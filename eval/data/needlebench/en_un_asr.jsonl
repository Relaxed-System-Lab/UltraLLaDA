{"title": "", "text": "A small plane burst into flames as it careened into a shoulder of Nashville’s Interstate 40 Monday night, killing all on board and prompting the partial closure of the highway as officials investigated the scene, police said.The plane was approved for an emergency landing at John C. Tune Airport after reporting engine and power failure around 7:40 p.m. Monday, Metro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Don Aaron said. But the pilot soon told air traffic control that they wouldn’t make it to the tarmac.It’s still unclear how many people were inside the plane, which exploded into flames upon impact, Nashville Fire Department spokesperson Kendra Loney said.“That impact was catastrophic and did not leave any survivors,” Loney said.Witnesses reported the plane appeared to be “obviously in distress as it was coming over the interstate” and before it crashed into a grassy area behind a Costco alongside I-40 East, Aaron said.“We are fortunate the aircraft did not hit any buildings as it went down,” Aaron said.Officials are still working to identify the deceased and determine where the plane originated from, according to Aaron.The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the cause of the crash, he said.The crash prompted the closure of I-40 East at mile marker 202, Tennessee Department of Transportation Region 3 spokeswoman Rebekah Hammonds said on X.One of the eastbound lanes was expected to reopen later Monday night and two lanes should be open before rush hour Tuesday morning, police said. Commuters should still anticipate slow traffic and delays early Tuesday, the department warned.Witness video shows an aircraft engulfed in flames and smoke, and images shared by police capture the aircraft’s mangled frame surrounded by first responders on a grassy roadside.Live traffic cameras also showed a large emergency vehicle response blocking all eastbound travel lanes near the crash site and a string of gridlocked traffic leading up to the shut-down stretch of I-40 East.“If you’re traveling tonight find an alternate route,” Hammonds said, adding the investigation will be ongoing."}
{"title": "", "text": "From above, Haiti’s capital city Port-au-Prince still looks serene, its white-washed homes climbing steep green hills that encircle a glittering bay. But to step onto its cracked streets requires a careful calculation of risk and reward.Ruthless gangs have a stranglehold on the city, preying on the population, carving neighborhoods into warring criminal fiefdoms, and cutting Haiti’s international port off from the rest of the country.In this city, the most-shared online videos are often torture footage, recorded and posted by gangs to spread horror and hasten ransom payments for thousands of kidnapping victims. Last month, within hours of landing at the city’s Toussaint L’Ouverture airport, a CNN team began to receive forwarded messages from contacts sharing the latest cruel footage – a bound woman twisting away from flames as her kidnappers jeered.It was a glimpse into the viral daily torment of life in Haiti, where frequent civilian protests emphasize that the population has reached a breaking point. Gangs control 80% of the capital, according to UN estimates, and are fighting to seize the rest.Since last week, Port-au-Prince has been gripped by a wave of highly coordinated gang attacks, with armed groups burning down police stations and freeing prisoners in what one gang leader described as a direct challenge to Haiti’s unpopular Prime Minister Ariel Henry. On Sunday, Haiti’s government declared a state of emergency after thousands of inmates apparently escaped from its largest prison.“We have chosen to take our destiny in our own hands. The battle we are waging will not only topple Ariel’s government. It is a battle that will change the whole system,” said Jimmy “Barbeque” Cherizier, a former police officer who styles himself as Robin Hood figure in his territory, in a statement reported by local media.Henry’s whereabouts are currently unclear, after a visit to Kenya last week.‘The country cannot continue like this’Each year in recent memory has been worse than the last, each catastrophe another blow to the disintegrating Haitian state. In downtown Port-au-Prince, the country’s historic National Palace is still in ruins from Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Now, multiple courthouses in the area have now been taken over and occupied by gangs.Many Haitians blame their prime minister for rapidly ceding ground to the gangs over the past three years, while refusing to organize elections that would bring in a new government and give the country a fresh start. Henry and his allies say that the current insecurity would make a free and fair vote impossible, but such explanations do little to appease popular outrage.Earlier this month, when rumors swirled in one Port-au-Prince neighborhood that a local police station would be closed, fed-up residents quickly spilled into the streets, toppling a bus and burning tires as they called for Henry’s ouster.“Ariel Henry has to go,” one protester shouted. “We are living in total precarity. We’re living on trash, on sewage. I have nothing, I’m empty. I can’t go to work, I can’t support my family, I can’t send my kids to school.”Even for some within the gangs, the brutality of the current situation has become unbearable.“I see people dying in front of me every day,” one 14-year-old gang recruit from the city’s Martissant neighborhood told CNN, visibly distraught, in an interview last month. “The thing I hate the most is when (other gang members) kill someone and they make me burn the body,” he said.One of his friends, also a gang member, was killed and burned a few days ago, he adds. “I don’t want that to happen to me.” CNN is not naming the teenager due to concerns for his safety.“The sentiment on the ground is that the country cannot continue like this. The level of violence that people are exposed to is inhumane,” United Nations deputy special representative in Haiti Ulrika Richardson warned in a press briefing in New York Wednesday.80% of Port-au-Prince controlled by gangsOn TikTok and WhatsApp, accounts flaunting guns and flashy cars tout affiliation with groups like the 5 Segond gang, 400 Mawozo (notorious in the US for the 2021 kidnapping of over a dozen foreign missionaries), and Kraze Barye, whose leader has a nearly $2 million bounty on his head from the FBI.Haiti’s gangs were once seen as thuggish instruments for powerful politicians and business elites.  But today, they seem to have slipped their leashes; the gangs overrunning Port-au-Prince have become independent “violent entrepreneurs,” according to a recent analysis by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.In an impoverished country with little to exploit, the gangs are treating human beings like commodities, snatching at least 2,490 people off the street last year to trade in a fast-growing kidnapping business, per UN figures.Victims whose families cannot pay for their release are often killed, adding to the thousands of others who have lost their lives to indiscriminate gunfire, waves of arson, and other abuses. Haiti’s national homicide rate doubled last year, reaching 41 murders for every 100,000 people, the UN says – one of the highest murder rates in the world.Haiti’s National Police, which boasts an aggressive new anti-gang unit, has seen some success in apprehending some criminal figures and holding back gang expansion in a key areas of the city, including next to the US embassy. But with nearly 100 growing gangs in the metropolitan area, the force just does not have the firepower or training to restore calm to the country, sources say.According to UN figures, Haitian police are quitting en masse, with 1,663 officers leaving in 2023 alone.As hunger spreads, popular anger growsOne recent morning in the neighborhood of Delmas, dozens of women from the nearby gang-controlled slum of Cité Soleil lined up to receive food handouts from the UN’s World Food Programme, distributed by Catholic charity St. Kizito.Every person CNN approached said they had been brutalized one way or another; one recounted being raped by a gang member, showing scars on her arm from the attack. A widow said her husband had been burned alive inside their family home during a battle between gangs.“I was at home with my family, when a rival group to our local gang attacked the neighborhood. I had the time to run with my child, but my husband was too slow behind us. They burned the house down with him inside.”Over 300,000 civilians have been made homeless by inter-gang warfare, according to the UN.On the other side of Haiti, in the southern coastal city of Jeremie, an administrator at St. John Bosco school told CNN that at least 20 new students had arrived from the capital with their families since the start of 2024, some fleeing in such a hurry that they brought no clothes or even identification documents.But in rural areas, the threat is hunger. Gang control of key roads in and around Port-au-Prince has dramatically slowed the transport of vital imported food and fuel across the country. Exorbitant bribes are required for safe passage.Prices are spiking unsustainably for a population where more than 60% of households live on less than $4 per day, according to World Bank estimates.One market vendor in Jeremie told CNN that the wholesale price for a sack of sugar had now leapt from the equivalent of $50 to $150. The cost of a bag of rice, a staple in Haitian cuisine, has risen from $40 to $120.The stress of trying to make ends meet in these conditions is fraying the social fabric. In January, rioters attacked the St. John Bosco school, trying to break down its gates and reach food stocks donated by the UN’s World Food Programme, according to the administrator.The food was intended for impoverished students’ lunches – often their only meal of the day. But since then, the terrified kids have not come back.Anger boils overFrom the smoke-filled streets of the capital to farmworkers plunging their machetes into the fields in Jeremie, CNN’s team repeatedly heard an angry sing-song refrain: Ariel kraze peyi a, Ariel kraze peyi a. “Ariel is destroying the country.”Prime Minister Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon by training, was appointed prime minister in 2021 with the backing of the United States, Canada and other key allies, following the assassination of former President Jovenel Moise.The job was a poisoned chalice; even then, gangs were estimated to be in control of more than half of Port-au-Prince. Henry vowed to restore order and hold elections, but two and half years later, the world’s first free Black republic is further than ever from those democratic fundamentals. Haiti’s last elections were in 2016, so most terms have long since expired, leaving elected offices vacant – including the presidency and the entire legislature.It’s a fertile landscape for political opportunists. Earlier this month, Guy Philippe, a rebel leader who was recently repatriated by the United States to Haiti after serving time for money laundering, called for a revolution. Accompanying him in some videos were members of the Haitian Environment Ministry’s security brigade (BSAP), raising fears of a state security force gone rogue.“We are battling to change a system which is not working for any Haitian, in which no one can live, no matter who they are… We are loyal to the government, but it is not loyal to us,” one BSAP commander, Inspector Odric Octina, told CNN.“Any revolution that can free the Haitian people from this dictatorship, we are ready to stand with it,” he said, adding the caveat that BSAP does not intend to turn their arms against the government and that his only action so far had been to participate in protests in Port-au-Prince.The gangs meanwhile have shown no qualms about attacking government institutions directly.As armed groups pounded the National Penitentiary, one of Haiti’s police unions posted a desperate message to X on Saturday, pleading for reinforcements. If the prison’s detainees are released to join gangs already at large, the union warned, “we are done. No one will be spared in the capital.” But by the end of the day, the prison had been opened; over 3,500 prisoners are thought to have escaped, according to UN estimates.Violence continued throughout the weekend, with Haiti’s government on Sunday announcing a state of emergency in the West department, where Port-au-Prince is located, and a curfew from 6pm to 5am in an effort to “regain control of the situation.”Hope in a foreign uniformFebruary 7 was the date that a new elected government should have taken power in Haiti, per an agreement between Henry’s government and a coalition of influential figures from Haiti’s civil society and business sector.But the necessary elections were never held, so Henry last month could offer only a rare national address asking for patience as the deadline came and went, telling citizens it is time to “put our heads together to save Haiti.”“The principal task of this transitional government is to create the conditions in which elections can be organized,” he assured viewers.“My interim government is working hand-in-hand with the police to restore normal life in the country. We are aware that many thing have to change, but we need to make those changes together and calmly,” he also said.A new transition deadline has already been proposed: Last week, the leaders of regional bloc Caricom said in a statement Henry had agreed to hold general elections no later than August 31, 2025.Until then, Henry’s best hopes may rest on an outside solution over which he wields little control: The Kenyan-led “military support” force requested by his government last year and greenlit by the United Nations Security Council.“The reason why the Prime Minister requested the UN resolution back in October 2022 is because the police department and other forces cannot challenge the gangs,” Henry’s advisor Jean Junior Joseph told CNN.Anger toward the government for Haiti’s gangs problem is misplaced, he also said, emphasizing that the government has limited options.“The situation is so complicated that the gangs have more ammunition than us,” he said.The Prime Minister’s office declined CNN’s request for an interview.Foreign military interventions are viewed with deep skepticism in Haiti, where UN peacekeepers are synonymous with sex abuse scandals and the deadly introduction of cholera. How exactly the Kenyan-led mission will operate and what kind of human rights precautions its forces will take remain unclear.Still, Haitian security forces interviewed by CNN say they welcome the help. The United States – a top destination for Haitian migrants fleeing the country’s turmoil – has also eagerly backed the mission with a promise of $200 million.It may be no coincidence that the latest wave of gang violence began while Henry was in Nairobi last week to sign an agreement underpinning the mission.The stakes are high: If the promised 1,000-plus troops are delivered, the foreign muscle is expected to pose a serious challenge to gang control – potentially renewing hope for change in the country and buying time for the embattled premier.But if the mission does not come soon, experts and government insiders warn that mounting pressure over Haiti’s unbearable violence is likely to explode."}
{"title": "", "text": "Heading into Super Tuesday, former President Donald Trump remains on track to potentially win more primaries and caucuses than any previous Republican presidential candidate other than an incumbent.His performance so far reflects his success at transforming the Republican Party in his image. He’s reshaped the GOP into a more blue-collar, populist and pugnacious party, focused more on his volatile blend of resentments against elites and cultural and racial change than the Ronald Reagan-era priorities of smaller government and active global leadership that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has stressed. The refusal of almost any GOP elected officials to endorse his last remaining rival – despite the qualms some of them hold about the direction Trump is imposing on the party –testifies to their recognition that the former president now commands nearly unquestioned loyalty from a majority of the GOP coalition.But while the primaries have underscored Trump’s grip on the GOP, they have also demonstrated continued vulnerability for him in the areas where he has labored since he first announced his candidacy in 2015 – particularly among the white-collar suburban voters who mostly leaned toward the GOP before his emergence. The early 2024 nominating contests have shown that a substantial minority of Republican-leaning voters remain resistant to Trump’s vision. Even while posting such convincing victories, he has struggled with college-educated voters and moderates. Trump has carried only about 40% of independent voters who participated in the three contests where exit or entrance polls of voters have been conducted.Capturing both strength and weakness, the presidential primaries, as always, have offered important clues about the direction of the party holding them. As Trump nears what could be a crushing performance Tuesday, here’s a look at some of the key lessons about the GOP suggested by the results, and patterns of support, from this year’s primaries.The most important message from the primaries is the most straightforward: Trump’s coalition is the dominant faction in the GOP. Haley’s victory in Sunday’s low-turnout Washington, DC, primary will prevent Trump from winning every primary and caucus (as the past four incumbent GOP presidents have done.) But Trump is still faring better than any other Republican who was not an incumbent. (Reagan in 1980, Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000 and Mitt Romney in 2012 all won about 45 contests.)Veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres said the primaries have shown that Republican voters are viewing Trump, in effect, as an incumbent president to a greater extent than the other candidates expected. Trump is trying to become the first defeated incumbent to win a rematch four years later against the man who ousted him from the White House since Democrat Grover Cleveland beat Republican Benjamin Harrison in 1892. Trump “is running as a quasi-incumbent,” Ayres said. To understand his dominance, Ayres continued, “What we really need are entrance polls and exit polls from the 1892 Democratic coalition for Grover Cleveland. That’s the analogy: a former president running again to defeat the guy who beat him.”Chris Wilson, who polled for the super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during the primary, likewise said, “Trump’s lead in the GOP race at this point” is rooted in “the perception among a large number of GOP primary voters that Trump is effectively our incumbent candidate.” None of the other candidates, he said, “found the message that makes them think they should dump their de facto incumbent.”Yet in important ways, Trump is a different candidate that he was in 2016. This time he’s much stronger among – and more reliant on – the party’s most conservative elements. In his first run, Trump attracted almost exactly the same level of support among voters who described themselves as very conservative, somewhat conservative and moderate, according to a cumulative analysis by Gary Langer of ABC News of all the exit polls conducted that year. This time – in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the three states where exit or entrance polls have been conducted – voters who describe themselves as very conservative have given him a much higher share of their votes than the other two groups; he’s lost moderates badly in all three states, never exceeding 28% of the vote among them.Likewise, Trump is posting huge advantages this year among Republican voters who identify as White evangelical Christians, while facing a much closer split among voters who don’t. The gap in his support between evangelicals and everyone else is much wider than it was in 2016.Education was already the most important dividing line in the 2016 race, with Trump running 12 percentage points better among voters without a degree than those with at least a four-year college education, in the cumulative analysis. That gap, too, is much wider this time: Trump has run at least 25 points better among voters without a degree than those with one in each of the three states that have been polled on Election Day. (There’s some preliminary evidence as well that those non-college voters are comprising a larger share of the total vote than they did in 2016.)“Trump’s strength has kind of changed,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “It’s made him a more durable Republican candidate. But it remains to be seen what that means for the general election.”For all Trump’s strength, he has faced stubborn resistance from a significant minority of primary voters. Despite his sweep of the early nominating contests, his share of the vote hasn’t quite reached the heights of some other primary candidates in both parties. Counting Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan, Trump has won a little over three-fifths of the total combined vote so far. That slightly exceeds the share that Reagan won in 1980 and equals the percentage George W. Bush won in 2000, according to results compiled by Northeastern University political scientist William Mayer. But Trump still lags behind the last two candidates who most closely matched his advantages as a quasi-incumbent: vice-presidents George H.W. Bush in 1988 (who hit 68%) and Democrat Al Gore in 2000 (who reached 75%), according to Mayer’s tabulation.Trump’s total vote share may approach those heights after Super Tuesday, when six deeply conservative Southern states are among the 15 contests. But the size and consistency of the hold-out coalition behind Haley has surprised many in the GOP. Even with all his advantages, Trump in Iowa only won a little over one-third of voters with at least a four-year college degree. Haley beat him soundly among that group in New Hampshire and South Carolina. No exit poll was conducted in Michigan, but Trump’s totals lagged his statewide percentage there too in white-collar places like Oakland, Washtenaw and Kent counties. These trends are likely to continue on Super Tuesday.Haley’s consistent advantage among independents participating in the GOP primaries partly explains that trend, but even a substantial share of college-educated Republicans voted against Trump in the three states where voters were polled on Election Day. Moderates have flocked to Haley in large numbers in the early contests as well.Yet the clear message of the primaries is that those traditional center-right, often suburban, Republicans now constitute the subordinate minority in a party dominated by Trump’s more populist and volatile coalition. This power shift has changed both the party’s agenda and its priorities.The most significant shift is evident on foreign policy. When internationalist Dwight Eisenhower beat isolationist Sen. Robert Taft for the 1952 GOP presidential nomination, it marked a lasting turning point in the GOP’s internal balance of power. In every Republican presidency over the next six decades, the internationalist forces that supported a robust American role in the world set the course. Trump rejected that consensus when he was elected in 2016, but even during his tenure, Republican internationalists in Congress and his own administration resisted many of his efforts to downplay or abandon traditional alliances.Now that resistance is crumbling, both in the party’s elite and grassroots. A majority of House Republicans last fall voted against providing further aid to Ukraine; so did a majority of Senate Republicans this year. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs found last year that, for the first time in a half century of polling on American attitudes about foreign policy, a majority of Republicans now say the US would be better off to mostly stay out of global affairs; that view was strongest among the Republicans most sympathetic to Trump.More than any other prominent Republican, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who was first elected the year Reagan won his 49-state landslide reelection in 1984, has defended the Reaganite vision of America as the stalwart leader of the free world – the “shining city on a hill.” McConnell’s announcement last week that he would step aside as Republican leader in November marked an implicit acknowledgement that in Trump’s GOP, that Reaganite torch is flickering.Like McConnell’s announcement, the choices by GOP elected officials in the primary contest signal their acknowledgement of the party’s direction. The share of GOP elected officials who have endorsed Haley isn’t anywhere near as large as her share of the total vote. (Her list of prominent endorsers doesn’t extend much beyond New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and two moderate senators who backed her in the past few days, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.) Meanwhile, Republicans are scrambling over each other to bend their knee to Trump.The long line of GOP elected officials endorsing Trump reflects many factors. He’s demolished the standing of his critics – from former Rep. Liz Cheney to DeSantis – among Republican voters, and most in the GOP have grown deeply reluctant to challenge him. Trump’s early primary victories, and huge lead in the national primary polls, convinced other Republican officials that opposing him was a suicide mission.But a deeper factor also explains the imbalance in support among GOP elected officials. Trump has changed the electoral incentives for virtually everyone in the GOP. In the Trump era, hardly anyone in the party running in a competitive state can now rely on as much support from the college-educated voters who once anchored their coalition. That means virtually all Republicans need big turnout and margins among the same blue-collar, non-urban and culturally conservative voters most passionate about Trump. That gives other Republicans a powerful electoral incentive to move in Trump’s direction, in tone and substance. “There is no doubt the composition of our base is changing,” said Wilson.The reluctance of other elected GOP officials to cross Trump in the primaries suggests he would face even less internal resistance in a second term than he did in his first. At times in that first term, GOP congressional leaders resisted him, particularly on foreign policy. That seems much less likely now, with staunch Trump loyalist Mike Johnson installed as House speaker and McConnell stepping aside as Senate GOP leader.  “No one could make the argument that McConnell or Kevin McCarthy gave Trump any significant pushback,” said Jennifer Horn, a former Republican Party chair in New Hampshire who has become a staunch Trump critic. “And they weren’t enough. Neither one of them could be loyal enough for him.”As Trump nears a possible knock-out blow on Tuesday, the most important unanswered question is what Haley and her voters do in November. The primaries have shown her coalition is not nearly big enough to deny Trump the nomination. But it is more than big enough to deny him a general election victory. Through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, a consistent four-fifths of Haley voters have said they don’t think Trump would be fit to serve as president if he’s convicted of a crime, according to the entrance and exit polls. In the AP/NORC VoteCast polls, two-thirds of Haley voters in Iowa, three-fourths in New Hampshire and about three-fifths in South Carolina said they would not vote for Trump in a general election.In practice, it’s unlikely that so many Haley voters would actually reject Trump. In the days before the South Carolina primary, almost everyone I spoke with at Haley events disparaged Trump but said they would still vote for him over Biden, whom they viewed as both a failure and too old for the job. Distaste for Biden’s record and capacity may severely limit Democrats’ ability to convert Republican voters skeptical of Trump into crossover voters for Biden, predicted William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who has sparred with the GOP as an adviser to prominent Democrats since the 1980s. “Yes, there is a division” among Republicans, Galston said. “But is it going to manifest itself where it counts, in votes cast [for Biden]? I don’t see a lot of evidence for that so far.”Yet Republicans skeptical of Trump have noted that Trump might not be able to survive if even a meaningful fraction of Haley’s voters ultimately reject him. With Biden facing plenty of cracks in his own coalition, the independent, center-right, college-educated Republican-leaning voters who flocked to Haley present probably Democrats’ best opportunity to find new voters.“I expect most of those [Haley] voters to ‘come home’ by November, but the big caveat is that if Donald Trump keeps picking at the scab rather than letting the party heal, he could absolutely hurt himself,” said GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator. “You need your party unified behind you to win a general in an era of deep polarization. You can’t afford to lose 10%+ to the other side.”One final point is clear as Trump nears his third consecutive GOP nomination: He isn’t relinquishing his grip on the party any time soon. Galston noted that since World War II, the GOP has undergone two previous fundamental shifts – when Eisenhower installed internationalism and greater acceptance of the New Deal as the party consensus in 1952, and when Reagan cemented a more aggressive economic, national security and social conservatism in 1980. “Trump is the third great transformer of the Republican Party since the end of the Second World War,” Galston said. “And like the previous two, the consequences will be with us for a long time.”Trump is consolidating his hold on the party infrastructure with the likely installation of his loyalists (including his daughter-in-law) in the top positions at the Republican National Committee. Ambitious younger Republicans are mostly defining themselves in his image. After the latest Ukraine vote, first-term Missouri GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt noted on social media that almost all of the 17 Republican senators elected since 2018 opposed the aid.Given the level of dominance Trump has displayed in this year’s primaries among both voters and elected officials, there’s no reason to assume that even if he loses a general election he wouldn’t try for the GOP nomination again in 2028, when he’d be about the same age Biden is now. But whether or not Trump regains the White House this year, and whatever he does next if he doesn’t, it seems certain that his shadow will envelop the GOP for years.“I think he will continue to be a significant influence over the party, its elected officials, its platform, its position on all of these important issues, for as long as he’s alive frankly,” said Horn.“I said back in 2016 that if the party embraced him and took him on, it would be 25 years before they were able to truly cleanse themselves of him. Now I don’t know if I gave it enough time,” she added."}
{"title": "", "text": "China has set an ambitious economic expansion target of “around 5%“ for 2024, as its leaders vowed to “transform the growth model” in the face of significant challenges facing its development.The figure — similar to last year’s growth target — was announced by Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which draws nearly 3,000 delegates to Beijing for a week-long meeting.“Stability is of overall importance, as it is the basis for everything we do,” Li said during the delivery of his maiden work report. “In particular, we must push ahead with transforming the growth model, making structural adjustments, improving quality, and enhancing performance.”Li’s proclamation comes as Beijing is seeking to boost confidence in China’s economy, while grappling with a troubled property sector, deflationary pressures, an exodus of foreign capital, a battered stock market and a record low birth rate.He delivered the report to an auditorium filled with delegates inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People. Delegates clapped in unison in time with a military band serenade as top leadership entered the room in a line led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.The political heart of Beijing, where the event is taking place, was under heavy security ahead of the event, with barricades and traffic controls restricting access to the public square and surrounding government buildings.At the event, China also unveiled its annual military budget for 2024, which will increase by 7.2% to 1.67 trillion yuan ($230.6 billion), according to a draft report released separately. The growth rate for the defense budget is the same as last year’s.The gross domestic product (GDP) target and military spending are among the most closely watched figures during the opening day of proceedings.But investors appear to be disappointed about the lack of major stimulus measures. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.6% by afternoon trade, the worst performer in Asia. The Hang Seng Tech Index sank 4%.A highly ambitious targetA target of “around 5%” is ambitious but achievable, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group.“(It) entails more aggressive easing measures than last year. As a result, it may also improve the growth outlook among households and corporates,” he said.Last year, China also set an “around 5%” target, in what was then the country’s lowest numerical target announced in decades. Earlier this year, it said economic growth had reached 5.2% in 2023.Meeting a similar target in the coming year, however, could be significantly tougher. In 2022, Covid-19 restrictions in the country were rampant, setting a low base of comparison for last year.Premier Li admitted that achieving the growth targets “will not be easy.”“In setting the growth rate at around 5%, we have taken into account the need to boost employment and incomes and prevent and defuse risks,” he added.China’s economic challenges have generated hardship and frustration as young people struggle to find jobs, investors grapple with market losses and small business owners fight to stay afloat.No major stimulus measures were announced, but Li said the government would “stabilize and expand” consumption, while targeting an increase in spending on big-ticket items including electronics and new-energy vehicles.The government set the fiscal budget deficit at 3% of GDP for 2024. This is lower than the revised deficit of 3.8% in 2023, but the same as the 3% target initially announced last year.The target may indicate Beijing’s caution over debt sustainability, as policymakers try to strike a balance between stabilizing growth and controlling debt, analysts said. In December, Moody’s downgraded China’s credit rating outlook from “stable” to “negative,” citing risks from financially stressed local governments and state-owned enterprises.To boost government spending for major projects, Li announced a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) of ultra-long special central government bonds this year, the first such sale since 2020.Local governments will also be allowed to issue 3.9 trillion yuan ($542 billion) of special bonds, which would be mainly used for infrastructure spending. That’s an increase of 100 billion yuan ($13.9 billion) from last year.“The NPC did not bring any major surprises to investors but raised doubts about achieving the ambitious 5% growth target without the increasing fiscal deficit ratio,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank. “While the total increase in 1.1 trillion yuan bond issuances provides extra funding to bolster infrastructure investments, there is no big stimulus plan to support growth.”Recent years have seen national security interests, Covid-19 controls and efforts to tighten government control over industries like technology, entertainment and real estate all take priority for Xi — at times over business growth and economic expansion.Li also appeared to nod to criticism that China had gone too far toward prioritizing national security at the cost of economic growth, calling for the country to “ensure that high-quality development and greater security reinforce each other.”As part of its strategic goals, China boosted its annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion) — the biggest increase since 2019 after years of minimal growth.“We will move faster to boost self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” Li said. “We will fully leverage the strengths of the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide to raise China’s capacity for innovation across the board.”Li also vowed to bolster efforts in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) and launch a number of major science and technology programs.The emphasis on self-reliance in science and technology comes after the United States tightened control over the export of cutting-edge technologies to China, especially in the field of AI, which Washington said could be used to strengthen the Chinese military.The Biden administration has restricted American companies from selling advanced semiconductor chips to China and banned US investment in China in sensitive technologies including AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.A bigger budgetChina’s 7.2% growth rate in military spending is in line with several previous years of similar single-digit increases.Beijing hasn’t announced double digit growth in military spending since 2015, when there was a push to revamp the armed forces.Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, said that given China’s economic slowdown, a 7.2% increase is fairly significant.“The overall percentage of defense spending in GDP is still smaller than those of the US and Russia, but the ratio is nevertheless growing,” she said.The US authorized an $886 billion defense budget for 2024, up about 3% from the previous year.The expansion of China’s defense budget has outpaced its target economic growth for years, with this year being no exception.Nevertheless, it has not reached the stage where it is overburdening the national coffers, said James Char, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and an expert on the Chinese military.“Of course, the country’s longer-term economic fortunes will determine whether this can be sustained going forward,” he said.China’s leaders are watching what they see as an increasingly fractious geopolitical environment, ranging from America’s closer alliances with Beijing’s neighbors, growing friction with the Philippines over contested South China Sea waters and rising tension globally amid major conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.Beijing has repeatedly pushed back against characterizations that it is aggressively ramping up military spending. Rather, it seeks to project an image of itself as a proponent of peace, despite its own aggression in places like the South China Sea and toward the self-ruled island of Taiwan.NPC spokesperson Lou Qinjian told reporters in Beijing on Monday that “compared with major military powers, such as the United States, China’s defense spending is quite low, whether as a percentage of GDP or total budget, or in terms of per citizen or per service member expenditure.”Outside estimates in recent years have suggested higher actual spending than official figures indicate. The official figure does not include a breakdown of military spending, making it difficult to make direct comparisons.China’s military has also had a tumultuous year.Multiple high-ranking officials and defense executives were removed from their positions either in the armed forces or political bodies in recent months alongside an anti-corruption drive and apparent purge. Those ousted included then-Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who was removed from his post without explanation.The fallout has been felt at the NPC.Last week, Lt. Gen. Li Zhizhong, the deputy commander of the Central Theater Command, was removed as a member of the congress. He formerly served as the head of the equipment department of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force and was the tenth senior PLA officer to have been ousted from the legislative body in recent months.And since December, four senior figures in the defense industry have been dismissed from the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body to the congress.“If our assumptions about extensive corruption and wastage in China’s military-industrial complex are correct, the PLA high command will likely prioritize the imposition of tighter resource management above all else,” Char said."}
{"title": "", "text": "Right-wing attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who helped devise the Trump campaign’s fake electors plot, continued proposing ways to overturn the 2020 presidential election even after the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, according to texts and emails made public Monday as part of a lawsuit.The texts also reveal that an attorney for Donald Trump claimed to have sent a memo to the White House – “the real decision makers” – about how to carry out the fake electors plot across the country.The new materials were disclosed after Chesebro and former Trump lawyer Jim Troupis, who are both from Wisconsin, settled a lawsuit brought by Wisconsin’s real Democratic electors from 2020. These revelations build on what is known about Trump’s efforts to cling to power, which led to federal and state election subversion indictments. Chesebro pleaded guilty in Georgia and has been identified by CNN as one of the unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case. Trump has denied wrongdoing.The tranche of emails, text and photos offers additional evidence that Chesebro pushed for the electors plot to move forward regardless of whether Trump won any lawsuits challenging the election results. This undercuts his recent testimony to state prosecutors in which he said the fake electors were contingent on winning the litigation.Chesebro’s lawyer declined to comment, noting Chesebro represented himself in the civil litigation. CNN has reached out to Chesebro for comment.Chesebro and his attorneys have maintained that all of his legal work for the Trump campaign was done in good faith and was largely rooted in historical precedent from past disputed presidential elections.CNN also has reached out to Troupis’ lawyer for comment.As CNN previously reported, Chesebro pushed a more aggressive version of the fake electors plot from a secret Twitter account than he later described in his interview with Michigan investigators.Chesebro told Troupis in late 2020 that it was “really not necessary” to link the GOP electors to ongoing litigation. “Having the electors send in alternate slates of votes on Dec. 14 can pay huge dividends even if there is no litigation pending on Jan. 6,” Chesebro said in an email.Congress could seat the pro-Trump electors “even if Trump lost all the legal cases, and none are still pending,” Chesebro wrote in the email to Troupis on December 8, 2020.Weeks later, as CNN previously reported, Chesebro protested outside the Capitol and shadowed conspiracy theorist Alex Jones while Congress certified the election results on January 6, 2021. Previously unseen pictures made public Monday include a selfie that Chesebro took near the Capitol with Jones in the background. He also texted Troupis that he “caught a wiff” of the tear gas deployed against the pro-Trump mob.The texts show that even after the carnage of January 6, Chesebro continued pitching ideas to Troupis for how the election could be overturned through long-shot lawsuits.According to the text chain, he told Troupis on January 8, 2021, “The events of the last 2 days open up legal options in the states for winning rulings favorable to Trump.”Memo sent to the White HouseChesebro wrote a series of memos in 2020 spelling out what the pro-Trump electors should do in their respective states, including one memo in early December that Troupis claimed he sent directly to the White House, according to the newly released messages.“Jim, can you send my December 6 memo to (Trump lawyer) Justin Clark … messaging on Jan. 6 being the real date is key,” Chesebro wrote to Troupis on December 7, 2020.“I have sent it to the White House this afternoon. The real decision makers,” Troupis responded, though he didn’t identify who at the White House received the memo.“I also gave it to Reince so he might talk with the President,” Troupis added, referring to Trump’s former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is also from Wisconsin.Priebus, Chesebro, Troupis and other Wisconsinites attended an Oval Office meeting with Trump a few weeks after the December 6 memo was distributed, and Chesebro briefed Trump about the fake electors planning, according to past CNN reporting.In the December 6, 2020, memo, Chesebro laid out the plan to put forth slates of Republican electors in seven key swing states that Trump lost, including Wisconsin."}
{"title": "", "text": "A woman whose home near Canadian, Texas, was destroyed in the record-breaking and deadly Smokehouse Creek Fire is suing a power company, alleging a fallen utility pole near Stinnett started the devastating fire.Melanie McQuiddy filed the lawsuit late Friday against Xcel Energy; its subsidiary Southwestern Public Service Company; and Osmose Utilities Services, a contractor headquartered in Georgia that inspects wood utility poles.In her suit, McQuiddy alleges the pole, which the companies “failed to properly inspect, maintain, and replace, splintered, and snapped off at its base” on February 26, causing the fire.“As a result of the utility, powered utility lines hit the ground, igniting a fire, which spread quickly into an uncontrollable conflagration,” states the lawsuit.Mikal Watts, who is representing McQuiddy in the lawsuit and has previously represented plaintiffs in lawsuits related to wildfires in Maui and California, told CNN his team used “fire patterns” to identify a specific pole. He said the patterns indicate the fire started near where the pole went down.The Texas A&M Forest Service is investigating the fire, which is the largest in the state’s history, and has not announced a cause. CNN reached out to the service Monday morning for comment and is awaiting a response. The lawsuit does not provide specific evidence for its claim that the wildfire was started by a fallen utility pole.The plaintiff’s daughter, Brooke McQuiddy, told CNN she evacuated last week along with her mother as the wildfire erupted. It was only three days before the massive inferno became the largest wildfire in state history.“My mother’s home, unfortunately, has burned to the ground, and there’s absolutely nothing left. She’s lost everything,” Brooke McQuiddy told CNN last Wednesday.In a statement to CNN, Xcel Energy said, “Our thoughts are with the families and communities impacted by the devastating wildfires across the Texas Panhandle.” The company added, “There has been no official determination of cause or causes for the fires in the Texas panhandle and investigations are ongoing.”In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last Thursday, Xcel Energy disclosed that a law firm requested “that a fallen SPS utility pole that is situated within the vicinity of the fire’s potential area of origin be preserved.”The lawsuit alleges Osmose Utilities Services is the company that inspected poles for SPS, and “negligently failed to adequately or properly inspect or report on the rotten pole that caused the Fire.”Osmose is “closely following reports of the devastation brought by the Smokehouse Creek Fire, and our thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy,” Osmose’s CEO, Mike Adams, said in a release Monday.“Osmose takes these allegations extremely seriously. We immediately launched an in-depth investigation, and we are committed to fully cooperating with any other local investigations into the cause of the fire. We stand by the quality and accuracy of our utility pole inspections,” Adams said.Since igniting last Monday, the Smokehouse Creek Fire has incinerated more than 1 million acres of the Texas Panhandle and is still only 15% contained, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. The fire has killed at least two people and crossed into Oklahoma, where more than 31,000 acres have been burned, according to the service."}
{"title": "", "text": "As our country confronts another crisis of American republicanism unleashed by former President Donald Trump and his followers’ reluctance to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, we are rediscovering the importance of the Reconstruction-era 14th Amendment to the Constitution.Though ratified in 1868, the 14th Amendment laid the foundation of our modern rights in the 20th century and contains provisions to prevent an attempt to overthrow American democracy or compromise democratic governance. The framers of the 14th Amendment meant for it to be binding — if they didn’t, they would not have made it a part of the fundamental law of the country. A constitutional mandate is, most importantly, self-enforcing. It does not require a law or a trial to enforce it.On Monday, the Supreme Court decided unanimously that Trump is not disqualified from the presidential ballot. The Supreme Court was united on the idea that Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado and that the state cannot remove him off its ballot. But the justices were divided about how broadly the decision should be construed. A conservative 5-4 majority, usually very respectful of states’ rights, said that no state could remove a federal candidate off any ballot — with four justices, including the court’s three liberal justices, asserting that the court should have limited its opinion.Although the 14th Amendment was ratified during Reconstruction, the period immediately after the Civil War, its provisions weren’t just for that historical moment in time, but a safeguard for the future. In ruling that Trump should stay on the presidential ballot of 2024, the Supreme Court has delivered a mortal blow to Section 3 that basically eviscerates its power altogether. In doing so, the court is living up to its sorry 19th-century history of emasculating Reconstruction federal civil rights laws and constitutional amendments.The Colorado Supreme Court, in Trump v. Anderson, had upheld Trump’s disqualification per Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but the high court baldly rejected that: “Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.” But Section 3 does not call for Congress to enforce disqualification for participating or aiding in an insurrection. It only gives Congress the power to remove that disqualification by a two-thirds majority of each house.While correctly pointing out that the 14th Amendment restricted state autonomy, the high court again erred in claiming that the “Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how those determinations should be made.” To argue that the “States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency” is tantamount to claiming that the states have no power to uphold the Constitution.It bears repeating that qualifications to run for president and the constitutional disqualification of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment are self-executing. The Colorado Supreme Court did not enforce that disqualification; it simply upheld Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. In their concurring opinion, the three liberal justices, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, argued against “a chaotic state-by-state patchwork” that the Colorado decision would allegedly unleash, while chiding the majority for its lack of “judicial restraint” in ruling not just in this case, but for all future cases on the need for congressional legislation to enforce Section 3.While the court’s liberal justices rightly grasped that the majority decision would emasculate the constitutional disqualification for waging and abetting an insurrection against the US government, they wrongly surmised that upholding the Colorado decision would allow each state to go their own way. Just as this decision allows Trump to be on the presidential ballots of all states, upholding the 14th Amendment disqualification would have meant his removal from the presidential ballots of all states. As during Reconstruction, when even Republican-appointed judges went along with undoing federal laws and constitutional amendments, the justices have also left us defenseless against future insurrection attempts. As they conclude, “the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President.”The Supreme Court heard this case on appeal from the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, which in Trump v. Anderson, a case brought by Colorado voters, ruled that Trump is disqualified from the presidential ballot under Section 3. The secretaries of state of Maine and of Illinois had also evoked this amendment clause in their attempt to remove Trump from the states’ ballots.While many of the insurrectionists have been tried for their actions during January 6th, Trump is still on trial for this act of supreme betrayal to his oath of office and other alleged criminal misdoings. Trump, of course, vehemently denies this charge and claims executive immunity from all wrongdoing. He is also fast becoming the presumptive Republican candidate for the presidency. In their decision, the Supreme Court made no attempt to decide whether Trump and his followers did engage in an insurrection or not.The language of Section 3 is clear and unmistakable: Any person who has sworn an oath of office to uphold the Constitution and then participated in or given aid and comfort to a violent insurrection against the government of the United States is barred from holding office unless pardoned by two-thirds of both houses of Congress. The president, like any other federal official who takes such an oath of office on the United States Constitution, is covered by this provision. Trump’s lawyers’ attempts to hold the president of United States above the rule of law and endow him with absolute immunity, even in cases of personal wrongdoing, make a mockery of our republican form of government, a constitutional guarantee and would convert our republic into a monarchy where the king can do no wrong.The Republican Party of the mid-19th century, the party of former President Abraham Lincoln and big government, sought to safeguard the American republic from all future insurrections after the slaveholders’ rebellion that had precipitated a crisis of the Union and Civil War. Historians and legal scholars, who submitted amicus briefs to SCOTUS in Trump v. Anderson, overwhelmingly agreed on Trump’s disqualification, citing copious amounts of evidence from the framers of the amendment and congressional debates. In the interest of full disclosure, I signed one of the briefs and my book was cited in the other.For the conservative majority in the Supreme Court to ignore this historical testimony is tantamount to betraying their own principles of constitutional interpretation, originalism that looks to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution. For them, it’s strict construction for thee but not for me. Not to mention that one of them, Justice Clarence Thomas, is highly compromised, given his wife’s involvement in the events that preceded the January insurrection, and should have recused himself from this case.But even some of the liberal judges, including Kagan and Jackson, put forth a line of questioning that betrayed an outdated adherence to ideas of states’ rights, which should have died on the battlefields of the Civil War, and that has historically allowed the court to ignore the plain meaning of the Reconstruction amendments. If Colorado and Maine can remove Trump from the ballot, why would red states not do the same to President Joe Biden, they mused. But if the Section 3 disqualification had been upheld by the Supreme Court, it would have had a national effect and would not have been confined only to Colorado. Unlike Trump, President Biden faces no such automatic, self-executing constitutional disqualification nationally.Of course, the Supreme Court has a sorry history of political meddling even as it has sought to wrap around itself the robes of impartial jurisprudence. From the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which sought to outlaw the platform of the newly formed antislavery Republican Party and declare African Americans non-citizens, to Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which facilitated racial apartheid in the South, the Supreme Court has played an especially abysmal role in undermining democratic governance and equal justice for Black Americans in the 19th century.The interracial democracy of Reconstruction was overthrown not just by domestic terror in the postwar South perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan and similar racist groups, but also by a series of reactionary judicial decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in cases such as United States v. Cruikshank (1876) that let the perpetrators of one of the worst racial massacres in the South go scot-free, the Civil Rights Cases (1883) that allowed the rise of racial segregation, and Williams v. Mississippi (1898) that allowed southern states to disfranchise Black men using legal subterfuge in violation of the 15th Amendment.Using states’ rights reasoning of “state action” and the state’s “police powers,” the Supreme Court left Black Americans to the tender mercies of ex-Confederates, who inaugurated a regime of disenfranchisement, Jim Crow, convict lease labor, debt peonage (which it finally outlawed in 1905) and racial terror. The court also never implemented the provision of the 14th Amendment that would make southern states suffer a loss of representation in Congress for disfranchising Black voters. This is another sleeping giant in the 14th Amendment that can be activated against states with voter suppression laws today.Only relatively recently has the Supreme Court upheld the equal protections of the 14thAmendment to dismantle Jim Crow and establish gay marriage and reproductive rights for women. But the right-wing majority in the Supreme Court has been steadily walking back those decisions and acting true to historical form in emasculating voting and reproductive rights. The Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade (1973), the right to privacy derived from the 14th Amendment, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) and kneecapped the Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforcing the 14th and 15th amendments in Shelby County v. Holder (2013).It seems the court develops political qualms in enforcing the Constitution only when the fate of American democracy is at stake. With its approval ratings at a historic low, SCOTUS, instead of correcting course, has adhered to the mostly dismal historical record of the Reconstruction-era Supreme Court.There is not substantial case law regarding Section 3, precisely because the country has not been subject to violent domestic insurrections since the slaveholders’ rebellion. Just as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause for freed people was misused by the courts during the Gilded Age to protect corporations from government regulation, the only time Sec3 was implemented was when it was misused against Socialist Party representative Victor Berger, who opposed the First World War.Berger’s lawyer wrongly argued that Sec 3 had been repealed by the Amnesty Acts of 1872 and 1898 that pardoned all ex-Confederates, as if it were formulated only for them. While Berger was ultimately vindicated and got to serve in the House of Representatives, everyone acknowledges that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is a binding, enforceable part of the Constitution.But just as it has gutted the protections and provisions of the 14th Amendment in the past, the Supreme Court has now rendered ineffectual its one provision that could prevent the overthrow of the American republic."}

{"title": "", "text": "Iran has recorded the lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic’s founding in 1979, with officials portraying the participation of those who did vote as a victory against the country’s “obstinate opponents.”Out of Iran’s 61 million eligible voters, some 25 million cast their ballots in parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections that took place on March 1, Iran’s state news outlet IRNA said.The announced turnout is not final, experts say. And while only 41% of voters came out, according to official data, “the real turnout is likely lower although it is impossible to know at this stage,” wrote Alex Vatanka, founding director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, adding that “in this round, the vetting was among the most extreme.”Turnout was low despite Iran extending the voting time three times, and despite weeks-long efforts by officials to boost participation levels ahead of the polling date.The turnout also comes as Iranians grapple with a tumbling local currency, a crippled economy and widened crackdown on dissent, which rights groups say only intensified after the 2022 protest movement sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.Iranian officials and state media however hailed the turnout as a triumph. The figure is a win against “the biggest election boycott campaign in the last 45 years,” said Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency on X, adding that the boycott was orchestrated by “foreign enemies and their internal followers.”President Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday told Iranians who voted that their participation was a “zealous blow to Iran’s obstinate opponents.”Lowest turnout since the 1979 RevolutionWhile not as low as some polls published in state media initially speculated, the turnout so far announced is lower than any legislative or presidential election held since the Islamic Republic’s founding in 1979.It is unclear if the announced 41% turnout will sink further in the coming days, with some candidates in the parliamentary election going to a runoff.Recent elections have generally seen increasingly low rates of voter participation. Iran’s last parliamentary election in 2020 saw a turnout of 42.57%, and its last presidential election in 2021 had a turnout of 48.8% – both were the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic.Some 15,000 candidates competed last week for the 290-seat parliamentary election, and 144 ran for the 88 seats of the Assembly of Experts.Preliminary results show the election of mostly hardline politicians, including President Ebrahim Raisi who was re-elected to the Assembly of Experts – which has the power to appoint the Supreme Leader, the highest political authority in Iran.Key takeawaysSeveral Iranians in Tehran have cited economic conditions and a lack of trust in leadership as reasons for not voting.In a shocking move, Iran’s former president Mohammad Khatami refused to cast his vote on March 1. The reformist president has previously urged the Iranian government to be more lenient with protesters amid the 2022 nationwide demonstrations. Azar Mansouri, an Iranian reformist politician, over the weekend confirmed Khatami’s refusal to vote.“His (Khatami) critical stance is indicative of the mood in the reformist camp that is by now nearly extinguished as a channel for criticism of Khamenei,” Vatanka wrote.International watchdogs previously slammed Iran for holding elections that are neither free nor fair, marked by a vetting process that restricts the types of candidates permitted to run.This year, Iran’s Guardian Council – a powerful 12-member council charged with overseeing elections and legislation – had disqualified thousands of candidates from running for parliamentary seats and barred former moderate President Hassan Rouhani from running for the Assembly of Experts.Other politicians who were once leading election charts saw their popularity drop. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards air force commander, seemed to lose some votes, coming fourth in this year’s election after his popularity peaked in the 2020 parliamentary election.Ghalibaf’s fall down the chart shows that even among those who did vote, they are “taking a more striking position against perhaps incumbents and even pragmatic conservatives,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN.Vakil added that another sign of voter discontent was the high number of spoiled ballots, showing that there were protesters even among those who voted.“The real question now is what comes next,” Vatanka wrote, adding that for a majority of Iranians this election was “a referendum on the future of the Islamic Republic.”“Few reformists chose to or were able to run in these elections and those that did fared badly, marking the loss of the public’s faith in the ability of gradual reform in the Islamic Republic,” he added.This election “tells us where the system is,” Vakil told CNN, adding that in an attempt to maintain cohesion for succession and the existing composition of the Islamic Republic’s institutions, the system has been “purged” of elites who may have become more pragmatic or moderate over time."}

The two communicated via email and through the foreign dating website’s online messaging platform, though the indictment does not identify which one.Slater was arrested Saturday, the Justice Department said in a news release. CNN could not immediately identify an attorney for him.The person Slater communicated with, who is identified only as “Co-Conspirator 1,” referred to him as “Sweet Dave” and “my secret agent” in messages, according to the indictment.Prosecutors say Slater’s co-conspirator sent him a message around March 11, 2022, asking, “Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting.”Less than a week later, according to the indictment, the co-conspirator sent another message saying, “You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?”The co-conspirator sent messages for nearly two months, according to the indictment, repeatedly probing Slater for more classified information. In April 2022, prosecutors say Slater received a message that said, “You have a job in the Operations Center today, I remember, I’m sure there is a lot of interesting news there?”In response to these messages, prosecutors say Slater shared classified information about military targets in Russia’s war against Ukraine and Russian military capabilities relating to the invasion.CNN has reached out to the Air Force and the Army for comment.Slater “knowingly transmitted classified national defense information to another person in blatant disregard for the security of his country and his oath to safeguard its secrets,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen from the Justice Department’s National Security Division.Slater faces one count of conspiracy to disclose national defense information and two counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information. If convicted on all charges, he faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000.Before working as a civilian in the Air Force, prosecutors say Slater rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army, retiring at the end of 2020. Eight months later, Slater began working at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, the home of US Strategic Command, which is responsible for command and control of the nuclear weapons stockpile.“When people violate the trust given to them to safeguard our nation’s intelligence, they put our country at risk,” Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel of the FBI’s Omaha Field Office said in a statement.Slater is scheduled to make his first appearance in federal court in Nebraska on Tuesday."}
{"title": "", "text": "A United Nations team has found “clear and convincing” information that hostages in Gaza were sexually abused, Pramila Patten, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict told reporters on Monday. There are “reasonable grounds” to believe the sexual violence is ongoing, she added.According to Patten, the team also found “reasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred” during Hamas’ October 7 terror attack in Israel, in what is the most definitive finding by the global organization on sexual assault allegations in the aftermath of the attack.The UN team, which was led by Patten, visited Israel between January 29 to February 14 for a mission “aimed at gathering, analyzing, and verifying information on conflict-related sexual violence” during October 7 and its aftermath, according to a 24-page report.The team also went to Ramallah in the occupied West Bank where stakeholders alleged “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment… including the increased use of various forms of sexual violence, namely invasive body searches; threats of rape; and prolonged forced nudity” on Palestinians in detention, the UN report wrote.Patten stressed on Monday that the mission “was neither intended nor mandated to be investigative in nature,” adding that the team had 33 meetings with Israeli institutions while in Israel, interviewed 34 people, including survivors and witnesses to the October 7 attack, and released hostages, as well as reviewed 50 hours of footage of the attacks.The mission was not able to meet with any victims of sexual violence on October 7 “despite our efforts,” Patten said. “On the very first day, I made a call for survivors to come forward. But we received information that a handful of them were receiving very specialized trauma treatment and were not prepared to come forward,” she said.Hamas has previously denied that its militants committed rape during the October 7 attack.“We strongly reject and denounce the coordination of some Western media outlets with the Zionist misleading campaigns that promote unfounded lies and allegations aimed at demonizing the Palestinian resistance, the latest of which is the allegation that resistance members committed ‘sexual violence’ during the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th,” Hamas’ political office said in a statement on Telegram in December.Findings in Israel and the West BankThe report said that the mission team found that, across various locations in Israel, “several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered – mostly women – with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head.”Although circumstantial, the report continued, “such a pattern of undressing and restraining of victims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.”Patten said grave violations, most involving rape, were identified in at least three locations, “namely the Nova music festival site and its surroundings, Road 232, and Kibbutz Re’im.”The mission, however, had challenges in “both the gathering and verification of incidents of sexual violence” Patten noted.She highlighted the “limited professionally gathered forensic material” and “inaccurate and unreliable forensic interpretation by some non-professionals” at the crime scenes.The UN team’s research was also constrained by “the extremely limited availability of victims, survivors and witnesses of sexual violence due partly to the internal displacement of affected communities, the lack of public trust and confidence in national and international institutions, including the UN,” she said.Some widely reported alleged incidences were also determined by the mission to be “unfounded,” she said. These included an unverified claim of a gruesome attack on a pregnant woman and her fetus. An official from an Israeli search and rescue organization told CNN in October that they had found a pregnant woman shot from behind and stabbed in the stomach.The report also said the team was unable to verify a reported case of rape in Nahal Oz military base and genital mutilation. “With respect to the latter instance, while the forensic analysis reviewed injuries to intimate body parts, no discernible pattern could be identified, against either female or male soldiers. However, seven female soldiers were abducted from this base into Gaza,” the report wrote.While in the West Bank, the mission said they were told of the “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” Palestinian women and men faced while in detention.The mission were told that Palestinian detainees faced various forms of sexual violence, from “unwanted touching of intimate areas and forced unveiling of women wearing Hijab; beatings, including in the genital areas; threats of rape against women and threats of rape against female family members (wives, sisters, daughters) in the case of men.”The report said that concerns were also raised about the circulation of pictures of women detainees in and “depriving women of menstruation products.”CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment."}
{"title": "", "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has found multiple problems with Boeing’s production practices following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines’ 737 Max 9.“The FAA identified non-compliance issues in Boeing’s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,” the FAA said in a press release, but did not immediately provide further details.A separate report launched prior to the door plug incident but released last month found “gaps” in Boeing’s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns.The FAA said the findings of both this audit and the separate report should be part of Boeing’s quality improvement plan. It has given Boeing 90 days to produce the plan to fix its quality issues.Boeing said it is prepared to do what is needed to improve quality.“We have a clear picture of what needs to be done. Transparency prevailed in all of these discussions,” said the company’s statement. “Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator [Michael] Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.”It is not the first such promise from Boeing since the Alaska Air incident. In January Boeing CEO David Calhoun conceded Boeing needed to improve its quality controls.“Whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,” said Calhoun in comments to the company’s investors in January. “An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.”The audit also included major Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet, among other items. Without giving details, the FAA said it found multiple instances where both companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.Boeing used to own the operations that now make up most of Spirit, but spun it off as a separate company in 2005. Boeing disclosed on Friday that it is in negotiations to possibly re-acquire Spirit.Asked for a comment on the report, a Spirit spokesman replied, “We are in communication with Boeing and the FAA on appropriate corrective actions.”More than two dozen FAA inspectors are taking part in the audit of Boeing’s 737 plant in Renton, Washington, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told members of Congress during a hearing last month. The agency is not the only government body looking into Boeing’s quality issues.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident aboard the Alaska Air flight. A preliminary report on the incident found that the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the jet left Boeing’s factory last October to be delivered to Alaska Air. The NTSB has yet to assign blame for the missing bolts.In addition, the Justice Department is reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the door plug blowout on a 737 Max flight last month violate a deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing signed with the government three years ago following two Max fatal crashes, according to a person familiar with the investigation. That probe could expose Boeing to criminal liability.The final results of this audit will likely be the backbone of future congressional hearings that could take Boeing to task.This Wednesday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy will give the latest on the Alaska Flight 1282 investigation to the Senate committee that oversees aviation. The chair of the Senate Commerce Committee has said that hearings involving Boeing executives will take place after senators hear the latest investigative findings."}
{"title": "", "text": "Bitcoin surged to its all-time high on Monday, shaking off a more than two-year rut that put the future of the entire crypto ecosystem in question.Bitcoin, the world’s first and by-far largest digital currency, was trading at $68,791, topping the previous record of $68,789 reached on November 10, 2021.Over the past several months, bitcoin’s rally has been turbocharged by US regulators’ approval of exchange-traded funds pegged to the digital asset, which created an on-ramp for more traditional investors to incorporate bitcoin into their portfolios.That approval took years of lobbying by crypto firms, and was granted only grudgingly by the Securities and Exchange Commission after a court ruled the regulator’s reasons for rejecting bitcoin ETF applications were “arbitrary and capricious.”The first 11 “spot” bitcoin ETFs — which track the real-time market price of the asset — launched in January.After just a month, the ETFs had spurred more than $4.2 billion in net new flows, according to Bloomberg.ETFs are investment tools that track a basket of assets but trade like a stock. Part of the appeal of a bitcoin ETF is that investors can get exposure to bitcoin through their usual brokerage firm, rather than having to set up a digital wallet through a cryptocurrency exchange.Bitcoin is a bellwether for the broader $2 trillion crypto industry, whose reputation has been pummeled by a series of negative headline-making events: high-profile bankruptcies of exchanges and lenders, volatile price swings and the prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, a onetime crypto celebrity who was convicted in November of stealing billions of dollars from customers on his FTX exchange, which collapsed in late 2022.Bitcoin, which accounts for more than half of all cryptos in circulation, is up more than 200% over the past 12 months, according to CoinMarketCap.The bitcoin rally has also been fueled by the crypto faithful, who are anticipating even more gains this spring following an event known as the “halving.” Roughly every four years, the number of bitcoin entering circulation gets cut in half — a built-in feature of the cryptocurrency, which is finite by design. As bitcoin approaches scarcity, the value is expected to rise."}

A drone turned their apartment in Odesa, southern Ukraine, into a pile of concrete and bricks, with only the narrow room where Serhiy and Liza, who is just two-and-a-half-years-old, were sleeping remaining intact.Serhiy then spent 16 agonizing hours waiting in the courtyard of the building, hoping that his wife and baby were alive. When rescue workers finally found them, both were dead.“I was very worried that they suffered, but the doctors said they died in their sleep. They were found in the same position they fell asleep, they were together,” he told the congregation, according to the video of the event viewed by CNN.A relative of Anna told CNN that Liza doesn’t understand what happened to her mother and brother. She has been told that they’re now in heaven.Odesa, a strategic city in southern Ukraine, is no stranger to Russian strikes. But the attack on Saturday against a high-rise residential building was particularly brutal. Twelve people were killed and 20 others injured, some of them critically.Locals were left reeling with sadness and anger, and the site of the attack is now covered with flowers, candles and toys.Investigators are trying to determine what type of drone was used in the attack. The damage it caused to the building was significant, as was the number of people who were killed, which has led some to speculate the drone might have been modified to cause bigger impact.“It’s possible that the drone’s warhead could have been additionally reinforced, as such destruction is not something that happens very often. We see that the enemy is gradually increasing the combat part of the drones,” Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Southern Operational Command, told CNN.Entire family killedFive children, including Tymofii, were among the 12 people killed, according to Odesa officials.Three of the children were from the same family, killed alongside their parents Tetyana and Oleh Kravets, who both served in Ukraine’s armed forces.The couple and their 7-month-old daughter Lisa, were found on Saturday. Eight-year-old Zlata and 9-year-old Sergiy were the last to be pulled from the rubble on Sunday.The fifth child killed in the attack was only identified by local media as 3-year old Mark. His father Vitaliy was also killed, while his mother Anastasia was injured and is in an intensive care unit.The Regional Directorate of the Territorial Defence Forces South, the unit that Oleh Kravets served in, described him as a “serviceman who was an example in his courage and bravery, determination and resilience, performing his military duty with full dedication and devotion to his homeland.”"}

{"title": "", "text": "A growing number of children in Gaza are dying of starvation and dehydration, according to the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials, amid desperate conditions due to Israel’s throttling of aid and destruction of the besieged enclave — reinforcing the urgency of this week’s ceasefire talks.A WHO team found “severe levels of malnutrition, children dying of starvation, serious shortages of fuel, food and medical supplies, hospital buildings destroyed,” during a recent visit to the Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X Monday.Tedros appealed to Israel to ensure the safe and regular delivery of humanitarian aid and for a halt to the fighting.Negotiators gathered in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Sunday for talks on a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and release of hostages from Gaza, but Israel did not send a delegation, an Israeli official told CNN, despite increasing international pressure to end hostilities and allow for a desperately needed surge of humanitarian aid.The official said the reason was that Hamas had not responded to two Israeli demands: a list of Israeli hostages specifying which are alive and which are dead; and confirmation of the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons, in exchange for the hostages taken when Hamas militants attacked communities in southern Israel on October 7.The militant group wants a permanent end to fighting before agreeing to release hostages, a Hamas source told CNN as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Sunday. However, a high-ranking Hamas official did not immediately respond to a CNN question about whether the militant group had responded to Israel’s conditions.It comes as the United States is increasingly vocal about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, where the United Nations warns hundreds of thousands of people are on the brink of famine and US ally Israel continues to obstruct the bulk of aid deliveries.On Saturday, the US made its first humanitarian airdrop into the strip — 66 bundles containing meals but no water or medical supplies, a US official said. Aid groups have criticized the air drops as an ineffective and degrading way to get aid to Palestinians in Gaza, with the International Crisis Group’s UN director saying they are at best a “temporary Band-Aid measure.”One of the strongest rebukes of Israel by a US official to date came from US Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Sunday forcefully called for more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying that people in the region are “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and urged Israel to do more.She called for an “immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks,” a proposal currently on the negotiating table, and urged Hamas to free Israeli hostages.“What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration,” Harris said, citing the deaths of dozens of Palestinians amid Israeli gunfire and panic at Gaza food lines.“The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” said Harris.Her comments come at a critical moment in the Israel-Hamas war. On Monday, Benny Gantz, a key member of Israel’s war cabinet and one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s most prominent political rivals, was in Washington, holding meetings with high-level US officials that will include Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Gantz’s three-day trip to the US capital has rankled some of Netanyahu’s allies. Dudi Amsalem, Minister of Regional Cooperation and a member of Netanyhau’s Likud party, said Gantz’s visit was in “total violation of government regulations” and accused Gantz of attempting to “stop the IDF from winning the war and create an opportunity to lead the process of establishing a Palestinian state that will eliminate the State of Israel!”Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that Netayahu was not aware of Gantz’s plans and had instructed the Israeli embassy in Washington not to facilitate the visit. But Gantz said he personally informed Netanyahu of his plans to visit Washington DC over the weekend, according to a statement from his office. CNN has reached out to Netanyahu’s office for comment.Since the war began, Gantz’s National Unity party has steadily climbed in the opinion polls while Likud has lost ground.Children starving to deathIn northern Gaza, children are starving to death and others fighting for their lives as critical supplies are held up from reaching those in need.A Palestinian Ministry of Health spokesperson said Sunday the number of children who have died of dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza has risen to 15.CNN cannot independently confirm the deaths of the children or their causes due to the lack of international media access to wartime Gaza.A further 124 people were killed over the past 24 hours, the Gaza Ministry of Health said Monday, bringing the death toll in the enclave since October 7 to 30,534.Doctors at the Kamal Adwan Hospital also “fear for the lives of six children suffering from malnutrition and diarrhea in intensive care as a result of the cessation of the electric generator and oxygen and the weakness of medical capabilities,” Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the Ministry spokesman in Gaza, said in a statement.The death toll has been rising since last week when incubators and oxygen supplies at Kamal Adwan Hospital ceased to operate at night because of fuel shortages, the ministry said.A WHO team visiting the hospital at the weekend corroborated the dire conditions, saying the lack of food resulted in the deaths of 10 children at the hospital.“Kamal Adwan Hospital is the only paediatrics hospital in the north of Gaza, and is overwhelmed with patients… The lack of electricity poses a serious threat to patient care, especially in critical areas like the intensive care unit and the neonatal unit,” WHO chief Tedros said on X.The United Nations children’s agency has called for urgent action, requesting “multiple reliable entry points” to allow them to bring aid.“Humanitarian aid agencies like UNICEF must be enabled to reverse the humanitarian crisis, prevent a famine, and save children’s lives,” UNICEF’s Adele Khodr said in a statement Sunday.UNICEF said it was also aware of at least 10 children dying due to dehydration and malnutrition in recent days at Kamal Adwan Hospital.“There are likely more children fighting for their lives somewhere in one of Gaza’s few remaining hospitals, and likely even more children in the north unable to obtain care at all,” Khodr added.One recent incident exposed the particularly desperate situation in northern Gaza.More than 100 people were killed last week when Israeli troops opened fire on crowds, triggering panic as hungry Palestinian civilians were gathering around food aid trucks, Palestinian officials and eyewitnesses said.Israel said its troops fired warning shots to disperse the crowd. A UN team that visited victims said many suffered gunshot wounds.In a separate incident on Sunday, at least eight people were killed and several others injured in an Israeli strike on an aid distribution truck in central Gaza, the enclave’s health ministry told CNN. The truck, carrying aid donated by Kuwait, was struck on the Al Rashid coastal road in the city of Deir El Belah.CNN footage shows a medium-sized truck destroyed, with seats covered in blood. Some people can be seen gathered around the wrecked vehicle, looking through the sand for aid that is still intact and can be used. The IDF has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.UNICEF’s Khodr described the situation in Gaza as “man-made, predictable, and entirely preventable,” and warned the death toll among children could rapidly increase unless immediate action is taken.“The widespread lack of nutritious food, safe water and medical services, a direct consequence of the impediments to access and multiple dangers facing UN humanitarian operations, is impacting children and mothers, hindering their ability to breastfeed their babies, especially in the northern Gaza Strip,” she said.“People are hungry, exhausted and traumatized. Many are clinging to life.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett packed two very different messages into her one-page opinion on Monday as the Supreme Court declared states could not toss former President Donald Trump off the ballot.She chastised her colleagues on the right for breaking significant – and in her mind unnecessary – ground in the breadth of their legal reasoning.But then she admonished the court’s three liberal justices, who also split from the majority’s legal rationale, in unusually biting terms.“In my judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency,” Barrett wrote. “The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.”The 52-year-old appointee of Trump emphasized that the justices were more in sync than not, suggesting that the liberals’ writing subverted that fact.“All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case,” Barrett wrote. “That is the message Americans should take home.”Yet Barrett’s statement, joined by no other justice, had the effect of highlighting the tensions between ideological factions and the power of the conservative majority, rather than neutralizing them. Liberal justices, often in the dissent, regularly adopt a caustic tone. It was paradoxical that Barrett herself, in rebuking them on Monday, chose words with more bite than usual.The ideological strains inside the court will likely grow as the justices hear another chapter of Trump election-related litigation in April and begin issuing decisions this spring on various challenges to Biden administration policy.Not since the 2000 case of Bush v. Gore, when the justices by a 5-4 vote cut off decisive recounts in Florida and gave then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush the White House over then-Vice President Al Gore, has the Supreme Court been positioned to play an outsized role in a presidential election.Trump’s choice of Barrett as his third high court appointment dates to just before the November 2020 election and the sudden death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that September. Confirmed by the Senate before Election Day, Barrett immediately became the most consequential new justice.Her sheer presence created a conservative six-justice supermajority on the nine-member bench. And her vote began defining the court’s new direction, especially when the justices in 2022 reversed the landmark Roe v. Wade decision and obliterated constitutional abortion rights nationwide.But in the recesses of Barrett’s jurisprudence, she has sometimes set herself apart from the conservative wing and become slightly unpredictable. Liberal justices, likely hoping she might inch left over time, have pitched their arguments toward her, just as they sometimes do with two conservatives who’ve straddled the middle: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.On Monday, Barrett aligned with the liberal justices to a point on legal reasoning – but also demonstrated her differences.How the justices agreed and then splinteredAs the high court rejected a Colorado Supreme Court decision that would have allowed the state to bar Trump from presidential ballots, it said states lack the power to enforce the key provision at issue.The 14th Amendment’s Section 3 dictates: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion … .”Relying on that provision, the Colorado Supreme Court in December disqualified Trump from the state presidential primary ballots.“President Trump incited and encouraged the use of violence and lawless action to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” the Colorado court said, referring to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and Trump’s protest of the 2020 vote that favored Joe Biden for president. (The effect of the Colorado ruling was postponed as Trump appealed to the justices, and his name was never removed from ballots.)During the justices’ oral arguments on February 8, it was clear a majority, if not all nine justices, were prepared to reverse the Colorado decision. They plainly believed no state, acting on its own, should be able to remove a candidate for national office.And on Monday, the court in an unsigned opinion declared: “We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency…”Even the three liberals who separated themselves from the majority’s reasoning agreed that the Constitution forbids individual states to set their own qualifications for a presidential candidate.“Allowing Colorado to do so would, we agree, create a chaotic state-by-state patchwork, at odds with our Nation’s federalism principles,” wrote Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson in a joint concurring opinion. “That is enough to resolve this case. Yet the majority goes further.”Invoking the wounds of past cases, that liberal trio opened with a Roberts line from 2022 in protest of how far the majority was going to reverse abortion rights: “If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more,” Roberts had written in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade.“Today, the Court departs from that vital principle, deciding not just this case, but challenges that might arise in the future,” the liberals wrote Monday.They denounced the majority for its view that Section 3 could be enforced against only after Congress passed specific legislation, precluding, as the trio wrote, “other potential means of federal enforcement.”“We cannot join an opinion that decides momentous and difficult issues unnecessarily,” the liberals said. “The majority is left with next to no support for its requirement that a Section 3 disqualification can occur only pursuant to legislation enacted for that purpose.” They noted that the majority opinion foreclosed judicial enforcement of Section 3, such as through a prosecution for insurrection.Joining Roberts in the majority were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.For her part, Barrett agreed with the liberals that the five on the right wing need not have addressed “the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.”She said once the majority took that approach, the remaining four justices were left “with a choice of how to respond.”Barrett made plain that with their “stridency,” the three liberals had chosen the wrong path.Echoes of John Roberts’ complaint about the liberalsIn criticizing the court’s critics, Barrett appeared to take a page from Roberts. The chief justices often implores the public to ignore the differences between the nine. He loathes instances when liberal dissenters make especially cutting remarks.“It has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,” Roberts wrote of dissenting justices last year after he captured a six-justice conservative majority to reject the Biden administration’s student-debt relief plan.Roberts, ever mindful of public regard for the court, added, “We do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement. It is important that the public not be misled either. Any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and the country.”In Monday’s case, Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson refused to temper their disagreement, although their writing was listed as a concurring opinion rather than a dissent.At one point, they even invoked a dissenting opinion from the enduringly controversial Bush v. Gore: “What it does today, the Court should have left undone.”Today’s liberals then added of today’s majority, “In a sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint, it abandons that course.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "At the bar on the 30th floor of The Lana — the first hotel from the Dorchester Collection to open in Dubai — chic clientele sip from glass flutes overlooking the City of Gold’s dazzling array of skyscrapers, silhouetted against the dark dunes beyond.The bar, which opened earlier this month, is called High Society, a reference to the clientele who have typically enjoyed its signature drink: champagne.The hotel’s director of food and beverage, Nicolas Caupain, is a self-confessed champagne aficionado, and designed the bar concept to allow guests to experience champagne “not just as celebratory wine but as a nice wine which you can enjoy every day,” he says.It’s an unusual concept for Dubai. The Emirate has a complicated relationship with alcohol: in Islam, the official religion of the United Arab Emirates, alcohol consumption is prohibited. However, the city’s diverse, expat-heavy population and its push to grow its tourism sector has seen many of its alcohol laws relaxed in recent years, including decriminalizing alcohol in 2020 and scrapping its 30% alcohol sales tax last year, although Muslims are still prohibited from acquiring a license to buy alcohol.While the city has over 13,000 restaurants, its bar scene has largely been confined to Michelin fine dining, nightclubs, and boozy brunches. Venues that emphasize the design and diversity of their drinks menus are few and far between.But Caupain believes “there is a market in Dubai who are looking for this level of refinement and discovery,” and that High Society is part of a movement towards casual drinking venues.Unlike other wines, champagne undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle, which gives it its signature fizz, making “every champagne different,” Caupain adds. Champagne is left to mature for at least 15 months, although vintages are left for up to 10 years. This unusual process creates a vast range of flavor profiles, exemplified by High Society’s 118 labels and extensive “by the glass”menu — one of the largest collections in the UAE, claims Caupain.A growing interestHigh Society’s collection ranges from well-known champagne houses like Pol Roger (the favored champagne of Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill) to artisanal-like “grower champagnes” Egly Ouriet, Larmandier Bernier, and Ulysse Collin.As the name suggests, these lesser-known labels are small-scale champagne producers that grow their own grapes — and they are surging in popularity globally, says Samuel Lacroix, wine director at Al Muntaha, a Michelin-starred European fine-dining restaurant at the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel.“Smaller labels tend to produce super cool, exclusive and delicious champagnes,” says Lacroix.Al Muntaha, which was recognized by Star Wine List as having the best sparkling wine list in the UAE earlier this year, has 166 labels on its champagne list, including around 60 recently added grower champagnes, says Lacroix. Dubai’s changing demographic, which in the past two years has included an influx of business elite and professionals attracted by the Emirate’s golden visa, is pushing the city’s food and beverage scene to compete with other international cities, he says, adding: “The clientele is getting more refined.”The UAE already dominates for its wine selection in a region that generally has restrictive alcohol laws — in 2022, it was the largest importer of champagne in the Middle East and Africa, according to data from the Comité Champagne trade association, importing nearly three times as many bottles as the rest of the Arabian Peninsula combined — but suppliers favor the big champagne houses, which are easier to buy in bulk, says Lacroix. However, as more world-class sommeliers and chefs descend on the city, they’re bringing with them preferences for more unique products and culinary experiences.“To have all of these champagne names here, I think that we’re getting into the big leagues in the champagne world,” says Lacroix.“Casual wine culture”More and more restaurants in Dubai are offering unusual wines and champagnes, such as Josette, a French restaurant that opened in 2023 and serves its own private-label champagne, and BOCA, winner of the 2023 Green Michelin Star, which offers a list of organic, biodynamic or eco-conscious sparkling wines.Even Dubai’s national airline, Emirates, is on board with the city’s penchant for fizz: in December 2022 it became the only commercial airline in the world officially serving Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon onboard and claims it purchases more champagne than any other airline in the world.Award bodies are also beginning to pay attention to the region: Gault&Millau, a French dining guide, opened its UAE office in Dubai in 2022, launching the UAE Champagne index the same year; and just last month, Star Wine List, a Swedish publication, launched its inaugural awards for the UAE. For both awards, the majority of winners and nominees were located in Dubai.While the bar scene is evolving quickly, it still faces challenges, often stemming from the country’s history of alcohol prohibition: there are just two wine suppliers in the city and a 50% customs duty on alcohol. Additionally, many venues are not set up for the kind of storage that fine wines and champagnes require — a major problem for smaller or independent restaurants, says Lacroix, as storing wine incorrectly in Dubai’s year-round heat could damage the stock.And the culture around drinking is largely focused on dining or special occasions, with little in between, says Krister Bengtsson, founder of Star Wine List.“This more relaxed setting of sharing wine, it’s not really present yet — whereas if you’re in Paris, London, New York, (wine bars) are really where things are happening,” says Bengtsson, adding that new venues like High Society could help create a “casual wine culture” that emphasizes the drinks rather than food.“It’s interesting to see a lot of good wines and champagnes by the glass at unusually lower prices in the Dubai market, to allow people to taste the wines,” says Bengtsson.The growing interest in artisanal labels is also “adding a new layer of perspective both for wine lovers and restaurants,” and “putting pressure on the importers to add more diversity and smaller scale to their portfolio,” Bengtsson adds — all things that are pushing the city’s drinks scene to evolve.At High Society, Caupain hopes that a luxurious finger food menu (designed by French chef Jean Imbert to pair with champagne) and a vinyl DJ will create a laid-back atmosphere that allows guests to enjoy champagne on a range of occasions — and launch a new era for Dubai’s bar scene.“Our pricing strategy is made for people to keep coming back — come on a Tuesday with friends, come back with a partner on a Thursday, or a business partner on the weekends,” says Caupain, adding: “We want to make a lifestyle destination.”"}

He spent his entire 13-season NFL career with the Eagles, including the team’s 2018 Super Bowl win.During a lengthy news conference lasting around 40 minutes, Kelce broke down in tears on numerous occasions as he explained what football has meant to him during his childhood and professional career.“I’ve been asked many times why did I choose football, what drew me to the game, and I never have an answer that gets it right,” he said.“The best way I can explain it is what draws you to your favorite song, your favorite book. It’s what it makes you feel – the seriousness of it, the intensity of it. Stepping on the field was the most alive and free I had ever felt.”Following the Eagles’ 32-9 playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in January, it was reported Kelce had told his teammates he was retiring.However, he declined to make his retirement official, raising the question of whether he might return for one final year with the Eagles.But on Monday, he tearfully announced the end of his playing career at a news conference attended by his family and Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni.“It took a lot of hard work and determination getting here,” said Kelce. “I have been the underdog my entire career and I mean this when I say it, I wish I still was. Few things gave me more joy than proving someone wrong.”During the announcement, Kelce paid tribute to, among others, his former coaches and teammates, the fans in Philadelphia, and his family, notably his brother.In 2023, Kelce’s Eagles came up short in Super Bowl LVII against the Kansas City Chiefs and his younger brother Travis – the first time that two brothers played against each other in a Super Bowl.“There is no chance I would be here without the bond Travis and I share,” said Kelce. “It made me stronger, tougher, smarter and taught me the values of cooperation, loyalty, patience and understanding.“It’s only too poetic I found my career being fulfilled in the City of Brotherly Love. I knew that relationship all too well.”In a statement Monday, Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie said it is “difficult to put into words how much Jason Kelce has meant” to the organization, the city, and the fans.“He gave everything he had to all of us for 13 years, and he did it in a way that was truly authentic,” Lurie added.“Jason was an incredible football player; a future Hall of Famer who would have been successful anywhere. But has there ever been a more perfect marriage between a player, a city, and a team?”"}

{"title": "", "text": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that former President Donald Trump should appear on the ballot in Colorado in a decision that follows months of debate over whether the frontrunner for the GOP nomination violated the “insurrectionist clause” included in the 14th Amendment.The opinion is a massive victory for Trump, vanquishing one of the many legal threats that have both plagued and animated his campaign against President Joe Biden. Though the decision has no impact on the four ongoing criminal cases that Trump is facing, including the federal election subversion case that covers some of the same conduct surrounding January 6, 2021.The court was unanimous on the idea that Trump could not be unilaterally removed from the ballot.But the justices were divided about how broadly the decision would sweep. A 5-4 majority said that no state could dump a federal candidate off any ballot – but four justices asserted that the court should have limited its opinion.A five-justice majority – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – wrote that states may not remove any federal officer from the ballot, especially the president, without Congress first passing legislation.“We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency,” the opinion states.“Nothing in the Constitution delegates to the States any power to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates,” the majority added.“BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” Trump wrote on social media.Four justices say the court has gone too farFour of the justices disagreed on the scope of the decision.With its opinion, the majority, “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement,” Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a concurring opinion. “We cannot join an opinion that decides momentous and difficult issues unnecessarily.”Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing alone in a concurring opinion, said that the case “does not require us to address the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.”The five conservatives went further than the other four were willing to go, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.“First, the unsigned majority opinion holds that states can’t enforce Section 3 against any​ prospective federal officeholders, and not just against presidential candidates. Second, it also requires Congress to pass affirmative legislation to enforce Section 3 – cutting off other ways that the federal government might enforce that provision, e.g., by refusing to count electoral votes in favor of a candidate who violates Section 3. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson didn’t say they would’ve answered those questions differently; they just wouldn’t have answered them at all.”SCOTUS does not discuss if Trump was an insurrectionistThe Supreme Court’s opinion doesn’t directly address whether Trump’s actions on January 6 qualified as an “insurrection” – skirting an issue that the courts in Colorado had wrestled with.The unsigned opinion noted that lower courts in Colorado found Trump’s remarks before the attack on the US Capitol qualified as engaging in an insurrection within the meaning of the Constitution. But the US Supreme Court’s unsigned opinion didn’t return to that judgment.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the liberal group that filed the the lawsuit on behalf of Republican voters, criticized the Supreme Court ruling – but also said it was “in no way a win for Trump” because it declined to address the insurrection language from Colorado.“The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so. Every court – or decision-making body – that has substantively examined the issue has determined that January 6th was an insurrection and that Donald Trump incited it. That remains true today,” the group said.Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on the “Situation Room” Monday that while she was “glad” the Supreme Court issued a ruling ahead of Super Tuesday, she was disappointed in the decision.“We believe that it’s up to Colorado or any state to determine whether to disqualify oath-breaking insurrectionists from our ballots. Ultimately, the United States Supreme Court disagreed,” Griswold said, adding that she would uphold the court’s decision.Longshot bid to use 14th AmendmentThe decision, which marked the first time the high court had weighed Trump’s actions on January 6, landed a day before Super Tuesday, when 16 states and territories, including Colorado, will hold nominating contests.Using the 14th Amendment to derail Trump’s candidacy has always been seen as a legal longshot, but gained significant momentum with a win in Colorado’s top court in December, on its way to the US Supreme Court. Since that decision, Trump was also removed from the ballot in Maine and Illinois.Courts and legal groups had for months debated the meaning of the post-Civil War provision at the center of the case, language that prohibits certain officials who took an oath to support the Constitution – and then engaged in insurrection – from serving in office again. The key provision, known as Section 3, was originally intended to keep former Confederates from reclaiming power.But there was considerable uncertainty about the ban’s meaning and how it should be applied. Several conservative and liberal justices raised fundamental questions during the February 8 arguments about the fairness of Colorado effectively answering those questions for the rest of the nation.Trump ridiculed the 14th Amendment lawsuits that have cropped up across the country and routinely complains that they are an unconstitutional affront pursued by Democrats who want to take him off the ballot rather than compete with him in November. His lawyers have argued it would be “un-American” to deprive voters of the opportunity to decide whether Trump should return to the White House.Similar 14th Amendment challenges against Trump were rejected – all on procedural grounds – in Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts and Oregon. But in Colorado, a series of decisions by state courts led to a case that Trump ultimately appealed to the US Supreme Court in January.A liberal-leaning watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed the Colorado lawsuit in September on behalf of six Republican and independent voters, led by 91-year-old Norma Anderson, a trailblazing former Republican state legislator. They sued Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and asked a judge to force her to remove Trump’s name from the state’s GOP primary ballot.A state district judge in Colorado presided over a weeklong trial before concluding in November that even though Trump “engaged in an insurrection,” he should stay on the ballot because the ban didn’t apply to presidents. The Colorado Supreme Court, on a sharply divided 4-3 vote, affirmed the findings about Trump’s role in the US Capitol attack but said that the ban did, in fact, apply to presidents.Only three states had removed Trump from the ballot because of the “insurrectionist ban.”In addition to Colorado, the top election official in Maine reached a similar conclusion and determined that Trump is constitutionally barred from office. Trump is appealing, and a state court paused those proceedings while the Supreme Court dealt with the Colorado case.An Illinois judge also removed Trump from the ballot in that state on the same January 6 grounds, though implementation of that ruling was paused pending any appeals.It appeared during the Supreme Court’s arguments that Trump would win. The court’s conservatives most likely to be skeptical to the former president, like Roberts and Kavanaugh, lobbed relatively friendly questions at Trump’s lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell. When the attorney representing the voters stood up, questioning became far more pointed and insistent.And it wasn’t only conservatives who appeared to be on the attack: Justices Kagan, nominated by President Barack Obama, and Jackson, a Biden pick, also zeroed in on some of the arguments that Trump had raised in his briefs.“The question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States,” Kagan pressed Jason Murray, who was representing the challengers. “Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation?”"}
{"title": "", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former President Donald Trump could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state – a sweeping and historic ruling that brushed aside a lawsuit claiming that he disqualified himself from office because of his actions on January 6, 2021.In a repudiation of the notion that Trump’s actions left him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a unanimous court ruled that an individual state could not dump the former president from the ballot.But the justices did not say if Trump was in fact an insurrectionist and split on technicalities of how the ban could be enforced – a distinction with potentially broad consequences.The opinion reversed a stunning decision last year from Colorado’s top court that found Trump engaged in an insurrection because of his remarks outside the White House before the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Those actions, the state court ruled, violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment and left Trump ineligible to appear on the state’s ballot.Since then, both Maine and Illinois also moved to take Trump off the ballot. Monday’s Supreme Court decision appeared certain to shut down those and other efforts to remove the frontrunner for the GOP nomination from the ballot.“States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office,” the court’s unsigned majority opinion read. “But states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency.”Here’s what to know about the opinion and what it means:Bottom line: Trump will appear on ballotsThere was no equivocation in the Supreme Court’s short opinion: States do not have the power to remove a federal candidate – especially a president – from the ballot under the Constitution’s “insurrectionist ban.” It is Congress, the court wrote, that can enforce the provision, not states.“The notion that the Constitution grants the states freer rein than Congress to decide how Section 3 should be enforced with respect to federal officer is simply implausible,” the court’s unsigned opinion read.What that means is that the impact of the decision will sweep far wider than the controversy at issue in Colorado. It means that any state would be overstepping its power by trying to knock Trump off the ballot – a position that will almost certainly shut down similar “insurrectionist” lawsuits across the country.In that sense, the court’s opinion was a significant victory for Trump, vanquishing a legal theory that has for months threatened his viability for a second term.Court appears to head off 2025 showdownThe high court’s opinion went farther than shutting down state enforcement of the insurrectionist ban. It appeared to make it much harder for it to be enforced at the federal level as well.And that is where the unity on the court split apart, with four justices – Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – asserting that their colleagues went too far. Barrett is a conservative Trump nominee and the other three are members of the liberal wing.The court’s opinion, the three liberal justices wrote in a concurrence, “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement,” by requiring Congress to act to pass legislation first, something that’s highly unlikely. By doing so, the three wrote, “the majority attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.”The move appeared to head off a concern that a narrow ruling from the court could lead to a messy confrontation in Congress when the electoral votes are counted in 2025. A group of legal experts feared an outcome that would leave unclear whether lawmakers opposed to Trump could attempt to disqualify him after the election.Supreme Court avoids insurrectionist debateThe Supreme Court’s opinion doesn’t directly address whether Trump’s actions on January 6 qualified as an “insurrection” – skirting an issue that the courts in Colorado wrestled with.The unsigned opinion noted that lower courts in Colorado found Trump’s remarks before the attack on the US Capitol qualified as engaging in an insurrection within the meaning of the Constitution. But the court’s unsigned opinion didn’t return to that judgment direction.That tracks with what experts had predicted would happen, that the justices would seek to decide the ballot case in a more narrow way without saying much of anything about Trump’s actions.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the liberal watchdog group that filed the suit, focused on the point in a statement after the decision.“While the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump back on the ballot on technical legal grounds, this was in no way a win for Trump,” Noah Bookbinder, the group’s president said. “The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so.”Barrett’s concern with ‘national temperature’Barrett devoted more than half of her one-page concurrence to urging the public to look past the fact that four of the court’s members – herself included – disagreed with how broadly their colleagues decided the case.The conservative justice stressed that although she and the three liberal justices were at odds with their other colleagues, “this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency.”“The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up,” Barrett wrote.She continued: “For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home.”The Colorado dispute was one of several high-profile Trump-related cases before the court this term, and its inclusion on the court’s docket likely contributed to more lukewarm poll numbers for the justices. A poll taken last month around the time that the case was heard showed the public’s approval rating of the high court standing at just 40%.Liberal wing rebukes majority for opinion’s sweepThe court’s three liberals – Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson – sharply criticized the majority for the breadth of the opinion. The issue of Trump’s eligibility could have been decided simply, they said, by ruling that states can’t enforce the insurrectionist ban on their own.“In a sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint,” they wrote, the court’s unsigned opinion, “abandons that course.”The three focused their ire on the fact that the majority opinion limited federal enforcement of the insurrection ban as well as state enforcement. That decision, they said, wasn’t before the Supreme Court in the case and would “insulate all alleged insurrectionists” from future challenges.Nobody took credit for writing the opinionNo justice signed their name to take responsibility for writing the opinion keeping Trump on the ballot.To begin with, the court handed down what’s known as a “per curiam” opinion, a Latin term that translates to “by the court.” Such opinions are relatively rare and are sometimes used to signal consensus – even though they are not always unanimous.Per curium opinions are “unsigned,” which means that unlike most opinions, the public doesn’t know who wrote them and can’t always glean the vote count.Per curiam opinions have faced criticism from some quarters for that very reason: They allow the court to resolve controversial issues without explicitly making clear their authorship. Among the most notable per curiam opinions in the court’s history was the Bush v. Gore decision, which effectively settled the 2000 election for President George W. Bush.Meanwhile, the “concurring” opinions at times looked likely sharply worded dissents. So despite the unity of the per curiam judgment there was considerable disagreement about some of the court’s reasoning."}
{"title": "", "text": "With access that millions of Americans have to preventive care at stake, a conservative federal appeals court on Monday picked apart how the Biden administration has tried to maneuver around the latest significant challenge to Obamacare.The case concerns the Affordable Care Act provision that mandates insurers cover preventive care services – including screenings for certain cancers and HIV-prevention drugs – at no cost to patients. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing a district judge’s ruling that wiped away that requirement for certain preventive services – a ruling that was paused while the appeal plays out.Very little of Monday’s 40-minute hearing in front of the 5th Circuit focused on the legal claim that started the case.Instead, the appeals court dug into the actions that the Biden administration took after the lawsuit was filed to try to neutralize the challengers’ arguments. Members of the panel also showed skepticism towards Justice Department’s assertions that the lower court acted inappropriately by applying its ruling nationwide, rather than just to the individuals and business in Texas that brought the lawsuit.“You wouldn’t just vacate these things just for people in Texas or just for the plaintiffs – if they’re invalid, they’re invalid,” said Circuit Judge Cory Wilson.Circuit Judge Don Willett suggested that the lower court’s nationwide move was the “default” approach in such a case, as he pressed the Justice Department to explain why the appeals court should deviate from that nationwide approach.Willett and Wilson – both appointees of former President Donald Trump who showed hostility towards the Affordable Care Act before they were nominated to the federal bench – were joined on the panel by Circuit Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez, an appointee of President Joe Biden.Not only will they be weighing whether to uphold the ruling that partially invalidated the mandate, they will also be deciding whether additional coverage requirements targeted by the challengers should be struck down, including no-cost coverage for some vaccines as well as for certain preventive health services for women and children.The case, called Braidwood v. Becerra, is the latest significant challenge to the Affordable Care Act, though it does not pose the existential threat to the landmark law that previous lawsuits did. A previous suit that challenged the law’s validity also emerged out of Texas and moved through the 5th Circuit before it was shut down by the Supreme Court in 2021.In the case now before 5th Circuit, the Biden administration is asking the appeals court to reverse a ruling by US District Judge Reed O’Connor that jeopardizes access to no-cost coverage for statins, screenings for certain cancers and HIV-prevention drugs, among other services. If allowed to take effect, O’Connor’s ruling would end the mandates for cost-free coverage of preventive care services that were recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force after Obamacare’s March 2010 enactment.“These are preventative service provisions that are critical and life-saving to millions to Americans,” Justice Department attorney Daniel Aguilar told the appeals court Monday, calling the wide reach of O’Connor’s ruling “unwarranted and unjustified.”The plaintiffs don’t have a reason to object to someone who is constantly receiving lung cancer screenings at no cost or a Maine resident getting a colonoscopy, Aguilar continued.However, the administration’s opponents say that O’Connor did not go far enough. They’re asking the court to reverse aspects of his ruling that upheld no-cost coverage mandates based on recommendations by two other entities: the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends which vaccines should be covered cost-free, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which issues recommendations for coverage of certain services for women and children.The appeals court on Monday asked the challengers’ lawyer Jonathan Mitchell to clarify that the move by his client – Dr. Steven Hotze, the sole trustee of the trust that owns Braidwood Management – was to challenge all of the mandates, rather than the handful that were singled out in his initial complaint.“Dr. Hotze does not want to be compelled by force of law to include any preventive care coverage in his plan, without any deductibles or co-pays, unless he chooses on his own initiative to do that,” Mitchell said. “He wants to have control over what he would charge with respect to co-pays, whether he will allow preventive care to count towards his deductible. He wants full autonomy.”Hurting access to careIf the 5th Circuit upholds O’Connor’s ruling, it could make it harder for Americans to obtain important preventive screenings and services aimed at early detection of diseases.They include lung cancer screenings for certain current and former smokers; colorectal cancer screenings for adults ages 45 to 49; the use of statins to prevent cardiovascular disease; counseling referrals for pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of depression; and the offer of HIV-prevention pills, known as PrEP drugs, for those at high risk.The lower court’s ruling does not apply to preventive care recommendations issued by the Preventive Services Task Force before the Affordable Care Act became law. However, some of the recommendations issued prior to Obamacare’s enactment have since been updated based on the latest scientific evidence, and those updates were invalidated by the ruling.If the 5th Circuit expands the ruling to encompass recommendations by the other entities, the impact would be much broader. It could wipe out the requirement that insurers provide vaccines for the flu, RSV and shingles at no charge, as well as infant screenings for more than 70 genetic diseases and conditions, testing for post-pregnancy diabetes, and annual checkups for women at no cost.The cost-sharing for some of these preventive services can be substantial, which would deter some people – particularly those with lower incomes – from accessing the care.“You can see insurance companies imposing costs that will likely make folks think twice before getting checked for particular ailments,” said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.More than 150 million people with private insurance can receive preventive services without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Health and Human Services. Studies have shown the Obamacare mandate prompted an uptake in preventive services and narrowed care disparities in communities of color.Appeals panel judges hostile to ObamacareWilson wrote a series of op-eds bashing the health care law in the years after it was passed. He called it a “massive, unworkable intrusion” by the federal government and a “slow-motion train wreck,” and wrote in 2012 that, if its individual mandate was upheld by the Supreme Court, it would “mark an end to any meaningful limit on the federal government.”When the commentary was brought up at his judicial confirmation hearings, Wilson, then a Mississippi state court judge, told the Senate that his views on Obamacare “have no part in serving as a judge, and I’ve not expressed that belief since becoming a judge.”Willett, who was appointed to the 5th Circuit by Trump in 2017, reportedly praised Texas officials’ legal efforts against the Affordable Care Act when he was a justice on the state’s Supreme Court.“Government will have carte blanche to control every sphere of your everyday life,” Willett said at a 2012 event, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle, where he was speaking alongside then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who was challenging the law’s individual mandate.Carrillo Ramirez was appointed to the 5th Circuit by Biden in 2023 and had broad bipartisan support when she was confirmed. Monday’s hearing marked the first panel Carrillo Ramirez has sat on as a 5th Circuit judge.The breadth of the judge’s rulingThe Braidwood challengers argue the government entities that recommend the mandates for no-cost preventive care run afoul of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, which requires that the officers of the United States be appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate.“The Task Force members, the members of [the Committee on Immunization Practices], and the [Health Resources and Services] Administrator all wield significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States, and they must be appointed as ‘officers’ under Article II of the Constitution,” the challengers told the 5th Circuit in a brief. “Yet none of these decisionmakers have been constitutionally appointed. The Court should declare it so and enjoin implementation of their preventive-care coverage edicts until they receive a constitutional appointment.”When the case was before O’Connor, he additionally ruled the requirement that employers cover PrEP drugs violated the challengers’ religious rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. However, that part of his ruling applied only to the challengers in the case, and the Justice Department has not appealed it to the 5th Circuit. But the mandate for no-cost coverage mandates for PrEP treatments was also blocked by a nationwide order O’Connor issued under the Appointments Clause claims.Much of the briefing in the dispute in front of the appeals court focuses not on the substance of the case, but on the breadth of O’Connor’s ruling, which blocked for the entire country the mandates issued by the task force after Obamacare took effect in 2010.The Justice Department argues that such a sweeping order was not appropriate and that any ruling against the mandates should affect just the handful of individuals and business who brought the lawsuit.O’Connor’s order undermined “the statutory right of 150 million Americans to coverage without cost sharing for more than 50 vital preventive services,” the Justice Department told the appeals court in a brief."}

Greg Abbott in December, immediately raised concerns among immigration advocates of increased racial profiling as well as detentions and attempted deportations by state authorities in Texas, where Latinos represent 40% of the population.Last week, a federal judge in Austin, Texas, had blocked the state government from implementing the law.“If allowed to proceed, SB 4 could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws,” Judge David Alan Ezra wrote.A federal appeals court over the weekend granted a temporary stay of the lower court’s decision and said the law would take effect later this week if the Supreme Court did not act."}
{"title": "", "text": "California’s mountain towns and ski resorts are digging out after a blockbuster blizzard buried them and major roads under several feet of snow.The storm slammed California’s mountains for multiple days before wrapping up Monday. The most extreme conditions targeted the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, where over 10 feet of snow and hurricane-force wind gusts of 170 mph-plus were reported.Additional snow will fall across high elevations of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest into Wednesday, as a new storm pushes into the region but amounts are expected to be well short of the weekend’s monster storm.Still, even small amounts of additional snow could increase travel woes across the region.A stretch of Interstate 80 in California near the Nevada state line more than 70 miles long was closed for more than two days after highway officials reported stranded drivers Friday night. The road was reopened to passenger vehicles Monday morning and semitrailers Monday afternoon, with chains required on a 40-mile stretch from Baxter to Truckee, according to California’s transportation agency.In the South Lake Tahoe area, where 3 to 5 feet of snow fell, a snowslide trapped vehicles and briefly shut down Highway 50 in California Sunday morning. There were no injuries reported and crews quickly reopened the road, officials said.Incredibly heavy snow and roaring winds presented long-lasting problems for other areas that typically thrive on plenty of snowfall.Numerous ski slopes and chairlifts were closed Sunday because of the extreme conditions, including at Palisades Tahoe, Sierra-at-Tahoe and Mammoth. Many will remain closed on Monday as crews dig out.Alpine Peak at Palisades Tahoe registered a wind gust Saturday of 171 mph, with gusts nearby topping 140 mph on Sunday, forcing it to close.Other nearby high elevations were buried under even more snow. The Sugar Bowl Ski Resort located near Donner Peak recorded 126 inches (10.5 feet) of snow from Friday to Monday. Of that total, 39 inches fell in 24 hours from early Sunday to Monday morning. Soda Springs reported 116 inches, Kingvale had 106 inches and Dodge Ridge saw 89 inches over the same period.The ski resort Sierra-at-Tahoe in Twin Bridges shared images with CNN of snow piling up against the door of the resort’s maintenance shop and a car in the resort’s guest parking buried in snow that fell overnight. At least 5 feet of snow pummeled the resort, but strong winds carried snow into even taller piles creating snow drifts.The daunting forecast wasn’t enough to dissuade some travelers from hitting the road during the worst conditions.The snowy and windy conditions left some vehicles stuck on the main road to Mammoth Mountain ski resort, US 395, on Friday, with some motorists in need of rescue, according to the highway patrol office in Truckee, which reported a “mass amount of vehicles stuck over Donner Summit.” The road was forced to close.The snowfall was so intense with such punishing winds that even crews dispatched to help those trapped found themselves in a similar predicament.“At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions,” the highway patrol said.The California Highway Patrol posted a photo Saturday afternoon of one of its cars stuck in snow.The severe winter storm conditions in Northern California even damaged and knocked out several pieces of equipment crews were using to clear roadways of snow, California Department of Transportation officials said in a post on X.As communities dig out from the blockbuster storm, one positive development is the state’s snowpack, a critical source of water for California in the warmer months.Statewide snow water equivalent — a measure of how much water is contained within snow — has risen above average for the first time this winter, overcoming a significant deficit from earlier in the season, according to data from the California Department of Water Resources.California’s snow water equivalent is at 104% of its average for March 4 and 94% of its April 1 average, when snowpack is typically at its peak. On February 28, before the storm arrived, the snow water equivalent was 81% of average for the date. In early January, the measure was only at 28%."}
{"title": "", "text": "Cookie Monster has taken a stance on a very real and controversial trend in the US economy — and he hates it.The gluttonous blue Sesame Street character known for gorging on cookies expressed his dismay at “shrinkflation” Monday in a post on X. Cookie Monster is apparently feeling the pain of high prices and an elevated cost of living, which have led to, among other things, the downsizing of certain consumer goods without an accompanying drop in their price.“Me hate shrinkflation! Me cookies are getting smaller,” Cookie Monster wrote. “Guess me going to have to eat double da cookies!”He may be right.OREO Double Stuf Chocolate Sandwich Cookies saw a 6% decrease in size by weight from January 2019 to October 2023, according to a report from Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in December, using Labor Department data.His report also showed that goods ranging from cleaning products, coffee and candies to sugar and frozen foods decreased in size last year, with household paper products experiencing the most shrinkflation.“Household paper products, like toilet paper and paper towels, are 34.9 percent more expensive per unit than they were in January 2019. Of that total cost increase, 10.3 percent is due to producers shrinking the size of rolls and packages,” the report said.It’s not a new phenomenon: During times of high inflation, companies increasingly prefer to reduce the size of their products rather than to hike the price, as a way to cut costs. Research indicates that consumers are more sensitive to when prices change than they are to when products become smaller.But, as inflation has slowed recently, the question as to whether companies are downsizing to boost profits (which some call “greedflation,”) or due to higher input costs, has become debatable.Cookie Monster sparked an online discussion in the same way Elmo did when he posted a kind-hearted check-in in January, only to get a flood of comments reflecting people’s traumas.Folks told Elmo they’re not doing OK mentally, now people are telling Cookie Monster they don’t like shrinkflation.Shrinkflation gets the spotlightDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio chimed in on Cookie Monster’s post, saying “big corporations shrink the size of their products without shrinking their prices, all to pay for CEO bonuses.”“People in my state of Ohio are fed up — they should get all the cookie they pay for,” he added.Daniel Zhao, lead economist at jobs site Glassdoor, posted a chart on X in response to Cookie Monster showing that cookie inflation spiked to more than 19% in November 2022 from a year earlier, but registered at a tepid 0.5% annual increase in January.That still means that cookie prices are up more than 28% compared to pre-pandemic times, which is “tough for somebody whose consumption basket is 100% cookies,” Zhao wrote.Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania responded to the insatiable blue monster by saying: “I’m on it.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren posted that she and Casey “have a bill for that.”No prominent Republicans seemed to respond to Cookie Monster’s tweet by Monday afternoon.President Joe Biden is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address to Congress on Thursday, and shrinkflation could be one of the challenges he addresses, according to media reports.Last month, Biden lambasted shrinkflation ahead of the Super Bowl match, calling on companies to “put a stop to this.”“The American public is tired of being played for suckers,” Biden said in a video posted on X ahead of the game, which is typically an occasion in which Americans stock up on snacks such as chips and soda.Casey introduced a bill last week that “empowers Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to crack down on corporations reducing product size without a reduction in price.”Inflation could prove to be a stubborn painMeanwhile, while the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since reaching a four-decade high in the summer of 2022, the level of prices remains above anything Americans dealt with in pre-pandemic times.Recent economic data have some on Wall Street fearing that inflation could prove to be more stubborn than previously thought.The latest Consumer Price Index showed that inflation didn’t ease in January as much as investors were expecting. That resulted in a brief selloff that week.Then the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — similarly showed that some price pressures didn’t slow as much as in prior months. In fact, prices rose from December to January at the fastest clip in months.That all means Fed officials, who are tasked with stabilizing prices, likely won’t cut interest rates anytime soon — so higher prices could be here to stay just a little bit longer. The central bank raised its benchmark lending rate 11 times since March 2022 in an effort to tamp down rising prices by reducing overall demand, but the economy has largely resisted those efforts.Americans’ attitudes toward the economy have improved recently, thanks to slowing inflation, according to consumer surveys, but remain below levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said Americans “hate” inflation, which has been reflected clearly in surveys and polls.Powell testifies before congressional lawmakers this week to deliver a semiannual report on the central bank’s policies over the past several months, and the Fed chief could give markets — and cookie consumers — some idea of what to expect in the months ahead."}

The individual resisted arrest on multiple occasions,” the report said.The driver of the Infiniti then began interfering with the arrest of the driver of the Dodge, the report said.“Both individuals were subsequently arrested for Resisting Arrest, Obstruction of Justice, Disorderly Conduct and other related charges,” the report said.The report does not list Morrison or McLean by name.LaTasha Morrison Sinclair, Morrison’s sister, posted the arrest video on Facebook. The video is no longer public as of Sunday afternoon. It is unclear whether Facebook or Sinclair took the video down.State police are not releasing the name of the trooper in the video at this time. The trooper is on restricted duty status and will not be on patrol during the investigation, according to Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Myles Snyder.They also said the incident was recorded by a dashboard camera in the trooper’s vehicle.They also said the incident was recorded by a dashboard camera in the trooper’s vehicle.CNN has reached out to Facebook, the Pennsylvania Fraternal Order of Police and Morrison for comment.Joe Grace, the communications director for the mayor’s office, said, “please … give our City official some time and space.”On Saturday, Mayor Cherelle Parker called the interaction “very concerning.”“Earlier today, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper executed a car stop on the Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia, reportedly for a Motor Vehicle Code violation.“Celena Morrison, the City’s executive director of the Office of LGBT Affairs, was in the vehicle that was stopped,” Parker said.“A video circulating on social media that depicts a portion of the incident is very concerning to me, and I will have no further comment until the investigation has been completed.”A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Police said Sunday its office is still investigating.“Several misdemeanor and summary charges were filed but initially declined by the Philadelphia DA Office pending additional review of the incident,” Snyder said Sunday. “Multiple traffic violations to include expired/suspended registration, following too closely.”A spokesperson with the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office said no charges have been filed as a result of the incident but the investigation is ongoing.“The District Attorney’s Office has made no charging decision pending a thorough, even-handed investigation.

{"title": "", "text": "The ruling by Alabama’s state Supreme Court on IVF has set off alarm bells across the country that the issue may be swept up in the war over abortion rights unleashed by the US Supreme Court 2022 Roe v. Wade reversal.Almost every state has a version of a so-called wrongful death statute, the basis of the Alabama court ruling that has undermined access to fertility treatments in the state. And the 2022 dismantling of Roe, which protected abortion rights nationwide, has hyper-charged the push behind “fetal personhood” measures that seek to treat fetuses or even embryos as humans in the eyes of the law.A number of factors, however, will shape whether the Alabama ruling will be just a one-off legal episode or a bellwether for how fertility treatments could be jeopardized by the battle over reproductive rights.“If you’re trying pinpoint how many states this could happen in, you’re looking at not just at the wrongful death laws,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, “but the composition of the state supreme court, whether there’s personhood language in other parts of the state law or constitution, or whether a judge could interpret it that way.”The Alabama high court’s ruling, handed down on February 16, said that embryos outside of the uterus were included in the definition of “minor children” in the state’s decades-old wrongful death statute. That means that fertility clinics could face civil damages under the statute for the destruction of embryonic materials in certain circumstances.The Alabama ruling has prompted several fertility clinics in the state to pause their services, as they assess the legal exposure the state court has created for them. Amid a political backlash, some anti-abortion activists have defended the IVF ruling while downplaying the possibility that similar rulings will pop up in other parts of the country, absent additional new measures passed by lawmakers.“Alabama law has uniquely evolved over the last decade, and I don’t know of any state that might reach a similar decision at this time,” said Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel at the anti-abortion organization, Americans United for Life. “This is probably left to the legislatures.”However, reproductive rights advocates fear that in any law that’s ambiguous about the legal rights of embryos lies a threat that those laws can be weaponized against fertility treatments.“Potentially, any of these broad laws could be interpreted to apply to IVF, it just depends on how far the state wants to go,” said Lourdes Rivera, the president of Pregnancy Justice, which defends pregnant people who face prosecutions related to their pregnancies. “It is something that we need to be vigilant about, because this is the next frontier.”Wrongful death of ‘unborn children’The Alabama Supreme Court was considering a case brought by IVF-seeking parents whose embryos were destroyed by a hospital patient who was able to enter the cryogenic nursery where the embryos were being stored. The majority opinion pointed to a previous state Supreme Court ruling that said “unborn children” were covered in Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. The latest ruling said that “unborn children” applied even to embryos that had not been implanted in the uterus.Some observers say that the decisions made by a handful Alabama clinics to pause treatments have been an overreaction, as the case was not focused on embryos that were discarded as part of the typical fertility process. The court’s opinion also distinguished its approach to the civil wrongful death law from how persons are defined in Alabama’s criminal code.But other legal experts noted that health care providers tend to be risk averse, particularly in the wake of the reversal of Roe v. Wade.“Even without the criminal threat, the civil threat is really substantial,” Rutgers Law School Dean and professor Kimberly Mutcherson said.Though it had been predicted that overturning Roe could put IVF in legal crosshairs, the Alabama ruling depended on a wrongful death statute that had long predated Roe’s demise.Wrongful death statutes – which allow family members to seek civil damages for the death of a relative – are on the books in nearly every state, and all but six states, according to a recent analysis by the Florida legislature, allow for wrongful death lawsuits to be brought on behalf of unborn children. Though more than a dozen other states join Alabama in defining unborn children from the moment of conception, several of those states include language in their statutes that appear to exempt the IVF process from wrongful death lawsuits brought on behalf of embryos or fetuses.Still other states’ wrongful death statutes lack any such carveout, leaving the possibility that embryos that expire in the course of fertility treatments could be treated like humans for the purpose of wrongful death lawsuit.“It really is going to be determined by each state’s exact wording, and you are dealing with multiple sections of law in one state,” said Texas Right to Life president John Seago, while pointing to language in Texas’ code that seeks to insulate fertility treatments from its anti-abortion laws and wrongful death statutes.Alabama lawmakers advanced measures to protect IVF providers last week as they race to get fertility clinics back up and running.A Florida bill that would have extended its wrongful death law to unborn children has stalled amid the controversy around the Alabama ruling, even as the measure rested on language defining unborn children as being “carried in the womb.” There are bills in Indiana and Iowa’s legislatures tweaking their wrongful death statutes to apply to unborn child that lack language exempting assisted reproductive technology, while many other states have fetal homicide bills that have been introduced this year, according to Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that favors abortion rights.The push for embryonic ‘personhood’To come to the conclusion that “extrauterine children” were covered by Alabama’s wrongful death statute, the state Supreme Court also pointed to a constitutional amendment approved by the state’s voters in 2018. The amendment said that “it is the public policy of this state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.”“You could definitely see individual judges making these kind of arguments in other states, which have any kind of wrongful death-type of statute,” said Seema Mohapatra, a professor in health law at the Southern Methodist University School of Law.The 2018 Alabama amendment is far less explicit than the so-called “personhood measures” that have been proposed by anti-abortion lawmakers and that seek to extend the legal protections in a state’s code to fetuses, and sometimes even embryos from the moment of fertilization. As personhood measures are adopted, they could bolster treating embryos as people in both criminal prosecutions and in the civil context, and some judges may even reach a conclusion like the Alabama ruling without an explicit personhood measure in the state’s law.There are personhood laws already on the books in four states, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights advocacy organization that has obtained a temporary court order blocking a personhood measure in Arizona. Personhood proposals have been introduced in more than a dozen states. A West Virginia proposal explicitly exempts IVF, but the rest do not address fertility treatments and their language varies in defining the start of human life.The Alabama ruling has added to the scrutiny of a US bill supported by many Republicans in Congress that would establish that “human beings” include human being” to include “all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.”House Republicans are now circulating a resolution supporting IVF. It is non-binding and largely symbolic."}

The issues caused a $2.4 billion loss to shareholders last quarter, NYCB said.Shares of NYCB slid more than 25% on Friday, a day after the company disclosed the new developments, including a major leadership shakeup resulting in Alessandro DiNello, its recently appointed executive chairman, becoming the new president and CEO.The stock was further pressured Friday evening after Fitch Ratings downgraded the quality of NYCB’s debt to junk status and Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating further into junk territory.Last week, the Long Island-based bank announced it delayed the release of its required annual financial disclosure, known as a 10-K, to focus on addressing the issues it identified. The bank said it now expects to file its 10-K by March 15. Unless the company provides an additional update, the 10-K will be the latest source of information on whether depositors are withdrawing their funds. The delay draws eerie parallels to First Republic Bank, which postponed reporting its quarterly earnings shortly before it failed last year.The bank’s latest troubles come just one month after NYCB reported it would slash dividends after reporting a surprise loss of $252 million last quarter, compared to a $172 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2022. That caused the stock to plunge, bringing it to its lowest level since 1997.Amid the selloff, the company sought to reassure depositors and investors by notifying them that deposits were stable and had even increased slightly in the last quarter of 2023.Last week’s updates invite new questions regarding the strength of the bank. The problems management identified had to do with “internal loan review, resulting from ineffective oversight, risk assessment and monitoring activities.”Such language mirrors post-mortem reports of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — both failed a year ago.Year to date, shares of NYCB are down over 70%.NYCB’s troubles are having a mixed effect on other regional bank stocks.Shares of Valley National Bank (VLY) closed 5.6% lower on Monday, while Zions Bancorporation (ZION) closed 1% higher.

{"title": "", "text": "The estate of Irish singer Sinéad O’Connor has called on Donald Trump to stop using one of her songs during campaign events, the latest in a string of similar requests from artists who have decided they don’t want to be associated with the former US president.In a joint statement published with her record label, Chrysalis Records, O’Connor’s estate said the Dublin-born singer would have been “disgusted, hurt, and insulted” by Trump’s use of her version of the Prince song “Nothing Compares 2 U.”“Throughout her life, it is well known that Sinéad O’Connor lived by a fierce moral code defined by honesty, kindness, fairness, and decency towards her fellow human beings,” the statement reads.“It was with outrage therefore that we learned that Donald Trump has been using her iconic performance of Nothing Compares 2 U at his political rallies,” it continues.“It is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt, and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil,’” the statement added.“As the guardians of her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump, and his associates desist from using her music immediately,” it concluded.CNN has contacted Trump’s representatives for comment.O’Connor, 56, was found unresponsive at her home in London in July last year and pronounced dead at the scene. Her death was not considered suspicious, and in January, a coroner in London ruled that she died of natural causes.The singer was known for her pure and crisp voice, paired with exceptional songwriting abilities that expressed her views on politics, spirituality, history and philosophy. Her first album, “The Lion and the Cobra,” was released to critical acclaim in 1987, but it was O’Connor’s 1990 follow-up, “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got” that broke her through as a well-known artist.Her rendition of “Nothing Compares 2 U” shot to No. 1 in 1990, buoyed by a music video that featured O’Connor, with close-cropped hair and a dark turtleneck.The request from her estate is the latest call from artists concerned about Trump’s use of their work.In 2020, the Rolling Stones threatened legal action against Trump’s campaign for using their music at his campaign rallies, and Tom Petty’s family issued a cease-and-desist notice to the Trump campaign after “I Won’t Back Down” was played at a rally. R.E.M. and Linkin Park also complained about Trump incorporating their songs during his 2020 campaign.In 2016, Adele told the Republican politician that he didn’t have permission to use her music, while in 2018 Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler ordered his attorney to send a cease-and-desist letter to Trump’s campaign over the use of the classic hit “Dream On.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "The first down-ballot primaries of the year on Super Tuesday are likely to be even more consequential than the day’s presidential contests, which are unlikely to change the trajectory of the Democratic and Republican races.On the ballot Tuesday are primaries for US Senate and governor, but it’s the primaries for the US House – where Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority – that are by far the most important for the balance of power in Washington.Central to the fight for control of the chamber is California. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the House, and in California alone, the party is targeting seven GOP-held seats. President Joe Biden would have won five of them in 2020 had the current district lines been in place, making these so-called crossover districts potential low-hanging fruit for a party looking to flip seats.Other states holding primaries for competitive House races Tuesday include North Carolina and Texas — and, to a lesser extent, Alabama, where redistricting has created a new district that’s much more favorable to Democrats.The four states, and Arkansas, also have primaries for seats seen as safe for either party, but the nominating contests could serve as key ideological tests.Only Texas and California have Senate primaries Tuesday. Republicans need to pick up one or two seats in the fall – depending on who wins the White House – to win the majority. The Texas race for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s seat has taken on increased importance for Senate Democrats in what is otherwise a tough landscape for them.North Carolina is also hosting gubernatorial primaries Tuesday in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The open-seat contest is expected to draw fierce attention in this presidential battleground state, which former President Donald Trump narrowly carried in 2020 and which Biden is hoping to flip.Here are the key races and most important things to watch for on Tuesday:House races that will be pivotal to the majorityThe outcomes of several House primaries Tuesday will shape just how competitive these key races will be in the general election.Most of them are in California, where candidates from all parties run on the same primary ballot, with the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advancing to November.The top-two primary system offers potential risks and opportunities for both parties, and nowhere is that clearer than in California’s 22nd Congressional District. GOP Rep. David Valadao, a perennial Democratic target in a Central Valley district that would have backed Biden by 13 points, is facing competition from both sides Tuesday – two Democrats and one other Republican are also on the ballot. Because it’s a four-way race, both national parties have spent money trying to make sure their preferred candidates don’t get locked out of the November election. It’s a familiar challenge. In 2022, Valadao nearly failed to make the top two, edging out Republican Chris Mathys (who’s running again this year) by about 2 points. Valadao, one of two House Republicans who returned to Congress after voting to impeach Trump in 2021, then went on to defeat Democrat Rudy Salas in the November general election. Salas is running again this year and is the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s preferred candidate against state Sen. Melissa Hurtado. While Hurtado hasn’t raised significant money, her presence on the ballot could still splinter Democratic votes. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates this race Tilt Republican.The 45th District, held by GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, offers Democratic voters a choice between multiple candidates in this Orange County seat. Garden Grove Council Member Kim Nguyen-Penaloza has the backing of BOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as a handful of members of the California congressional delegation. Army veteran Derek Tran has his own congressional endorsements, as well as the support of VoteVets, which works to elect progressive veterans to Congress, and the political arm of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition. Biden would have won this district by 6 points. Inside Elections rates the race Lean Republican.The 47th District is open because Democratic Rep. Katie Porter is running for Senate. Republicans hope former state Assemblyman Scott Baugh, who lost to Porter in 2022, will have a better shot at flipping this Orange County seat without challenging an incumbent. Tuesday will likely determine whom he’ll face – and how much the millions spent in negative advertising has shaped the Democratic primary. An outside group affiliated with AIPAC, called United Democracy Project, has been spending big to attack Porter’s endorsed successor, state Sen. Dave Min, over a DUI incident last year. (Min has apologized for driving under the influence.) Democratic attorney Joanna Weiss has the support of EMILY’s List, whose super PAC arm has boosted her on air. National Democrats haven’t gotten involved in this race other than to highlight what they see as Baugh’s weaknesses. Biden would have won the district by 11 points, and Inside Elections rates the race Tilt Democratic.The general election matchups appear set in two key California swing seats. In the 13th District in the Central Valley, a rematch of 2022 looms with GOP Rep. John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray the only names on the ballot Tuesday. The DCCC has named Gray to its Red to Blue list for competitive challengers. Duarte defeated Gray by just 564 votes in 2022. Biden won the seat by 11 points and Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.And in the 27th District, in the Los Angeles area, GOP Rep. Mike Garcia and Democrat George Whitesides, the former CEO of Virgin Galactic who’s also on Red to Blue, are heavily favored to make it out of Tuesday’s primary. Garcia has been an elusive Democratic target, but this would be the first time since a May 2020 special election that first sent him to Congress that Garcia will be facing a different opponent. Biden would have won the seat by 12 points, and Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.Meanwhile, Democrats are targeting Republicans Young Kim in t﻿he 40th District, a race Inside Elections rates Likely Republican, and Ken Calvert in the nearby 41st District, a contest rated Leans Republican. The presidential margins in both Southern California seats are tight – Biden would have carried Kim’s seat by just 2 points while Calvert’s district would have backed Trump by 1 point. Republicans are targeting Democrats Josh Harder in the 9th District, which Inside Elections rates Solid Democratic, and Mike Levin in the 49th District, which is rated Likely Democratic. Republicans are excited about potential Levin opponent Margarita Wilkinson because she’s the kind of diverse candidate the party has seen recent success with.While California has the largest number of noteworthy House primaries on Tuesday, there are also contests in Texas and North Carolina for seats likely to be competitive in the fall. The general election matchups in a pair of South Texas seats – the 15th District, held by GOP Rep. Monica De La Cruz, and the 34th District, held by Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez – look like they’re going to be rematches from 2022.And in North Carolina, where redistricting has scrambled this year’s map, the 1st District, held by freshman Democrat Don Davis, is now the state’s only competitive seat. The Republican race to take on Davis illustrates the split within the party. The chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus is backing Sandy Smith, who has twice lost earlier iterations of this rural northeastern North Carolina district. Smith’s ads tout that she believes Trump won the 2020 election and she tweeted about marching to the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Congressional Leadership Fund – the super PAC tied to House GOP leadership – has stepped in for retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout.House primaries that will likely determine the next member of CongressMany of the primaries for open seats on Tuesday are in seats that are safe for one party or the other. That means the winner of those contests – or the eventual runoffs – will very likely be coming to Congress next year.Several of the notable ones include California’s deep-red 20th District, where voters will be picking a successor to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Tuesday’s primary will decide the top-two candidates for November’s election, but there’s also a special election primary later this month to fill the remainder of McCarthy’s term through January 25. State Assemblyman Vince Fong, who has the backing of both McCarthy and Trump, is running in both races.Another notable open safe GOP seat is North Carolina’s new 8th District, where pastor Mark Harris is making his fourth run for Congress after a failed Senate bid in 2014, a failed House bid in 2016 and a House campaign in 2018 that made national headlines. Harris was the apparent winner of that contest by 905 votes. But allegations of absentee ballot tampering, related to a consultant who worked for Harris’ campaign, stopped the state Board of Elections from certifying the result. Harris later called for a new election. But he didn’t run in the do-over election, which was won by Republican Dan Bishop. Bishop is now running for state attorney general.In making his self-described comeback bid, Harris is spinning a Trump-like narrative. “In 2020, Democrats stole the election from President Trump. The year before, they did it to me,” he said in his announcement video.State Rep. John Bradford, who had loaned his campaign more than $1 million by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on February 14, sparred with Harris over the ballot scandal in a recent debate. But Harris and Bradford are just two of six Republicans on the ballot here, and, under North Carolina law, an outright win requires at least 30% of the primary vote. Otherwise, the second-place finisher can request a runoff.The first member-on-member House primaryTwo Alabama Republicans elected in 2020 are facing off in the first member-versus-member primary of the cycle. In response to a court decision ordering the state to create a second majority-Black district “or something quite close to it,” the 2nd District – held by GOP Rep. Barry Moore – was redrawn to increase its Black population. Moore is now running in the new 1st District, but so is Republican Jerry Carl, who represents the current version of the 1st District.The outcome of this race could help shape the tenor of the House GOP conference. Moore, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, has been campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and touts his opposition to funding for Ukraine. Carl has donations that signal more establishment support – from the likes of the Chamber of Commerce and GOP donor Paul Singer. Both are pitching themselves as Trump conservatives in a new district that the former president would have won by 50 points.House incumbents facing primariesSeveral incumbents in safe seats are facing threats from within their own parties on Tuesday – and while those internecine contests might not necessarily affect partisan control, they can reveal a lot about where the base stands.In Texas’ 23rd District, for example, GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales is facing a handful of primary challengers after he was censured by the state party last year “for lack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities.” Candidates must surpass 50% of the primary vote to avoid a runoff, so any splintering of the GOP vote could hamper Gonzales.Elsewhere in Texas, Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee faces a competitive challenge from former Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards. The congresswoman, who lost a runoff for Houston mayor election in December and then decided to run for reelection, had raised just $252,000 by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on February 14, while Edwards had raised nearly $1.5 million. With a third Democrat in the race, the primary could head to a runoff.California Senate primaryThe jockeying for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat began well before she died. And it’s only intensified since Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to succeed Feinstein and Butler decided not to run for the full term. Tuesday’s primary will determine which two candidates will advance to November in an election that has seen more ad spending, excluding future reservations, than any other nonpresidential federal contest so far.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who led Trump’s first impeachment prosecution, has dominated the airwaves as he tries to cast the race as a two-way contest between himself and former Los Angeles Dodgers star Steve Garvey, who’s running as a Republican. Schiff’s ads argue that Garvey poses a threat to Democratic control of the Senate and that the congressman is the one to stop him.Rep. Katie Porter, who came to Congress in the 2018 blue wave, is attacking that strategy in her own ads that tout her refusal of corporate PAC money and showcase her signature whiteboards. Rep. Barbara Lee, who was the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 authorization for use of military force after 9/11, has the backing of an outside group called She Speaks for Me. Lee supporters have touted the fact that she would bring diversity to the Senate. Butler – who won’t be returning next year – is currently the only Black woman serving in the chamber.Texas Democratic Senate primaryUS Rep. Colin Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat in 2018, appears well-positioned financially to win the Democratic nod to take on Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who only faces token opposition in his primary. Allred ended the pre-primary reporting period on February 14 with more than $8 million the bank. He will need to clear 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff.Allred’s main competition appears to be state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde. But Gutierrez hasn’t been able to assemble anywhere near the money or endorsements the congressman has.North Carolina gubernatorial primariesBoth parties are picking their nominees Tuesday in one of only two states with competitive gubernatorial races in 2024 (New Hampshire is the other). On the GOP side, the front-runner is the Trump-backed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. He’s a controversial figure whose past hard-line stances on abortion Democrats may try to use against him – and against Republicans up and down the ticket.On the Democratic side, state Attorney General Josh Stein is the leading contender. Their likely matchup will overlap with the focus from the presidential candidates on this battleground state."}
{"title": "", "text": "Unscathed by the PETA protesters who disrupted her show, Victoria Beckham closed out the fifth day of Paris Fashion Week at the lavish Salomon de Rothschild Hotel on Friday night.Her appearance before a front row filled with her family, designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, Anna Wintour and former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld — on crutches, as she reportedly injured her foot a few weeks earlier while working out — marked just the latest show by a British designer in Paris. The destination is proving to be something of a home-from-home for the fashion pack from across the Channel.At Carven, Louise Trotter, former creative director for Lacoste, presented her first collection for the French heritage house. Irish-born, Central-Saint Martins-trained Seán McGirr showed his debut for Alexander McQueen, succeeding Sarah Burton. And London-based Ibrahim Kamara, editor-in-chief of “Dazed & Confused” magazine, also showcased his creations as the head of Off-White after a break following founder Virgil Abloh’s death.Over at Nina Ricci, Anglo-American designer Harris Reed — who had shown his personal line in London earlier in the season — presented a collection that combined “a fine-art approach with Paris’s classical way of doing things,” he told CNN, adding that he hoped to “push the envelope (…) on inclusive bodies and sexualities… I’ve never been someone who just wanted to make beautiful clothes.”Paris Fashion Week has always centered designers from around the world, offering a creative vision of French chic from an outsider perspective, from German designer Karl Lagerfeld to Japanese creatives including Yohji Yamamoto.But perhaps its most historical cultural dialogue is with Great Britain. In the 19th century, English couturier Charles Worth chose Paris to establish his approach to luxury, and the system of custom-made clothing defining fashion as we know of it today, earning him the nickname of “father of haute couture.”Almost a century later, in the 1990s, a long list of British designers brought a subversive flair to Paris’ fashion scene: Stella McCartney was appointed creative director of Chloé in 1997, succeeding Lagerfeld; John Galliano was head of Dior from 1996 to 2011, the same year Alexander McQueen took over at Givenchy; while Phoebe Philo was made creative director of Chloé in 2001. A few years later, Kim Jones joined Louis Vuitton in 2011 and Dior Men in 2018. (British fashion houses including Vivienne Westwood and Paul Smith also relocated to Paris at different stages of their careers.)Today, in a post-Brexit and post-Covid world, keeping this creative dialogue up has become more challenging. Funding and exporting has become more complex due to revised import regulations, and working with stockists and ateliers throughout Europe is also more difficult, as Serge Carreira from the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode explained.“London is a scene of revelations, where one puts down creative (roots), whereas Paris is a destination once the brand is established, to reach a more global audience,” Carreira told CNN. “This dynamic isn’t new but Paris as a next step in a British designer’s career might feel like a more amplified move.”Yet if the amount of shows put on in London continue shrinking, and if the opposite continues happening at Paris Fashion Week (this last edition featured over 100 shows during a sprawling nine-day event), London might end up feeding the cultural fashion dialogue in different ways.As Melody Thomas, professor in fashion criticism at Parsons Paris and author of “La Mode est Politique” told CNN, “another form of avant-garde is emerging, with off-calendar British brands such as Corteiz pointing, perhaps, to a generation that doesn’t want dream of big runways, but prefers creative drops, collaborations, capsules… Questioning the fashion system at large.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "A group of former Twitter executives sued Elon Musk on Monday in a bid to recover more than $128 million in severance that they allege Musk has not paid since he acquired the company, now called X, more than a year ago.The executives include former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, former CFO Ned Segal, former Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde and former General Counsel Sean Edgett — all of whom were fired within hours after Musk took control of Twitter.The lawsuit alleges that Musk declined to make the severance payments as a form of “revenge” against the executives after he was forced to go through with the $44 billion acquisition deal, wh﻿ich he had spent months trying to get out of.“Because Musk decided he didn’t want to pay Plaintiffs’ severance benefits, he simply fired them without reason, then made up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision,” the complaint, filed Monday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, states. “He claimed in his termination letters that each Plaintiff committed ‘gross negligence’ and ‘willful misconduct’ without citing a single fact in support of this claim.”X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Monday’s lawsuit is just the latest legal action brought by former Twitter employees related to Musk’s acquisition. One lawsuit brought by a former Twitter human resources leader in July, seeking class action status, seeks an order for Musk and the company to pay additional severance benefits allegedly owed to former employees in an amount no less than $500 million. The company has also been accused of failing to pay annual bonuses to employees laid off after Musk’s takeover.Agrawal, Gadde and Segal also previously sued Musk to recover more than $1 million in legal fees they said they were owed; the company was ordered to pay the fees in a Delaware Chancery Court ruling last year.Musk and X have also faced lawsuits from vendors, landlords and business partners who claim the company has failed to pay what they are owed.“Musk’s refusal to pay Plaintiffs is part of a larger pattern and practice of failing to comply with his payment obligations,” the former executives claimed in Monday’s lawsuit.Evidence from a biographyA key focus of Monday’s lawsuit is an anecdote reported in the Musk biography published by journalist Walter Isaacson last year.The complaint cites the anecdote as evidence Musk intentionally sought to “cheat” the former executives out of what they were contractually owed, quoting the biography’s account of the moments leading up to Musk closing the Twitter acquisition in October of 2022.In the narrative, Musk reportedly claimed that closing the deal on Thursday, October 27 — a day before the scheduled close — and firing Agrawal and the other executives immediately would prevent them from resigning and claiming their severance benefits, saving the company an estimated $200 million.Closing the deal so quickly forced Agrawal to scramble to send his own letter of resignation, but it was too late, according to the account; Agrawal had already been fired and his access to email revoked.Musk’s apparent gambit to head off the severance obligations violated federal labor laws, the lawsuit alleges, because the reasons Musk cited for firing Agrawal and others do not stand up to scrutiny.“’Cause’ under the severance plans is limited to extremely narrow circumstances, such as being convicted of a felony or committing ‘gross negligence’ or ‘willful misconduct,’” the lawsuit said. “’Cause’ is not ‘Board-approved business decisions that Musk dislikes’ from the time before he owned the company.”According to the complaint, Musk’s termination letters to some of the executives explained that the source of their misconduct was a failure to cooperate with a government or internal investigation of Twitter, but the letters did not substantiate those allegations.The former executives claim they spent months trying to obtain the severance payments from X prior to filing the lawsuit but allege that the company and its leaders “have withheld documents and taken other actions designed to inhibit Plaintiffs’ presentation of their claims.”In addition to the severance payments themselves, the lawsuit also seeks a court order forcing Musk to make interest payments on the allegedly unpaid amounts, as well as a penalty for Musk’s alleged failure to send the executives legally required plan documents associated with their benefits."}
{"title": "", "text": "Police are searching for three suspects who they say pulled up to a King City, California, house party and opened fire Sunday evening, killing at least four people and injuring three others.Three men died at the scene and a woman who was shot was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to King City Police Chief James Hunt.Three other people injured by gunshots were taken to a hospital for treatment, and their conditions were not released.The California house party adds to a troubling list of ordinary gatherings disrupted by gun violence in America this weekend:The incident in California also extends the list of at least 68 mass shootings in the country so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.Police say that the shooting occurred when a vehicle pulled up to the residence in King City, located about 62 miles southeast of Monterey.Three masked men exited and began shooting at the people attending the party in the front yard, before getting back into the car and fleeing the scene, according to police."}
{"title": "", "text": "Firefighters racing to wrangle the largest blaze in Texas history could get their best chance in days to contain the flames in the wake of a cold front Monday. Hot air and raging winds have fueled the infernos in recent days, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and inflicting harrowing injuries upon ranchers’ livestock.The front arrived Monday morning, bringing an influx of cooler conditions. Breezy winds will taper off early in the afternoon and calmer air will last through Tuesday, giving firefighters a reprieve from the critical fire risk conditions that have aided the wildfires’ explosive spread over the Texas Panhandle.Since igniting last Monday, the ravenous Smokehouse Creek Fire has incinerated more than 1 million acres of the Texas Panhandle and is still only 15% contained. The fire has killed at least two people and crossed into Oklahoma, where more than 31,000 acres have been burned.Five fires tearing across the Panhandle have burned as many as 500 homes and businesses, state officials said. A new blaze – the Roughneck Fire – ignited in Hutchinson County on Sunday and prompted evacuations there as crews raced to get resources to the area.First responders hoped that after the weekend’s severe fire risk, improved conditions in the coming days would allow them to inch closer to containing the infernos, Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Jason Nedlo told CNN on Saturday.But the blazes have so far been thriving on a bounty of fuel, including blankets of grass grown after higher-than-average rainfall this winter.“There’s a lot of fuel on the ground,” Nedlo said. “When you add high winds and low humidity to high fuel load levels, that’s when you get the conditions that are ripe for large, fast-burning wildfires.”Latest developments• New fire prompts evacuations: The Roughneck Fire began burning Sunday and has grown to cover about 300 acres of Hutchinson County, which is also the origin site of the Smokehouse Creek Fire. The blaze prompted an evacuation order in the town of Sanford, which began to be lifted later that evening, county officials said. The Texas A&M Forest Service said that the fire’s forward progression had been halted and it was 50% contained as of Monday afternoon.• Several other fires still burning: The Windy Deuce Fire in Moore County has burned through 144,000 acres and is 55% contained as of Sunday night, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. The Grape Vine Creek Fire in Gray County has torched nearly 35,000 acres and is 60% contained. The Magenta Fire in Oldham County has destroyed 3,297 acres and is 85% contained.• Significant progress in containing Oklahoma fire: “The Smokehouse Creek Fire perimeter looks good and will be turned back over to local departments tomorrow,” Oklahoma Forestry Services spokesperson Keith Merckx said Sunday. “The fire will be 75% contained by the end of shift today.” The fire has scorched more than 31,500 acres of Oklahoma near its border with Texas.• Lawsuit alleges fallen power pole caused fire: A woman whose home was destroyed by the Smokehouse Creek Fire is suing Xcel Energy, its subsidiary and a contractor, claiming that an improperly maintained power pole fell and started the fire. The Texas A&M Forest Service is investigating the fire, and has not announced a cause.• At least two people are dead: Truck driver Cindy Owen was working about 50 miles north of Pampa, Texas, on Tuesday when the Smokehouse Creek Fire overcame her, her sister-in-law told CNN. She left her truck and tried running for safety but received fatal burns over almost her entire body, said Jennifer Mitchell, the wife of Owen’s brother. In nearby Hutchinson County, 83-year-old Joyce Blankenship was found dead, her family said. “The house was gone,” her grandson Nathan Blankenship said. “There was no way she could’ve gotten out.”• Devastating loss of beef cattle crushes local ranchers: As the fires rip through scores of ranches and acres of farmland, officials report thousands of cattle have been killed and ranchers have been forced to put down many others that have sustained gruesome and painful burns to their hooves, udders and fur. Ranchers and local authorities told CNN that beef prices likely won’t be affected, but the fire may leave lasting economic scars for ranchers.• How you can help: GoFundMe has launched a platform for verified fundraisers benefiting Texans affected by wildfires, including dozens of families who have lost entire homes, belongings or livestock. The Texas Farm Bureau has established a fund to aid farmers and ranchers. CNN’s Impact Your World has also identified several charities assisting wildfire victims.‘Nothing left but ashes on the ground’Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state has witnessed damage wrought by tornadoes or hurricanes, but the wildfires have brought unprecedented destruction and “utter devastation” for many Panhandle residents.“Frequently when you see the aftermath of (hurricane or tornado) damage, there is some semblance of a structure that is still there,” Abbott said Friday. “When you look at the damages that are here, it’s just gone. Completely gone. Nothing left but ashes on the ground.”Though officials estimate between 400 to 500 structures have been destroyed, the number could increase as damage assessments continue, Abbot said. ﻿Tyler McCain and his family are among those who frantically evacuated their homes on Tuesday – only to return to find their life’s possessions had been incinerated. He and his wife were able to pack up their three daughters and leave their home in Fritch, Texas in time, but McCain was tortured with doubt over whether their home would be spared.“Until I saw my house, it wasn’t real,” McCain said. The home – razed to the ground – was unrecognizable.Susan and Ronnie Johnson also fought desperately to save their five-bedroom ranch near Fritch, only to watch two decades of their lives go up in flames.“You don’t ever want to believe it’ll be your house that burns,” Ronnie told CNN.Now all that’s left is a pile of charred debris – a dining table, pieces of white fine china, blue and red Dutch ovens, chairs and a smoker were scattered across a devastated scene of dust, rubble and fallen trees.The loss has been “numbing,” Susan said, but she still holds on to the beloved memories she and her family of nine made in the home.“We’ll rebuild and start again,” Ronnie said."}
{"title": "", "text": "As former President Donald Trump gears up for a costly general election campaign with President Joe Biden and faces staggering legal expenses of his own, his campaign is actively working to keep costs in check.Senior adviser Susie Wiles has privately joked that the campaign staff call her a “miser” — and she’s not entirely wrong.After a recent event, one Trump staffer was discussing the Uber he took home before quickly clarifying to the group that it was an UberX, and the cheapest available option. “Susie would kill me if she thought I spent more than I had to,” the person noted, implying that Wiles paid such close attention to the line items that she would notice a lower-level staffer’s car choice – a potentially marginal cost difference.Senior adviser Chris LaCivita, meanwhile, has privately grumbled that the former president’s signature large rallies are too expensive. He has encouraged the team to make a concerted effort to host his events at smaller, less costly venues, according to conversations with multiple Trump advisers. He has also said publicly that the former president has stopped hosting as many rallies due to the enormous cost.“Any organization that is concerned, or at least puts that level of concern, at the forefront, you’re gonna get better bids for business,” LaCivita told CNN about the campaign’s attempt to cut costs across the board. “If you’re not spending the majority of your money on touching voters, and pushing your candidate, then you’re not running a good campaign.”One of the driving forces for why the Trump campaign has been so diligent about cost-cutting, the advisers say, is because they fear a repeat of the former president’s 2020 general election financial struggles, when the campaign burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of months that left Trump’s team facing an alarming cash crunch weeks before the November 2020 election.In addition to reining in spending on rallies and transportation, the campaign is also keeping a tight leash on the money being spent on hotels, meals and other everyday expenses typically associated with a large political operation, the advisers say. Even the furniture found in Trump’s state headquarters across the country has been meticulously chosen so as not to accrue superfluous costs, one senior adviser noted.“Anyone that’s ever worked on a campaign knows that, at the headquarters, the furniture should be functional, and that’s it. Mismatched and functional is the decor of the Trump campaigns’ offices,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “We don’t have mahogany desks, and if we do, they’re 200 years old and they’re falling apart.”The senior Trump adviser noted that the 2020 campaign “went broke.”“From our standpoint, we look at everything through that prism,” the adviser said. “The leadership of the campaign is intent on ensuring that that does not happen in this campaign, because that is the greatest sin that can be committed in politics.”The more frugal approach to Trump’s 2024 campaign, which has been a point of pride — and, on occasion, frustration for the former president’s team — may also now be a necessity.Trump has been hit with more than a half a billion dollars in legal penalties in recent weeks. In January, the former president was ordered to pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million dollars in her civil defamation case. Shortly after that, a New York judge ordered the former president to pay a $355 million judgment – which has since ballooned to $454 million, counting interest – following a civil fraud trial.And those figures don’t even include his mounting legal bills as he faces 91 charges in four criminal indictments. One trial, his New York criminal case involving hush money payments, is slated to begin in Manhattan on March 25.Trump himself has also personally begun paying for some of his legal expenses, two senior Trump advisers told CNN — a stark departure from someone who has long loathed paying his legal bills and has a history of stiffing lawyers. One senior adviser told CNN Trump has spent at least six figures of his own money to cover the costs of his legal expenses.In January alone, Trump’s leadership PAC paid out more than $2.9 million to law firms and racked up an additional $1.9 million in unpaid legal bills, according to a recent filing with federal regulators.The leadership fund, Save America PAC, has been the main vehicle underwriting astronomical legal bills for both the former president and some of his allies — spending more than $50 million in 2023, totaling nearly 85% of its spending. The PAC is now running low on money, ending January with a little more than $6 million in available funds.The financial troubles of Save America, which was seeded with money Trump raised shortly after the 2020 election amid his false claims of election fraud, became apparent last year when Trump began to claw back money that Save America had donated to his super PAC, Make America Great Again, Inc., which was set up to support Trump’s current White House bid.So far, Save America has recovered more than $47 million from the super PAC, and 10% of every dollar Trump’s political operation raises is funneled away from his campaign and into Save America.Financial headwindsWith resounding early state wins, Trump appears to be on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination — months before the party’s July nominating convention. A recent memo circulated by Trump’s senior advisers predicted that the former president is just weeks away from securing enough delegates to declare him the presumptive nominee — a turning point in which he’ll need the infrastructure of the national GOP, and the funding that accompanies it — to launch his general election campaign.However, recent filings show that Trump’s political operation is trailing the Biden campaign significantly in the money game, entering February with roughly $30 million in cash reserves compared to nearly $56 million in Biden’s equivalent account.The Democratic National Committee has similarly trounced the Republican National Committee — ending January with $24.1 million in its coffers compared to the RNC’s $8.7 million.Trump’s strapped financial reality has forced the Trump campaign to get creative in finding new cash avenues to pull from — as well as different ways to preserve resources — to continue funding both Trump’s campaign and his legal battles, according to conversations with Trump’s advisers and people close to the former president.The campaign plans to continue relying on Save America for the bulk of his legal expenses, though they also privately acknowledge the financial strain it has faced is a result of the mounting legal bills that are continuing to pile up, the sources said.Some of the legal bills originally paid for by Save America PAC have also been picked up by the Patriot Legal Defense fund, which was set up in 2023 to help cover the costs of legal fees and lawyers for some of Trump’s co-defendants and allies who are facing charges linked to the former president. This fund, which reported raising $1.5 million through the end of last year, will continue to be utilized, Trump’s advisers say.One avenue, however, that his advisers insist is not on the table — at least for now — is asking the RNC to step up and help shoulder the cost.“There is no expectation of the RNC helping and we have no plans to ask them to divert funds for his legal bills,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN.That stance has come as a surprise to some Trump allies and former RNC members, who had expected the committee to revert to its process of helping pay the former president’s legal bills when he became the party’s nominee, a practice they began implementing while he was in office and continued until he announced his 2024 bid. It’s especially surprising, they argue, given Trump’s endorsed picks to run the RNC are expected to succeed in their efforts of taking over the committee’s leadership.Last month, Trump officially threw his support behind North Carolina Party Chairman Michael Whatley to serve as the RNC’s new chair, and also endorsed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to serve as co-chair.LaCivita has also been tapped to serve as the RNC chief operating officer, but is expected to continue in his current role as co-campaign manager for the former president.Trump’s advisers argue the decision not to rely on the RNC for help covering the former president’s legal costs is two-fold, the most pressing being the committee’s current financial straits.“How are they going to help with his legal fees? With what money?” a Trump adviser told CNN. The RNC entered 2024 with just $8 million in the bank, the lowest figure in a decade. Those fundraising struggles, in part, led Trump to call for new leadership at the committee.Trump’s advisers also argue they would rather use the RNC as a core driver of his general election campaign, preserving its donations to bolster both Trump and the broader infrastructure of the national Republican party.However, given the strain on resources Trump’s political operation is currently facing due to his staggering legal fees and penalties, their aversion to tapping into the RNC’s reserves may be short-lived.One RNC member recently authored a resolution that seeks to ban the RNC from paying Trump’s legal bills. The committee’s 168 members would have to take up the resolution, with some members saying they believed it was unlikely to pass. Current and former RNC members, meanwhile, insist that their financial problems will improve once Trump becomes the presumptive GOP nominee and they can once again begin using his name and likeness to boost fundraising."}

The Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” based on an Australian show with the same name, is arguably the most visible program where people can see what it’s like for real autistic adults to navigate the challenges of life and love.The show follows a group of adults with autism as they navigate the dating world, aided by a relationship coach and the input of their loved ones. Despite its generally warm reception, the show has also received criticism from within adult autism communities. Some see it as a kind, compassionate representation of the social challenges people with autism face. Others see any good faith representation as a step in the right direction, even if it’s incomplete.“‘Love on the Spectrum’ is kind, but unrepresentative,” reads a review of the first season posted on Spectrum, an autism news and research publication.In online forums, some adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have taken issue with production details: A violin plucks a childlike motif when people describe their special interests and hobbies. Descriptions from family and friends, though well meaning, sometimes carry the tone of one speaking about a child rather than a grown adult. Throughout their dating journey, advice the cast receives sometimes encourages a “normalcy” that is, frankly, unnatural to many people with autism.“While it’s nice to see representation, some of the ways they portray people’s behaviors and their likes and dislikes feels like they’re playing into stereotypes of autistic people as being weird or childlike when they’re not,” Krista Ferguson, a 42-year-old with ASD and a member of Reddit’s 342,000-member autism subreddit, told CNN.Rather than being a criticism of the show in particular, the reactions to “Love on the Spectrum” speak to deeper nuances within the autism community that often go unnoticed. They also reveal gaps in the way allistic (non-autistic) people understand the autistic mind; that “normal” is sometimes neither possible nor desired, and that love — and acceptance, and success — are not things to be gained at the expense of suppressing one’s true self.What ‘Love on the Spectrum’ looks likeCast members on “Love on the Spectrum” make it clear they want to find someone who loves them for them.For some, that means a partner who will participate in their special interests, whether it’s medieval history or a love of cosplay. One could practically hear swoons when animal lover Abbey Romeo, a Season 1 favorite who continued her dating journey in Season 2, joined her boyfriend David Isaacmen on a trip to Africa — an adventure he had planned especially for her. For others, it means a partner who supports specific sensitivities or displays patience and understanding in challenging situations.It’s not uncommon to see very matter-of-fact language as cast members clarify the particulars of their romantic expectations. “I hope you don’t think me blunt, but I kind of like you, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to hold hands,” cast member Connor Tomlinson tells one of his partners during a speed date. Another cast member suggests to her date that they have a round of kissing practice on cupcakes before trying the real thing.Obviously, not every date works out, and “Love on the Spectrum” shows daters weighing their fears of being alone with their fears of settling for someone who’s not quite right. When cast member Steve Spitz started to get close to a woman he wasn’t sure about, he ended up cutting ties rather than ignoring discomfort in the name of love.“I learned that finding love isn’t an easy process,” Spitz told Netflix after Season 2 was released. “There’s so much more to finding love than just having similar interests. You have to be compatible, trusting, and fair to the other person.”Why it’s so hard to get autistic representation rightAutism among adults is often hard to understand due to a lack of research and public awareness. The first US study of adults with autism wasn’t published until 2020. Despite its conclusion that an estimated 5.5 million US adults live with ASD, most high-profile autism research and advocacy revolves around children with autism and their parents. Fearing stigma and discrimination, many adults with autism keep their condition a secret. Even more adults may live with autism and not know it, or avoid a diagnosis.When autism is visible, whether it’s in our own social circles or on a TV show, the individual experience is never representative of the whole.“When we’re talking about a spectrum, there’s an infinite number of ways a person can be autistic, so there are also endless possibilities for how a person can be seen or portrayed,” said André Felipe de Medeiros, a neurodivergent podcaster and journalist from São Paulo, Brazil.In his limited viewing of “Love on the Spectrum,” Medeiros said he found a “good mix of people presenting different traits that can be found on the spectrum.” These traits can include different tolerances to social situations or stimuli, varied speech patterns and conversational habits, the presence of verbal or physical “stimming,” (self-regulating with repetitive motions or vocalizations) physical differences and the need for some kind of supportive care.He also recommended the scripted shows “Everything’s Gonna Be Okay” and “Atypical” as two examples where autism representation hit the mark.“On both shows, different characters on the spectrum had different traits, giving viewers a broader picture of what autism can be,” he told CNN.“Good autism representation comes from being open to understanding that the spectrum is incredibly vast and being honest about how the way an autistic person or character is being represented is only one of infinite possibilities.”Autism is more than a social challengeOn “Love on the Spectrum,” the focus for participants is mostly on social interactions — the infinite web of cues and clues that make dating hard for anyone, let alone people with differently-wired brains. That’s definitely part of it, but limiting the challenges of ASD to some double-black-diamond social gauntlet ignores larger experiences of autism.“Autism is so much more than social communication,” said Dr. Megan Anna Neff, a clinical psychologist and author of “Self-Care for Autistic People.” “We have very sensitive nervous systems. Part of that is how we take in sensory information and stressors, and there are a lot of things we do to accommodate that.”Neff says common “autistic” traits like adhering to routines and disliking unexpected change may manifest in a social way, but are really speaking to something different.“All of these things that are so-called symptoms of autism are really ways that we are adapting to our nervous system to be able to move through the world,” she said.Having to constantly regulate in a way that most people don’t can lead to other behaviors that are considered to be outside of the social norm, like seeking long periods of time alone. While some people might find this concerning, Neff said for many people with autism, it is a necessary form of self-care.The problem with trying for ‘normalcy’One of the most frustrating things for autistic adults is the pressure to act “normal” — a pressure that, for better or worse, is reflected in shows like “Love on the Spectrum.” On the show, dating coaches gently instruct participants how to act in socially typical ways. That often means suppressing natural autistic tendencies like stimming and editing oneself in conversations to avoid, say, speaking too forcefully or talking at length about a special interest.The fact is, many people with autism already engage in some form of self-censorship. It’s called “masking,” and while it is a common way for autistic adults to fit into social situations, it’s also extremely draining and isolating.“When we mask, we suppress the urge to communicate authentically, or to soothe our bodies in ways that might look different to others,” said Neff. “So perhaps other people might feel more connected to me when I mask, but I’m going to feel less connected to them. It can facilitate small talk, but it doesn’t actually forge authentic connection.”Sometimes, Neff said, autistic people find masking necessary — but it’s also a privilege that many on the spectrum simply cannot access.That diversity of ability and comfort with suppressing natural behaviors makes media representation even more complicated. Some critics of shows like “Love on the Spectrum” say it doesn’t acknowledge a wide array of ASD experiences, which can include physical, verbal and intellectual differences. While Neff says she’d like to see more diversity of race, gender and sexuality in such programs, she says the experiences that do get portrayed are just as valid.“I think there’s some division happening in the autistic advocacy space among those who mask and those who don’t. There’s a temptation to see a show and be like, well, that doesn’t show me,” she said.“But for those who present in a more stereotypical way, who do mask and want to fit in, they might feel seen. So I think it’s always important to show the many ways we present. We need a kaleidoscope of representation.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "“Dune: Part Two” raked in $82.5 million at the domestic box office on during its opening weekend, narrowly surpassing the opening weekend of the 2023 blockbuster film “Oppenheimer.”The two films came from different studios — “Dune: Part Two” is a Warner Bros. Pictures movie and shares the same parent company as CNN, while Universal Pictures distributed ‘Oppenheimer.’In updated box office receipts released Monday, “Dune: Part Two,” directed by Denis Villeneuve, surpassed the milestone set last summer by the historical epic that was catapulted to success in theaters amid the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, brought in $82.4 million in its opening weekend.“Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan inhabit that rarefied air of marquee filmmakers and both ‘Dune: Part Two’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ inspired audiences to head out to the multiplex on their opening weekends to the tune of over $80M in domestic receipts,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, said.The film is a much-anticipated sequel to one of the most popular science fiction adaptions in recent years, and helped revive a sleepy box office. Similarly, “Oppenheimer” was one half of the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon last summer, which took social media and the movie theater industry by storm.“This is just what the box office needed and much higher than any of us could predict,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. Pictures, which distributed the movie. “That’s especially true given that it’s a sci-fi movie, which is a genre that is a hard nut to crack. And we grossed $178.5 million worldwide, which is quite a standup.”The sequel doubled the domestic opening of the first “Dune” installment, which opened with $41 million when it was simultaneously released in theaters and on the streaming service HBO Max in October 2021. The film is also Villeneuve’s highest grossing movie."}
{"title": "", "text": "A former school bus driver in Utah faces both federal and state arson charges for allegedly lighting his school bus on fire in two separate incidents, including at least once with students onboard.Michael Austin Ford, 58, of West Valley City, was indicted by a federal grand jury last month on two charges of arson of a vehicle of an organization receiving federal funds, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah. He has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, according to the court docket.One incident stems from February 2022 when the US Attorney’s office alleges he set a Granite School District bus on fire with 42 children inside and while driving in traffic. He used an ignition device to start the fire and continued to drive the bus while smoke blew past his face toward where the children sat in the back, according to the US Attorney’s Office, which said the incident was captured on video.Over a year later, in April 2023, he again set a school bus on fire and continued driving in traffic as the smoke billowed past him, according to the office, which said this incident was also captured on video. A detention memo filed by prosecutors says video also shows him attempting to tamper with the surveillance system and covering up the camera above the driver’s seat.Ford was arrested days later in April 2023 by Granite School Police and questioned about the fire but was released, according to the prosecutor’s office.While the investigation was ongoing, his home and personal vehicle were severely damaged by fire in October 2023, the second time his home had serious fire damage, and he acknowledged two other personal vehicle fires, according to the memo. Further, Ford acknowledged to investigators his involvement in three other bus fires in which he was driving, dating back to around 2001 or 2002, 2016 and 2017, according to the memo.Ford was arrested again on felony state charges in October 2023, according to a state docket report. Ford has been ordered detained ahead of his federal trial, set for April 29 in Salt Lake City, the prosecutor’s office said.CNN has reached out to his federal public defender Benjamin Hamilton for comment.Suspect was district bus driver for 25 yearsThe Granite School District said in a statement Ford was employed as a bus driver in part-time and full-time positions from 1998 until he was terminated in June 2023. “He was hired after passing appropriate background checks as required by law,” the district said.The district said it “had suspicions” about the February 2022 fire and so officials worked with law enforcement and “installed additional camera systems on his bus.” After the April 2023 fire, the district said it obtained footage and evidence that indicated he was responsible for tampering with the bus and then placed him on leave.In addition, Ford has been charged in state court with 10 counts of aggravated arson and a count each of aggravated child abuse, arson, obstruction of justice and misdemeanor property damage for the two bus fires, according to Utah district court filings.His attorney in his state case, Jason Groth, did not respond to CNN’s call and email requesting comment.According to a declaration of probable cause, onboard video surveillance of the February 2022 fire shows smoke coming from under the bus dashboard as Ford drove. Students reported smelling smoke, according to the declaration, which says they covered their faces and coughed. Finally, Ford stopped the bus, evacuated the students and put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, according to the declaration. One minor was treated for smoke inhalation.In the bus fire on April 7, 2023, the declaration states onboard video shows Ford used a thumb-strike lighter to light electrical components under the dashboard on fire. He continued driving the bus and looked down several times at the smoke and flames before the fire was extinguished minutes later, the declaration states. The fire was determined to be “incendiary,” or had been deliberately set, the declaration says.An area transportation manager for the school district said Ford had previously disabled the video surveillance system on his bus or had issues with the system several times, according to the declaration. Suspicious of those problems, bus shop staff altered the system so that it recorded even when manually turned off – a change that led to the video surveillance of the April 2023 fire, according to the declaration.State prosecutors asked the court to deny bail and said Ford was a “clear danger” to the community and to himself. Prosecutors also noted several other fires may be related.“Not only was he the cause of the two bus fires detailed in the probable cause statement, but two additional times he was the bus driver when fires started on buses,” the statement said. “All of the fires originated under the dash of the bus. An intentional fire set in a school bus full of minors presents an unacceptable risk to those minors and the community at large. Additionally, fires have occurred at two of Ford’s residences and one of his vehicles. The fires at Ford’s residence cannot be a mere coincidence.”"}

{"title": "", "text": "Prostate cancer remains a significant concern in my practice, which is why I emphasize the importance of early detection. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be nearly 300,000 new cases of prostate cancer and about 35,000 deaths in 2024.One vital tool in this quest to diagnose and treat this common cancer is prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, testing, which is a simple blood test offering valuable insights into prostate health. By the age of 50, men should be having the test done annually. If you have a family history, have risk factors, or if you are Black, you may need to start as early as age 40.What is prostate-specific antigen testing?Prostate-specific antigen testing serves as a cornerstone in the early detection of prostate cancer. When combined with other diagnostic tests and clinical assessments, it aids in identifying prostate cancer in its early stages, when treatment outcomes for prostate cancer surgery and radiation have the best odds for cure.Regular PSA screenings are particularly crucial for high-risk individuals, such as those with a family history of prostate cancer or advanced age. The blood test is also essential for the average man during his routine annual checkup with his primary care doctor.What else can affect PSA levels?Conditions such as an enlarged prostate, recent sexual activity or prostate infections can all contribute to elevated PSA levels, potentially leading to unnecessary alarm. By considering these factors alongside PSA test results, health care providers can provide more informed guidance and avoid unnecessary interventions.Going beyond PSA for screeningProstate-specific antigen testing has also evolved beyond its traditional bounds, with advancements in molecular urine and blood tests and imaging technology.Blood and urine-based tests can now pinpoint specific genetic markers associated with prostate cancer, providing insights into each patient’s unique risk profile.When combined with traditional PSA testing, these tests offer an even more comprehensive picture of a patient’s prostate health and cancer risk. These tests in combination with the initial PSA can help us determine who may benefit most from further investigation such as a prostate biopsy.Prostate MRI technology offers a detailed, high-definition view of the prostate gland. It enables us to identify suspicious lesions within the prostate gland that could harbor prostate cancer. These “hot spots” are then targeted using MRI fusion technology in which the MRI images are fused to the live ultrasound images during a prostate biopsy. The use of this imaging tool allows for more accurately detecting cancer during a prostate biopsy.Together, these additional tests can increase our ability to detect prostate cancer, ultimately leading to more effective and personalized treatments.More prostate cancer testing and detection for Black menRecent research and guidelines from the Prostate Cancer Foundation highlight a significant update in prostate cancer screening for Black men. Recognizing their heightened risk, the guidelines recommend initiating baseline PSA testing between ages 40 and 45, earlier than current recommendations from other organizations. Regular screenings, preferably annually, should continue until at least age 70. These updates aim to address disparities in prostate cancer outcomes among Black men, offering essential lifesaving screening recommendations.Lowering the recommended age for baseline PSA testing in Black men could reduce prostate cancer deaths by about 30% without significantly increasing overdiagnosis rates, according to recent findings. Doing so emphasizes the importance of tailored screening approaches for high-risk populations, particularly Black men, who are about two times more likely to be diagnosed with and die from prostate cancer than White men.Proactive steps toward prostate health for all menThe PSA test remains a critical tool in prostate cancer detection, offering men an opportunity for early intervention and improved outcomes. Staying informed about updates in screening guidelines and understanding individual risk factors is vital. By prioritizing proactive health care and engaging in open discussions with health care providers, men can take charge of their prostate health and contribute to reducing the burden of prostate cancer in our communities."}
{"title": "", "text": "Opill, the first oral contraceptive approved for over-the-counter use in the United States, will be available in stores and online this month, with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply and $49.99 for a three-month supply, according to Perrigo, the company behind the product.Perrigo announced Monday that Opill has shipped to major retailers and pharmacies and will be available to pre-order from select retailers beginning this week. Once the product hits shelves, anyone can buy it without a prescription. It will also be available at Opill.com.“From an online perspective, it should be available for order pretty much immediately,” said Triona Schmelter, executive vice president and president of consumer self-care Americas at Perrigo.As for the availability, “I expect it’s going to take a few weeks for it to get through the distribution pipeline, of us shipping to retailers’ distribution facilities and then them shipping to their stores,” she said. But once the product is on shelves, “consumers will find it in the family planning section in most retailers and should be able to pick it up at their convenience.”Opill will be available in stores and online as one-month and three-month packs, according to Perrigo. And at Opill.com, a six-month supply will be available at a price of $89.99.When taken as directed at the same time every day, Opill has been found to be 98% effective at preventing pregnancy, according to Perrigo. Most birth control pills are up to 99% effective at preventing pregnancy if taken as instructed every day.“We’re excited about this. It looks very good,” Patrick Lockwood-Taylor, president and chief executive officer of Perrigo, said of Opill’s rollout in a company earnings call last week. “The product is here, waiting to be distributed.”Walgreens and CVS have said they will offer the product.“Opill will be available at CVS.com and through the CVS Pharmacy app in late March,” spokesperson Matt Blanchette wrote in an email Friday. “In early April more than 7,500 CVS Pharmacy stores will offer Opill and for added privacy and convenience, customers will be able to choose same-day delivery or buy online and pick-up in store.”Some online retailers, such as the women’s health hub Stix, are poised to offer the product, as well. Stix founders Jamie Norwood and Cynthia Plotch said they are “excited” about the significant milestone that Opill marks for the accessibility of contraception but are “acutely aware” of the impact that cost may have on access.A survey conducted by the nonprofit KFF in 2022 found that among women who said they were likely to use over-the-counter birth control pills, 39% said they were willing and able to pay up to $10 per month for them, 34% would be willing and able to pay up to $20 per month – the recommended cost of a one-month pack of Opill – and only about 16% said they would pay more than $20. Under the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are required to offer coverage of birth control with no out-of-pocket cost, so it is free.“With these insights, Stix is committed to breaking down financial barriers, ensuring that essential health products and services are within reach for everyone,” Norwood and Plotch said.Plotch said Opill “is going to be really amazing for people who don’t otherwise have access to the prescription form of oral contraception that is covered by health insurance.”Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Opill for over-the-counter availability, meaning it can be obtained without a prescription. Since then, questions have swirled around how much it would cost.A group of advocates called Free the Pill is among those urging a lower price. In January, Free the Pill sent a letter to Perrigo, calling on the company and retailers to price Opill at only $15 for a three-month supply.“We also urge Perrigo to implement a robust and accessible consumer assistance program for those who cannot afford to pay that price,” the letter said. “Perrigo’s and retailers’ decision to price Opill affordably can help to combat contraceptive inequities – rooted in systemic racism and other forms of oppression – that already persist across the United States.”Perrigo’s Schmelter said that advocacy groups like Free the Pill have been “essential in building the research, in educating the public, educating us, and being an advocate for bringing a birth control pill over the counter.”She added that Perrigo will have a cost assistance program available for qualified low-income and uninsured people, which will be available in the coming weeks.“We really wanted to think about all consumers as we were crafting our pricing strategy just to make sure that it was accessible to our consumers, and ensure both affordability and availability on shelf,” Schmelter said.For people with insurance, Opill may be eligible to be paid for or reimbursed through flexible spending or health savings accounts, according to Perrigo.Issues of cost and insurance coverage could still put Opill out of reach for some people, but overall, an over-the-counter birth control pill is a “great step forward,” said Dr. Colleen Denny, director of family planning at NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn, in an email.“Having an over-the-counter, highly effective birth control option on the shelves is potentially a great step forward in improving access to high quality birth control. We know that getting a prescription medication, which is required for all other birth control pills in the U.S., can potentially be a big barrier for patients,” she wrote. “A pill you could buy off the shelves could potentially help with that.”Opill works as a “mini-pill,” using only the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. Combination hormonal birth control pills, which contain both progestin and estrogen, increase the risk of blood clots more than progestin-only birth control pills, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a global fertility care platform.“Progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of having a blood clot like combined OCPs can, which can make it a great option for some people who cannot take combination OCPs,” Ahmad wrote in an email, referring to oral contraceptive pills.“The pill does need to be taken at the same time every day to be effective,” she said, “but if it is not taken consistently and around the same time every day, the effectiveness drops.”Because Opill is a progestin-only oral contraceptive, it is “incredibly safe” for the vast majority of people who may be interested in taking it, said Dr. Ashley Brant, director of complex family planning at Cleveland Clinic.Combined birth control pills may carry risks for people with uncontrolled hypertension or blood clot risks for smokers older than 35. Contraindications for progestin-only pills include conditions such as breast cancer or liver disease, or the use of certain medications.“Birth control pills are either progestin-only, or they’re estrogen plus progestin. For most people, either birth control pill will be safe, but the progestin-only pill in particular has very few contraindications to it. There are very few medical reasons why a progestin-only pill would be unsafe for someone,” Brant said, adding that overall, Opill is a “great step” toward making birth control more accessible.“Now, there will still be lots of people who prefer to come to their trusted health care professional, talk about other options, get a prescription, use their insurance to cover a prescription – and that way of getting birth control isn’t going to go away,” she said. “This is just one extra way to get birth control that we didn’t have before.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "France became the world’s first country to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution on Monday, the culmination of an effort that began in direct response to the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.Lawmakers from both houses of the French Parliament voted 780 to 72 in favor of the measure, easily clearing the three-fifths majority needed to amend the French constitution.Monday’s vote, held during a special gathering of lawmakers at the Palace of Versailles, southwest of Paris, was the final step in the legislative process. The French Senate and National Assembly each overwhelmingly approved the amendment earlier this year.The amendment states that there is a “guaranteed freedom” to abortion in France. Some groups and lawmakers had called for stronger language to explicitly call abortion a “right.”Lawmakers hailed the move as a history-making way for France to send a clear signal of support on reproductive rights, with abortion under threat in the United States, as well as in parts of Europe, like Hungary, where far-right parties have come to power.Following the vote, the Eiffel Tower was lit up with the words “my body my choice.”Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said before the vote that lawmakers had a “moral debt” to women who were, in the past, forced to endure illegal abortions.“Above all, we’re sending a message to all women: your body belongs to you,” Attal said.French President Emmanuel Macron said the government would hold a formal ceremony celebrating the amendment’s passage on Friday, International Women’s Rights Day.France first legalized abortion in 1975, after a campaign led by then-Health Minister Simone Veil, an Auschwitz survivor who became one of the country’s most famous feminist icons.While abortion is a highly divisive issue in US politics that often falls along party lines, in France it is widely supported. Many of the lawmakers who voted against the amendment did so not because they opposed abortion, but because they felt the measure was unnecessary, given the wide support for reproductive rights.The measure’s passage is a clear victory for the French left, which has been pushing for years to guarantee abortion rights in the constitution. Before 2022, President Emmanuel Macron’s government argued — like the amendment’s current opponents — that the move was unnecessary.However, in 2022, when the US Supreme Court ruled against Roe v. Wade and let states individually decide on the issue, France was pushed to act.French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said perviously, before debate began in the National Assembly in January, that history was full of other examples where “fundamental rights” were believed to be safe but then taken away, “as we were recently reminded by the decision of the US Supreme Court.”“We now have irrefutable proof that no democracy, not even the largest of them all, is immune,” he said.The vote marks the 25th time the French government has amended its constitution since the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958.The Catholic Church was one of the few groups to announce its opposition to the amendment. The Pontifical Academy for Life, the Vatican body which focuses on issues related to bioethics, said in a statement that “in the era of universal human rights, there can be no ‘right’ to take human life.”"}

{"title": "", "text": "The Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of posting a trove of highly classified intelligence reports and other documents on social media pleaded guilty on Monday to willfully retaining and disseminating national defense information.Jack Teixeira, 22, pleaded guilty to all six counts he faced under the Espionage Act during a hearing Monday morning.Teixeira has agreed to sit for a debrief with members of the intelligence community and the Department of Defense, court documents say, as well as turn over all relevant documents he has or knows the location of.In exchange, prosecutors have said that they will ask a judge to impose a sentence of 200 months in prison, or over 16 years. The hefty sentence recommendation is far less time than the potential decades-long prison sentence he could have faced had he not struck a deal. Prosecutors have also promised not to charge Teixeira with additional counts under the Espionage Act, according to court documents.“Jack Teixeira will never get a sniff of a classified piece of information for the rest of his life,” the US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Josh Levy said at a news conference following Teixeira’s guilty plea.“This guilty plea brings accountability, and it brings a measure of closure to a chapter that created profound harms for our nation’s security,” said Matt Olsen, the assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice.The final sentence will ultimately be decided by a federal judge in September. The Massachusetts native has been in custody since he was first arrested in April 2023.The document leak rocked the intelligence world when it first came to light last year. The leak raised questions about the US government’s classified vetting process, as officials grappled with how a 21-year-old computer specialist who prosecutors say had an arsenal of weapons and history of violent rhetoric could obtain a top-secret security clearance.It also revealed what defense and intelligence sources said at the time were glaring weaknesses in how the Pentagon safeguards its most sensitive secrets.Teixeira stood between his two defense lawyers as he pleaded guilty Monday morning. He wore an orange prison jumpsuit and rosary around his neck. Behind Teixeira sat family members and supporters, including his father.According to court documents, Teixeira ran an obscure chat room on the social media platform Discord called “Thug Shaker Central,” where members posted memes and talked about guns and religion.While at work at a military base on Cape Cod, Teixeira allegedly conducted unauthorized searches of government databases despite repeated warnings from his superiors not to. Teixeira first began posting messages that included classified information in the Discord chat, according to prosecutors, and eventually posted photos of documents marked as classified.The documents, some of which have been reviewed by CNN, included a wide range of highly classified information, including eavesdropping on key allies and adversaries and blunt assessments on the state of the Russia-Ukraine war. Prosecutors allege that the documents Teixeira posted also include information about an unnamed US company’s accounts that were compromised by a “foreign adversary,” as well as a document discussing a “plot by a foreign adversary to target United States forces abroad.Judge Indira Talwani read aloud details of the actions Teixeira is accused of taking – and the information he is accused of leaking – during the hearing on Monday, and asked Teixeira whether had “any disagreements” with the allegations.“No, your honor,” Teixeira said.“Any disagreement … that each of those documents was classified as top secret, and that unauthorized disclosure could reasonably affect national security,” the judge asked.Teixeira responded, “No, your honor.”Prosecutors say that after the leak was publicized, Teixeira destroyed his electronics and obtained a new phone number and email address. He was taken into custody at his home in Massachusetts about a week later.After he was charged, the US Air Force punished 15 individuals who “intentionally failed” to report documented concerns about Teixeira’s behavior preceding the leaks, including the commander of Teixeira’s unit who was relieved of his command.Outside the federal courthouse in Boston, Teixeira’s attorney Michael Bachrach said that his client pleaded guilty to “do the right thing” and is “absolutely not” selling classified secrets to foreign governments.In a statement to CNN, Teixeira’s family said that “it is unfathomable to think your child would ever be involved in something so serious, but he has taken responsibility for his part in this, and here we are.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "The adage “show, don’t tell” sends the message that it’s far more convincing to make a point with one’s actions than with words. That lesson was also underscored this week during the opening sketch of “Saturday Night Live.”The show lampooned the myriad allies of President Joe Biden who have defended him vociferously against critics who suggest he may be too old to run again for the highly demanding job of US president. Some of those voicing concerns have said they worry in particular about Biden’s cognitive abilities after a series of verbal stumbles.But members of Biden’s team have insisted that when he’s not in the spotlight, the president is as sharp as a tack — an assertion that “SNL” took to humorous excess on Saturday.“Behind closed doors, Joe is incredible,” said cast member Michael Longfellow playing the role of California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, in response to an interview question from CNN anchor Dana Bash — played by Heidi Gardner — about mounting public concern over Biden’s age.“SNL” presented a litany of Biden defenders including White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre (SNL’s Ego Nwodim) and US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (Marcello Hernández).Nwodim as Jean-Pierre — who in the skit describes Biden as “the most vigorous man I’ve ever known” — displays what is supposed to be the president’s packed daily schedule, including a 7 a.m. entry for a SoulCycle class, adding, “And I’m not talking about taking one. He leads it.”This is a Joe Biden, we learn, who when outside of the public eye is quickly dispatching all comers in speed chess, besting NBA player Draymond Green (“SNL”’s Devon Walker) of the Golden State Warriors at pickup basketball and trouncing the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a pushup contest.The SNL sketch makes the same very good point that comedian Jon Stewart raised  during the first show following his return to hosting duties at “The Daily Show” last month.Stewart played a clip of Vice President Kamala Harris assuring an audience that in closed-door meetings Biden is “smart … on his game … and on top of it all.” Stewart — in a tone of voice that was as playful as it was incredulous — responded: “Did anyone film that? … That would be good to show to people.”Again, show — don’t tell. And this week, Biden will have the opportunity to do just that. On Thursday, he takes center stage at the State of the Union, the perfect vehicle to show his vigor and mental acuity to the American people. With the nation watching, the president can mollify any concerns over his age or cognitive skills while delivering a bold, powerful and at least occasionally amusing address.That’s what Biden did with great success last year. His 2023 State of the Union speech was a master class in which he perfectly handled GOP hecklers.When GOP lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Green and others booed Biden after he stated that some Republicans wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare, he didn’t become flustered. Instead, he addressed the hecklers directly, saying, “So folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right?” This prompted a loud cheer from even Republicans.Biden responded, “We’ve got unanimity,” adding jokingly, “I enjoy conversion.” A CNN flash poll found that 72% of those watching had a positive view of the speech.That same command of policy combined with sharp wit and a bit of levity is what Biden needs as the 2024 presidential race gets underway in earnest. We saw Biden do just that last week while appearing on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”After Meyers asked the “age question,” Biden responded by joking, “You got to take a look at the other guy, he’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name.” (Biden was referring to a recent speech where former President Donald Trump appeared to refer to his wife Melania as “Mercedes,” a claim debunked by fact-checkers.)After the laughs died down, Biden pivoted to more substantive issues, dismissing age as a major impediment to doing the job of president. “It’s about how old your ideas are,” he said before lambasting Trump. “Look, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back on Roe v. Wade. He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that are — 50, 60 years, they’ve been solid American positions.”That’s the perfect approach: Biden delivered a joke addressing his age then quickly turned the focus of the discussion to issues that will help Democrats win at the ballot box, such as protecting reproductive freedom. By contrast, Trump has frequently bragged about terminating Roe v. Wade, which for five decades protected a woman’s right to abortion access.Trump and the GOP may be thrilled that millions of women in GOP-controlled states are now forced against their will to carry a fetus to term with few or no exceptions, but a 2023 CNN poll found that 64% of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe. And as we’ve seen in numerous elections since the law was overturned, the issue appears to have motivated voters to cast ballots for candidates who support reproductive freedom.I’m not saying Biden should turn the SOTU speech into a standup set at The Improv. But using comedy — be it self-deprecating humor or barbs aimed at his political opponents — is well within Biden’s wheelhouse. Every State of the Union speech is important for an incumbent president. This Thursday is Biden’s most important ever — and it’s the ideal place for him to turn things around, amid news reports that his poll numbers have been soft, even among his base.Biden also needs, of course, to lay out a bold vision for a second term that will inspire people to vote, addressing domestic concerns as well as foreign policy issues such as a new approach to the war in Gaza demanded by the large protest vote in last Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But a little levity sprinkled here and there, showing that he still has what it takes, can only help his case with voters."}
{"title": "", "text": "“Dune: Part Two” spiced up the box office with a $81.5 million opening weekend, becoming the biggest film, so far, of 2024.With success, often comes sequels — and in the case of “Dune,” director Denis Villeneuve has made it no secret that he hopes to complete his storytelling with a trilogy.On the press tour for “Part Two,” Villeneuve said that his vision is to adapt a third film from Frank Hebert’s second novel, “Dune Messiah.” (“Dune,” released in 2021, and “Dune: Part Two” were both based off of Hebert’s original book with Villeneuve making the creative decision to split the novel into two parts.)Speaking to CNN, Villeneuve said that his third film is already in the works, although it has not been officially greenlit.“I signed for two movies at the beginning,” Villeneuve said. “I felt when finally the movie finished with ‘Part Two,’ I felt like, ‘Okay, I did it.’ But I would love [and] I think it would make sense to me to totally finish Paul Atreides’ arc by doing ‘Dune Messiah,’ and it’s in the works right now.”Atreides is played by Timothée Chalamet in the film series. He stars opposite Zendaya and an A-list cast rounded out by Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Christopher Walken and Anya Taylor-Joy.Distributor Warner Bros. (which shares the same parent company as CNN) has not announced any plans for a third “Dune” — yet. But with the box office performance and critical praise, it seems likely that Villeneuve’s dream will come true.“Nothing official,” Chalamet told CNN when asked about a third film, weeks before “Part Two” was released in theaters. “The rule is, I think, this would have to be successful,” Chalamet added, with a laugh. “Knock on wood. Fingers crossed.”Warner Bros. declined comment on a possible third firm when contacted by CNN.However, Mary Parent, chairman of worldwide production at Legendary, which produces the franchise, and a producer on “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two,” told CNN that the company hopes to produce a third film.“The focus right now is still on supporting the successful launch of this film, but we certainly hope and dream,” Parent said.Reflecting on the big opening weekend (globally, the film grossed $178.5 million), the executive said she believes audiences turned out to theaters to see the film because “it’s a real cinematic experience.”“It’s as emotional as it is visceral with characters you really care about set against action and worldbuilding you have never seen before,” Parent added.Chalamet and Zendaya told CNN they don’t know anything about the script yet. Sure, it’s based off of a book, but the stars insist Villeneuve hasn’t clued them in on any plans for how it will all end on-screen.“I have no idea,” Zendaya said.However, she added, if there is a third film in the franchise, she hopes to have more scenes with Pugh, who was added to the cast for the second film.“I haven’t gotten fully into the next book yet,” Zendaya said about “Messiah.” “I started it and then was like, ‘Hold on. Let me just go back and re-read the book that I’m currently doing again.’ You get immersed quickly into a whole thing, especially with Princess Irulan and Chani and Paul. There’s a lot going on there. I, at least as a fan, would love to see more of that. Florence is brilliant and it would be amazing to be in more scenes with her. But again, it’s up to Denis and how he sees it.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "The Church of England has welcomed a report that calls for it to spearhead the establishment of a £1 billion ($1.3 billion) fund to address its historical ties to slavery.The document, released Monday, recommends that the church’s initial commitment of £100 million ($127 million) to the “Fund for Healing, Repair and Justice” should form the nucleus of a bigger initiative that would target assets of over £1 billion.The Church Commissioners group, which manages the church’s £10.3 billion ($13 billion) investments, has accepted the report “in full,” the church said in a statement.The report was drafted by an independent “oversight group” comprising mainly Black experts from various fields, recruited to advise the Commissioners on the new fund.Established last year following revelations that the Church had profited from the South Sea Company, which was involved in the transatlantic slave trade, the fund will invest in Black-led businesses focusing on education, economic empowerment, health and improving Black people’s access to land and food.The report also calls for the Church Commissioners to build up the value of the fund by bringing in co-investors while also increasing its own allocation.The Church of England is the established church in the United Kingdom. Its most senior leader, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, is also the spiritual head of the worldwide Anglican church.“No amount of money can fully atone for or fully redress the centuries-long impact of African chattel enslavement, the effects of which are still felt around the world today,” said Barbados-born Bishop Rosemarie Mallett, who led the oversight group.“But implementing the recommendations will show the commitment of the Church Commissioners to supporting the process of healing, repair and justice for all of those across society impacted by the legacy of African chattel enslavement.”Britain enslaved 3.1 million Africans between 1640 and 1807, transporting them to colonies around the world, according to Historic England, a public body. Many of these people were taken to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations, which made their owners very wealthy through the export of sugar, molasses and rum, according to the National Archives.“Crimes against humanity rooted in African chattel enslavement have caused damage so vast it will require patient effort spanning generations to address. But we can start today, in small and large ways,” Monday’s report said.It also urged the Church Commissioners to deliver the full sum committed to the fund sooner than over the nine years originally envisaged.“The oversight group’s independent work with the Church Commissioners is the beginning of a multi-generational response to the appalling evil of transatlantic chattel enslavement,” said Welby.In 2020, major British institutions, including the Bank of England and insurance market Lloyd’s of London, apologized for their historic ties to the transatlantic slave trade in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd in the United States."}
{"title": "", "text": "Turns out Taylor Swift was spot on naming her forthcoming album, “The Tortured Poets Department.”The company Ancestry, which helps people trace their genealogy, has found evidence that Swift is distantly related to the famed poet Emily Dickinson.“We need to calm down…but how can we when we have BIG news!?” a post on the Ancestry Instagram account reads. “Renowned American poets Taylor Swift and Emily Dickinson are 6th cousins, three times removed.”CNN has reached out to Swift’s representative for comment. The news was first announced on NBC’s “Today.”Dickinson, who lived from 1830 to 1886, is known for her poems such as “Because I could not stop for Death” and “‘Hope’ is the thing with feathers.”The writer, who should have been a celebrity in her own time, even wrote about fame like her distant cousin. “Success is counted sweetest/By those who ne’er succeed/ To comprehend a nectar/ Requires sorest need,” Dickinson wrote in her poem, “Success is counted sweetest.”“Swift and Dickinson both descend from a 17th century English immigrant (Swift’s 9th great-grandfather and Dickinson’s 6th great-grandfather who was an early settler of Windsor, Connecticut),” according to Ancestry.Swifties have long made the connection between the two women.Her album “Evermore” was announced in 2020 on December 10, which happens to be Dickinson’s birthday. The title is believed by some to have been inspired by Dickinson’s poem “One Sister Have I in Our House,” which includes the word “forvermore.”Two years after that announcement, Swift referenced the legendary writer in the her acceptance speech for the songwriter-artist of the decade award from the Nashville Songwriters Association International.Swift explained that the lyrics she writes fall under three genre categories: quill lyrics, fountain pen lyrics and glitter gel pen lyrics, which reference the writing instrument she imagines she would have been holding while penning the lyrics.“If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the quill genre,” Swift said, noting that her single “Ivy” from “Evermore” would fall under that category."}
{"title": "", "text": "It began with a bellowing horn. Then out came singer Sam Smith, trudging onto the catwalk wearing a tartan shawl shrugged over a v-neck jumper and a functional codpiece-turned-fanny-pack. On their head, another ream of tartan was twisted with black tulle that, from a distance, resembled a flowing mass of dark knotted hair. Trouserless, Smith’s look was finished off with a pair of towering, tartan platform boots and a gnarled wooden walking staff.Were we watching an amateur rendition of Mel Gibson’s “Braveheart”? Apparently not. The discombobulating outfit was, in fact, the opening look of Vivienne Westwood’s Fall-Winter 2024 show in Paris — a collection that has proved divisive online.Designed by Andreas Kronthaler, the late Westwood’s co-collaborator since 1990 and husband since 1992, this season felt like a departure from a more popular version of the brand. In truth, many elements of a traditional Westwood show were there — the high platform shoe, the reference to 18th and 19th century dress, an irreverent glimpse of a butt cheek, even the codpieces seemed to be a nod to the brand’s history pioneering of underwear as outerwear in the 1980s. But the execution was jumbled and confused, a sentiment that was neatly — and perhaps unfortunately — summarized in Smith’s outfit.Vivienne Westwood, who died in December 2022, has long been recognized as a vanguard of the fashion industry — pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable, even at times what was wearable, and using her platform to amplify discussions on climate change and over-consumption. Her designs have influenced fashion’s greats from Alexander McQueen to John Galliano, and the label has even enjoyed a recent revival amongst Gen Z (so popular is the Vivienne Westwood 1990 “orb choker,” there are now hundreds of counterfeits available on Temu, AliExpress and Etsy).Knowing that many feel passionately about the brand, particularly after Westwood’s death, the show on Saturday appeared to touch a nerve. “Vivienne Westwood will be turning in her grave watching Sam Smith in this get up,” wrote one disgruntled fan on X. “I cannot believe this is a Vivienne Westwood show,” chimed another. While many online lamented how Kronthaler’s latest season has “defiled” and “tainted” Westwood’s fashion reputation.In reality, Kronthaler has played an important role in building Westwood’s legacy. From the time Kate Moss walked the runway in little more than a captain’s hat eating a chocolate ice cream, Kronthaler was there, and his vision is inextricable from the DNA of Westwood.But perhaps the label works best when the garish is balanced with the glamorous. The punk designer has always been, as Vogue wrote, “confrontationally subversive” but she was also a tailor who understood the power of proportion, silhouette, shape. For every oversized t-shirt Westwood sent down the runway scrawled in Sharpie pen, there were 10 truly transcendent looks banked in her arsenal.There was the opulent, crystal-encrusted corset dress Linda Evangelista wore for the Fall-Winter 1995 show, the chiseled bodice enchantingly offset by the soft, ombré ostrich feather skirt. Or the regal satin ball gowns and sleek, sexy skirt suits of Spring-Summer 1998, two sides of the same Westwood archetype that could somehow happily coexist on one runway. Kronthaler has proved he can do this, too. Just take the closing look of Fall-Winter 2020 (his debut solo collection). Bella Hadid is reimagined as a Renaissance princess in translucent white lace, puff-sleeves, a pink satin corset and a brown leather belt with a matching sword and sheath.After all, there are so many variations of what “Vivienne Westwood” means — the brand has existed for over 50 years. To one person, true Westwood means draped dresses and exaggerated corsetry. To another, it’s ripped stockings, bare butts and bikini bottoms.When a fashion house outlives its founder, scrutiny is often magnified by nostalgia. But the furore is unlikely to phase Kronthaler. “I of course noticed this wave — this phenomenon,” he told the Financial Times in 2022, when asked about the renewed interest in the Westwood brand. “But I’m ducking under it, trying not to get too engaged. I don’t want to make a parody — reworking, redoing it.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg admitted on Monday to testifying falsely to the New York attorney general about his knowledge of the size of Donald Trump’s apartment triplex and how the value of that apartment was inflated on Trump’s financial statements for years based on the incorrect square footage.Weisselberg was charged with five counts of perjury, but under a deal with prosecutors, he agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts relating to testimony he gave during a 2020 deposition with the attorney general’s office. Weisselberg admitted to testifying falsely at the attorney general’s civil fraud trial against Trump last fall, though that is not among the charges to which he pleaded guilty.Per his agreement with prosecutors, Weisselberg did not plead guilty to perjury at Trump’s civil fraud trial over the triplex, and the parties agreed he wouldn’t be sentenced for that conduct, which could be considered a violation of his parole in connection to his 2022 guilty plea to 15 counts of tax fraud.The former Trump Org. CFO answered questions from Judge Laurie Peterson confirming his plea. Weisselberg told the judge he is pleading guilty because he is guilty.In reviewing the plea agreement, prosecutor Gary Fishman said they considered Weisselberg’s age in not recommending more than five months in prison but said prison time was necessary as the harm caused by perjury “tears at the very fabric” of the justice system.Weisselberg will be sentenced on April 10. Under the terms of the deal with prosecutors, Weisselberg will be sentenced to five months in jail – a deal identical to the prior arrangement he made in 2022 plea. In the previous case, he served about 100 days.During his arraignment Monday morning, Weisselberg acknowledged he lied when he testified to the attorney general during a 2020 deposition that he never heard Trump falsely misstate the size of Trump’s triplex in a September 2015 interview with a Forbes reporter. He admitted he was present for that Forbes interview.Weisselberg also admitted he gave false testimony during a May 2023 deposition when he tried to distance himself from the creation of Trump’s inflated personal financial statements at issue in the AG’s civil fraud case. Weisselberg acknowledged he falsely testified when he told state attorneys that “I didn’t delve into the numbers” and that he relied on the property valuations computed by former Trump Org. Controller Jeff McConney.“These statements were false as Weisselberg was significantly involved in determining what methodology and numbers were used to value properties in the [statements of financial condition],” the complaint says.Per his plea agreement, Weisselberg also admitted he lied again about these matters on the stand last October during the civil fraud trial, though that is not among the charges to which he pleaded guilty.Earlier Monday, Weisselberg declined to comment to CNN. Seth Rosenberg, an attorney for Weisselberg, also declined to comment.A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that “it is a crime to lie in depositions and at trial – plain and simple,” adding that the former Trump Organization official is “being held responsible for his conduct.”Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, accused Bragg of committing “prosecutorial misconduct.”Weisselberg had been in plea talks with Manhattan prosecutors for several weeks relating to his testimony taken during the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the former president in 2020 and when he testified last year, several people familiar with the investigation said.As part of the plea talks, Weisselberg was not expected to turn on Trump and will not testify against him at the New York criminal hush money case scheduled to start later this month, the people said.Trump is indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment and reimbursement before the 2016 presidential election. Weisselberg was central to the financial dealings but neither prosecutors nor Trump’s attorneys said they plan to call him as a witness. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges.It is the second guilty plea by Weisselberg, who in 2022 pleaded guilty to 15 counts of tax fraud and testified in the trial of two Trump Org. entities. Weisselberg was credited with giving truthful testimony and the entities were convicted and fined. The judge sentenced Weisselberg to five months in jail and supervised release. He served about 100 days in Rikers Island jail.The latest charges are a blow personally for Weisselberg, who is in his late 70s with medical issues. Last month, the New York state judge overseeing the attorney general’s civil case found Weisselberg liable for fraud and ordered him to pay $1 million plus interest, roughly half of the $2 million severance he received from the Trump Org.In the hush money case, Weisselberg helped arrange the reimbursement to Michael Cohen, the ex-president’s former lawyer, who advanced $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about an affair with Trump. Trump has denied the affair.The payment initially drew scrutiny of federal prosecutors who gave Weisselberg limited immunity for his testimony before a federal grand jury. Prosecutors moved forward with charges against Cohen.“Because the Trump Organization is a privately held company, had I remained silent and stayed on Donald’s desired messaging, none of this would have been exposed,” Cohen told CNN. Cohen was investigated by federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty to multiple charges in 2018. He did not cooperate with the federal investigation. However, he did cooperate with the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation and is expected to testify against Trump at the trial later this month."}

It can’t go on the way it is. It will explode. He is playing the victim, when he is the one causing the problems.”In a statement to CNN on Monday, Red Bull said, “This is untrue. We are united as a team and we are concentrating on racing.”An independent investigation was launched by Red Bull in February after Horner was accused of engaging in inappropriate behavior towards a member of the racing team, who has not been identified. Last week, the investigation cleared Horner of any wrongdoing.One day later, alleged leaked messages were distributed to members of the F1 community on Thursday, coming from an anonymous email address. That email contained a Google drive of WhatsApp messages. It was anonymously emailed to notable race officials, teams and journalists around the world.In a statement, regarding the mass email, Red Bull told CNN: “This is a private matter between Mr. Horner and another and it would be inappropriate for Red Bull to comment on this.”Meanwhile, Horner reiterated that he denied allegations of wrongdoing following the release of the leaked messages.In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Jos Verstappen denied being the source behind the leaked messages.“But why would I do that?

{"title": "", "text": "The UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Monday accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about the agency’s ties to Hamas.“Some of our staff have conveyed to UNRWA teams that they were forced to (make) confessions under torture and ill-treatment. These false confessions were in response to questioning about relations between UNRWA and Hamas and involvement in the 7 October attack against Israel,” UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma said in a statement.Israel has accused at least 12 staffers from the UN Relief and Works Agency of being involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks and has alleged that about 12% of UNRWA’s 13,000 staffers are members of Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups. Israeli officials have said some of the information about the 12 staffers involved in October 7 was obtained through cell phone data and other sources. UNRWA says it has fired 10 of the 12 accused staffers and that the other two are dead. CNN cannot confirm the allegations.Touma said that false confessions elicited “under torture” were being used “to further spread misinformation about the Agency as part of attempts to dismantle UNRWA,” but did not tie those confessions to the allegations against the 12 staffers accused of participating in the October 7 attacks.The allegations are part of an as yet unpublished report compiled by UNRWA alleging Israel’s widespread physical and psychological abuse of Palestinians detained in Gaza during the war, including 21 UNRWA staff members, some of whom said they were beaten and threatened.The unreleased report, a copy of which CNN obtained, is largely based on the testimony of Gazan detainees held in Israeli prisons and at military sites and released back into Gaza at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between mid-December and mid-February. An UNRWA spokesperson said that when the report was leaked, the agency had not yet decided whether to release it publicly.The detainees cited in the report gave testimony of beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence against both men and women detained by the Israeli military. Some of the detainees are also reported to have died while in Israeli custody, at times allegedly as a result of the abuse they suffered in detention.CNN cannot independently verify all of the accounts of abuse listed in the UNRWA report, but has previously documented similar allegations of abuse by Palestinian detainees.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the allegations about the torture and detention of UNRWA staffers, but said in a statement that “the mistreatment of detainees during their time in detention or whilst under interrogation violates IDF values and contravenes IDF orders and is therefore absolutely prohibited.” It said that investigations into the deaths of detainees are investigated by the military police and are currently pending.The Israeli military forcefully denied claims of sexual abuse of detainees, calling them “another cynical attempt to create a false equivalency with the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war by Hamas.” It also denied that detainees are deprived of sleep and said detainees have access to medical care.UNRWA estimates that at least 4,000 Gazans have been detained by the Israeli military since the start of the war. As of February 19, the agency had documented the detention of 29 children and 80 women, as well as elderly individuals with Alzheimer’s and people with intellectual disabilities.“UNRWA received widespread reports from released detainees of ill-treatment across all stages of detention. According to individuals released from detention, ill-treatment was used in attempts to extract information or confessions, to intimidate and humiliate, and to punish,” says the UNRWA report, which was first reported by the New York Times.The report also says that in each of the releases it monitored at Kerem Shalom, “ambulances were required to immediately transport some person due to their injuries or illness.”The detainees reported being held and interrogated at military sites in Israel, sometimes for weeks on end, before being transferred into the Israeli prison system.According to the UNRWA report, some detainees reported being stripped, handcuffed and held in the cold with no access to toilets, food or water for over 24 hours. Detainees interviewed by CNN in December also described similar treatment, saying they were held for days on end with little access to food or water."}
{"title": "", "text": "Advocacy groups and critics of former President Donald Trump tried to remove him from the 2024 presidential ballot based on the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which says public officials who have “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from ever serving again.Three states — Colorado, Maine and Illinois — determined that this ban applies to Trump, because of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Those three states decided to strip him from the Republican primary ballot, though those decisions were paused on appeal.The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Colorado case in early February, and unanimously ruled Monday that Trump should remain on the ballot. A narrower 5-4 majority further ruled that states don’t currently have the power to enforce the ban against any federal candidates.Similar attempts to block Trump from the ballot last year fell flat last year in several other key states, where lawsuits were dismissed on procedural grounds and never reached the questions about Trump’s actions on January 6. This includes Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Arizona, and elsewhere.Each state has different rules for how challenges like these are adjudicated. Some begin in the state courts, while others are first handled by state election officials, like a secretary of state.CNN has been tracking the major decisions on Trump’s eligibility. Most of the major challenges were initiated by well-funded advocacy groups with the backing of seasoned constitutional scholars.There has also been a flurry of minor lawsuits, often brought by individuals without attorneys, or who lack standing, or who filed in courts without jurisdiction.

{"title": "", "text": "Certain kinds of greaseproofing “forever” chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, will no longer be used in food packaging in the US, the US Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday.The FDA’s food studies have shown that food packaging materials like fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags and take-out pizza boxes were a major source of dietary exposure to certain types of PFAS, hormone-disrupting chemicals that may persist in the body and the environment.PFAS have been linked to a variety of health effects including changes in immune and liver function, obesity, diabetes, certain cancers and lower birth weights.While health and environmental advocates cheered the new announcement, they noted that companies were already facing pressure from state bans to get PFAS out of consumer products, including food packaging.“I am enthusiastically supportive of getting PFAS out of food packaging,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at NYU Langone Health in New York City, who has studied the health impacts of PFAS. “We are talking about a decent chunk of ongoing exposure.”Twelve states have moved to ban or phase out PFAS in food packaging, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs for the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.“This is really the culmination of state action to drive PFAS out of the marketplace and, particularly, to drive PFAS out of food packaging, where alternatives have existed for a long time,” Benesh said.The American Chemistry Council, a trade association, said in a statement Wednesday that “PFAS are a diverse universe of chemistries that are critical to many products families rely on every day, including semiconductors and electronics, advanced batteries, modern healthcare applications, and renewable energy. All PFAS are not the same. Individual chemistries have different physical, chemical, and toxicological properties, as well as differing uses.“ACC supports strong, science-based regulation of PFAS chemistries and will continue to work with state and federal policymakers on this important issue.”In 2020, the FDA announced that chemical manufacturers would voluntarily phase out certain kinds of PFAS for use in food packaging within three years, after a scientific review concluded that these chemicals could linger in the body longer than anticipated.“This ‘win’ for public health is the result of FDA research and leadership, combined with cooperation from industry,” noted Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, in a news release on the milestone.Asked whether imported food packaging could still contain PFAS, the FDA said there are no other companies — beyond those that have voluntarily stopped selling the chemicals — that have FDA authorization to sell PFAS for use in food packaging sold in the US.Wednesday’s announcement doesn’t mean the wrapper of your next fast-food burger won’t contain PFAS, however. The FDA estimates that there may be lingering stocks of packaging that contains PFAS, and it may take some months before that stock is completely exhausted.In addition, the agency said it is working on a validated test that would allow it to monitor the marketplace for PFAS chemicals in food packaging.While PFAS will no longer be in food packaging, the FDA says it will still allow some kinds of these grease-proofing chemicals to be used in nonstick cookware and in food manufacturing equipment.“Current research demonstrates that the potential exposure to PFAS through the remaining limited authorized uses is exceedingly low,” Enrico Dinges, an FDA spokesperson, said in an email to CNN.“Given that the migration potential of the substance to food is considered negligible, there are no immediate plans for the FDA to take action related to the remaining uses at this time,” Dinges said in response to questions.Chemicals called long-chain PFAS stopped being sold in the US due to safety concerns in 2011. Manufacturers then substituted short-chain PFAS, which have fewer carbons in their structure and weren’t thought to be as hazardous as long-chain PFAS, in their products to replace them.Short-chain PFAS weren’t thought to build up in living organisms the way long-chain PFAS do, but research has shown that they may be metabolized into forms that linger in tissue."}
{"title": "", "text": "San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin has implemented a new policy for the team’s dugout requiring every member to stand for the US national anthem – ‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’Melvin says his reasoning for the mandate isn’t based on any political motivation – or even a Major League Baseball (MLB) ruling – instead explaining that it is meant to show a unified front before games.“Look, we’re a new team here, we got some good players here,” Melvin told USA Today’s Bob Nightengale on Friday. “It’s more about letting the other side know that we’re ready to play. I want guys out here ready to go. There’s a personality to that.“It has nothing to do with whatever happened in the past or whatever, it’s just something I embrace.”The US national anthem kicks off every NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS and NHL game featuring an American team, but it’s a notable change for the Giants.Former Giants manager Gabe Kapler kneeled several times in protest over the death of George Floyd in 2020 and didn’t take to the field for the national anthem in the 2022 season in response to that year’s school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 children and two teachers dead.“We stand in honor of a country where we elect representatives to serve us, to thoughtfully consider and enact legislation that protects the interests of all the people in this country and to move this country forward towards the vision of the ‘shining city on the hill,’” Kapler wrote in a blog post in 2022.“But instead, we thoughtlessly link our moment of silence and grief with the equally thoughtless display of celebration for a country that refuses to take up the concept of controlling the sale of weapons used nearly exclusively for the mass slaughter of human beings.“We have our moment (over and over), and then we move on without demanding real change from the people we empower to make these changes. We stand, we bow our heads, and the people in power leave on recess, celebrating their own patriotism at every turn.”Melvin says that he’s implemented similar rules during stops with the Oakland Athletics and the San Diego Padres.“It shows that we’re ready to play,” Giants infielder Wilmer Flores said, per the Athletic.“That’s the message we want to send to the other team.“Even if you’re not playing, you’re engaged. You’re there to watch the game. It’s definitely something he wanted us to do. We’re here to play, right? I think it’s good. It doesn’t mean you’ll have a good result this season. But it’s a good way to start.”San Francisco announced last year that Melvin was returning to the Giants, this time as manager. Melvin spent three seasons with the Bay Area team as a catcher between 1986-88, playing the most amount of games of his MLB career.Since retiring in 1994, he has gone on to become a productive manager in the league, coaching for over 20 years – including being part of the Arizona Diamondbacks’ 2001 World Series-winning team as a bench coach – and winning three Manager of the Year awards during that span.His 1,517 regular season wins rank 25th all-time and are fifth-most among active managers.The national anthem was played at baseball games decades before it was actually the national anthem. There are records of “The Star Spangled Banner” gracing the diamond going back as far as 1897, but the song wasn’t adopted as the national anthem until 1931."}

{"title": "", "text": "Damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea is disrupting telecommunications networks and forcing providers to reroute as much as a quarter of traffic between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, including internet traffic.Cables belonging to four major telecoms networks have been “cut” causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, according to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications.HGC estimates that 25% of traffic between Asia and Europe as well the Middle East has been impacted, it said in a statement Monday.The company said it is rerouting traffic to minimize disruption for customers and also “extending assistance to affected businesses.”HGC did not say how the cables had been damaged or who was responsible.South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, told CNN that repairs wouldn’t begin for at least another month, partly because of the length of time it takes to secure permits to operate in the area.Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the internet, with many funded in recent years by internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Damage to these subsea networks can cause widespread internet outages, as happened following the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.The destruction of cables in the Red Sea comes weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables. The Iranian-backed militants have already disrupted global supply chains by attacking commercial vessels in the crucial waterway.Reports last week from Israeli news outlet Globes suggested the Houthis had been behind the damage to the cables. Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.The Houthis have since blamed British and US military units operating in the area for the damage, according to a report Saturday by the rebels’ official news agency. CNN has contacted the UK and US governments for comment.Seacom’s chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee said acquiring permits from the Yemeni maritime authority to repair the cables could take up to eight weeks. “Client traffic will continue to be rerouted until we are able to repair the damaged cable,” he added.Among the other networks affected is Asia-Africa-Europe 1, a 25,000-kilometer (15,534-mile) cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt. The Europe India Gateway (EIG) has also been damaged.EIG connects Europe, the Middle East and India and counts Vodafone as a major investor. Vodafone, a large mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, declined to comment.The company says on its website that it can send internet traffic across some 80 submarine cable systems that reach 100 countries.Most large telecoms companies rely on multiple undersea cable systems, allowing them to reroute traffic in the event of an outage to ensure uninterrupted service."}
{"title": "", "text": "Ed Pierson was flying from Seattle to New Jersey in 2023, when he ended up boarding a plane he’d never wanted to fly on.The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board – essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max.“I got to the airport, checked again that it wasn’t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane – I thought, it’s kinda new,” Pierson told CNN. “Then I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.”He got up and walked off.“A flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, ‘I wasn’t supposed to fly the Max.’ She was like, ‘What do you know about the Max?,’” he said.“I said, ‘I can’t go into detail right now, but I wasn’t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.’”Pierson made it to New Jersey – after some back and forth, he said, Alaska’s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said.Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing – including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch.But he’s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part – a door plug – was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of “many” loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug.Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that “something like this can happen again.”The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability in 2021 for one of the crashes.Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: “We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn… This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.”“We caused the problem, and we understand that,” Calhoun said. “Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures.The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety.The FAA is now “taking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company’s top priority,” a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing’s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident.On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues.Boeing told CNN: “Every day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely. The 737 MAX family’s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.”Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do.Mixed impressionsThe last time the Max was grounded – for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 – 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll said that they had “not a lot” or “no” confidence in the aircraft – compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft’s return to the skies.After being “told about the aircraft’s safety issues,” a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half – 45% – said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) “puts passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.”Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max.“It’s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,” Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. “I hope something is done so that this doesn’t happen again.”Then there’s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered “not at all” or “a little” when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free.If it’s Boeing, ‘I ain’t going’Belén Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight.“My boyfriend didn’t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn’t flying on any type of Max,” she said.“It doesn’t matter which model, I don’t want to fly them.” To her, she said, “The Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.”Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She’s made two trips since January.“The whole thing of, ‘If it’s not Boeing I ain’t going,’ it’s totally the opposite now,” she said. “I’m very happy when I’ve seen I’ll be flying an Airbus.”She says she’s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both “soft” and “hard” boycotts.“Some say, ‘Absolutely not,’ others say, ‘If I can change it, I will; if not I’ll just go on it.’”‘Not an aircraft I’d want to fly’UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8’s first crash in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes – who’d previously worked in emergency crisis management – was immediately concerned about Boeing’s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017.“I actively sought out airlines that didn’t have the Max,” she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve.In 2022, Grimes watched “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,” a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing.“I watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, ‘That’s not for me.’ I don’t see myself flying one in the near future,” she said.While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that “its issues are not resolved.”“When the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought ‘Hmm,’” she said. “It’s just not an aircraft I’d want to fly.”Grimes is a self-declared “avgeek,” or aviation fanatic – and she’s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. “I wouldn’t exactly refuse to fly it, but I’d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,” he said.A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash.“After the first one, the predominant talking points were, ‘Oh, it’s got to be pilot error, or the weather – it can’t be the plane,” they say. “It was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested – it had to be something else.“Then the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.”They say they still love flying the “older style of Boeings – the 777s and the original 737s.”“They were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,” they say. “I feel I can trust them more than the Max.”‘Piss poor design’“Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.”They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 – eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, “No.”)In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, “This airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.” The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft’s “piss poor design.” A design tweak was labelled as “patching the leaky boat.”These internal communications were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined “the serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.” The report highlighted five key themes, including “production pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public” and a “culture of concealment” at Boeing.At the time, Boeing said that the communications “do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.” The company issued a statement acknowledging the committee’s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were “in our thoughts and prayers.”Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be “one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.”It added: “We have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public… We have made fundamental changes to our company… and continue to look for ways to improve.”The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its “grossly insufficient oversight” over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report said that “gaps in the regulatory system at the FAA… allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.”A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: “The FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing and its suppliers produce.”‘Vindicated’ after safety failureRory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of “Downfall” told CNN she didn’t have a “strong opinion” on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020.But, she said, “I was shocked by what we discovered… [it] was really disturbing.”Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. “Downfall” interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims’ families.Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing “went to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.” The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots.Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time.“Boeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,” House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement.“We are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned… these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,” the FAA said in a statement following the committee’s report.“[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,” said Kennedy. “I interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?”“I would absolutely not fly that plane,” she told CNN. “I’ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.”She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was “talking to pilots who were telling me, ‘Absolutely don’t get on that plane.’”And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, “When the door ripped off the airplane, people said, ‘You’re so vindicated.’”Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner – Boeing’s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too – and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole.A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and “is conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing’s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems’ supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.”Kennedy wants a “proper hearing” in Congress – similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes.“To me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what’s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,” she says.‘Their numbers game cost me my friend’Critics say that Boeing’s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line.Damning its “broken safety culture,” DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that “Boeing – under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street – escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.”In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified.“The reason that [Boeing’s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,” says Deveney Williams.In March 2019, Williams’ friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C.“I avoid Boeing as much as possible – I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,” said Williams.“I never knew about plane models prior to this, but I’ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I’ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I’ve learned a lot – I don’t want this happening to anyone else.”For Williams, the Alaska incident was a “weird relief” – because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn’t happen in January. “This time, it’s on American soil, I’m presuming it was an American pilot – so they don’t have any other fingers to point.”‘Airlines don’t make it easy to switch’Torleif Stumo – Samya’s brother – had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogotá in August 2023.“I don’t really have anxiety, I’ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,” he says.“The crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].”Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he’d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he’d been assured that he wouldn’t be on a Max.Williams and Kennedy both say they’ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute.Stumo believes that it’s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they’ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif’s father, wants aircraft types to be “prominently displayed” during the booking process, he tells CNN.Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United – the US carriers which use the Max 9 – issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations.“We have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,” they added.A spokesperson for United said the airline “has no change fees on most tickets. We’re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.”Pierson’s Foundation for Aviation Safety – established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it – added a page to their website in February for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one’s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport.Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it’s safe to fly the Max.The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an “unstable production line.” In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote.Having taken early retirement in August 2018 – “I knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn’t support the leadership anymore,” he told CNN – he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing.“I would definitely not fly that plane,” he says now. “The same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they’ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.”‘We want no third crash’Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation “into whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.” It has also launched an analysis of “potential safety-focused reforms around quality control,” a spokesperson told CNN.As part of its “enhanced oversight,” FAA teams are reviewing Boeing’s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems’ production system for the aircraft’s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at “how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,” a spokesperson told CNN.Meanwhile, the NTSB’s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues.A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB’s final report which could take a year or more.Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, “as a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.”For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. “We have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don’t,” he said. “Now we have this: where they can’t even put plug doors in a plane, can’t fix bolts.”Stumo wants Boeing to “bring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.”“These people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,” he said.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has “invested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.” Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have “increased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.”“We have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,” they added.Stumo says the company needs urgent change.“The first crash shouldn’t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] – it absolutely shouldn’t have happened.“We want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.”"}

The super PAC announced last week that it had gathered enough signatures to qualify Kennedy for appearance on the November ballot in Arizona and Georgia.“This is yet another example of AV24 playing fast and loose with election law,” DNC senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said following the FEC complaint. “It’s clear that they, along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his campaign, don’t believe that the rules apply to them.”CNN has reached out to American Values 2024, de Becker and the Kennedy campaign for comment.The DNC has sought to highlight Kennedy’s ties to donors who have previously supported Republicans, focusing on GOP megadonor Timothy Mellon’s support for the candidate along with Mellon’s previous donations to former President Donald Trump. Democrats have paid for billboards outside multiple Kennedy campaign events in recent weeks boosting Mellon’s support for Kennedy.De Becker has supported both Republican and Democratic candidates in past elections.In addition to donating in support of Kennedy, de Becker’s company has provided security for Kennedy during his presidential run.Kennedy initially launched a Democratic primary challenge to President Joe Biden last year, but after his efforts did little to sway the party’s primary voters, he ended those efforts and began his independent campaign for the presidency."}

For example, developers are not allowed to inform iOS users about the price differences between in-app subscriptions and those available for the same streaming service on a website.Apple responded that the European Commission’s decision had been reached despite “its failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast.”The company said in a statement that app developers “compete on a level playing field” on Apple’s app store. It plans to appeal the fine.The European Commission said it had added a lump sum of €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) to a basic fine in an attempt to deter Apple, as well as other big tech companies, from violating its antitrust laws.“If you are a company who’s dominant and you do something illegal, it will be punished,” said Vestager, adding that, by itself, the basic fine was equivalent to a “parking ticket” for Apple.The total €1.84 billion fine amounts to 0.5% of Apple’s worldwide annual turnover, according to Vestager.Spotify complaintThe European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple in 2020 after Spotify (SPOT) lodged a complaint against Apple the previous year, accusing it of unfairly disadvantaging its competitors.It said Apple required the Swedish music streamer and other content providers to pay a 30% fee on purchases made through Apple’s in-app payment system, while its own service, Apple Music, didn’t have to pay the fee. Spotify also said Apple prevented it from sharing information about subscription deals with customers who use iPhones.Apple is “one of the biggest sellers of the smartphone” and its smartphone operating system “is the only way to offer our app to anyone with an iPhone,” according to Spotify.The streamer said the EU’s decision to fine Apple sent “a powerful message.” “No company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers,” the music streamer said in a statement.In its statement, Apple argued that Spotify was the “biggest beneficiary” of the EU’s fine. “Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” it said.Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that claim.In January, Apple announced changes to its handling of apps in the EU, including plans to allow third-party app stores on iPhones and iPads for the first time in the company’s history and significant cuts to its app store fees.The changes were unveiled in anticipation of new EU rules taking effect this month as part of the Digital Markets Act, a sweeping set of competition regulations for Big Tech."}
{"title": "", "text": "A swimmer’s disqualification on a technicality after winning a college conference final has led to one teammate branding the decision as the “dumbest rule in swimming.”Owen Lloyd, a senior at North Carolina State University, clinched the 1,650-yard freestyle title at the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Championships at the end of February, but was promptly stripped of his title after climbing into the adjacent lane to celebrate with teammate Ross Dant, who finished in second, before the other swimmers had touched the wall.The meet’s head referee implemented Rule 2, Section 5 of the NCAA rulebook, which states that “a swimmer who changes lanes during a heat shall be disqualified,” leading to Lloyd’s disqualification.CNN reached out to NC State, who deferred to the ACC, and the NCAA for comment.Winning the ACC Championship title would have booked Lloyd a spot at the NCAA Championships in the event.“I think that’s the dumbest rule in swimming,” Dant told the ACC Network. “Owen beat me fair and square, he should be on that podium. He was excited. That’s a huge win for him, right? He earned that. He earned that, and that’s his emotion.“That’s what we get in the sport of swimming when we do well. We train all year for a moment like that, and to have him disqualified I think is the dumbest thing ever. He works so hard every day. He is going to be on that No. 1 trophy. I am not going to stand up there.“I think the rule makes sense if you’re interfering with a swimmer that is still racing,” Dant added to The Athletic. “But there should be a caveat to the rule where it’s ‘not interfering with a swimmer’s ability to complete the race’ or something like that.“He didn’t interfere with my lane because I was already done, and everyone else around us was done as well. Him getting into my lane would not have affected the person in lane six.”Lloyd was visibly distraught by the decision, sitting by the side of the pool in tears after the decision was announced over the speaker system.“I just started crying because I was so upset that all that hard work had been kind of taken away from me by such a strange situation,” Lloyd told The Athletic.“That was a huge moment for me to become an ACC champion after really kind of climbing up the ranks throughout the team, throughout the conference and nationally, as well. I’ve seen people get on the lane line before and I didn’t think twice about it when I did it there.“It happened to be unfortunate that in the mile, where there’s the opportunity to pull ahead farther, that someone was still swimming. That did not cross my mind at all that potentially I’d be disrespecting them or showing emotion that I shouldn’t while they were still racing. I was kind of just letting it flow.”Dant later handed the first-place medal to Lloyd in the stands, according to The Athletic, with Lloyd saying the ACC Championship title is now in his bedroom.The incident has drawn widespread criticism, with Fox reporter Will Kunkel calling the decision “outrageous.”“Can we not have some discretion here?” he asked on X. “This is so sad and stupid.”Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, who was the color commentator for the race, questioned why the referee didn’t appear to be enforcing rules as rigorously in other races.“I am a rule follower,” she said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter. “I love a rule because I love to follow it – my problem with this whole thing has been: if you’re going to call that, you need to call everything.“Not five minutes after all this hot mess happened, there were backstrokers that were diving into the pool. Why is that a problem? The rule states backstrokers must enter feet first.“So if you called Owen Lloyd for celebrating and ‘interfering’ – which he did not – you gotta call the backstrokers for diving in, which you did not. So if you’re going to call one, you call them all. That has been my problem with this whole thing.”The 2024 NCAA Division 1 championships will take place at IU Natatorium in Indianapolis, between March 27 and 30."}
{"title": "", "text": "JetBlue Airways announced Monday it is pulling out of its deal to purchase Spirit Airlines.The decision comes in the wake of a federal court ruling blocking the deal from taking place on antitrust grounds. The Justice Department had argued that airfares could go up if Spirit was no longer an independent airline.Spirit has been a leader in the segment of the airline industry that offers very low, no-frills base fares that required passengers to pay extra for everything, including carry-on baggage.JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit $69 million as part of its decision to end the deal, JetBlue said.While the companies had appealed the judge’s ruling blocking the deal, JetBlue and Spirit both issued statements saying it had become clear they wouldn’t be able to overcome the legal obstacles to complete the merger.“Given the hurdles to closing that remain, we decided together that both airlines’ interests are better served by moving forward independently,” said JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty.Spirit said it was always prepared to continue as an independent airline, given the regulatory challenges the deal faced.“We are disappointed we cannot move forward with a deal,” Spirit CEO Ted Christie said. “However, we remain confident in our future as a successful independent airline.”The decision could spark a new bidding war for Spirit. There is even the possibility that it could lead to a bankruptcy filing and liquidation for Spirit, according to at least one airline analyst. Spirit has struggled with losses for several years as larger airlines have returned to profitability since demand for flying resumed after the height of the pandemic.JetBlue had signaled it might pull out of the deal in a January filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shortly after the judge’s decision. It has been clear for months that Spirit is no long worth the $3.8 billion, or $33.50 a share, that JetBlue agreed to pay for the airline.Even before federal Judge William Young issued the ruling blocking the deal, a decision that sent the price of Spirit shares plunging, its shares were trading at half the purchase price, or less, over course of the last six months, and only two-thirds of the price at the time the deal was agreed upon in July 2022.Shares of Spirit closed Friday at $6.46 a share, giving it a market cap of just over $700 million. Its shares are down 75% from the closing price the day the deal was originally announced, and they fell another 10% in premarket trading Monday on the news. Meanwhile shares of JetBlue rose 3% in premarket trading on news that the deal was off.Airline analysts from JPMorgan Chase believe that while JetBlue might still interested in expanding, it likely wanted to walk away from the $3.8 billion deal as originally crafted even before the judge’s decision.“We believe JetBlue was wholly unprepared (or unwilling) to proceed with the originally-crafted deal economics (the price was simply just too much to pay),” the JPMorgan analysts wrote in that note the day of the court decision.That section of the note had the headline “JetBlue dodges a bullet.”What Spirit means for fares on other airlinesThe US airline industry has gone through more than 20 years of mergers and consolidation before this deal was announced.The 10 major airlines that existed in 1999 have been combined into four major carriers — American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines — through a series of deals, often done as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. Those four large carriers carry about 80% of the nation’s air traffic.The mergers have resulted in a much more profitable US airline industry, but far fewer choices for US air travelers, which can result in higher fares.The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach in fighting mergers and combinations, including in the airline industry. Besides successfully fighting this deal in court, it also objected to an alliance between JetBlue and American Airlines, an alliance that was dropped as JetBlue pursued this deal.Since the rise of Spirit, the four biggest US airlines – American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines – have since created a class of seats on their planes that more closely mirrored Spirit’s frill-free offering, a “basic economy” seat. But they were also making a significant portion of their money by selling seats with a more premium service, including first class, business class, and economy-plus seats.But while its customers might have liked its fares, Spirit was regularly at or near the top in customer complaints about the service, according to Transportation Department reports. And with its fare structure and other issues, Spirit has found it difficult to return to profitability the way the larger carriers have.And if analysts who doubt Spirit’s ability to survive prove to be correct, the end of this deal could lead to a closure of the airline and the loss of 13,000 jobs at Spirit, along with the higher fares that it sought to avoid by blocking the deal.Spirit reported an adjusted loss of $359.5 million in 2023, nearly double the $189.4 million it lost in 2022. Analysts forecast it will lose nearly $300 million more this year and $174 million in 2025.JetBlue has also been mired in losses since the pandemic as well, reporting an adjusted loss of $151 million in 2023, although that was an improvement from the $260 million it lost in 2022. Still, it faces its own challenges going forward, including activist investor Carl Icahn buying a 10% stake in the company and announcing plans to win two seats on its board of directors for his allies at the upcoming shareholders’ meeting."}
{"title": "", "text": "A defining week in politics will clarify the choice Americans will face in November in a fateful and unprecedented election that is already testing long-held interpretations of the Constitution and the powers of the presidency.The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a push in Colorado to throw ex-President Donald Trump off the ballot because of the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists.Trump is meanwhile expected to emerge from the 15-state Super Tuesday GOP primaries within touching distance of a third straight Republican nomination. As he seeks a stunning White House return four years after trying to overturn the last election, the ex-president is showing a new term would be even more extreme than his first.President Joe Biden, meanwhile, will take the stage before a huge television audience two nights later for his State of the Union address. It’s a critical test for an 81-year-old commander in chief facing deep doubts that he’s fit to serve a second term as he’s beset by global crises and disappointment with his performance at home.A race between the current president and the ex-president is one that polls show many Americans dread. But Trump and Biden’s turns in the spotlight this week will highlight their all-but-certain rematch, barring health crises or other surprise events. Biden is highly vulnerable in a race that has no clear leader, according to the CNN Poll of Polls average.November’s election is already heaping pressure on political and electoral institutions, the Constitution and America’s fragile national unity. The country has never had an election in which one candidate faces multiple criminal trials and is running on the false premise that he was illegally ousted from power.Following Monday’s Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, Trump’s name will appear on ballots that were printed weeks ago. Without a ruling from the justices, there was no guarantee voters who pick Trump would have their choice counted if justices decided he was ineligible to serve.The Supreme Court last week agreed to hear another massive case, over Trump’s claims of sweeping presidential immunity, which he’s made in response to his indictment for attempting to steal the 2020 election. The move further delayed the ex-president’s federal criminal trial over election interference, which Trump – who is seeking to push off his trials past the 2024 election – touted as a win.Both cases pose enormous questions about the legal foundation of the electoral system and whether presidents are truly subject to the same laws as other citizens.Four years ago, the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries saw Biden pull off a staggering political comeback, routing his rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and taking a decisive hold on the Democratic nomination. This year’s edition will likely prove similarly decisive for Trump, who is aiming for a sweep of big states to build on his cruise through early state contests and hopes to finally crush his last-remaining rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. A third nomination for Trump would represent an extraordinary comeback after he left office in disgrace two weeks after a mob of his supporters smashed their way into the US Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of Biden’s election win.Ahead of a likely general election clash, Trump’s appetite for testing the rule of law and the Constitution is undimmed. He is promising a presidency of “retribution” against his political enemies in a campaign pulsating with some of the most venomous anti-immigrant and autocratic rhetoric in modern US history.Biden’s appearance in the House of Representatives on Thursday night, therefore, will not just mark a vital opportunity to court a primetime audience and to cultivate buzz that will reach many more viewers on social media. It will personify the implicit narrative of his campaign: that while voters may worry about the oldest president in history in a second term that would end when he’s 86, he’s the final bulwark between a second Trump presidency, which he warns could trash democracy.Trump’s momentum is growingThe former president’s march toward the Republican nomination accelerated over the weekend with his victories in the Idaho and Missouri caucuses and after he locked up all Michigan’s delegates to go with his thumping win in the state’s primary last week.The GOP front-runner will not be able to reach the 1,215 delegates he needs to win the nomination on Tuesday night, but his expected victories in a run of states with 865 delegates at stake will make him the presumptive GOP nominee in all but name. According to CNN’s latest calculations, Trump has 247 delegates compared with Haley’s 43. She scored her first victory Sunday night when she won the GOP primary in Washington, DC.Trump’s dominance of the GOP primary race has enabled him to consolidate the congressional leaders of the party around him. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican leader in the Senate, endorsed him last week. And last week’s announcement from Mitch McConnell that he’ll soon step down as Senate GOP leader underscored the ex-president’s populist, nationalist transformation of a party once rooted in fiscal conservatism and globalism.Haley, stung by the loss of her own state primary in South Carolina last month, vowed Sunday to “keep fighting” because “70% of Americans say they don’t want Donald Trump or Joe Biden.” But there will be increasing pressure on her to bow out of the race if her opponent blows her out of the water Tuesday.“At some point, you have got to call it,” GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I thought she would call it after she lost her own state in a horrible fashion. Now that we go into Super Tuesday, there’s not a chance she’s going to win a single state.”As Trump consolidates his power within the GOP, his rhetoric is becoming even wilder, in a campaign that is now inseparable from his defense in his multiple criminal trials. The ex-president, posing as a political “dissident,” falsely styles his daunting bill of hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution after several lost civil cases as proof of a campaign of political persecution by the Biden administration.On Saturday, Trump characteristically projected onto Biden the exact offense of which he is accused in several criminal cases, underscoring the threat the ex-president would pose to democratic institutions if he won back the White House.He told supporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, that Biden’s conduct amid a southern border crisis was tantamount to “a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America.” He said: “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base power that gives them control for generations.”Trump’s comments reflect the vital importance of his case before the Supreme Court on his claim of almost blanket presidential immunity. The case is important not just in relation to his interference in the 2020 election; it points to his aspirations for unfettered political power if he wins in November.Biden is failing to quell concerns about his ageAs his likely contest with Trump looms, Biden heads into the State of the Union address under enormous pressure to cut a vigorous and optimistic figure. He needs to show he’s a president in command and can transmit a vision for the future.A new round of polls released over the weekend underscored Biden’s challenges. The surveys portray a nation that most voters feel is headed in the wrong direction as they wait to feel economic benefits that official data show – and the White House insists – is a strong recovery. Biden looks vulnerable in these surveys on his management of the economy, inflation, the southern US border, the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas.But the most striking aspect of the new surveys by The New York Times/Siena College and The Wall Street Journal lies in the profound concerns many voters have about the president’s age and his capacity. A majority of voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s too old to serve effectively as president, according to the Times poll. There are fewer concerns about the 77-year-old Trump’s capacity. In the Wall Street Journal survey, 73% of respondents said Biden was too old to run for reelection. Some 52% thought the same of Trump.The president has in recent weeks tried to deflect such concerns by joking about his age. And last week, he was certified as fit to serve by his medical team after his annual physical examination. Biden has also spent recent weeks seeking to shore up key elements of his coalition, including union workers and minority and younger voters. And Democrats plan to jam Republicans over hardline abortion restrictions backed by Republican state legislatures and conservative judges in the wake of the overturning of the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion by the Supreme Court.But the new polling suggests the president’s efforts have done little to dismantle one of his biggest obstacles to reelection – his age. That’s why his State of the Union address is shaping up to be one of the most important such speeches this century.The appearance will come at a fraught moment. Another end-of-the-week deadline is looming to avert a government shutdown. While leaders of both congressional chambers have reached a bipartisan spending deal, the tiny GOP House majority means any piece of legislation is a heavy lift. Biden is, meanwhile, under pressure as he pushes for a long-term pause in the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Last week’s Michigan primary showed how anger among Arab American and progressive voters over his handling of the war could threaten his prospects in a vital general election swing state. Biden is also demanding House Speaker Mike Johnson put a foreign aid bill on the floor that would send $60 billion in weapons and other aid to Ukraine.Last year, Biden’s annual address was something of a triumph, as he shut down Republicans who heckled him and laid a trap for them as Democrats sought to portray the House majority as extreme. The president positioned himself as the last line of defense against the excesses of what he has called “ultra MAGA” Republicans. This is still the cornerstone of his reelection strategy.This year, the visual impression that the oldest president in history sends about his vigor and mental acuity may be as important as anything he actually says."}
{"title": "", "text": "Last summer, on a hot and humid July night at her home in Baltimore, Krystal Gonzalez was jolted to her feet by her husband’s screams. He almost never raised his voice.Gonzalez could not register the words her husband was crying out, except their daughter’s name: “Aaliyah was shot!”Hours earlier, their daughter said one last “I love you” as she walked out the door and headed to a block party with a friend. The next time Gonzalez saw her daughter, who had graduated from high school just three weeks earlier, her body was covered with a white sheet at the scene of a mass shooting at the yearly celebration known as Brooklyn Day.The moment Gonzalez arrived, she was getting ready to kick off her slippers and sprint to find her daughter, when she looked to her left and saw Aaliyah’s foot sticking out from under the sheet.She knew it was her.“The police officers are saying, ‘Ma’am, you don’t want to see her like this.’ And I’m like, ‘You don’t know. You don’t know. I need her. Oh my god, I need her,’” Gonzalez told CNN.It was the worst night of her life, Gonzalez said, and it plays on repeat in her mind every day. Her 18-year-old daughter was one of two people killed in the mass shooting, which left 28 others injured, when gunfire erupted at around 12:30 a.m., July 2, in the Brooklyn Homes neighborhood of south Baltimore.Five people, including three juveniles, have been arrested in connection with the shooting, but no one has been charged in the killings of Aaliyah Gonzalez or 20-year-old Kylis Fagbemi.Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott doesn’t know where the guns came from or how they ended up in his city, but he is almost certain they were trafficked across state lines.Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show most firearms recovered from crimes in Maryland do not originate there but only law enforcement officials can see the weapons’ history. Public officials, such as Mayor Scott, are barred by a provision in federal law known as the Tiahrt Amendment from accessing the ATF firearms trace database, the only source for information about the manufacturer, distributor, point of sale and recovery of guns linked to violent crime nationwide.Scott and the city council of Baltimore are suing the ATF, arguing he and local lawmakers cannot stop the flow of guns without knowing where they come from, hobbling their efforts to spot trends and hold unlawful dealers accountable.The mayor says Baltimore has no gun stores but 84% of homicides reported in the city since 2007 were firearm deaths, according to city officials in the suit.In its lawsuit, the city said the ATF adopted an overly narrow interpretation of the law, arguing it cannot prevent the disclosure under the 2009 Open FOIA Act. More than 60 Democrats in Congress seemingly agree, penning a letter to President Joe Biden in September, urging him to direct the Department of Justice to review its interpretation of the amendment.“When you’re dealing with an issue as complicated as gun violence, you need every single tool at your disposal and as long as we don’t have access to this information, we won’t have every tool,” Scott told CNN.Biden has promised to improve access to firearms data, campaigning in 2020 on his intent to repeal provisions like Tiahrt as part of his agenda to crack down on the nation’s gun violence epidemic. But he has yet to use his executive authority to order a review.A White House spokesperson told CNN, “Early in the Administration, the White House did ask the Department of Justice to review its interpretation of the Tiahrt Amendment,” and referred to the DOJ for further comment.When reached by CNN, the Department of Justice did not provide a comment.Gun rights organizations and law enforcement groups supporting Tiahrt, such as the Fraternal Order of Police and the Firearm Industry Trade Association, assert releasing such sensitive data would jeopardize criminal investigations and put firearm retailers at risk. Gun policy and violence prevention experts counter the agency can safeguard data while giving critical information to localities.Research shows many weapons are used repeatedly to commit crime, according to Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami who previously served as the director of the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.“Knowing that information allows the city and the law enforcement to crack down on businesses that might be acting nefariously,” Piquero said. “If you don’t know the nature of the problem, how are you going to direct resources to where the problem is, and or where it’s coming from?”‘Too many guns fall into the wrong hands,’ ATF saysThe ATF processes tracing requests for firearms linked to crimes for thousands of law enforcement agencies, urging them to take a gun’s serial number, if it has one, and pinpoint when the firearm went from lawful commerce into the black market.The goal of the agency’s national tracing center is to slow down those pathways or stop them completely, ATF Director Steven Dettelbach told CNN.“There are too many guns that fall into the wrong hands in this nation,” Dettelbach said. “It is too easy to move firearms from the legal market to that illegal black market.”Dettelbach would not comment on the Tiahrt Amendment but noted Congress “has restrictions on how we can share, and use, and divulge trace information,” adding the ATF does not “write the laws, we abide by them.”Tiahrt named after proponent of gun rightsThe Tiahrt Amendment, first enacted as a rider to appropriations legislation in 2003, grants the ATF one exception to blocking the public disclosure of information from its firearm trace database.It allows the agency to release “statistical aggregate data regarding firearm traffickers and trafficking channels, or firearms misuse, felons, and trafficking investigations,” the rider states.The agency released its first national report on US crime guns in more than 20 years, which revealed trends from 2017 to 2021, including about a quarter million gun thefts from private owners each year, among other findings.Despite the restriction, there is nothing in the data that would reveal the identities of who is being investigated for any crime, according to Daniel Webster, a research scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.“You could analyze the data and make predictions on who might be under investigation; but you’d likely be wrong,” Webster told CNN.The rider was named after then-Kansas Rep. Todd Tiahrt, a Republican, who put it into the bill because “I wanted to make sure I was fulfilling the needs of my friends who are firearms dealers,” he said at the time.“I take him at his word,” Webster said.At the time, cities nationwide were bringing lawsuits against the gun industry after research using crime gun trace data showed 1% of licensed gun dealers sold nearly 60% of the guns used in crime and implicated “corrupt licensed gun dealers in channeling hundreds of guns to criminals,” Webster said.But Congress did not address the root problems revealed by the research, instead opting to take action to protect the gun industry from “stronger regulations, oversight, and litigation against corrupt gun dealers,” said Webster.The Baltimore lawsuit and the letter to Biden from Democrats in Congress highlight a central sticking point that has fueled the debate surrounding the Tiahrt Amendment, according to Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis Health.“It has been clear that the language of the amendment has been ambiguous enough that it has had different interpretations, and the language has changed over time,” Wintemute said.Lawmakers can rescind or alter the language in the amendment, he added.“It’s a real shame … That every city in the country doesn’t have access to these data so they can study the flow of crime guns in their own city,” Wintemute said.Tiahrt supporters: Data ‘misused’ by gun control groupsGun rights organizations like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry trade association, argued in their support of the rider the tracing data was previously “misused by gun control groups in litigation against industry members as a substitute for actual evidence of wrongdoing.”In January, the foundation filed a motion to intervene in Baltimore’s lawsuit against the ATF, saying in a statement the data sharing “would jeopardize ongoing criminal investigations, putting the lives of law enforcement, witnesses, cooperating firearm retailers and others at risk.”Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the foundation, told CNN it’s clear Congress is not going to repeal Tiahrt because it had the support of major law enforcement groups as well as the Justice Department when it was enacted.Even if the gun tracing data reveals a high number of crime guns originating from a single source, Keane said, “it’s not indicative that anybody has done anything wrong.”Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat who signed the letter to Biden, told CNN, “More needs to be done.”The goal, Frost said, is not to take away guns from lawful owners, but to implement common sense gun control policies to save lives.“Congress needs to act, but we also need to have someone in the White House who’s willing to sign that legislation and continue to push ATF to develop rules that will make us safer,” he added.Mayor Scott says his efforts are not targeting lawful firearms owners and dealers.“This is trying to save American lives and help police investigations so that they’re not tracking down the same guns coming from the same stores each and every year, which is happening on the streets of Baltimore and cities around this country right now.”For Aaliyah’s mother, the result of gun violence is as personal as it is irreversible.“I have to close my eyes and envision her speaking to me, her giving me a hug. I have to do these things in order for me to survive, right?” Gonzalez said. “When you shot Aaliyah, she didn’t get back up. That was permanent.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday forcefully called for more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying that people in the region are “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and urging Israel to do more in one of the strongest pushes by a US official to date.Harris – who was in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday – has been closely monitoring the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and has been involved in the post-conflict planning for the besieged coastal enclave.Her Sunday remarks marked an escalation in the US push to address the situation in Gaza. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” Harris said.Her comments also come at a critical moment in the Israel-Hamas war. On Monday, the vice president is expected to meet with Benny Gantz, a key member of the Israeli War Cabinet and rival to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in Washington as the US continues to advocate a temporary ceasefire and hostage release.“What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration,” Harris said, citing the deaths of dozens of Palestinians amid Israeli gunfire and panic at Gaza food lines.“Our hearts break for the victims of that horrific tragedy and for all the innocent people in Gaza who are suffering from what is clearly a humanitarian catastrophe. People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane,” she continued.Harris also echoed calls by President Joe Biden for a six-week ceasefire — a proposal that would allow for the release of hostages held by Hamas and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.“Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire, for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said to cheers from the crowd. “Hamas claims it wants a ceasefire. Well, there is a deal on the table. And as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal. Let’s get a ceasefire. Let’s reunite the hostages with their families. And let’s provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza,” she added.On Saturday, the United States and Jordan air-dropped humanitarian aid into Gaza after Biden had asserted that the US would pull out “every stop” to get more aid into the territory.Senior administration officials touted the effort as successful but maintained that more needs to be done to address the crisis in Gaza, including ensuring land crossings are available to send more assistance into the region. Officials are also exploring a maritime corridor to deliver aid.An annual commemorationSpeaking at the site of a critical moment for the civil rights movement, Harris also warned Sunday that 59 years after Bloody Sunday, Americans’ freedoms were again at risk as she drew a direct link to “extremist” Republican efforts to restrict reproductive rights, voting rights and other issues.“Selma, the challenges we currently face are not unlike the challenges faced by those 600 brave souls 59 years ago,” she said before marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the site of violence in 1965 as 600 people began a march from Selma to Montgomery, demanding an end to discrimination in voter registration.In 1965, state and local lawmen in Alabama attacked the marchers on the bridge with billy clubs and tear gas, driving them back to Selma. Seventeen people were hospitalized and dozens more were injured by police. Months after the brutality, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.“In this moment, we, too, then are confronted with a fundamental question: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, liberty, and justice, or a country of injustice, hate, and fear? We each have the power to answer that question, with our voice, with our feet, and with our votes,” Harris said Sunday.The vice president also said that “the fight for freedom is not over,” pointing to efforts to curb voting rights, reproductive rights and the ability to live free of gun violence.Harris’ visit to Selma marked the fifth time she has participated in the annual civil rights pilgrimage. She attended as a senator in 2018, as a presidential candidate in 2020, and as vice president in 2022. She also took part virtually in 2021."}

You wouldn’t think it’s still out there,” Reynolds told reporters after the match. “It’s a bit of a shock.”Roosters coach Trent Robinson told reporters he had not spoken to Leniu about the incident in the locker room after the game.“I don’t know what happened … He [Mam] obviously made the complaint but that doesn’t mean that it’s right. It will go through the formal process as it should,” Robinson said.The Sydney Morning Herald reported Leniu was involved in a verbal confrontation with Broncos players the night after the match, with both teams staying in the same hotel.The match was the second of two games being played in Las Vegas as the NRL attempts to increase global interest in the sport. The Roosters won the match 20-10. More than 40,000 spectators were in attendance at the Allegiant Stadium, according to the league.“There is no place in sport for these types of slurs. We pride ourselves on being inclusive. It’s unacceptable in this day and age,” NRL CEO Andrew Abdo told Nine News.“The process will unfold. We are aware of the issue and it’s gonna be dealt with.”"}

{"title": "", "text": "Malaysia may renew the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, the country’s transport minister said Sunday, as the 10th anniversary of its disappearance nears.Flight MH370 became one of the world’s most puzzling aviation mysteries when it vanished with 239 aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Despite the launch of the largest aviation search in history, virtually nothing of the aircraft has since been found.But days ahead of the 10th anniversary, Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke vowed to “do everything possible to solve this mystery once and for all.”“Meaningful changes have been made to prevent a repeat of this tragedy, but I am also clearly aware that the task remains incomplete,” Loke said at an event to mark the disappearance of the Boeing 777.The US-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity had made a “credible” new search proposal, Loke said, without providing details. The company has previously made two fruitless attempts at finding the plane.“The Ministry of Transport are ready to invite Ocean Infinity to Malaysia to discuss the proposal of a no-find, no-fee proposal. We are waiting for Ocean Infinity to provide the suitable dates and I will meet them any time that they are ready to come to Malaysia,” Loke said.He said he would do “everything possible” to get Cabinet approval for a new contract with Ocean Infinity.“I am glad that there is some progress in some of the new research and new technologies, which have been put into place and we really hope that the search can find the plane,” Loke said.The mystery surrounding MH370 has gripped the world since its disappearance nearly a decade ago. While the plane has not been found, clues have been scattered across nearby seas.Debris confirmed or believed to be from the aircraft has washed up along the African coast and on islands in the Indian Ocean, including a wing flag in Tanzania, a wing fragment in Mauritius and a flaperon in Reunion Island.Loke said the tragedy had been a “wake-up call to the aviation sector at home and abroad.”“As we approach the 10 years remembrance of this heart-wrenching tragedy, it is a painful reminder of the decade-long journey of grief and resilience that loved ones of the victims have endured,” he said.Ocean Infinity last attempted to find the missing plane in 2018, with Malaysia offering up to $70 million if the firm had found it."}
{"title": "", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won the Republican presidential primary in Washington, DC, after three days of voting in the party’s only capital polling location – a downtown hotel.Haley’s victory – her first of the primary – comes on the eve of what is expected to be a decisive week in the GOP primary, as she attempts one last stand as the race turns national. Former President Donald Trump has dominated every other early nominating contest and is poised to rack up more delegates on Super Tuesday.“It’s not surprising that Republicans closest to Washington dysfunction are rejecting Donald Trump and all his chaos,” Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement that touted the former governor as the first woman to win a GOP presidential primary.Haley’s victory, though a first, did not come as a major surprise. Many in Washington believed the District represented her best, and perhaps only, chance to win a primary. Trump’s hold on the capital’s GOP, which counts roughly 22,000 registered voters, has never quite reflected his dominance across the country. Trump won the primary in 2020, running uncontested, but finished third in the 2016 cycle. Haley held an event on Friday with local GOP leaders, a clear sign of optimism.The Trump campaign, in a statement, sought to spin Haley’s win into a loss.“Tonight’s results in Washington D.C. reaffirm the object of President Trump’s campaign — he will drain the swamp and put America first,” Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “The swamp has claimed their queen.”Republicans will mostly forget about Washington now, at least in the coming general election. Biden won it in 2020 with more than 92% of the vote. The District has never supported a Republican presidential candidate. The GOP’s high-water mark came in 1972, when Richard Nixon managed a little more than 21% during a landslide reelection."}
{"title": "", "text": "Last month, news surfaced that major companies like Walmart, Starbucks, Delta and Chevron were using AI to monitor employee communications. The reaction online was swift, with employees and workplace advocates worrying about a loss of privacy.But experts say that while AI tools might be new, watching, reading and tracking employee conversations is far from novel. AI might be more efficient at it — and the technology might raise some new ethical and legal challenges, as well as risk alienating employees — but the fact is workplace conversations have never really been private anyway.“Monitoring employee communications isn’t new, but the growing sophistication of the analysis that’s possible with ongoing advances in AI is,” said David Johnson, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.“What’s also evolving is the industry’s understanding of how monitoring in this way impacts employee behavior and morale under various circumstances, along with the policies and boundaries for acceptable use within the workplace.”A recent study by a company called Qualtrics, which uses AI to help filter employee engagement surveys, found that managers are bullish on AI software but that employees are nervous, with 46% calling its use in the workplace “scary.”“Trust is lost in buckets and gained back in drops, so missteps in applying the technology early will have a long tail of implications for employee trust over time,” said Johnson, even as he called a future of AI-powered employee monitoring “inevitable.”How it’s usedOne company that’s getting AI into common work-related software, including Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Meta’s Workplace platform, is seven-year-old startup Aware.Aware is working with Starbucks, Chevron, Walmart and others; the startup says its product is meant to pick up on everything from bullying and harassment to cyberattacks and insider trading.Data stays anonymous until the technology finds instances that it’s been asked to highlight, Aware says. If there’s an issue, it will then be flagged to HR, IT or legal departments for further investigation.A Chevron spokesperson told CNN the company is using Aware to help monitor public comments and interactions on its internal Workplace platform, where employees can post updates and comments.Meanwhile, a Starbucks spokesperson said it uses the technology to improve its employees’ experience, including watching its internal social platforms for trends or feedback.Walmart told CNN it uses software to keep its online internal communities safe from threats or any other inappropriate behavior as well as to track trends among employees.Delta said it uses the software to moderate its internal social platform, routine monitoring of trends and sentiments, and record retention for legal purposes.Other monitoring services exist, too. Cybersecurity company Proofpoint uses similar technology to help monitor cyber risks, such as incoming phishing scams or if an employee is downloading and sending sensitive work data to their personal email account. (Disclosure: CNN’s parent company Warner Brothers Discovery is a subscriber.)Proofpoint, which is used by many Fortune 100 companies, recently rolled out newer capabilities to restrict the use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, on company systems if it’s against company policies. This would prevent employees from not sharing sensitive company data with an AI model, which could resurface in future responses.Still, the inclusion of AI in the workplace raises concerns for employees who may feel like they’re under surveillance.Reece Hayden, a senior analyst at ABI Research, said it’s understandable that some workers could feel a “big brother effect.”“This could have an impact on willingness to message and speak candidly with colleagues over internal messaging services like Microsoft Teams,” he said.A new spin on an old methodSocial media platforms have long used similar methods. Meta, for example, uses content moderation teams and related technologies to manage abuse and behaviors on its platforms. (Meta has recently been heavily criticized over allegations of inadequate moderation, in fact, particularly around child sex abuse.)At the same time, employee behavior has been monitored on work systems since the dawn of email. Even when employees are not on a secure work network, companies are able to monitor activity through browsers. (Aware, however, only works on corporate communications services, not browsers.)“​​Trying to understand employee patterns is not a new concept,” Hayden said, pointing to companies tracking things like log on times and meeting attendance.But what’s changing with this process is applying more advanced AI tools directly into employee workflows. AI software could allow companies to quickly analyze thousands of data points and key words to give insight into trends and what workers are discussing in real time.Hayden said companies may want to track employee conversations not because they care about what your weekend plans or latest Netflix binge people are watching.“This will help gain more granular, real-time insights on employees,” Hayden said.He added that this can help companies better shape internal messaging, policies and strategies, based on what the software is learning about its workforce.The trust factorAlthough the rise of AI in the workplace could introduce legal and ethical challenges, along with issues around accuracy and relevancy, Johnson at Forrester Research said he views the biggest complication ahead as gaining employee trust in both the short and long term.Simply put, people don’t want to feel like they’re being watched.He said organizations need to be careful about how they embrace the technology; if a company uses it to determine how productive their employees are, or if workers are unhappy, followed by disciplinary action or termination, it could be years before their employees will trust them again.“It’s critically important to be cautious and deliberate” in using this technology, he said."}

{"title": "", "text": "Four decades after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition and given just six months to live, Bert Janssen has set a Guinness World Record as the longest-surviving transplant patient.“I want to be an example for people,” said the Dutchman, who was 17 when he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body.He says he is proof that living a long time with a heart transplant is possible.In 1984, the Netherlands had yet to perform its first heart transplant, so cardiologist Albert Mattart referred the teenager to Harefield Hospital in England.Janssen underwent transplant surgery in June that year after a heart became available following a tragic car crash in which two young adults died.The life-saving operation was carried out by transplant pioneer Magdi Yacoub.“I consider that day more important than my birthday,” said Janssen, who is now 57, married with two sons and a keen glider pilot.“I’ve never really looked this far ahead.”While he is fit and healthy, his heart medication causes side effects and in recent years he has had to slow down.“I still do more or less what I want (but) at a different pace,” he said.The average life expectancy for heart patients after a transplant is 16 years, according to Janssen’s current cardiologist, Casper Eurlings.Guinness World Records officially recognised Janssen’s achievement of living for 39 years and 100 days after receiving his transplant.The previous record was 34 years and 359 days, set by Canadian Harold Sokyrka in 2021, according to Guinness.Transplant patients “need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be active. That’s what Mr. Janssen did,” Eurlings said.Yacoub has since thanked Janssen for his achievements and dedication to global health.“But it’s really me who should be thanking him,” Janssen said."}

{"title": "", "text": "For one of Germany’s most established soccer teams, earning a nickname for your propensity to fall short at the final hurdle isn’t ideal.For Bayer Leverkusen it was the moniker ‘Neverkusen,’ notably in 2002 when a team, which included Michael Ballack, Oliver Neuville, Dimitar Berbatov, Lúcio and Zé Roberto, finished a point behind Bundesliga winner Borussia Dortmund, lost the German Cup final and the Champions League final to Real Madrid thanks to Zinedine Zidane’s wonder volley.However, after years of hurt and ridicule from opposition fans, Leverkusen’s fortunes might have finally turned, and the club’s renaissance has a lot to do with one man.Xabi Alonso was appointed the club’s head coach in October 2022, with Leverkusen languishing near the bottom of the German table. In just under 18 months, the former Spain international has guided Leverkusen to top of the Bundesliga table, wowing fans and reportedly earning himself plenty of interest from some of Europe’s top clubs.Alonso has been linked to impending managerial vacancies at two of his former teams – the Bundesliga’s second-placed Bayern Munich and Liverpool of the English Premier League.The 42-year-old began his professional playing career at Real Sociedad before moving to Liverpool in 2004 where he starred for the Merseyside club for five years, including the club’s famous 2005 Champions League victory in Istanbul, before moving to Real Madrid for five more years. He ended his playing career with three trophy-filled seasons at Bayern Munich.For the Spanish national team, he was a regular during the nation’s golden period. As part of a star-studded midfield, Alonso won 114 caps, winning the World Cup once and two European Championships.Prior to being appointed Leverkusen’s manager, Alonso had coached Real Madrid’s Under-14 team and Real Sociedad’s B team.Whether he remains in Leverkusen or chooses to move on at the end of the season, Alonso has become the hottest managerial property in Europe through his ability to transform Leverkusen’s fortunes and the stylish football his players have showcased.Alonso has stressed he remains focused on his current job with Leverkusen – saying in February that “it is normal to have questions but it is not an issue for me” – and his team has showed no signs of letting up.Finishing strongSunday’s 2-0 victory over rivals Köln in a Rhein derby match was the latest in a long line of impressive performances from Leverkusen as the club extended its lead at the top of the Bundesliga table to 10 points following Bayern’s draw on Friday.The victory was a perfect encapsulation of the job Alonso has done. The team dominated possession, had the lion’s share of the chances and two of the team’s stars who have blossomed under his leadership – defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Alejando Grimaldo – scored the goals.Grimaldo joined in the summer from Benfica with little fanfare before going onto become a potent attacking threat, scoring nine and assisting nine from left back. Frimpong has had a similarly effective season from right back, scoring eight goals and providing six assists.Alonso’s deployment of a back three, two defensive midielders and versatile attacks has consistently bamboozled defenses. John Muller of The Athletic has described Alonso as wanting “his team to play it short, on the grass and straight up the middle so fast it’ll make your head spin.”The win means Leverkusen has not lost a game all season, extending the club’s unbeaten run to 34 games in all competitions.“There are still a few games to play. We have seen in the past what else can happen,” Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tag told Dazn after the victory over Köln. “It’s important to maintain focus.”Leverkusen has capitalized on an inconsistent season from Bayern, the winner of the last 11 Bundesliga titles, but it has done so in emphatic fashion. So much so that Bayern have decided to call time on Thomas Tuchel’s tenure as head coach at the end of this season.Alonso’s team has had plenty of statement victories along the way this season, none more so than its 3-0 demolition of Bayern in February, a win which turned Leverkusen from title contenders to favorites.There are 10 games remaining in the Bundesliga season and Leverkusen is the strong favorite to win its first ever league title. And with Leverkusen in semifinals of the domestic cup and the round-of-16 stage of the Europa League, Alonso could cap off a memorable second season in first-team management with a hat-trick of trophies."}
{"title": "", "text": "Some voters in North Carolina and Alabama are selecting US House candidates Tuesday in contests dramatically reshaped by congressional redistricting in recent months.In North Carolina – where members of the Republican-controlled General Assembly drew a congressional map last fall that heavily favors their party – the GOP is poised to win at least 10 of 14 House seats this year, up from the current 7-7 partisan split. Flipping several seats now held by Democrats could help Republicans retain their threadbare majority in the chamber after November’s elections.Three Democratic incumbents in North Carolina – Reps. Jeff Jackson, Wiley Nickel and Kathy Manning – opted to head for the exits or seek a different elective office, rather than run for reelection in newly redrawn, Republican-friendly districts. In addition, two GOP House members – Reps. Dan Bishop and Patrick McHenry – also decided to leave Congress after this year, creating vacancies in districts that favor their party.In Alabama, meanwhile, new lines have triggered an incumbent-versus-incumbent primary Tuesday for one House seat and could set up a history-making outcome this fall if Alabamians choose, for the first time, to send two Black lawmakers to the US House.Legal confrontations lead to new Alabama linesIn a legal confrontation that drew national attention to Alabama, a federal court approved a new congressional map last year that gives the state’s African American residents – who make up about 27% of the population – the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice in a second House district.(Currently, Black voters make up the majority of voters in just one district out of seven in Alabama. It’s represented by Democrat Terri Sewell, the only Black member of the state’s congressional delegation.)The contest for the state’s newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District – which cuts across a southern swath of Alabama and has a significant Black population – has drawn 18 candidates: 11 Democrats and seven Republicans. Given racial voting patterns in the state, political observers say a Democrat is likely to prevail in the fall and a Black candidate could emerge as the victor. Most of the Democrats seeking the nomination are African American, as are several of the Republican contenders.Several state lawmakers are seeking the Democratic nod, including Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, state Sen. Merika Coleman and state Reps. Napoleon Bracy, Jr., Juandalynn Givan and Jeremy Gray.Other Democratic contenders include James Averhart, a former US House candidate, and executive director of NAACP’s Alabama branch, and Shomari Figures, a former aide to US Attorney General Merrick Garland, who also served in the White House during the Obama administration. Figures hails from a politically prominent Mobile family, and his mother is a state senator.Daniels and Figures led the Democratic field in fundraising at the end of the pre-primary reporting period on February 14, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.If no candidate secures more than 50% support Tuesday, the top two contenders will face off in an April 16 runoff.The court-ordered redistricting has also thrown two Republican incumbents – Reps. Jerry Carl and Barry Moore – into the first member-versus-member primary of the 2024 election.Moore currently represents the 2nd District. Both men were first elected to Congress in 2020 and have sought to position themselves as the true conservative in the contest.North Carolina’s open seats draw multiple contendersThe five open seats in the Tar Heel State have attracted a raft of Republicans contenders.Fourteen candidates, for instance, are running in the GOP primary for Nickel’s redrawn 13th District seat, which now includes communities that ring Raleigh and some counties along the border with Virginia.The GOP hopefuls include the top spenders in the race: Smithfield lawyer Kelly Daughtry, Wake Forest businessman Fred Von Canon and Brad Knott, a former federal prosecutor from Raleigh. Daughtry and Von Canon, who each have partly self-financed their campaigns, have made immigration a top issue in their campaign ads.Another GOP contender, physician Josh McConkey, has drawn headlines for pledging to plow his recent lottery winnings into the race.Multiple candidates also are vying for the open seats now held by Manning and Jackson, who is running for state attorney general. Contenders for Jackson’s reconfigured 14th District seat include current state House Speaker Tim Moore, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.Trump also has endorsed former Capitol Hill staffer and ex-health insurance industry lobbyist Addison McDowell, one of six Republicans seeking to succeed Manning in the redrawn 6th District. Former US Rep. Mark Walker, who represented the Greensboro-area district in Congress for three terms, also is running in the primary. The conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth, meanwhile, is backing Bo Hines, who was the GOP nominee for the 13th District in 2022 but lost to Wiley.Primary candidates in North Carolina must receive at least 30% of the vote to avoid a potential May 17 runoff."}
{"title": "", "text": "The Boston Celtics won their 11th game in a row on Sunday, rolling to a stunning 52-point rout, 140-88, of the Golden State Warriors.In a rematch between the two teams that contested the 2022 NBA Finals, the Celtics ran away with proceedings early on. All-Star wing Jaylen Brown scored 19 points in the first quarter alone to propel Boston to 44-22 lead after the first quarter.The Celtics’ advantage had ballooned to 44 points by the end of the first half, Boston’s largest halftime lead in franchise history.Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was naturally unimpressed with what he had seen and pulled the plug in the second half, not giving any minutes to the ‘Big Three’ of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green after the break.It was a nightmare evening for Curry – the two-time MVP scored only four points, shooting 2-of-13 from the field and uncharacteristically missing all nine of his three-point attempts as Golden State’s offense completely stagnated.The Celtics pushed the lead past the 50-point mark in the third quarter before Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla also turned to his bench for the rest of the game.The 52-point margin of victory was third-largest in Celtics’ history. Boston also became the first NBA team ever to win three games by at least 50 points in a single season, per StatMuse, after demolishing the Indiana Pacers and Brooklyn Nets earlier in the season.“It feels great, but at the same time, it’s always within humility,” said Brown, who finished with 29 points, three rebounds and three assists.“At any given point, that can be us and we don’t take the game for granted. We didn’t come out and mess around and that’s just how we show our respect to the game.We handle business and take care of it, but we don’t do it arrogantly. We do it with humility. And it’s a lot of respect for the Golden State Warriors, but we feel like it’s our time now.”MVP candidate Jayson Tatum scored 27 points for the Celtics on his 26th birthday, with Payton Pritchard adding 19 off the bench.Sunday’s win was Boston’s 11th in a row – the C’s have outscored their opponents by an average of 22.1 points per game during this winning streak, per the organization.The Warriors, meanwhile, were held to a season-low 88 points and fell to their worst loss of the current campaign and third biggest in franchise history.Despite the lopsided scoreline, Kerr was not worried by the defeat and was keen for his squad to move on.“This is a ‘flush it down the toilet,’” Kerr said postgame. “We had a great road trip, 3-1, we’ve had a million games. Boston was amazing, we weren’t beating them today. We’ll head home and get ready for Wednesday.”Lester Quiñones, who had his two-way deal converted to a standard NBA contract last month, led the Warriors in scoring with 17 points off the bench.Boston’s dominant offensive performance had four-time champion Curry reminiscing after the game.“They’re hitting 10 threes in the first quarter, that’s what we used to do teams,” Curry told the media.“They’re the best team in the league right now, and they played like it … that was hard to watch from the other side.”The Dubs drop to 32-28 on the season and face another Eastern powerhouse in the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. The Celtics, owners of the best record in the NBA at 48-12, visit the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday."}
{"title": "", "text": "When Shane Pennington, a 56-year-old cattle farmer near Canadian, Texas, first saw flames from an enormous wildfire approaching the ranch he manages, his first concern wasn’t his home. It was his animals.Pennington told CNN he returned to the ranch to find around 50 cattle dead, with nursing cows desperately searching for their lost calves.As the flames tore through the ranch, they caused excruciating injuries, burning off some animals’ tails and rendering others blind. “It just burned all the hair off them,” he said. “Their feet are coming off. Their hooves, they’re bloody.”Some of them are “cows that I raised right here,” he said. “It’s just hard to see them burn up.”Pennington is one of many cattle farmers whose livelihoods have been devastated by the Smokehouse Creek Fire, the largest wildfire in Texas history, which has burned more than a million acres of land across the panhandle.The state is home to about 4.1 million beef cattle, according to David P. Anderson, professor of agricultural economics at Texas A&M University. And more than 85% are in the panhandle, according to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller.Farmers and agricultural experts say the wildfire will continue to affect the cattle industry for years to come.In addition to the short-term effects of cattle killed and grievously injured by the flames, there will be lasting repercussions, as herds cultivated for years struggle to recover and traumatized cows fail to reproduce.Speaking with CNN’s Omar Jimenez on CNN Newsroom Saturday, Miller asked for donations and prayers for Texas residents who have lost homes and livestock in the wildfires.“There’s no grass, there’s no water for the livestock,” Miller stressed. “We’ve lost over 3,000 head, which is a very small number, that will double or triple easily. We’ve got cattle that we’re going to have to euthanize because of the damage to their hooves, their udders. We’ll just have to put them down.”For Pennington, the inferno has been both financially and emotionally catastrophic.“Your job is to keep them alive, not to destroy them,” he said. “It’s tough.”“Even if they survive it, more than likely they’re gonna get pneumonia, they’re gonna get sick, they’re gonna die,” Pennington added.He said he’s already euthanized some animals due to their injuries and anticipates the number will continue growing as he identifies which animals will be unable to recover from their wounds and illnesses.And some animals will need to be culled simply because the hundreds of bales of hay meant to feed them burned up in the flames, he said.It will likely take years for the business to recover. “We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us,” Pennington said.Death and destruction hit iconic industryThe cattle business in Texas is worth an estimated $15.5 billion, making it by far the most profitable agricultural commodity in the state, according to the state’s Department of Agriculture. There are millions of cattle across the panhandle specifically, with some counties counting more cattle than people among its residents, the department reported.“The losses could be catastrophic for those counties,” Miller said in a news release. “Farmers and ranchers are losing everything.”Brandon Meier, a local rancher, volunteer fire chief, and agricultural science teacher at a high school in the panhandle town of Canadian, described the raging inferno as a “monster.”Seeing the way the flames transformed the landscape was “surreal,” he told CNN.“I’ve seen this country, how it is with grass and sagebrush and cattle roaming out there, and the next day we come down here; it’s a barren desert,” he said.In addition to damage to their hooves and eyes, many of the cattle are also suffering from smoke inhalation which can cause fatal pneumonia, Meier said. And udder burns have made it impossible for some cows to nurse their calves, requiring them to be bottle-fed with milk substitutes.The loss of life represents a massive loss of income for ranchers, he said.“A lot of these families are ranching families, and that’s their livelihood out there” in the panhandle, he said. “And we rely on that income … Our job isn’t 8 to 5. It’s 24/7, holidays, everything.”Flames deal lasting blow to ranchersRanchers and local authorities say although the wildfire is not expected to affect beef prices across the country, it may leave lasting economic scars for ranchers.Fields, the owner of the ranch where Pennington works, told CNN “a good productive cow” is worth between $2,000 and $2,400.Currently, he told CNN, he’s more concerned about “trying to make them comfortable” than worrying about the financial losses he’s suffered. He credited volunteer firefighters with saving his ranch house and helping preserve his property,He pointed out cattle prices were already high before the wildfire hit and they will likely continue to go up in the aftermath of the blaze.Anderson, the agricultural economics professor, told CNN the effect on cattle ranchers will be multifold. In addition to losing animals, affected farmers have also lost grass, hay, barns, and fencing to the blaze. A mile of fencing alone might cost between $15,000 and $18,000, he said.Some relief might come from government programs designed to help farmers in the wake of ecological disasters. The USDA has instructed farmers to document their losses and take photos of each dead animal for reimbursement through its disaster assistance programs.The Texas Department of Agriculture coordinates its own relief fund for farmers and is also working to connect farmers in need with hay through its “Hay Hotline.”Anderson said despite how challenging the wildfire will be for Texas ranchers, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on beef prices. The number of affected cattle is small compared to the total population across the US, he explained.“If the fire hits your ranch, it’s a huge disaster for you,” he said. “But we don’t expect to see price effects to consumers because of this.”For Pennington, the incident has proved the challenges of separating the business from the emotional side of his work.“As sentimental and as attached as you get, it still has to be treated like a business,” he said, surveying the herd of injured and traumatized animals.“But look at these baby calves. How could anybody be mean to any of them?” he said."}
{"title": "", "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife has hit out at an online report that “there is no more joy” in her husband’s life.Emma Heming Willis said in a video posted to her Instagram profile on Sunday that she had been “clickbaited” by a headline “to do with my own family.”Appearing angry and frustrated, Heming Willis said she had been “triggered” by the story, which she came across on Sunday morning.The former model, who did not identify the publication that ran the story, said the headline was “far from the truth” and that, in fact, the reality was “the complete opposite of that.”“A hundred percent there is grief and sadness and there is all of that, but you start a new chapter,” she said, going on to say that it is filled with love, connection, joy and happiness.Calling for more restraint in reporting such stories, she said: “I need society and whoever’s writing these stupid headlines to stop scaring people, stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that that’s it, it’s over, let’s pack it up, nothing else to see here, we’re done.”After retiring from acting in March 2022 due to a speaking disorder called aphasia, Willis was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), his family announced in February last year.FTD is a group of disorders caused by a buildup of tau and other brain cell destroying proteins in the brain’s frontal lobes (behind your forehead) or temporal lobes (behind your ears). The condition typically strikes between the ages of 45 and 64, according to Alzheimer’s Research UK.In an interview last year, Heming Willis admitted that the diagnosis had been tough on her husband, herself and their two daughters. Willis also has three older daughters with his former wife, actress Demi Moore.“What I’m learning is that dementia is hard,” Heming Willis told Hoda Kotb on the Today show on NBC. “It’s hard on the person diagnosed. It’s also hard on the family. And that is no different for Bruce or myself or our girls.”That said, in a written message accompanying her video, Heming Willis explained that there was a lot more to the family’s situation than many headlines suggest.She wrote: “My experience is that two things can be true and exist at the same time. Grief and deep love. Sadness and deep connection. Trauma and resilience. I had to get out of my own way to get here but once I arrived, life really started to come together with meaning and I had a true sense of purpose. There is so much beauty and soulfulness in this story.”She described such reports about “neurocognitive disease” as “misinformation,” adding: “I’m not even talking about my family, I’m used to the craziness of these farfetched headlines and stories. I’m just talking about baseline dementia awareness and what’s being fed to the public.”In a separate interview last year, Willis’ daughter Tallulah, from his marriage to Moore, said the family was keen to “spread awareness about FTD.”“If we can take something that we’re struggling with as a family, individually, to help other people, to turn it around, to make something beautiful about it – that’s really special for us,” she said on the “Drew Barrymore Show.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Biking in one of the West Coast’s biggest cities, police Officer Donny Mathew spotted something out of the corner of his eye.It was a glint, shining off a piece of aluminum foil in the hand of someone on the sidewalk.Mathew knew the man was using it to cook. And he knew the substance in the small, makeshift pan was the same potent, intensely addictive, synthetic opioid that has torn through Portland, Oregon, and countless other American communities in recent years, leaving a stunning trail of debilitating addiction and death:Fentanyl.“He was still actively smoking right when we rolled up,” said Mathew.The officer, his feet on the pedals, braked hard into a turn. He quickly dismounted his bike, approached the man and handed over a $100 citation.But that wasn’t all. Mathew also handed him a card printed with a phone number that could help erase both his new fine and – in the longer term, civic leaders here hope – the sort of illicit substance abuse that’s escalated on these streets amid the nationwide opioid epidemic.“They call this hotline, and they can get the citation paid for,” the officer explained – but only if they agree, with the trained substance abuse counselors on the line, to a medical screening that could serve as a critical gateway to addiction treatment.The strategy is in place as the city’s mayor, its county chairperson and the governor – all Democrats – in late January declared at 90-day state of emergency to address the public health and safety crisis driven by fentanyl in Portland’s Central City.State lawmakers, meanwhile, overwhelmingly approved a bill this week to reverse a 2020 measure that decriminalized possession of hard substances, including fentanyl, which now awaits approval by the state’s governor.Gov. Tina Kotek hasn’t decided whether to approve or veto the bill, a spokesperson for her office told CNN on Sunday.“Our country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly and addictive, and all are grappling with how to respond,” Kotek said in a news release in late January, announcing Portland’s fentanyl emergency declaration, vowing “unprecedented collaboration and focused resources” ahead of a “roadmap for next steps.”Off the bat, drug dealer arrests have increased, the fire department has launched an overdose rapid response team and outreach workers have begun “saturating” hot spots to help connect people with treatment, recovery and housing services, the city’s Community Safety Division Director Mike Myers said Thursday at a news conference.Also expected under the emergency declaration are public health campaigns and a further effort by officials to pool and “use data to identify and respond to acute needs and gaps in service,” then figure out how to fill them quickly – and long after the three-month emergency period expires.This formidable undertaking reflects the particular challenges of combatting fentanyl, which is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and very cheap to make and mix with other illicit substances.“This addictive behavior is not something to be taken lightly and, not to be like, ‘Oh, just get a job,’ or ‘Just get help,’” said Portland Police Chief Bob Day. “There are demons there that I could never understand.”The emergency mission, in fact, is nothing less than a race against a killer, said the head of outreach and treatment group Central City Concern. Fentanyl is “dirt cheap, it’s very dangerous,” Dr. Andy Mendenhall told CNN, and “it’s ubiquitous.”‘An extremely dangerous spike’As public health workers, outreach teams and police unite for the task, they forge ahead under Measure 110, a 2020 law enacted by statewide vote that declared a “health-based approach to addiction and overdose is more effective, humane and cost-effective than criminal punishments.”“Essentially what has happened is drugs in Oregon are the same as a traffic ticket,” Portland police Officer David Baer told CNN.Meantime, opioid overdose deaths in Oregon have increased from 280 in 2019 to 956 in 2022, with 628 recorded so far for last year, state data show. “We’re on an extremely dangerous spike,” Multnomah County Health Director Rachael Banks told CNN.Nationwide, the tally of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl rose almost four-fold over five years through 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. And though early research, published in JAMA Psychiatry, suggests no link between Measure 110 and Oregon’s increase in fatal overdoses, critics have blamed the law for the mounting toll.“You look at what has happened: open fentanyl, open drugs on the streets,” said Republican state Rep. Jeff Helfrich said, decrying Measure 110 as “an unmitigated disaster.”While the governor would not “Monday-morning quarterback” the cause of Portland’s downtown drug crisis and Mayor Ted Wheeler said city officials have “been working on it,” public health and outreach teams said their efforts to beat back fentanyl’s scourge are continually challenged by its extreme addictive quality.“It’s one of those things that even though you love your family, even though you love your friends and you want to be an outstanding member of society, all you really think about is your next use or your next high,” said Central City Concern Program Supervisor Dave Crosby, who once was unhoused and addicted to drugs.The first need is housing, doctor saysFentanyl’s potency “makes this battle a completely different fight,” said Mendenhall, whose organization annually serves over 14,000 people. That includes medical withdrawal management help for over 3,000 people each year, about half of whom use the drug, he said.As for a common trope that fentanyl users should simply exercise personal responsibility and pull themselves out of their downward spiral, the solution is not so simple, Mendenhall said, pointing to myriad personal factors that can lead patients to substance use, including multigenerational poverty, job loss, mental illness, depression and anxiety.“The first thing those folks need is shelter or housing in order to get stabilized enough to then potentially benefit from treatment resources,” Mendenhall said. As it stands, though, “there’s simply not enough resources for people who are seeking treatment and recovery.”And while declaring a public health and safety emergency is an important step, it is not akin to flipping a switch and unleashing a flow of resources and funding, officials said. Rather, it starts with gathering critical information about the true nature of the crisis.The emergency declaration in Portland’s Central City “allows many of the agencies to start to communicate and share data where we haven’t always done in the past,” said Dr. Richard Bruno, Multnomah County’s health officer. State, county and city officials are now operating under a unified command, officials said, to best determine what gaps in resources exist, what more can be done and where they should go.Action will be taken, officials said, to increase public awareness of fentanyl’s addictive qualities, create wider access to overdose reversal agents like naloxone and expand access to treatment and recovery, including ramping up visibility and coordination among non-profits that provide housing and addiction services.‘These are human beings’On the same day the Portland officers tried to steer the man with the shiny fentanyl pan to treatment services, they pulled up on bikes to another man openly using the drug.They gave him a citation – and a treatment card – as his friend Chelan stood nearby.She had spent over two years in prison for delivery of methamphetamine and heroin, and she’d also tried – but failed, so far – to curb her own fentanyl use through treatment, Chelan told CNN, which is referring to her by one name to ensure her privacy after she shared details of her personal struggle with drugs. Asked to explain what it’s like to try to stop using fentanyl, Chelan was speechless: “There are not many words to describe how difficult that is,” she said.But locking up people who struggle to stop abusing drugs is not the answer, she said. “It doesn’t do anybody any good to go to jail,” she said. “It’s like a bunch of criminals get together to talk about how to do crime better. If you weren’t traumatized before jail, you will be afterwards.”Even seeking help, though, can be a struggle: “People don’t know where to go, or who to call, or how to access the resources,” Chelan said. “There’s treatment facilities, but they’re all backed up right now.”As Portland’s state of emergency leans hard into delivering tangible help, it is also vital not to lose sight of the humanity, said Crosby of Central City Concern.“That’s someone’s daughter, that’s someone’s son, that’s someone’s parent,” he said. “And until we look at it from a person-centered approach – these are people, these are human beings, we need to help each other – the systemic change is not going to grow.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Haiti’s government declared a state of emergency on Sunday after thousands of inmates apparently escaped from its largest prison during a surge of gang violence that has upended the Caribbean nation for months.The government cited the “deterioration of security,” notably in the capital Port-au-Prince, and “increasingly violent criminal acts perpetrated by armed gangs,” including kidnappings and killings of citizens, violence against women and children and looting, according to a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, who is serving as acting prime minister.It also cited the attacks by armed groups on Saturday against the country’s two largest prisons, one in Port-au-Prince and another in Croix des Bouquets, which led to the escape of “dangerous prisoners” and caused deaths and injuries among police and prison staff.A United Nations’ source said Sunday that around 3,500 prisoners are believed to have escaped Haiti’s National Penitentiary in Port-Au-Prince during the weekend.There had been 3,687 prisoners at prison, according to the source. The UN mission in Haiti tracks incarcerated populations and humanitarian conditions in prisons in the country.According to Haitian lawyer Arnel Remy, head of the Collective of Lawyers for the Defense of Human Rights in Haiti, (CADDHO), a total of 3,597 prisoners escaped from the National Penitentiary. CNN cannot independently verify CADDHO’s figures.Remy said his team was at the prison on Sunday and told CNN the remaining inmates are being moved to other facilities and that the penitentiary is now empty and surrounded by police vehicles.The Haitian Ministry of Communication said in a statement Sunday that police confronted “heavily armed criminals seeking at any cost to free people from custody” and were “not able to stop the criminals from freeing a large number of prisoners.” The violence left several inmates and prison staff injured, it said.Earlier, in a post on X, one of Haiti’s police unions pleaded for all officers in the capital with access to cars and weapons to assist police battling to maintain control of the prison. It warned that if the attackers were successful, “we are done. No one will be spared in the capital because there will be 3,000 extra bandits,” according to the statement.Multiple security sources in Port-au-Prince told CNN that the most recent surge in violence, which began Thursday and has targeted police stations, the international airport and the penitentiary, is unprecedented in recent years.On Friday, Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, also known as Barbecue, said he would continue in his effort to try to oust Prime Minister Ariel Henry.“We ask the Haitian National Police and the military to take responsibility and arrest Ariel Henry. Once again, the population is not our enemy; the armed groups are not your enemy. You arrest Ariel Henry for the country’s liberation,” Cherizier said, adding, “With these weapons, we will liberate the country, and these weapons will change the country.”Cherizier is a former police officer who heads an alliance of gangs. He has faced sanctions from both the UN and the United States Department of Treasury.Public frustration, which had been building against Henry over his inability to curb the unrest, boiled over after he failed to step down last month, citing the escalating violence.Under a previous agreement, he had committed to hold elections and transfer power by February 7.Caribbean leaders said Wednesday that Henry had agreed to hold general elections no later than August 31, 2025.The recent fighting came as Henry was visiting Kenya to finalize details with Kenyan President William Ruto for the expected deployment of a multinational security support mission to Haiti.Speaking to CNN, a Haitian law enforcement source said gangs had attacked multiple police stations across the city since Thursday, killing at least four people, and burning some of the stations down.Meanwhile, gunfire near the airport on Thursday forced airlines to suspend flights.The US Embassy in Haiti issued a security alert Friday, warning of gunshots and disruptions to traffic near the domestic and international terminals, as well as surrounding areas including a hotel and the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police.In a statement Sunday, the embassy urged US citizens to leave the country due to violence, adding that it would be on limited operations Monday. The French Embassy in Haiti said it was suspending visa and administration services on Monday.Haiti has been gripped by a wave of unrest and gang violence in recent years.Warring gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, choking off vital supply lines to the rest of the country. Gang members have also terrorized the metropolitan population, forcing more than 300,000 people to flee their homes amid waves of indiscriminate killing, kidnapping, arson and rape.Some 1,100 people were killed, injured or kidnapped in January alone, in what the UN called the most violent month in two years."}

In return, Western analysts say Russia could be a source of technology and expertise for Kim as he refines a nuclear-capable missile program that could threaten not only his neighbors in East Asia, but possibly the mainland United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles."}
{"title": "", "text": "New Year’s Eve 2020 was peculiar for many of us. As Coronavirus continued to sweep the globe, usual end-of-year reflections were replaced by a build-up of collective grief. Around the world, Covid-19 socializing restrictions put obstacles in the way of celebrations.For German photographer Valentin Goppel, the uniqueness of the situation was underscored by his companions: Instead of his spending the night with his flatmates as he would do usually, he was instead alone with his girlfriend’s younger brother and two of his friends, making the initial images for what would become Goppel’s first photobook, “Zwischen den Jahren.”“For weeks before, her brother had tried to persuade his parents to let him spend New Year’s Eve with his friends, which (as a young person) I found really understandable, but his parents didn’t,” the photographer recalled in an interview with CNN. “In the end, (they relented when) he agreed to spend four days (quarantining) in his room afterwards. It was a strange thing, this commitment to meeting your friends just for a few hours — then spending days alone — but to him it was worth it.”After returning home from photographing the boys, Goppel confessed he pondered his reasons for doing so. “I was like ‘why am I doing all of this?’. I would rather have spent the time with my girlfriend!” But the evening became the starting point for a wider project about young people, lockdown and mental health.“Zwischen den Jahren” translates as “between the years” and is a common expression in Germany for the last days of December. The title is also, however, a rich characterization of the disorientated state of limbo experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly by teens and those at university.Encouraged by a commission from German newspaper Die Zeit, following his New Year’s Eve shoot, Goppel spent the next 18-months taking photos, with his young subjects frequently lit by the glow of a laptop screen, pictured wearing face masks, or meeting outdoors — the realities of life during the pandemic. In some instances, Goppel set up his camera and observed those around him, and at others he staged specific scenarios from the recent past.“Oftentimes it was, ‘I want to depict this memory, I want this to be a part of the project’, so there was a conscious decision before taking the picture,” he said. “And sometimes I was just waiting for something important to happen.” The last photograph for his project was taken in summer 2022.Goppel was living with his parents in Hanover when news of the first lockdown emerged, but by late 2020, the photographer was back sharing with flatmates, who became some of the book’s key protagonists. “The idea came out of the sense of ‘I am a part of this,’” he noted, reflecting on the book’s genesis and the shared experiences of those around him. “It then became very collaborative, working with my friends. In the end they were ‘our’ images more than only mine.”Despite this communal sensibility, the pandemic’s impact left Goppel and his friends with an altered sense of companionship, he said. As he explains in the book’s accompanying text, before Covid 1 in 10 German teenagers showed symptoms of depression; after the first lockdown it was 1 in 4.“I tried to get back into society, which was really hard,” the photographer remarked of the images he made towards the end. “You were back with your friends, but many of us felt disconnected from them, and very isolated still. That was a strange experience, because you could be in a group and still feel alone.”With open borders and international travel since resumed, more recently Goppel has been making photos on a road trip across America, photographing strangers with a new purpose, largely informed by the making of “Zwischen den Jahren.”“The Covid project set the path for what I’m doing now, and a rule that whatever I’m working on, I implement my perspective,” he said. “During Corona, I realised for the first time that whatever I, as an individual was experiencing, was important.”"}
{"title": "", "text": "Thousands of delegates from across China are gathering in Beijing this week for the start of the country’s most prominent annual political event, where leaders will signal how they plan to steer the world’s second largest economy in the year ahead — and try to dispel deepening concern about the challenges it faces.Projecting confidence is likely to be high on the agenda for Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his top Communist Party officials during the days-long, highly choreographed event, known as the “two sessions,” when China’s rubber stamp legislature and top advisory body convene.The largely ceremonial gathering is taking on heightened importance this year as China’s economy has been roiled by a property sector crisis, hefty local government debt, deflation, a stock market rout and tech friction with the US — all fueling questions about whether the country will lose steam before it reaches its goal of becoming a developed global power.It also will include a significant break with precedent: the scrapping of a closing press conference with China’s premier, a political tradition that has featured in the gathering for three decades – at a times providing a rare window into the thinking of China’s number two leader, who is nominally in charge of the economy.The press conference would also not take place for the rest of the current five year political cycle “unless there are very special circumstances,” spokesperson Lou Qinjian told reporters in Beijing Monday ahead of the legislative meeting’s opening day, citing other interview opportunities for media throughout the event. This year’s legislative gathering will also last just seven days, a shorter format than was typical prior to the pandemic.The changes are likely to add to broader concerns about transparency around China’s policymaking and further dim the premier’s profile, which had already been impacted by Xi’s hardline control over all policy areas, including the economy. Under Xi, the premier and the State Council, which functions as China’s cabinet, have been increasingly sidelined.“By design, they only want one voice — from the (Communist) Party. They don’t want other voices to dilute the voice of the party, which is controlled by Xi,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.That also means Xi is heavily under the spotlight as economic pain has sparked growing frustration within China. The gathering comes one year after he began a norm-shattering third term as president, having consolidated power atop the party and stacked its leadership with a raft of officials who appeared to be selected for their loyalty as much as experience.A year later — as an expected post-Covid recovery has yet to fully materialize, young people struggle to find jobs, investors grapple with market losses and small business owners fight to stay afloat — skepticism has been rising about the direction charted by the leader and his new team. Xi has also overseen a political shakeup in his own ranks, further marring the start of the new term.Those challenges may not pose a threat to Xi, who is China’s most powerful and authoritative leader in decades. But how his team addresses those concerns will have implications not only for the future of China and its 1.4 billion people, but the global economy at large — and Xi’s top officials are likely stepping into the meeting feeling that pressure.Policymakers, investors and business owners in capitals across the world will also be watching closely, especially in a year when America’s presidential election could further strain the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.“The government wants to use this platform to send signals that China’s economy in general is okay and is on the right trajectory,” said Chen Gang, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute.“Now there are a lot of doubts and suspicions about the capacity of the new administration … (so) they want to showcase that this government, the new administration led by (Xi’s number two) Premier Li Qiang, is capable of handling economic issues,” he said.Delegates convergeThe gathering, which takes place in Beijing’s cavernous Great Hall of the People, is the only time each year that the nearly 3,000-person legislature, the National People’s Congress, meets in person.The body has little power to chart the course ahead for the country, as major policy direction is set by the party, whose elite members make decisions in closed-door meetings throughout the year.But the two sessions provide an important platform for China’s notoriously opaque government to broadcast its strategy for economic, social and foreign policies and announce key indicators including China’s economic growth target, its budget deficit limit and military spending for the coming year.It’s also an opportunity for elite leaders to hear from delegates, who hail from across the country and different social sectors — though the space for such exchanges at the gathering and in general has shrunk as Xi has tightened ideological control and overseen a drive to crush views that deviate from the Communist Party line.Such controls have also appeared in recent debate about the economy, with some prominent economic analysts subjected to social media restrictions that seem designed to restrict their ability to speak out.“The regime often utilizes the annual conference to secure support from Chinese society and bolster confidence in the market,” said Xuezhi Guo, a professor of political science at Guilford College in the US.Now “this is particularly crucial given challenges like China’s real estate downturn, stock market crisis, high unemployment, and weakened demand,” he said.Observers will be parsing how leaders discuss or comment on key issues like China’s position on the self-governing island of Taiwan, its relations with the US and bid to strengthen innovation as Washington bolsters tech export controls.“It is conceivable that Xi may adopt a more conciliatory stance towards the US, temporarily shelving the confrontational ‘wolf warrior diplomacy,’ and redirecting efforts towards supporting both the bureaucracy and technocrats to ensure stability in China’s economy,” said Guo.Such a tone shift could also be signaled by the appointment of a new foreign minister at this year’s gathering – something analysts ahead of the gathering said could happen in the coming days, though an agenda of the event announced Monday did not mention personnel changes.The role has been filled, in what many expected to be a temporary capacity, by senior diplomat and former Foreign Minister Wang Yi since July, when his newly appointed successor Qin Gang was ousted without explanation after disappearing from public view.That dramatic moment was followed just weeks later by the disappearance and subsequent removal and replacement of another of Xi’s hand-picked, third-term officials: then Defense Minister Li Shangfu. Again, it was done without explanation alongside an anti-corruption drive and apparent purge within China’s military.While analysts said the surprise shake-up wasn’t a threat to Xi’s iron-clad grip on power, it did raise questions about his judgment, with lingering vacancies from those removals still a reminder of that.Besides the foreign minister role, two high-ranking posts in China’s cabinet previously occupied by Li and Qin also remain open.Economic challengesSigns leading up to the gathering suggest the Chinese government is gearing up to focus on supporting economic growth in the year ahead, but it’s unlikely China will unveil any major stimulus.“Beijing will likely use the two sessions to announce tactical measures aimed at boosting short-term confidence in China’s economy but without changing Xi’s underlying strategy of state-led development,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.The announcement of the economic growth target for 2024, set to be delivered by Premier Li on Tuesday, is among the most important issues to watch during the two sessions.Analysts widely expect Li to reveal a relatively ambitious growth target of “around 5%,” showing that policymakers are still focused on economic growth, even as challenges pile up.Observers will also be closely watching how markets respond. Heading into the gathering, many are skeptical that projections of confidence and measures announced at the event will be enough to restore optimism.But even if they don’t, that’s unlikely to dent Xi’s power.“The country’s economic problems are eroding ordinary people’s trust in the leadership’s ability to deliver higher growth and improved livelihoods,” said Asia Society’s Thomas.“However, Xi does not need to win elections so what matters most for him is elite control rather than popular approval. And the economy seems a long way from the type of collapse that could overwhelm the party’s sophisticated apparatus of repression.”"}

The 28-year-old serves as a director at an energy business operated by Reliance, the Indian conglomerate founded by his grandfather.Although Ambani and his 29-year-old girlfriend Radhika Merchant are not due to marry until July, no expense was spared at the lavish pre-wedding bash. Guests were served 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs, according to Reuters, which saw a copy of a planning document provided to invitees.The weekend’s festivities took place in Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat, close to Reliance’s main oil refinery.The city’s airport, which typically handles fewer than 10 flights a day, reported a surge in activity. In a post on X Saturday, airport authorities said around 130 flights had arrived for the extravaganza.Chartered jets from New Delhi and Mumbai were made available to guests, Reuters said, as were the services of hair stylists, makeup artists and drapists.The charitable arm of the Ambani’s family business, the Reliance Foundation, said that weavers had been deployed to produce “a tapestry of dreams” for the nuptials, while visually impaired artisans had been hired to make candles for guests.A new Hindu temple complex is being built specifically for the wedding and will later be opened to the public, the NGO added.On Wednesday, the Ambani family hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers."}
{"title": "", "text": "It rains an average of 171 days per year in Singapore. But one hotel in the Lion City is taking a gamble to ensure that rain doesn’t spoil its guests’ holidays.The InterContinental Singapore’s “Rain Resist Bliss” package will reimburse one night of a guest’s stay if one of their planned activities ends up getting rained out.“​​I was chatting with a group of friends about what’s next in luxury travel and one of them jokingly commented that being able to guarantee good weather would be the next level of ultimate luxury travel,” the hotel’s general manager, Andreas Kraemer, tells CNN. From there, the concept of a rain insurance package was born.Still, there are caveats. The InterContinental isn’t going to hand out cash every single time it rains. According to a release from the hotel, ​​the criteria is met when “rain duration exceeds 120 cumulative minutes within any 4-hour block of time during daylight hours.”The package also is only applicable to people staying in suites, which begin at 850 SGD ($633) a night for junior suites and start at 4,500 SGD ($3,349) for the presidential suite.The money comes in the form of a voucher, which must be spent at the InterContinental Singapore within one week, and the amount you get is equivalent to one night’s stay in your room category.Kraemer’s own personal rainy day favorite things to do in Singapore include visiting the Asian Civilizations Museum, taking a tour of Tiger Brewery and shopping at the local outpost of Japanese bookstore Kinokuniya.Special packages like these can be a way for an established hotel to stand out from the pack.In Bali, one hotel banned smartphones and other electronics by the pool as a way to encourage guests to unplug and relax.Meanwhile, several hotels and resorts around the world, including the Park Hyatt New York, have created special rooms designed for getting an optimal night’s sleep, complete with white noise machines, weighted blankets and special sleepytime teas."}
{"title": "", "text": "Police in eastern India have arrested three men for the alleged gang rape of a foreign tourist and assault of her husband, as they hunt for four more suspects in a case that highlights the country’s decades-long struggle to curb sexual violence against women.The couple, who had been traveling by motorcycle from the state of West Bengal to neighboring Nepal, were found late Friday by police officers on patrol, said Pitambar Singh Kherwar, superintendent of Dumka district police in Jharkhand state.They were taken to hospital, where the woman told the doctor she had been raped, he said.Police know the identities of the wanted suspects and have formed a special investigative team, Kherwar said. It is unclear whether the three arrested suspects have legal representation.CNN is not naming the female victim, in accordance with Indian law that prevents the naming of victims of sexual violence. Police have not disclosed the names or nationalities of the couple.The arrests come after a travel vlogger couple on Saturday posted on their Instagram account that they had “knives (held) to our throats,” during an attack in India. The woman had been raped and brought to the hospital for DNA testing, they said.The couple posts in Spanish, and the woman says on her Instagram page that she is Brazilian.On their Instagram story, the woman showed bruises on her face, saying, “This is what my face looks like, but it isn’t what hurts the most. I thought I was going to die.”In a follow-up post Sunday, the couple thanked their followers for their support, saying they are doing well and that “the police is doing everything possible to catch” the remaining suspects.CNN has reached out to the couple for comment.India’s National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the alleged attack.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has spoken to the victim and extended all required assistance, the organization posted on social platform X on Saturday.Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur called the alleged assault a “condemnable incident.”“If a crime has been committed, the culprits will not be spared,” he said on Saturday.India has struggled for years to tackle high rates of violence against women, with a number of high-profile rape cases involving foreign visitors drawing international attention to the issue.In 2018, A British woman was allegedly raped while walking to her hotel in the western state of Goa, a popular tourist destination; two years earlier, an American woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a group of men in her five-star hotel room in New Delhi. And in 2013, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the gang rape of a Swiss tourist.According to India’s National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 31,516 rape cases were recorded in 2022, an average of 86 cases per day.And experts warn that the number of cases recorded are just a small fraction of what may be the real number, in a deeply patriarchal country where shame and stigma surround rape victims and their families.Under India’s current laws it is still not a crime for a man to force sex or sexual acts on his wife, as long as she is over 18.Perhaps India’s most infamous case of recent years was the 2012 gang-rape of a medical student who was beaten, tortured and left to die following a brutal attack on a public bus in New Delhi.The case and ensuing nationwide protests drew international media scrutiny – and prompted authorities to enact legal reforms. The rape law was amended in 2013 to broaden the definition of the crime and set strict punishments not only for rape but also for sexual assault, voyeurism, and stalking.Despite these changes, rape cases remain prevalent in the country – with victims and advocates saying the government is still not doing enough to protect women and punish attackers."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good afternoon. I wish to welcome the representatives of states and to open the annual informal meetingwith states with the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child are all present as we have been holding our 95th session. The conclusion of that session is tomorrow and we very much welcome this opportunity to exchangewith all of you today. We will begin with a short report by myself, the Chairperson, andthen some of our colleagues will also take the floor to share short reports on various different aspects of the work that we have been undertaking and then we will move on to questions and answers.So let me begin by saying that it has been a very busy year for the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Since the last meeting, the status of ratification and accession on the conventionitself has not changed. Of course, the convention has been ratified or exceeded to by all states except for the United States of America. The three optional protocols are presenting witha slower pace of ratification, the involvement of children in armed conflict and the optionalprotocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the communications procedure optional protocol. In respect of all of these, there was only one new ratificationand that was the Republic of Moldova for the optional protocol on a communications procedure during the last year since February. Concerning reporting, the pace of reporting under the optionalprotocols continues to be slow. Since last February, the Committee received only four new initial reports under the two substantive optional protocols. So in that regard, 36 initial reports are stilloverdue under the optional protocol on children in armed conflict and 48 are still overdue underthe optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Moving on to some of the activities that have been undertaken by the Committee during this last year, the Committee reviewed 23 reports in total since the last meeting. The current backlog ofreports pending consideration is now at 71 reports but will be 65 after the end of the sessionwhich is tomorrow. In May 2024, the Committee undertook a pilot project for a back-to-back reviewwith CEDAW Committee for the country and we are still in the process of evaluating that inorder to gather what we can from the learnings to feed into the Treaty body strengthening process.I also want to inform Delegates that three years after the Committee held its 84th extraordinary session in Samoa, the Committee on the Rights of the Child again returned to the Pacific, not all members, just three members attended this time, to meet with Pacific Island countriesto take stock of the efforts to advance children's rights in the region. The Committee membersvisited the three countries that were reviewed in 2020, namely the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Tuvalu and then the Committee Delegates convened for a workshopin Apia, Samoa to meet with Government Delegations from all of the Pacific Island countries. This took place in November 2023. The regional experience sharing workshop on implementation of the recommendationswas an opportunity for the Committee to discuss children's rights issues under certain thematicareas including violence against children and also the protection and promotion of children's rights in the context of the environment and climate change which, of course, is a very relevant issue for that region. Indeed, the 1st day of this regional workshop, the Committee hadthe regional launch of its general comment No. 26 on children's rights in the environment with a special focus on climate change. I will speak a little more about that in a moment. Sothis experience of the visit to Samoa will also be evaluated by the Committee. I also want tomention that two Committee members undertook a visit to Cambodia and Thailand at the requestof UNICEF in November 2023. Moving on now to some of the decisions that were made duringthe last year that are of relevance, decision No. 17 during its 92nd session to facilitatethe reporting under the two optional protocols, the Committee applied the opt out simplified reporting procedure to the initial reports. The simplified reporting procedure has been adopted by the Committee as the standard operating procedure for periodic reports under the Conventionon the Rights of the Child and for initial reports under the optional protocols. This has been implemented now as from the 1st of January 2024. States' parties were given the opportunityto indicate if they wanted to opt out and so far well, until the 30th of September the opportunitywas given and nine states decided to opt out. Decision No. 19, the Committee decided to createa new cluster entitled children's rights in the environment to be used in the dialogue with states' parties and the Committee's concluding observations. This is part of implementingthe general comment and I think my colleague who will speak to working methods will add a little to explain some of the decisions that have been made. Coming to the general comment, it was inthe May session of 2023 that the Committee launched general comment No. 26 on children's rights in the environment with a special focus on climate change. This attracted a great deal of, I wouldsay, attention throughout the world and the Committee received 170 written submissions fromstates, United Nations entities, national human rights institutions, civil society, children's organizations and experts. We also received information from thematic workshops in different regions.The Committee benefited from an unprecedented level of child participation in the development process and many of you may have already heard about this, that over 16,000 children participatedin the rounds of children's consultations and this was supported by a children's advisory team that worked closely with the Committee. The general comment highlights how children'srights are affected by environmental degradation and climate change and stressed the fact that children have a right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and that this right is embedded in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. There have been many follow-up meetingsand events since the official launch in many parts of the world including several side events at COP 28 and a high level panel at the 75th UDHR commemorative event in December 2023. Regardingevents, the Committee in September 2023 on the 1st anniversary of its joint statement on illegal country adoptions held an event together with the Committee on enforced disappearances and some special procedures. During the current session we have also held an online exchangewith the Council of Europe's Committee on Economic and Social Rights and in December last year we also held a preliminary meeting with the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child where we discussed some of our common interests and concerns and weintend to have further engagement with the African Committee of Experts. Finally, I want to draw the state's attention to the fact that the Committee on the Rights of the Child, like all the Treatybodies, is operating in an increasingly constrained environment. We have recently been informedthat the current cash deficit situation within the UN has caused a liquidity crisis for theTreaty body system and that this threatens to seriously undermine the capacity of the Treatybodies to serve the interests of rights holders, in our case children. In addition, last weekthe use of WebEx was suddenly discontinued without warning which in turn makes it very difficultfor the Committee to engage with stakeholders from civil society and we are concerned about this and the lack of consultation with regard to this issue. We believe that this needs tobe reconsidered, particularly given that digital uplift has been identified as a pillar of Treaty body strengthening. So I would like to conclude by asking states to do what they can to supportand strengthen the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child among all the Treaty body system. I thank you. Now, the 1st speaker on the agenda is Benoit van Keersbilk who willaddress us on the optional, the work under the optional protocol on a communications procedure. Thank you very much, Chair, for giving me the floor to report on the work of the Committeeon the Rights of the Child on the optional protocol to the Commission on the Rights of the Child on individual communications which as you know is a protocol which advocates to the Committee additional mechanisms, the two principle ones of them give the possibility to children toreport to us by sending an individual communication on an infringement or violation of their rightsin the Convention of the optional protocol. This form of communication is, of course, subjectto a number of conditions. One is the exhausting of the right to recourse on the national leveland there's a 2nd mechanism which will be covered by my colleague in a moment, gives thepossibility of the Committee to undertake an investigation given a serious or repeated violation of the rights of a child and this falls under the part of the optional protocol. So this protocolhas been in force for ten years. It entered into force in April or May 2014 after being adopted2011. So we are now reaching the 2nd anniversary of it and in this context the Committee hasenvisaged a number of different events. One of them will take place during our May sessionthat will be in exchange with states, parties and other stakeholder states on the implementationof this protocol and the results that have been achieved over a decade, analysis of the questions that have been raised and the general impact and consequences of the protocol at Leiden with the Leiden University. There will also be an event in April organized together with the HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Committee for the Rights of the Child. I'd like to offer a few statistical data. 51 countries have ratified this mechanism. That's relatively few giventhe number of Member States adhering to the Convention on the Rights of the Child because the Convention itself has achieved almost universal ratification. Just one quarter of countriesin the world have ratified this mechanism which, however, is vital to support as a mechanism itself. 16 countries through the signing of the protocol have indicated their interest andcommitment to ratify it but we are still awaiting for that to be effected and some countries,given their UPRs, Universal Periodic Reviews have in that context indicated that they do wish to ratify the protocol. Our Committee, since 238 cases, since the mechanism has been putin place, these are registered cases. Some cases are not registered because they do not meet the preconditions necessary, the basic terms for registration. A number of countries havecommunication against the state, e.g. , that has not ratified the protocol. So 238 cases registered. 137 decisions have been handed down. I think it is a little bit more than that, 141 if we take into account the decision in this state. In 45 cases we have identifieda violation of the rights of a child and in about the same number there were not a violation. The remainder were found inadmissible and just over 50 were interrupted. So these arefigures which do not shed light on the entire reality. So they were interrupted because a friendly resolution was found or the national justice system reopened a case often followingthe fact that we at our Committee had adopted interim measures and called on the state to act in light of the communication that we received. So those cases of interruption do not necessarilymean that those situations should be seen negatively but in many of them there is a positive outcome. The Chair has already underscored that the United Nations system requires resources and the communicationssection that handles complaints and communications are totally insufficient, insufficient resources for us to do the workload. We have 101 cases that are pending, that are awaiting review byCommittee. We can handle about 25 cases annually. So we have a backlog of work that will last four years. But those deposited in 2020 can only be handled in 2025 or even later. We shouldnot forget that there is a child behind every case. Those child are growing and the time that passes is an additional problem and a hindrance with continued possibility for further violationsof the rights of these children. So we are deeply concerned by the difficulty that we have in not being able to respond adequately in a reasonable time frame to all of these cases. We are not able to handle all of the communications that we receive. We have about one request for interim measureswhich we receive each week and we are not necessarily able to respond within 48 hours from receiving that. I would like to give you a few examples of specific cases for you to understand the scopeand the impact of this mechanism. We have fairly regularly intervened in cases of refinement of children or refinement associated with a serious violation of the right of a child orchildren, notably situations where a child together with a family were sent back to a zone or country that they had come from where there was a major risk for general mutilation. We were able tointervene in a number of such cases where decisions were reconsidered and the children ultimately benefited from a protection from that initial attempt at refinement. On the number of cases we haveintervened on the right of the children without papers, children who did not have valid residence papers or other travel documents who needed to go to school. We intervened in a number of symbolicflagship cases, but these cases were sufficient to trigger a state fully reviewing their procedures for allowing children into schools, their administrative requirements for new students, allowing somehundreds of children to be allowed to realize their right to education. I would like to give you another relatively recent example. The right to abortion, interruption of a pregnancy for a younggirl in sanitary and psychological conditions that have to be adequate. This was a 13-year-old younggirl who was pregnant following years of rape by her father and this was handled by the justice system.She lost her child and due to a voluntary abortion instead of being protected as a victim, she was broughtup before the justice system as accountable for all of these acts as the guilty party. To sumup, we have a tool here. The optional protocol is absolutely vital. It allows us to act in other ways, too, to engage inmonitoring to ensure that the rights protected by the Convention protocol are fully protected. It allows us to analyze andhand down decisions on specific cases, rule on nuances and to ensure systematic protection is maintained in national legislations.And we can challenge states to make them analyze again and review, adjust their own national legislation and judicial procedures. In additionto the cases of rape that we have seen in recent years, we have allowed our own jurisprudence to be evolved and we have called on states successfullyto make changes in general and individual cases. We have called for a general shoring up and strengthening of the Treaty mechanism for us to be ableto achieve our mission in the optimal manner possible. Thank you. Thank you very much. The next speaker is Hind Ayub Idrisi who will address us on inquiries.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I would like to thank all of the Member States who have joined us today for this informal meeting. As regards the inquiries, investigations as was underscored by my colleague,this is also supported by the 3rd protocol establishing the possibility of individual communications under Article 13. When there is a serious violation or a systematic violation, the Committee of the Rights of the Child can on its own initiative or when a case is referred through credible, verifiable information requestthe opening of an investigation. And so as was underscored previously, we had the opportunity last year to lay out the procedure for such investigations at a similar meeting. But what I would like to reiterate is that an inquiry can only be opened if there was a certain level of confidencethat there was a serious or systematic violation. The Committee puts itself directly in contact with the Member States, sends questions, surveys and so forth. We receive responses from the Member States and so we open up a dialogue in short between the Committee and the Member States in question. But I would like to underscore that the decision to open an inquiry is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken by the Committee. It is not something that is taken on the basis of those exchanges themselves. It is when after an exchange, questions, answers, information, further information is collected by the Committee, it turns out that there is ground to move forward with an inquiry to be absolutely sure at the end of the day that there were systematic or serious violations or not. Andso the goal of the inquiry is to shed light on reality in the field of a specific situation. An inquiry can be supported by a country visit. So country visits are not systematic when the Committee considers that it is necessary to make a local visit to get a better idea of what is going on to have contacts and meetings with the various stakeholders and parties. Then we envisagea visit which is organized in close cooperation with the Member States. And so in terms of inquiries, 1st of all, we have close cooperation with the Member States. Second, we have total confidentiality. The entire procedure from the very beginning up until the end, it falls totally under confidentiality. It is in the interest of Member States to cooperatebecause they will understand better what is happening on their own territory, that is to say whether there are serious or systematic or serious and systematic violations and will learn better how to resolve the situation, eradicate violations and so forth. And so we have three inquiries currently underway. One where a country visit was conducted a few months ago andthe draft report is being drawn up. One inquiry where a visit is being prepared for next month. And a 3rd inquiry where we would like to have more cooperation with the Member States in order to move this case forward and inquire further. When the Committee considers that following an inquirywe are on the path to adopting a report on the inquiry, the process ends. And so once the Committee adopts a report, it is published and then you'll learn of it. I would like to_1 thing. Conducting an inquiry, compiling a report and publishing a report does not actually mean the end of the inquiry because there is also follow-up. That follow-up continuesuntil the Committee believes that Member States has satisfied all of the recommendations handed down by the Committee. There could be different follow-up methods. First it is in the framework of a periodic review, but we've moved to a longer period, eight years is a long time, and so we have other follow-up procedures that are developed between the Committee and the Member States. Thank you. Thank you. We'll now hand over to the Chair, Justice Kagan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. I'll hand over to the Chairman now and then to the Member States. Thank you. Thank you. We have another follow-up procedure that comes out in our meeting. Let's go ahead and start by the floor at the Board of Trustees meeting. We would like to continue the follow-up processes until the Committee believes that the Member States has satisfied all of the recommendations handed down by the Committee. There could be different follow-upyou. The next speaker is Ragi Gudransson who will address us on working methods. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good afternoon. I will briefly share with you some of the work of the Committeewith regard to the revision of the dialogue structure with states in the reporting procedures. To reflect on the dialogue structure in light of the simplified reporting procedures whichMadam Chair has already mentioned is now the default monitoring procedure of the Committee is an important part of implementing this simplified reporting procedure. To clarify and avoid repetitionto overlap of issues under each cluster of the dialogue and finally to better reflect recent developments in child rights in the context of the recent jurisprudence of the Committee andto address new challenges such as those reflected in the last general comments that the Committee has made. This revision does not represent any revolutionary changes, albeit they are significant.The major change is that two new clusters are introduced. On the one hand, the right of the child and the environment and the other standard of living. The new cluster of children's rightsin the environment should not be surprising in light of the last general comment of the Committee on this topic. The purpose is, of course, to facilitate the better monitoring of the implementation of this topic as the general comment provides us with the tools to do this. Concerning theother new cluster on the standard of living, it has up to now been an issue listed under the cluster of health. However, due to the many issues addressed under health, the Committeefelt that the issues related to children living in poverty in particular, shortages of food and poor housing were not sufficiently addressed. By allocating a separate cluster on this matter,the Committee believes it will receive more detailed information on issues such as social security, family benefits, the monetary transfer system and housing. In addition to this, it has beendecided that the follow-up information on the implementation of the optional protocol on sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography as well as the optional protocol of children in armed conflict will be integrated into the clusters of violence with regard toOPSC and under special protection measures with regard to OPAC. It is the view of the Committee that the substantive issues dealt with by these optional protocols could better be addressedby integrating them into the relevant clusters of the dialogue structures with the aim to improve and strengthen the context of the relevant rights of the child in the dialogues with the state parties. Now, as you know, each dialogue cluster is operationalized, if you like, by identifyingthe relevant issues under the different dialogue clusters. These have been revisited with the same aim as before mentioned, namely to simplify and avoid overlaps and repetitions. My finalremarks are that I expect that at one point the state parties will be advised further on these changes by revised reporting guidelines. However, no decision has been taken in this respect yet. It is our hope that this work of the Committee will be well received by thestate parties and facilitate and will facilitate improved quality of the constructive dialogues between the state parties and the Committee. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. The nextspeaker is Viljana Todorova who will address us on the Article 5 statement. Thank you, Madam Chair. Distinguished Delegates, let me start with reading Article 5 which states that stateparties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or where applicable the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardiansor other persons legally responsible for the child to provide in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by thechild of the rights recognized in the Convention. Our purpose to work on an issue of this statement was to clarify the concepts of parental guidance and evolving capacities of the child in consistencywith the objective and purpose of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We further sought to explain how Article 5 strikes a balance between the rights of the child and the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents as well as the state obligation to ensure the rights of thechild in light of the importance of the family. The Committee observes that while the important role of parents in children's lives is reflected in numerous articles of the Convention includingArticle 5, the recognition by the Convention of children as subjects of rights has triggered concerns among some Member States and other actors that such recognition would underminethe rights, responsibilities and duties of parents. It increasingly results in a normative push back against child rights at country level and not only. Therefore, the Committee statesthat any interpretation that singles out one of the elements of Article 5 while ignoring or discarding the other element, e.g. , highlighting the rights of parents withoutalso mentioning appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise of the rights recognized in the current Convention would be contrary to an accurate and holistic understanding of thisarticle. The Committee reiterated in its statement that Article 5 affirms that all children have rights irrespective of their age and that as they grow, develop, mature and expand theirsocial circle beyond their family, they are entitled to an increasing level of responsibility, agency and autonomy in the exercise of their rights. Children's evolving capacities mustbe recognized and respected by those adults who provide direction and guidance over children's lives. And in this regard, I would like to remind us that the concept of evolving capacitiesof children is not new for this Committee and has been discussed in several general comments that date back in 2006 and further on. The statement further explains that in the exercise of theirrights, children should receive appropriate direction and guidance by parents. Children should also receive direct protection from the state in cases where parents fail to provideadequate protection of or in some cases abuse the rights of children. States also have a responsibility to build the capacity of parents, extended families, legal guardians and community membersto provide appropriate direction and guidance to children. The Committee notes that parents' responsibilities, rights and duties to guide their children is not absolute but rather delimitedby children's status as rights holders. The provision of direction and guidance must be exercised in a manner to respect and ensure children's rights. Parents should take into account the views of children while providing appropriate direction and guidance. As a childgrows and matures, greater weight should be given to the views of the child with parents adjusting their guidance and direction to reflect the child's evolving capacities. To this end, the Committee considers that parents should be encouraged to offer direction and guidancein a child-centered way through dialogue and example in ways that enhance the capacity of children, including younger children, to exercise their rights. Finally, the Committee reaffirmsthat the concept of children's evolving capacities is central to the recognition of children's status as rights holders. It establishes that when children reach a sufficient level of maturityand capacity to exercise their rights independently, there will be a decreasing need for parental direction and guidance. If children acquire capacities, they are entitled to an increasing level ofresponsibilities as I mentioned before, and therefore, the evolving capacities should be seen as positive and enabling process and not an excuse for authoritarian practices that restrictchildren's autonomy and self-expression and which are often inaccurately justified by pointing to children's relative immaturity. We encourage the state parties to widely disseminate this statement and to apply it in their policies and legislation and I thank you, Chair, andback to you. Legislation and I thank you, Chair, and back to you. Thank you. I'm going to hand the floor again to Mr. Van Keusbelk, this time to address us on the topic of the nextgeneral comment. Thank you again, Madam Chair, for giving me the floor on this important topic. I have the pleasure to announce that the Committee on the Rights of the Child will dedicate itsnext general comment to the topic of children's rights to access to justice and effective remedies.As you may know, the Committee issues general comments which are authoritative analyses of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and provide this analysis to the state party andother stakeholders. We have done that in 26 occasions up to now and this would be the 27th general comment of our Committee. I don't think that I need to justify and to explain why accessto justice has an important role to play in combating inequalities, challenging discrimination practice and restoring entitlement that has been denied. If you think of the situation of children inthe world, one can say that the vast majority of the children whose rights have been violated do not have access to justice and do not receive remedies following those violations. And theyneed to be able to reach out to a body, jurisdiction or another authority that would be able to provide a right remedy to respond to the claim that they may have. The barriers and the difficultiesthat the children meet and face when they want to access to justice or to a remedy are many. The knowledge about their rights, the capacity to claim them, the lack of accessible and effectivecomplaint mechanism at the local and national level are among the barriers but there are many other ones. It has been studied and analyzed in depth during many, many years. Access to justiceand effective remedies are essential for the protection, the promotion and the fulfillment of human rights. And despite this recognition, there remains a misconception that access tojustice is limited to children alleged or accused or recognized as having infringed the penal law. The issue of access to justice is much broader and should be seen in a much wider context.The objective of the Committee is to analyze the global context, to analyze what is in place at the different national level to clarify the concept and the terminology to build on therecent emphasis that the Committee has been putting on access to justice in other mandated activities like in the concluding observation, in several statements and so on. And we havethere a lot of information on which we can build. We also want to ensure that children know about the rights, know about the possibilities that are offered to him or her to access to a justicesystem or proper remedy. But we also want to ensure that the states are reviewing their justice system to make sure that this justice system fits for children and are adapted and adequateto respond to the needs and rights to the children. So we will be able to collect information from different sources and try to provide the best guidance for the states and other actors inorder to ensure that children have a better access to justice. The overall objective of this general comment will be to provide authoritative guidance to states party to undertake all appropriatelegislative administrative and others action to ensure children's rights to access to justice and effective remedy to the full realization of their rights. The methodology that will befollowed is as it was done in the past for other general comments. We will issue a call for contribution and we will ask states and other stakeholders to provide us with information, with their knowledgewith their experience and the situation at national level. We will collect example interesting practices on how states are currently ensuring the right to remedies. There will be several workshops,consultation at national, regional and international level as well as expert meetings. There will be plenty of occasion to contribute to the content of this general comment and, of course, we intendto ensure that there will be a genuine participation of children or young adults who have had an experience of the justice system. And we count on several actors to help us in organizing workshops andother consultation with children in a child friendly way. To finish this short presentation, I just want to give you a few examples on what are the needs of children to have a better accessto justice. Think of a child who is in solitary confinement in a detention center who do nothave access to any outside world support information and so on. How can this child currently in most of our countries challenge this decision and find a remedy? A child who has been victim ofsexual violence in the family while the parents don't want to support the child has special needs to be taken in care of in a way that will allow him or her to disclose information,to receive the proper support and to have legal advice and legal support. We can multiply this example to realize how important it is for children to have a proper and adequate access to justice.We are aiming to address these issues and questions through our next general comment and so stay tuned. You will be asked for contribution in this regard. Thank you in advance. Thank you.The last presentation from our side is from Ms. Sophie Kiladze. She will talk about the work of the Committee together with the Interparliamentary Union. Thank you, Chair. I would like to thankthe representatives for participating in this meeting and it is my pleasure to draw your attention to the issue relative to Parliaments and child rights and the work the Committee does in this regard. The engagement of Parliaments in the protection and promotion of child rights enshrinedin the Convention is an important pillar to mainstream child rights agenda, especially at the national level. The Committee puts great value towards the involvement of Parliaments to child-related issues which is clearly expressed through the establishment of the focal pointfor the Interparliamentary Union, IPU in 2021 on the one hand and the issuing of the CRC/IPU Joint Statement in 2022 on the other hand. The Joint Statement is a guide. What Parliamentscan do for children in their parliamentary functions and we use it as a basis to raise awareness of parliamentarians from different national Parliaments. For example, the CRC and IPU jointlyarranged a workshop for parliamentarians in February 2023 where we had more than 150 membersof Parliaments from all different regions of the world. Our next joint event is scheduled on the 15th of February, 2024 where again we await hundreds of parliamentarians from allover the world. We will send invitations to permanent missions and you are more than welcome to participate in this online event. All these activities are directed firstly for raisingawareness of parliamentarians on child rights and secondly, to engage them in the work of the CRC. It is of utmost importance that the state parties include members of national Parliamentsin the Delegations coming to Geneva for the constructive dialogue with CRC. This will help to promote child rights agenda in general and that the Parliament can use its legislativeoversight budgetary and public relations functions for the well being of children much more effectively. It is also or it will also support to better implementation of the concluding observationsof the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Therefore, I would like to encourage state parties to include parliamentarians in the national Delegations for the CRC. I thank you very much.So that brings to an end the presentations from the members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and we would now like to open the floor to gather statements and questions from representatives ofstates. Pakistan. Thank you, Madam Chair. It is a privilege to engage with the Honorable Committeeand I would like to thank all the members for their valuable comments. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the need for this Committee to help strengthen the norms and theirimplementation in one specific thematic area and that is protection of children in armed conflict,both in terms of the substantive work done by the Committee, its working methods and critically in terms of sufficiency in addressing the matter. A large number of children are affected due to armedconflict every year with many tragically losing their lives. Children are affected by armed conflicts all over the world including the region where I come from. More recently we have seen a staggering number of children who have been reported killed in the ongoing conflict in and around Gaza. The figuresare heartbreaking. Close to 12,000 children have lost their lives in the past four months. 24,000 children have lost one or both parents. The figure quoted by UNICEF is 19,000 for those children whoneed an adult to look after them. UNICEF has also stated that all children in Gaza are in need for urgent mental health support. While recognizing that it is not just in Gaza that children lost theirlives and both sides have reported children killed in the conflict, the key question here is the proportionate human right response, especially in the context of the Convention of the Rights of Child and the workingof this Committee. We recognize that the Committee has already expressed itself on the matter. As per the data that I have in the past decade, the highest number of children killed in armed conflict in oneyear was in 2014. We are about to cross that number only in four months. The number of children killed or affected by this conflict in a short period of time has created a moral imperative to reinforce protections under this Convention. While the state parties to the Convention cannot absolvethemselves of the responsibility of adhering to their obligations, still at the same time we would be happy to be guided by the experts on how the Committee could respond in proportion to this challenge.It would not be an exaggeration to say that protection of nearly all rights envisaged under the Convention for Children in Gaza is a serious challenge. Going forward, dealing with near-term challenges such as health, both mental and physical, education, et cetera, are only some of the challenges and at a minimumthe scale of work that needs to be done by specialized agencies needs to be assessed also from the perspective of the Convention and the rights envisaged in it. In specific, I am thinking of Article 45 of the Convention which provides the Committee with certain tools such as working with specialized agencies,recommending to the General Assembly to request the Secretary General to undertake special studies on the Committee's behalf or the Committee can make its own suggestions and general comments based on the information that it has received or is publicly available. I thank you, Madam.The State of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. The State of Palestine regrets that the Committee has not acted sufficiently against the genocidal acts that is being now committed against the Palestinianchildren in Gaza. The Committee's latest statement on the 1st of November, 2023, after almost one month of the Israeli ongoing genocidal attack, it mentioned the, and I quote, death of more than 3,500 childrensince the 7th of October, 2023, end of quote. I would like to bring to the attention of the Committeethat those Palestinian children, innocent Palestinian children were deliberately killed by indiscriminate bombing with bombs equivalent to more than two nuclear bombs, not died by a car accident.As we speak, Madam Chair, as of today, the 1st of February, three months since your latest statement, the death toll of Palestinian children killed reached over 11,500 children. Therefore, since yourlatest statement, 8,000 more children have been killed during those three months. While the Committee was quiet, didn't 8,000 children deserve an additional reaction from the Committee? More than 11,500Palestinian children killed in Gaza and it's impossible to keep the track. The state of Palestine would like to bring to the urgent attention of the Committee members and all the states parties to the Convention on the Rights of Children that the Israeli ongoing genocidal acts on Gaza. Gaza is a besieged,occupied enclave of Palestinian land that is one of the most densely populated areas in earth, where 2.3 million people live there, 50% of them children, 70% of them refugees. We have said this before andwe will say it again and again, bombing Gaza is tantamount to bombing many children and refugees whohave no safe place to go. As we speak, more than 26,900 Palestinians have been killed. Nearly 50% ofthem are children. 73% of them are children, women and elderly. 90% of them are civilians. Entire families have been wiped off the population registry in Gaza. It's impossible to keep the track. One Palestinianchild is being killed every 10 min . According to the safe children, the number of Palestinian children reported killed in Gaza in just the 1st three weeks of this has surpassed the annual number of childrenkilled across the world's conflict zones since 2019. As the UN Secretary General put it, Gaza has becomea graveyard for children. And this number does not include 1,000 children who are still missing, buried under the rubble, dying painful deaths as they are suffocated by the remains of their homes. Nor doesit reflect the number of children orphaned, children whose lives have been destroyed, children with no single family member left. Indeed, a new acronym was invented by the medical staff in Gaza,CNSF, wounded child with no surviving family. As Israel decimates one family after another, such an acronym should never have come into existence. This number does not account for the children slowlydying from hunger and thirst, the children getting sick from drinking sewage and sea water, the children who have survived enduring trauma that is beyond comprehension and will scar them for generations.UNSF described the 4-year-old daughter of one UN staffer in Gaza as pulling out her hair and scratching her legs until they bleed because of the massive stress of living through this every day. The Committeeshould continue its role by keep calling for an immediate cease fire and immediate access for humanitarian aid and just solution for the Palestinian cause because this is its role, this is why it was foundand why it is consisted of 18 independent experts and I thank you. We just wanted to express our supportto the statements made by the representative of Pakistan and Palestine. Thank you. Israel.But since the Palestinian Delegation and other Delegations decided to hijack this meeting as well,I will respond in just a few words. Human lives lost, indeed young lives lost, is a human tragedy.Israel is not indifferent to the human suffering in Gaza as a cause of complete disdain for human life.Perhaps I miss the Palestinian Delegation's condemnation of the October 7th massacre,the systematic rape, the burning, the torture of the children. We have yet to hear anything for theIsraeli orphans. Both the Israelis and Palestinians' children deserve a future that is free of terrorism,free from RPGs in schools and RPGs in crypts or hidden in teddy bears. Humanity cannot thrive,children cannot thrive where there is terror. When there is endocrinate to hate, endocrinated byterrorists that their lives do not matter. Thank you. Finland. Thank you, Madam Chairperson.Finland would like to reiterate our full support for the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.My question relates to the issues or Agenda Point 2 that we have discussed today. Now that the Committeehas already had time to work on the individual communications for several years, has the Committee identified any need to revise the Committee's rules of procedure? I thank you. United States of America.Thank you, Chair. In response to comments made earlier, we remain heartbroken by every civilian life lost whether they are Palestinian or Israeli. Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace. We condemn the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against Israeland the taking of hostages. Israel has the right to defend itself against these terrorists in order to protect its people while complying with international humanitarian law including the obligation toprotect civilians. I thank you. Is the State of Palestine asking to take the floor again?I did not intend to take the floor but I'm inclined to do so. To reply to the representative of the occupying power, to its continuous misleading statements and disinformation campaign, to theoccupying power I'm saying your disinformation campaign will not fool the decent diplomats in this room. They are aware of your 75 years of colonialism, 56 years of illegal occupation and 16years of continuous blockade of Gaza. Your war crimes and crimes against humanity now is televised.Everyone can watch it live. But your previous genocidal acts in 1948 where Palestinians were uprooted from their lands, it was not televised. But now it is televised. Your 1948 genocidal acts,what was the justification for them? Now it is televised and people are not fools and we will never forget what happened to our people and I thank you. Representatives, I will attempt to answer some ofthe questions and respond to some of the points that have been raised and I will also then give my colleagues, members of the Committee an opportunity to also add their voices. So let me begin by sayingin response to all of those that spoke about the huge crisis in the world today around children and armed conflict, the Committee bears heavy weight on its shoulders and we are conscious of this and duringthis session we have indeed been having briefings to ensure that we have all information at our disposal and we have made decisions to take forward certain actions which you will see during the next week.These will be made public. I also want to point out that whilst words can never fully express and weourselves are frustrated about the fact that a statement does not convey the huge burden of sufferingof children in the wars, on World Children's Day last year, 20th of November, the Committee did issuea statement in which we said that whilst that day is usually one to celebrate children's rights,on that day we could only mark this as a day of mourning for the many children who had recently died in armed conflict. We focused on the situation in Gaza in that statement and we did also issuetwo statements on the situation in the state of Palestine prior to this. And we also drew attention to children, many thousands of children dying in armed conflict in many parts of the world, includingin Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Sudan, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo andSomalia. Of course, to highlight that children are dying in many conflicts in no way should reflect as being that the urgent humanitarian crisis and the hugely disproportionate effect on children inGaza is not at the top of the Committee's mind. Indeed, it is. On the issue relating to individual communications, which was the only other question that we received, I will ask Mr. Benoit vanKerspiel to respond to that question and then I would also ask Committee members if they would liketo add or to the response that I have given. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to all the Delegateswho took the floor and raised such important questions and topics. I'm not going to add on what our Chairhas said but just to convey the fact that we are extremely worried, extremely desperate towards allthe situations that have been described and we are really willing to add our voice to recall thatchildren in any case have to be protected in all situations and especially in context of armed conflictsas it has been stated today. But let me answer and sorry to pass from a very sensitive and moving topicto something which is more I mean procedural, let me answer to the question of the esteemed Delegate fromFinland on the revision of our rules of procedure. The rules of procedure have not changed. I mean, there werea few adjustments that were made and that are announced each time that we are adopting them. It's usually to ease the work of the Committee and the Secretariat of the Committee and try to avoid duplication of work. It hasbeen also put in place some system to receive the complaints and to deal with them in a more effective manner. As you know, the U.N. system of individual complaints receive more and more complaints underthe 10 International Convention that it has to monitor and receiving so many complaints entails a lot ofdifficulties to ensure that it is done properly. So the last change has been made to make surethat the system works well. But let me highlight the fact that the system will only be able to delivercorrectly if states are really ensuring that it may deliver in the way it's expected to do. And so it's not enough to ratify an optional protocol and, again, we did and we continue to call to all states toratify this optional protocol because we believe that this is a right for a child to have this mechanism accessible. But in doing so, we need also to ensure that we are able to answer properly to children whoare asking for our support and our answer. If we are not doing that in a proper manner, if we are not able to respond in a time frame that is adequate for a child, we are just cheating children and this is certainlynot what we want to do. So we need collectively to find ways to ensure the capacity of the whole systemto answer properly to those requests. I thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I just wanted to supportwhat my colleague just said. The system functions and I would like to give you the number of closed casesto support this. A great deal have been closed following the receipt of responses from the state's parties given the request for follow-up. There are a number that were closed when an initial responsewas received. Others that were closed following a 2nd volley of questions and responses. If you areaware of the follow-up system that was established by the inquiries section, 1st we have follow-up withfull satisfaction, that's case A if you like, B if there was not full satisfaction and where a dollar can be left open but we have very good parameters, very positive but the big difficulty and problem isthe delay, the delay that we see notably when we are talking about communications concerning children.Time for children is not the same as for adults and that is why Member States need to be compliant and loyal with the obligations they have assumed in line with the rights of the child. We need for the systemto continue to function smoothly to meet the needs of children and for their rights to be enjoyed. Thank you. I don't see any more requests for the floor. So let me then begin to conclude. I would also liketo thank the delegate from Pakistan for the very constructive suggestions that you made to us as well and we will take that back and include it into the considerations that we are currently working onfor how to respond to current crises and I also recognize although the emotions are running high but at the same time it is a reflection of states' concern for the rights of children which we deeplyappreciate and we also very much appreciate your interest in our work and your commitment and thankyou for being here today. The meeting is closed."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to order meeting No. 2036 on the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee this afternoon will continue with item 4 of the agenda and I, therefore,give the floor once again to the head of Delegation from Italy to respond to questions that were still pending under articles that were dealt with thus far, 7, 8 and 9, and perhaps the headof Delegation was telling me there might be some other previous issues as well. Just for 5 min and then we will continue with the 3rd part of the convention. You have the floor sir. Just for 5 min . I will give the floor to ISTAT, then I will say a few wordsabout statelessness and then also we would like to answer Madame Morsi that she was asking a question about international cooperation. So we will answer also to that. So thank you againand now I will give the floor to the colleague from ISTAT. Thank you. I would like to adda couple of details about senior management positions. We have some improvement with referenceto female presence in the board of directors of listed companies, plus 1, 7%, 42.9% altogetherrepresented by women in decision making bodies, constitutional courts and superior courts andother institutions have 21% of women in their personnel and that's a plus 1.9 improvement.Interesting information refers to leading positions in the ministry of justice, internal affairs, upto 2021, women in senior management positions moved from 36% to 45% justice to 48%. So we'rebasically even. As for the ministry of internal affairs, we have some interesting data becausewe talk about 38.6% of senior women, not significantly different from 15 years ago, but it is interestingto note that we have younger decision makers, women in leading positions and that's a change because younger generations have been involved more significantly in leading roles. For the age range, 30to 44 years old representing the 16,7% of the total, whereas in the other ministries, there are no genderdifferences, 5.8% and 11% for the ministry of justice. As for magistrates, we have 56% representation of women and 33% of women in leading position in senior management positions. So we have a significant decrease in the gender gap related to these roles.Talking about statelessness, the ministry of interiors adopted initiatives aimed at simplifying procedures and in order to fast track proceedings, we were cooperating with all administrationsand bodies and we signed a memorandum of understanding involving the UNHCR in order to facilitate this approach and make it more efficient. Thank you, Mr. Petri. First of all, I would like to thank the president forthe opportunity, our colleague, she was a close friend and colleague who was very important to Italy and to Italian operations agencies and organizations and Bianca worked on this report as well and we focus on financing in favor of gender gap elimination.nations. Gender market principles, 10%. Gender market significance, that's the keyword we use for all the other allocations in relation to all our initiatives. We're above average,5% of principle and 40% significant categories, but we want to increase financing even more, not only in terms of financial allocation but also in terms of quality on our websitewe can you can find more information and documents in order to raise awareness in this respect and involve all civil society dealing with planning and implementation. We have this document intranslated into French, English and Spanish and it's going to be available shortly online. We also translated our guidelines into French, Spanish, English and Arabic. We have been carryingout training programs and organizing various events and all information about this is includedon our website in a special report shared with the state for the gender budgeting exercise.On behalf of the Committee, let me thank the Distinguished Delegation for the information provided. Let us now move to the 3rd part. Thank you. I think there are just a couple offollow-up questions. I don't think there are any other follow-up questions. Ms. Mikko, you have the floor for 2 min . Thank you. Thank you very much, Chair. Actually, I need to admitthat State Party answered out of my six questions only one. So either I repeat those others orI get in written way just to shorten the period of answer. So I asked about parity in all decks. I asked how many committees are chaired by women in Parliament. I asked about sanctions onsexist speeches in Parliament. I asked about feminist foreign policy. I asked about increasethe female officers in military and police. And I didn't get the answer. I'm sorry. Thankyou, Ms. Mikko, for just reminding us of the pending questions that have yet to be answered. I wonder whether the Delegation would be in a position to give us this information now or whether you wouldlike to do it in writing. Okay. If we can request you to take note of that. I'm sure you have done. Andwe look forward to receiving the written answers. Please do bear in mind what the word limits and this we cannot seek recourse to that procedure too much more because it makes our dialogue much moredifficult. Let's now move to the 3rd part of the convention. First of all, then, to cover Article 10, the right to education. I would like to give the floor to Ms. Brenda Accia for fiveminutes. Thank you, Your Excellencies. We would like to welcome the Delegation of Italy to the committee and we are really proud of all the achievements and we commend you for all the achievementsyou have been able to achieve. I will address the state party on Article 10 of the convention. The committee welcomes Italy's vision for gender equality that recognizes that all genders, ages andbackgrounds have equal access to education with no inequality in terms of income and dignity. And also we recognize that you have removed cultural barriers and gender stereotypes to ensure equal opportunities in skill development and fields relating to mathematics, science and technology stem so that bothwomen and girls and boys and men can realize their potential. We recognize the development of the national recovery and resilience plan and also the existence of the national strategy for genderequality 2021-2026. We do also note that the state party through a memorandum of understanding by the Ministry of Education, Minister of Public Administration, Minister for Equal Opportunities andfamily introduced a project aimed at promoting and carrying out activities aimed at combating all forms of violence and discrimination including understanding of equality and mutual respect that fight against stereotypes and GBV. Your Excellencies, it is now three years since the project and the nationalstrategy for gender equality were introduced and developed. Has there been any evaluation of the project and the national strategy to determine their impact, what is working and what needsto be changed in relation to education? And what strategy is in place for updating textbooks and school curricula regarding equality, non-discrimination and respect for dignity? The committee also commendsthe state party for recognizing that it is crucial to invest in education and the new generation through initiatives like the month of STEM, prioritizing the relational, social and educational recovery of students, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic and the national observatory for integrationfor foreign peoples. Your Excellencies, however, we did read alternative reports that indicate that despite all these achievements, there are still challenges in age appropriate sexuality education. It is not compulsory. There is also high educational poverty that contributesto a number of school dropouts in certain regions in Italy. Stereotypes that men and boys belong in artificial intelligence and STEM fields continue to exist among certain people, especially and also that Roma women, women with disabilities, migrants and refugee women and girls continueto face integration challenges and discrimination in equally accessing education. Your Excellencies, my questions in this regard, one, what drastic measures can be taken to bridge the gap in technologicaleducation and mathematics learning? The government implemented emergency measures during the pandemic to support early childhood education. Is this policy being sustained and generalized? Whatis the target result for the inclusion of marginalized populations, especially Roma children, migrants and refugees and women and girls with disabilities? And final questions, Your Excellencies, what actions are being taken to increase the number of women university professors? Thank you verymuch. Thank you very much, Ms. Akia. Let's also now hear the questions on Article 11, the rightto employment. I would like to give the floor to Ms. Despoja for 5 min . Madam, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, warmly welcome the Honorable Delegation and thank you,Your Excellency, for your opening remarks, comprehensive opening remarks in which you referred to the desire to remove obstacles to workforce participation for women as well as stressing the importance of work/life balance. So I begin by congratulating the government on achieving the largest overallincrease score on the gender equality index among all Member States since 2010. I also commend you as my colleague has just done on the implementation of the national recovery and resilience plan, particularly its focus on addressing gender inequalities by allowing around 7 billion Eurosby 2026. However, the Committee notes, as you heard from Ms. Mikko, that between 2022 and 2023, Italy ranks 79th on the global gender pay gap report. That is a fall of 13 positions.You also rate last in Europe when it comes to female employment. So the Committee is interested in hearing more about the government plans to address and challenge social stigmas surrounding women's place in the workforce, especially if they have children. And I do acknowledge throughyou, Chair, that departmental representatives have talked about some of the measures but would benefit from some greater specificity. You have also talked about cultural change, too. Research published in the Labor Economics Journal showed that a significant number of 30 to 39-year-oldwomen living in the north of Italy left both permanent and temporary work in 2020. The sametrends are not apparent in the south, however, but we see a particularly high rate of unemployment in these regions in comparison to the north. And I again note that some of your officials have referred to some of the changing or the closing of disparities generally in the regions,but specifically employment is the one we need to know about under Article 11. But can you provide examples of specialized programs which actually target these regional differences in supporting women's access to paid employment? I also note that less than 1% of the 103,000 projectsin place which targets women's employment are related to the reconciliation of private and professional lives, so creations, supplementary services for children, babysitting and afterschool care, e.g. . Do you have plans to increase the accessibility of these services? Furthermore,what is the State Party doing to create paid employment opportunities for women, particularly those who struggle to reenter the workforce after periods of stay-at-home motherhood? Can you please advise the Committee how you will achieve the objective of the 33% for genderequality in childcare facilities by 2026? I believe that's the plan, given that there have been reports of cuts in childcare services and funding for local municipalities. I note thatthe law 178 of 2020 extended paternity leave to 10 days. I'm wondering if you have any plans maybe to increase that and I don't mean only in the cases of multiple births. Are you alsoconsidering measures or do you have some in place that address stereotypes that deter fathers from sharing parenting responsibilities and taking longer paid leave? I do note the extension of the right of vulnerable workers to work in agile mode until the end of March last year.However, I understand that that right was removed for parents with children under the age of 14. Do you have any plans to reintroduce legislation which affords parents remote working rights where practical in order to encourage equal parenting? What measures have been integrated into theartificial intelligence AI plan to ensure gender balance, particularly with your strategic AI program that was adopted in November 2021 and the broader digital innovation ecosystem? Finally,I understand that workplace harassment has been recognized recently as a criminal offense that followed the signing of the ILO convention 190. How does the state party collect and how do you interpret data on sexual harassment in the workplace and what social and educational effortsare in place to support victim survivors or encourage victims and survivors to come forward and report these offenses? Thank you. Thank you very much. Let me now give the Delegation 20minutes to respond. You have the floor, Head of Delegation. Thank you very much. We are talking about the Article 10 and 11. The focus is mainly on the Ministry of Instruction but also on otherministries. I think I will start with the Ministry of Instruction and then we will proceed to otherministries to see other questions. So Ministry of Instruction. Good afternoon to you all. Thankyou for giving me the floor. I work at the Ministry of Education. I shall try to touch upon all ofthe questions raised. Firstly, concerning the strategy to reduce gender gap in relation tothe STEM subjects. Let me say from the outset that this gap has been reduced compared to thepast when it comes to science, statistics, mathematics and architecture. However, girls are still notas many as we would wish in other fields, e.g. , the fields relating to technology. So we thank Committee members for recognizing the progress made in recent months, particularly concerningthe STEM subject month. We also have an open call to all schools to encourage young pupils of bothgenders to be ambitious and to compete at all levels and on all subjects. Recently, the ministry hascome up with other measures, but they have been agreed upon very recently. So we don't have findings to share as yet. Let me list a few of such initiatives. First of all, the guidelines on STEM disciplines, decreelaw 184, such guidelines do not add much in terms of content. They apply to all young pupils and allstudents starting from elementary school, nursery school, rather, all pupils at all degrees. These guidelines are meant to give schools strategy elements and recommendations in terms of behavior in schools to encourage all pupils to study STEM disciplines. Thenthere is the PNRR plan and under the national plan, there is a new call for tender linked to mission number 4, STEM disciplines. 600 million Euros have been allotted to that purpose. And the aim in this case is to improve STEM preparation with agenda perspective. Digital skills is alsoan area of interest in this case and we are encouraging female pupils to improve in that respect. Let me also add that there is a new angle, STEM disciplines are supported across all school levels and school types. Iwould also like to mention that special attention is being paid to combating gender based violence in the field of economics and financial services. As part of civil education which is mandatory in Italian schools, we have also added financial education so all pupils and students will be formed in that respect as well.And as a new initiative for the month of October dedicated to economy and finance. We are also focusing on orientation to STEM disciplines. This is an essential element. Often young girls do not study STEM subjects because of gender based stereotypes of which the girls are themselves victims.So to better orient them towards STEM disciplines, we have published a set of guidelines with a decree law from December 2022. These guidelines include 30 hours of mandatory orientation sessions in 1st degree and 2nd degree schools and 30 hours to be integrated into the normal school hours.Also focusing on orientation in view of academic studies. 150 million new years have been allotted to forming tutors and personnel trained in orienting young pupils to STEM disciplines and their task is to also provide coordination and support for people going on to study at university level.Then there is also a new platform, a single platform whose purpose is to share information for pupils, students, teachers and families particularly on school curricula and training opportunities. There are new training opportunities that are helpful for the world of work and also training modules onfair and equal remuneration. I would also like to respond to the question about poverty and education. The ministry has for years been financing scholarships and it is still doing so focusing on disadvantaged pupils. About 40 million euros per year dedicated to that. And there is also funding for school textsand textbooks, 133 million euros per year. This is also in line with the needs shared by the regions. So we checked that the needs are met at the local level. I would also like to add information about digital disciplines. A new decree law from December 2023 has created a newtechnical digital pathway. Young students choosing this pathway will be doing something fairly new because it is a pilot project. This is the 1st year of implementation. So it is a new pathway for students focusing on digital and technical skills. It is an interesting project. The verybasis of this is the idea of networking amongst schools integrating this new academic pathway. But there is also a set of new academic opportunities dealing with such technical and digital subjects. So once again, a platform thatgathers new opportunities for young people interested in these subjects. The curriculum comprises only four years against the normal five-year pathway for other academic fields. I would also like to respond to the question about textbooks. There are two mechanisms at play here. First of all, decree law 297from 2014 and a decree law from 1919. It is a set of regulations about school autonomy. The ministry does not intervene in anything relating to content of textbooks because there is teaching freedom, academic freedom. However, the ministry does share a set of basic principles.Textbooks should be scientifically rigorous and the ministry gives a set of guidelines about the minimum content to be integrated in such school textbooks. Sexual education is included. There is also a set of guidelines about equal opportunities and there is a set of additional resourcesthat's recommended. So there is a minimum standard to which schools must comply, with which schools must comply. If there are errors identified in such textbooks, the ministry will intervene to remove those factual errors. Lastly, in Italy, there is a possibility of adopting alternative textbooks.Each teacher can, in fact, in agreement with families and teaching staff on alternative additional textbooks, that is a possibility. It is also possible to produce ad hoc school text, but they must be in line with those minimal guidelines. So as I said, the ministry does not intervene directly in mattersrelating to content for school textbooks, but there is a set of clear guidelines and recommendations. Then there was a question about sexual education. At the moment, it is not compulsory. That is true. However, this is a topical subject and through science education, a part of a part of sexual education is also conveyed. Asyou probably know, there is a Working Group that works on that. The national plan was indeed established in 2017 based on a previous national law. However, since then, several initiatives have been rolled out. The most recent one, which is worth mentioning, is a project which was inaugurated in November 2023very recent one, and this project is called education to inclusion, for inclusion rather. What is foreseen in this case is to make civil education mandatory and beyond that, the ministry has also since we have only 6 min left, I would like to give the floor to the ministry of laboron Article 10 and 11 exclusively. Then we will give the floor to the ministry for disabilities. First of all, the ministry of labor. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I am representative of the ministry of labor with reference to Article 11, in particular the question about measures introduced byItaly to remove obstacles and favor employment, the employment of women. We introduce law decree 105 of 2022. With that decree, we transpose directive 1158 of the European Union about balancing out private work/life balancewith that directive, and with this decree, with which we have transposed the directive, we tried to move towards better better balance between parental roles, trying to share the burden equally. We introduced compulsory parental leavethat was an experimental measure and it has now become a structural measure in Italy.Paternity leave was introduced in 2012 and it was a temporary measure but in the course of the course of these ten years we increased the number of days on which parents couldask for paternity and maternity leave and this measure has now become structural with 100%remuneration for fathers who take paternity leave as a compulsory measure from two months before to five months after the birth of children in combination with maternity leave as wellso this measure is very important because in our culture, in Italian culture fathers tendto avoid paternity leave or use this tool very little. In particular we introduced anotherprinciple related to paternity and maternity leave. This leave could be used by mothers upto six months so fathers could not really take parental leave but now we introduced modificationswith the decree number 105. We introduced three months of parental leave with indemnizationso fathers have great incentive in taking paternity leave because those three months are availableto them and cannot be transferred to mothers. We also increased the number of months for this type of leave. Three months for fathers, three months for mothers and three months that canbe used by either mothers or fathers. So the total of months available for paternity leaveis nine months. You only have 2 min for Article 10 and 11. Thank you. As for educationfor people with disabilities, law 104/2022 provides for this right irrespective of the type of disability.This measure is specific and aims at protecting equal opportunities and access and equal accessfor people with disabilities. Another decree 66 from 2017 addresses the situation of childrenin school who can be supported by teachers and assistants and can use assistants, canbe assistants to move across various buildings in the school. So we also have specific ad hocindividual plans in order to identify resources of various types to guarantee inclusions ofchildren with disabilities within schools also taking into consideration nature of the buildingsand rooms with specific measures in order to guarantee inclusion. Now the floor to my colleaguewith reference to what Mr. Spiers said, we would like to stress that the decree 43, we adoptedspecific guidelines in favor of people with disabilities in order to improve the inclusionat work for these workers who have to be supported in the right way. In particular, we have a contactperson in the public administration system dealing with labor issues so that workers can work inan inclusive environment and the decree 222 also refers to this. Now the floor to the Ministryof Labor talking about harassment at work. Laura Cosmy, representative of the Ministry of Labor. I'malso a member of a group dealing with gender equality. Talking about harassment at the workplace, wewould like to go back to the definition of harassment according to our legislation. These articleshave been amended. Article 25 defines direct and indirect discrimination. We have widened thedefinition referring to the law. We prohibit discrimination in the workplace but also during the recruitmentphases. That's important when we talk to access to the workplace, to the labor market. We alsofine-tuned the non-discriminatory practices working on working hours. This is very important for women. Themain discrimination happens when working hours come into place. Article 25 has been amended in order tostrengthen specific measures. We consider discrimination anything that could make career more difficult withinthe workplace. So this can be deemed can be considered discrimination. Speaking about harassment in theworkplace, Article 26 has been amended and expanded in addition to the definition of sexual harassment. Wealso have provisions forcing employers to create a favorable working environment to guarantee favorable conditions inthe workplace in order to raise awareness within companies and the article also provides for specific measures so thatharassment in the workplace could be taken into consideration. Workers cannot be sanctions or laid off or subjected to otherinitiatives when we are in the presence of sexual harassment. Cases should be reported. It is important that all this is free ofcharge and workers victim of sexual harassment can get counsel. Thank you. I would like to thank the Distinguished Delegation. There aresome follow-up questions. You have the floor for 2 min . Thank you very much Distinguished Delegation for the extensive responses. I just have a small follow-up question in regard to the different policies and strategies and also the curriculum interms of you have freedom for development of a curriculum on sexuality. Have you evaluated these policies? Are they working? What has been the impact and what are the challenges because maybe that is where the alternative reports indicate the gaps that undermine thepeople's access to education. Maybe if there has been an evaluation for you to learn from that. Thank you. Thank you. You have 2 min . Thank you, Chair. I also add my thanks forthe comprehensive answers and the specificity particularly around the issue of paid leave. I just want to clarify in relation to the ten days of paternity leave. I have seen that thereare suggestions that a minority of fathers are taking this leave but it is very difficult to find an accurate percentage. I am wondering if you have a percentage that you could provide to us. I appreciate the specificity around the timing and the duration of leave for mothersand fathers but I want to clarify if there is a consideration to extend the compulsory leave for paternity leave. Extend it from ten days. One other thing, I am curious, I knowworkplaces can be punished or sanctioned in some way for not providing leave but what aboutconsideration of a positive duty, so a positive means of encouraging workplaces to offer leave and encourage fathers in particular to take advantage of those particular benefits. Thankyou. I do apologize, says the Chair. I was saying that I also have a follow-up question regardingwhat you have been talking about, trying to reconcile the work/life balance, in other words. What measures have been taken to recognize care, caregivers? This is something that is done veryoften by women and it means that they are often made poorer because of this caregiving, not just now but you have got to think about their pension as well and how they pay into their pension or don't because of this. What are you doing in that regard? Distinguished Delegation,you have the floor for, let's say, 7 min to answer these three follow-up questions. Thankyou, Mr. Labor, please. Firstly, I would like to address the question about sanctions. Thepaternal leave is under decree 105. What is foreseen is mandatory parental leave and anequal sanction, a sentence up to five months for employers who do not grant this right tofathers. This goes hand in hand with mandatory maternal leave, of course. Concerning the additionalquestion about the duty of care and quite often care activities conducted by mothers, we haveforeseen a measure to assist disabled persons. Up to 2022, we had three days of leave to assistthese people with disabilities. Before the amendment to the law, these three days were to be takenby one family member only, taking care of a person with disabilities. Now the law has been amendedand these three days of leave can be taken by more than one member of the household so that women arenot burdened with care more than they should. So these three days can be taken by various membersof the household, not necessarily women. I will answer the question about school curricula.Statistics are interesting in that respect. They tell us that there is an improvement when it comesto gender-based stereotypes. And we believe that this is also the fruit of the recent guidelinesthat we have implemented. As I said, we don't have results to share about the most recent measures taken under the PNRR strategy. But I would also like to mention one additional element. We havecreated a memoranda of understanding with the ministry for family and the ministry of cultureto create other prevention initiatives in the sphere of combating gender-based stereotypes and gender-basedviolence in the school environment. I mention this because this is a promising new approach, butwe really stress the importance for young girls and women to identify the potential risks right fromthe start. And that's also the idea behind this new programs. Thank you. The National Institute forStatistics, ISTAD. I wish to answer the question about gathering data on gender-based violence inthe workplace. We are monitoring this. We have been doing so for years. We have a new study from2022 in line with the ILO directive. Data will be published in April, April 2024. Thank you.I would like to thank the Delegation for that information. Let's press on with Articles 12 and 13.I would like to give the floor to Madame Tisheva who will be addressing the right to health. You have the floor for 5 min , Madame. Thank you very much, Madame Chair. Distinguished representativesof the Government of Italy, I commend you on the presented periodic report on your achievements in the field of gender equality and on this very constructive dialogue. We recognize advances likethe upgrading of the essential levels of care to provide increasing services to support parenting and children and motherhood, development of family counseling centers, access to health services by migrant women and asylum seekers, women with HIV/AIDS. Despite that, we have some important concernsrelated to ensuring the realization of the fundamental socioeconomic rights to health for women in terms of equal access and also with respect to specific reproductive rights of women. I stress on whatMadame Amlin mentioned in the beginning that these human rights deserve progressive implementation only and particularly with no regression. The country has achieved important health gains but inequalities due to social and economic status, gender and geographical positions still persist. There are severaladditionally vulnerable groups of women at risk like women from rural and remote places, migrant women, asylum seekers, economically deprived women, women from minorities such as Roma, women with disabilities, LBTI women. My question is what are the measures that the state party has taken forcountering regional disparities in access to health care services and access to quality essential reproductive rights and services? What are the specific measures tailored for women from vulnerablegroups? Are there specific indicators for you for monitoring and assessment of accessibility and quality of sexual reproductive rights and health services, prenatal test and care, monitoring pregnancy, post-natalcare and also access to safe abortion and post-abortion care for women? Is access including financial access to modern contraceptives sure for women and girls and what are the plans to improve this access fromyour side? We are particularly concerned by the regression in guarantees for implementation of the right to safe abortion and especially with alerting trends in these last years. The right to terminate pregnancy in Italy has been in place since '78 and is recognized by the constitutional court and by abinding law. Doctors have the right to abstain from performing abortion which are legally available to all pregnant women, abortions up to 90 days from conception following an obligatory one week waitingperiod but in practice it is a longer period. The right to conscientious objection is enshrined in a law194 and as of 2020 about 64% of gynecologists in Italy are conscientious objectors, about 80% in the south and about 55% in the north. The obstacles encountered by women along with the conscientiousobjection and the whole environment makes that we do not see the right to safe abortion ensured nowadays in Italy. Concerning conscientious objection it seems more based not on religious considerations buton conservative attitudes not respecting the life and health and choices on independence of women as they are guaranteed by the convention. By the way, by the way and scale of the practice of conscientious objection it seems a real obstacle for women and this is contrary to what the state party affirms inits report and replies that the level of conscientious objection in Italy does not seem to affect the right of women to terminate a pregnancy. Other impediments are the waiting period to access abortionbetween two and four weeks in practice, lack of sufficient information about the access and procedures and only 60% of the hospitals which could perform abortion do provide it and medical abortion is notprovided everywhere. Also difficulty when it is needed and often impossible to access late to late term abortion mostly because objectors do prenatal test in these cases and do not provide continuity.So this 90 day limit is sometimes very heavy burden for women who have recourse for different reasonsto a period exceeding it for abortion. My questions are when will you revise the law on conscientious objection and provide for introduction of national and regional public registry of conscientious objectorsamong health professionals and transparent procedure for exercising this right with mandatory referral system for hospital and practitioners like the CEDO and its general recommendation on health requires.Is the State Party intended to publish clear information of the facilities and the contact and the description of uniform procedure for safe abortion, access and procedures also based also onthe WHO guidelines on safe abortion and also on the work done by CSO so you can build on the work done by civil society in that respect for informing about the existing possibilities. Will you consider furtherdevelopment on family counseling centers mentioned above and increase their services such as culturalmediation needed and providing medical abortion? And also very important because of the atmospherein your country and all the debates that are open by some anti-choice movement, how will you counter attacks, defamation, victimization and harassment and ensure protection of women who exercise theirchoice, their rights to safe abortion against the attacks by this anti-choice movement, these attitudesin society like the threatening popular initiatives, a beating heartbeat, what legal and policy measures will you undertake at such initiatives addressed against the rights and freedoms of women and what arethe measures taken for prosecution and keeping accountable the responsible for the acts of harassment against women? And concerning women and girls with disabilities at the end, they have highly unmet health needs, especially those with intellectual or psychological disabilities, psychosocialdisabilities. Women who are deaf, blind and those with multiple disabilities and particularly those living in institutional settings where they are also potentially at higher risk of abuse and coercion.I have information only about four centers which provide quality services specific for these very high risk women, groups of women with disabilities. My questions are what are the concretemeasures, protocols and guidelines used and envisioned to ensure access to women and girls with disabilities to reproductive rights and services? Is the specialized body at the Council of Ministers you spoke in thebeginning this morning at Minister level responsible for these specific measures and can it take effective measures for these gaps? Has been research implemented on the needs and obstacles for women and girlswith disabilities in this field on the abuse and coercion in the sexual reproductive rights, includingresearch on the practice of forced sterilization. Thank you. Thank you, Madame Tisheva. I would like to give the floor now to Madame Boniface, Article 13 onsocial protection, economic empowerment of women. Thank you, Madame Chair. I would like to also extend a warm welcome to the Italian Delegation. My specific questions in Article 13 are as follows: Those economic measuresadopted during the pandemic exacerbated structural inequalities between men and women. It was women who lost their jobs 1st . They were the ones who were sidelined and having to undertake informal work. Alsothey found that they had an increase in unpaid work. So my specific question is has the state party quantified the impact using agenda perspective of the national plan for recovery and resilience and what specificmeasures have been designed to close the inequality gap that exists and which harms women?When it comes to promoting entrepreneurship, businesses, only 40 million of the 191 million Eurosfor these programs are for women. Are you going to be increasing funds for women in this particular? Do you have training programs? Do you have loans granted in specific measures for women? In addition, what isthe state party doing to do away with those barriers that have an impact on the economic condition of women with disabilities? They are more exposed to possibilities of poverty and dependence far greaterthan others are. Are there going to be specific programs for them? Another question, what is going to be done so that those businesses promoted by the state are not only geared to activities that aredeemed to be typically female such as the care sector, but what are you doing to ensure that they are guided more into the digital economy or technological areas? We take note of the fact that the budget law 2020 has included this measure known as rural women to promote the developmentand consolidation of farms headed by and managed by women. This measure has been refunded or funded again. However, an awful lot of women are migrant women who live in very precarious conditions. What isgoing to be done for those migrant women so that they have better opportunities and can have alternatives in terms of taking care of their children? Thank you, Chair. I would now like to give the floor back to the Distinguished Delegation for 20 minutes to answer these questions. I think that, of course,we should start with the Ministry of Health and then we go on with the other ministries, labor and disabilities and the opportunities. First, the Ministry of Health. Thank you. Thank you for yourquestions. Let me start with access to health services and to the family centers. Under the national planwhich was funded both by the Italian government and the EU commission and under the EU cohesion fund,we have several measures. The aim is to support the seven less developed regions from the point of view of the European Commission, five regions in the south and the two main islands, Sicily and Sardinia.This national plan is supported by 5 million euros, the EU social plus fund and the regional cohesionfund. This program has four key areas. One is aimed at strengthening family centers and access to them inthe seven less developed regions to ensure equality in terms of access to health care services concerningthe PNR national plan, recovery and resilience within the next generation EU fund. Mission number 6 isdedicated to health and under that mission, we will implement an information system to support thefamily centers. Its aim is to assess health care services and to make sure that they are of equalvalue across the national territory. Concerning abortion, from 1980, a monitoring system is inplace. There is also a technical working table monitoring developments and there is also an annual report to Parliament. The most recent report dates back to 2021. Waiting times have been reduced andthat's a positive sign to terminate a pregnancy on a voluntary basis. So that's a positive sign. However,like you said, there is still a high number of gynecologists that are that do implement thethe objection of consensus and it is true that the general guidelines are not fully implemented concerningthe drug based termination of pregnancy. So in 2022, the Ministry of Health decided to fund a projectto the CGM center for control and prevention of diseases and the project is dedicated to improvingaccess to information and abortion services. The aim is to improve data collection and already this yeara number of training workshops have been implemented in several Italian regions to make sure thatinformation gaps are addressed. Concerning the procedures to obtain abortion, in October 2023,a document was published on the Ministry of Health website which is responsible for this project. This document highlights the status quo of drug based termination of pregnancy in Italy. The idea is tofully implement circular from August 2022. The project I mentioned will end in April 2025. Training coursesare foreseen also remotely and also monitoring mechanism is in place around abortion practices inItaly. There are specific objectives to this project and let me mention, e.g. , focusing on areaswhere conscientious objection is prevalent. If we look at the situation on average in the nationalterritory, we do not see a major problem because we are talking of the global or nationwide overview,but if you look more closely on a region by region basis, then some critical elements do surface. Someclinics do have an issue in this respect. So we aim to support these clinics that are struggling withproviding abortion services. Let me mention also the fact that contraceptive drugs are now more widelyavailable and I refer to a directive from October 2022. There is no need for medical prescriptionto obtain such contraceptive methods at a pharmacy and the most recent directive removed the obligation ofobtaining a medical receipt to get these medicines. To the Minister of Disabilities and then to theMinister of Labor. Concerning the question about access to health, we would like to mention that the reformof the law on disability is now published on the official Gazette and there is one specific decree that provides for a reform of public services which will have an impact on a wide range of services includinghealthcare services. Targeted actions are foreseen to facilitate access to, e.g. , gynecologicalservices for women with disabilities. The result of this would be more attention to specific healthcareservices for women with disabilities. What we expect to see is also better training for healthcare professionals and operators who will have better skills to inform persons with disabilities so thatthey can access healthcare services including at family centers and at gynecological wards. For example,through the use of more plain, straightforward language so that women regardless of the type of disability they have can be better informed about their body and the services they can access. Theirright to a range of services in that respect. And the idea is also to make sure that women are moreinformed also about specific type of diseases and sexually transmitted diseases. I will also mentiona specific program that was recently piloted at the hospital in Milan whose aim is to assist patientsacross their treatment and also to support family members.Article 13 with the Minister of Health. Thank you. Good afternoon. From the Ministry of Health. I wouldlike to provide more information about access to healthcare services for vulnerable women, particularlymigrant women and I would also like to provide information about FGM and transgender women.Let's start with migrant women. The Ministry has worked on two key documents. Firstly, the national planto integrate persons who have a right to international protection. The Ministry of Health has workedclosely with the Ministry of the Interior on this. We have focused on drafting those chapters linked tomental health and the special needs that women and migrants require withmental illnesses, right to health and right to healthcare services. There is also another keydocument which was published in 2023, the guidelines to improve the care for people who are vulnerablewithin the reception system. Several Ministries have worked on this, to draft this document.We would like to underline that following publication of this document, another Technical Working Grouphas been formed and the aim of this Working Group is to create training courses for personnel through remote training opportunities and there is also a pilot projectto monitor whether these initiatives have been fully carried out. I would like to answer the questions relatedto Article 13 put by Madame Boniface. Women were particularly affected during and after the pandemics.We can see that if we observe the labour market, the Italian Government is well aware of it and for this very reason, we included specific measures in our national plan. This is a cross-cutting priority forus. We allocated significant resources to gender equality issues. With reference to those 40 million,I would like to clarify that we are not talking about 40 million but 400 million devoted to female entrepreneurship. My colleague will talk about it. 40 million Euros is the amount provided for by thebudget law dating back to 2021 establishing a specific fund in favour of women in addition to those 400million Euros. Our priority is to guarantee equal opportunities in economic, social and financialterms for women in order to foster gender equality, digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, cultureand tourism and some of the axes. Green revolution is another important topic and issue for us. We are going to invest in local transport infrastructures and services and related services for public housingas well in order to favour numerous families and families with several children. We have We will see ifthere is time for disabilities but Minister of Labour. Thank you. I would like to answer the question aboutfemale workers in the agricultural sectors, especially when it comes to migrants. The initiative in place has been promoted by the ministry of labour and the ministry of agriculture in the framework within theframework of several initiatives devoted to the promotion of female inclusion. We are talking aboutmore than 195 million for the past budget cycle and the investment is significant for the current cycle, inparticular for women. We have been carrying out a monitoring analysis of these programmes. The outcomeshould be analyzed because female work in the agricultural sector is not something that has been investigated and reported. First of all, one of the reasons is that labourexploitations particularly affect women. Women with children run greater risks and can be threatened by gang masters. Women are invisible, so to speak. So these projects have been implemented and reached less women in terms of numbers. This is true. We talk about 20% of women, but nevertheless, it is important to have data in order to implement better programmes. Together with specific with different authorities, we introduced several measures aimed at identifying informal settlements wherewomen live. It is very difficult to identify the exact number of women living in this in these shelters, in informal settlements. We have invested 200 million in order to investigate the matter and improve decent working conditions. Those guidelines are going to be published in March and willrefer to migrant women employed in agriculture or working in agriculture. To conclude, the decrees to be approved by June 2024 are important for people with disabilities and we also have three areas where we can implement effective measures. We are going to review theanalysis of projects related to disabilities. We also have to consider how to introduce significant and sensible programmes to protect people with disabilities and allow them to have access to the same opportunities with reference to other measures related to the labour market. We wanted to mention that the decree 48 of May 2023, we consider measures to improve access to the labour market by people with disabilities also in cooperation with the 3rd sector entities to get closer and to be included in the labour market. In the same decree, we also have provisions as per Article 28 related to the 3rd sector parties concerning people with disabilities of 35 years of age or less. The Article 14 of a different law provides for 3% to bedestined to specific measures in favour of workers with disabilities. Thank you. Thank you. My colleague mentioned the tools available in this respect. In 2023, thedecree, we refinanced a specific fund called special section of the presidency. This is a guarantee fund for middle-sized company, small and medium-sized companies. That goes back to memorandum of understanding of 2013 in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry ofEconomic Development which is now the ministry of the made in Italy. We continued working on this and we refinanced this fund by 6.5 million Euros. So we have 56 million Euros in total related to this fund. My thanks to the Distinguished Delegation. I have a fewrequests for follow-up questions. We are out of time, unfortunately. So let me ask you to be extremely brief, please. Ms. Tisha, you have the floor for 2 min . I would like to thank the Delegation for the very detailed and very useful information and specifically also women with disabilities. I understand that the issue about the access to safe abortion is very hot issue and in society and debates but I think it is very important also if the statescan respond about possible revisions of laws and policies because it pertains to revisions of laws and policies in order to have these conscientious objection and other obstacles really let's say predictable, transparent for women who have the right and access this right and especially the most deprived because the issue is like we saw here, there are regions and the most deprived women from those regions that they have to travel and they are displaced in orderto affirm their right in order to realize their right. And 2nd also about no response about what this victimization and attacks against from the anti-choicemovement just left like that in society without any actually denial and without any when needed also sanction. Because this harassment which also women who have the right to a safe abortion, they have to endure.This is something that I think the state cannot tolerate. Thank you. Thank you. Two very specific questions there that I do hope you'll be able to answer in the next round.We'll move then to the last part in part 3, sorry, the last Article in part 3, Article 14. First of all, let me give the floor to Mr. Silva for her to address Article 14. You have the floor, Madam, for 5 min . Thank you, Madam Chair.Your Excellencies, thank you for your exhaustive discussions which have covered many of the elements of Article 14. My questions are on structural vulnerabilities, both territorially and extraterritorially. First, de jure, the gender equality law number 162 broadensthe scope of discrimination; however, it does not include disability, sexual identity, migrant status, rural women or Roma women. Would the State Party consider including intersectionality in the law 162? The 2nd question is on de facto equality.Poverty is the major theme at the 2024 Commission on the Status of Women. How do you engage in rural women's poverty alleviation, including older women, as the face of poverty? I go on to the women in the criminal justice system. Italian prisons that incarcerate women are modeledafter men's detention facilities. We would like to know about Italy's penal system reform. How do you hope to incorporate the Bangkok rules, the United Nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners? These rules can provide the State Party guidance in addressing the ways in which historically prisonshave been designed for the majority male prison population, from the architecture of prisons to health care, family contact, work and educational training. My fundamental question to you is do women in the criminal justice system have access to justice and legal counsel?I go on to Italy's extraterritoriality. As my colleague Nicole Amelin mentioned, Italy is a party to the Rome statute of the ICC.However, State parties to the Rome statute must incorporate the Rome statute's core crimes in their national legislations and penal courts. Most European countries have already done this, Your Excellencies, but Italy is yet to do so.This is important to the CEDAW because our general recommendation 30 on women, peace and security clearly calls for the complementarity of the convention with international criminal law and affirms that the Rome statute's gender-based elementsof a crime against humanity are consistent with the convention. Your Excellencies, recently a bill was brought before the Italian parliament to domesticate crimes against humanity in the Rome statute. Will the state party reconsider this bill,which will also expand your universal jurisdiction to try crimes of gender persecution committed against the most vulnerable women in different jurisdictions like Afghanistan? I go on to climate crisis. In June 2021, more than 200 plaintiffs, including women,filed the 1st ever lawsuit against the government called the Last Judgment based on climate inaction for violations of numerous fundamental rights, including international and regional human rights laws.Then, Your Excellencies, in February 8, 2022, Italy codified the historic reforms in Articles 9 and 41 of your constitution to include, and I repeat these words because they are sacred, the protection of the environment,biodiversity and ecosystems, even in the interest of future generations. This is groundbreaking. The Last Judgment case and this historic constitutional reform provide an entry point to align the CDoS general recommendation 37with the constitution. Can you provide clear information about the specific domestication of general recommendation 37, which provides guidance to states on the leadership role of women in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change?At COP 28, Italy was one of the largest contributors to the new loss and damage fund, which is committed to the support of countries most exposed to climate change. Your Excellencies, as you know, a hallmark at COP 28was Italy's Youth for Climate event, which is a new generation effort. What are the strategic policies for women and girls to lead these visionary strategies as agents of change? I go on finally to extraterritorialityand your responsibility as a state party. And I anchor this question, Your Excellency, on CDoS general recommendation 30, which articulates that a state party which is engaged in prevention of conflict is accountable under the convention within its territoryand extraterritorially. I would like information on Italy's extraterritorial obligations in regard to Italy's arms trade and the impact of arms trade on violence against women in conflict. General recommendation 30 states, and I read,arms transfers have a well-documented and multifaceted impact on human rights, especially on women and girls. In 2018, three groups filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor of Rome against the national authority in charge of authorizing arms transfers.And in September 2020, the UN group of experts on Yemen reiterated its call for 3rd states to stop transferring arms to parties to conflict. Given the current escalation of the Houthi rebellion in northern Yemen, this is indeed important.Your Excellencies, how do you apply general recommendation30 and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda as UN Security Council Resolution 2467, which states clearlyarms transfers can have serious consequences for the rights and safety of women in the countries that receive them? Thank you, Your Excellencies.Thank you very much for that statement. Let me now give the floor to Ms. Manalo for her to address questions under Articles 15 and 16.Ms. Manalo, you have the floor for 5 min .(speaking in foreign language) Thank you for giving me the floor.It gives me an opportunity to set out a range of questions under Articles 15 and 16. Italy is a wonderful country. It's great to be able to ask questions. I'll now like to carry on in English.A warm welcome I extend to the Italian Delegation headed by His Excellency, Minister Ambassador.I applaud the coalition of 31 Italian NGOs for submitting a joint report on family issues under Articles 15 and 16 of CEDAW and congratulate the State Party for having an active professional feminist civil society. My questions in relation to these two Articles are as follows.Number one, how has the judicial reformknown as the cartavia reform which aims to speed proceedings impact on safeguarding a woman against domestic violence during the family legal proceedings? Number two, does the high rate of more than 90%of joint child custody representing joint physical custodyor joint legal custody? If physical joint custody, does this mean that fathers are expected by law to care equally by 50% of the time as the mothers do? If this is the case, how does this situation correlatewith the gendered labor divisions according to which women spend 2.4 times as much on domestic and care work than men?B, is there a study on the joint custody reform on the children's wellbeing?Three, there is information that it is common practice under Italian jurisprudence to consider a mother who has suffered violence as unfit to have custody of her child.How correct is this? The following questions are, is joint physical custody order in cases of domestic violence? Number two, are professionals such as judiciary people involved in family proceedings required to undergo regular trainingon domestic violence? Do courts and services dealing with family cases with indications of domestic violence apply risk assessment procedures? Is compulsory mediation imposed in cases of domestic violence?Has a specific study been conducted on the economic consequences of divorce? Considering the income differential between spouses,according to Italian NGOs, the ongoing problem of fathers' failure to pay child support has no structural solution and there is no available data of actual application of the alleged funds allocated by the Ministry of Justice in 2016 and renewed in 2021 for this purpose.Please elaborate on this SPC party's effortsto ensure the child support ordered or agreed upon or actually paid by the father. Does the state party have a mechanism through which the state pays the child support sums and then sues the father for reimbursement?As a follow-up study has a follow-up study been conducted on the enforcement of 2019 legislation that has introduced forced marriage as a specific offense into the criminal court code. Are there any indications of decreased rates? What other measures are takento prevent early and forced marriage? The next question is do family policies explicitly include the status of unmarried women?According to Italian NGOs, there is no comprehensive public data or analysis on who benefits from legal aid in separation and divorce proceedings, nor on lawyers' compensation and how this affects women. Taking into account women's greater reliability on legal aid,this is a concern. Does the state party plan to study this issue and to better compensate legal aid lawyers for their services so as to guarantee women's rights to quality counseling and representation in family matters? And last one, according to Italian NGOs,the organic surname reform has not yet been approved. Please explain what is holding this back for approval. Thank you very much.Many thanks, Madame Manolo. I'd now like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation for 15 minutes to answer the also follow-up questions,don't forget regarding the abortion laws, follow-up questions raised by Madame Tisheva and questions in Articles 14, 15 and 16. You have the floor.Thank you. First thing, thank you so much, both Madame Tisheva, Manolo, your question are really very interesting and extremely wide.Of course, I don't think honestly that we will have the time at all, but we are at your disposal also bilaterally because especially Mrs. Da Silva touched upon issues that are extremely interesting and extremely important. But generally speaking, I think that we will give the floor to the Minister of Justice,because especially for women in detention and for all the questions that Mrs. Manolo asked, and then we will see if there is time left. We will answer also the other, but 1st I think that it is important that the Minister of Justice can answer the question that you posed.So Minister of Justice, 1st for women in detention and then the other about, thank you.Good afternoon.Thank you for giving me the floor. Carla Chavarella.I work within the judicial system and the prison system.I would like to respond to the questions that were put in this respect. In Italy, we have more than 60,000 inmates. Only 2,500 are women.Prison facilities dedicated to women are different, of course, compared to the facilities for men. Over the course of the past years, we have been focusing on women inmates.And to do so, we have been focusing, e.g. , on the prison cells and common areas where women can do several activities. The color of the walls are different.Just to improve their well-being. We have specific services for women inmates. The biggest facility is for women, 500 inmates. And it's clearly a different prison facility, clearly dedicated to women. There's a different environment, atmosphere.There's plenty of flowers, e.g. . It's a welcoming environment. And we have specific services for women inmates. For example, it's a welcoming environment. For women inmates who have children,even though they're less and less over the past 10 years, we only have 17 women inmates who have children, 18, to be precise, within prison facilities. Well, they are hosted in a specific detached unit, not in the main prison unit.These are specific facilities where women inmates, women who are mothers can be with their children. There's a kitchen area, dedicated one. There's a common area where mothers can have their lunch with their children.And the uniform, the inmates' typical clothing is avoided.We have nine child care facilities within prison facilities. And we have a section in bigger prison facilities that are detached from the main buildingswho are dedicated to men who have families with small children. Thank you.Good afternoon. I wish to provide more information about the impact of the Cartabian law which entered into forceon the 28th of February, 2023. It is very recent. We don't have relevant statistical data to share about the impact of the reform, particularly linked to reducing the time for legal proceedings.And we have had much progress on that, in that respect. Concerning women victims of violence,the Cartabian reform introduced a new provision which is applicable when the part accessing the legal proceedingstates that she has been a victim of violence. So all that is needed in this respect is for the person, for the woman involved in such proceedings to say that she has been the victim of violence.And then in that case, other provisions kick into place to protect her. First and foremost, I would like to underline this.Mediation in these cases is clearly and directly ruled out. So the judge cannot refer to that possibility, refers to the possibility of referring to mediation in such cases.It is not permitted for none of the parties involved in the legal proceedings. So mediation is categorically ruled out. I would also like to mention other provisionsto reduce the time in legal proceedings, particularly involving assistance to the judges to make sure that victims of violence are protected, specifically to avoid close encountersbetween the person who has been victim of violence and the other party. In such cases, the judge will continueto manage the investigation and to access relevant evidence as needed, but the victim is protected.There is also one important point to underline. If in case of criminal proceedings, an information systemis in place whereby the judge supervising the proceedings and the judge supervising the criminal proceedings can have access to the legal text if they are notif they are not object of a specific prohibition to share. When a minor is involved, the minor,the underage person will be can be interviewed by the judge upon 12 years of age. Such interviews are recorded and the minoris protected from contact with any other of the parties involved. In case of family litigations, the judge can immediatelyfrom the start impose a provision on the parent that can and should be paying for childcare services to do so promptly.Concerning joint custody, in civil proceedings, the judge when deciding for joint physical custody,the judge will then decide where the child will be housed and will make sure that the other parent has accessto the minor, to the child, so that both parties are protected.There is nothing prevents women who are victims of violence to see their children in case of joint custody.This in no way curtails their right to see a child that has been granted in joint custody.Concerning child support, the law provides for the judgeto impose on the parent to pay for child support directlyto make sure that the responsibility is equally shared.As I said, the judge can directly order one of the two parentsto pay for child support if he or she does not do so promptly. Concerning child support in case of divorce,there is an interesting and wide jurisprudence. This kind of support is clearly aimed at supporting the parentwho has no strong economic base. It is also a form of compensation for all those activities that are carried out most often by women to support the familyand the household so that she can be fully autonomous. If one of the two parents, for instance, decided to leave their jobto, e.g. , follow the spouse abroad or in other situations, that kind of child support is granted also to make sure that the woman can again be autonomous from an economical point of view.Concerning the surname given to children, the Italian legal system provides for this. Children can have the surname of both parents in the order that they agree on. That is a right granted.I'll stop here because I think I've run out of time. I wish to provide more information about legal aid in proceedings involving victims of violence.Women have access to free legal aid from the state regardless of their economic situation in case of victims of violence. Again, with respect to free legal aid,there are information points across the regions to make sure that the public is well informed. There are legal experts in place, psychologists. It is a multidisciplinary approach.So at these info points, you have experts that can inform the population about such rights. Thank you.I give the floor to Minister of Health for a follow-up question. Thank you. With reference to the latest questions regarding abortion, we do not have useful information at the moment,something we can share. So we are going to bear in mind the questions for future dialogue sessions. And we thank you for that. Thank you on behalf of the Committee.I would very much like to thank the Distinguished Delegation for answering all these questions. I have further requests for the floor. I know there is very little time. So Delegation, perhaps you can just note them down and provide the answers in writing.First of all, Madam De Silva, 2 min . Madam Chair, I will not take up more time. We are right at the end. But I did want to remind the Distinguished Delegation that they should send us written comments on the questions that I raised on extraterritoriality,the domestication of the Rome statute, as well as the ways in which General Recommendation 37 on climate justice is being integrated into some of the groundbreaking work that is being carried out in Italy. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Boniface, you have the floor.Two minutes. Thank you. Very briefly, I wanted to ask you whether this program that you mentioned exists in all the Italian regions as regards people with disabilities and living with disabilities.I'm very happy that you are progressing with the law that you mentioned. But I would like to know whether the national fund for persons with disabilities, that seems to have been reduced. I think you had four funds initially. Now you have got just one.But it seems that in terms of resources, it is going down. How can you guarantee that jobs are also given to people living with disabilities? How is that covered in your law? Right to health for persons with disabilities,how are you ensuring full accessibility for them? Madam Amelin, you have the floor. Thank you and thank you for being so generous for giving us the floor again at this time. I don't expect an immediate answer,but the whole issue of accessibility is extremely important. And I wanted to tie that in with the whole issue of what you are doing now. You are, to some extent, as it were,entrusting Albania to deal with some of these centers for migrants. What is happening with this new form of organizing thing? And how do you ensure that these people are going to have their rights fully respected? It seems there might be a degree of selectivity. I'm not sure how to use the term, but the selectivityin terms of the migrants who will find themselves in the centers in Albania. And thank you again for giving me the floor. And I would like to thank the Delegation for the quality of their answers. Thank you.So with the final statement just now from the country rapporteur, this brings us to an end of our dialogue. I would again like to say to the Distinguished Delegation that we are looking forward to receiving all the informationthat you have committed to sending to us in writing, plus the questions that we have just heard now and answers to those follow-up questions.And with this, we come to an end of the consideration of the 8th periodic report of Italy as per the simplified reporting procedure. I would like to thank experts for their questions, their comments, and also like to thank all the representativesof the State Party for the answers that they have been providing us with today. Head of Delegation, do you wish to make any concluding statement, Head of Delegation? Very, very short. Personally, I'm extremely happy to be here.Thank you so much for this dialogue. It is my last one after seven years in this position. So I'm extremely pleased to end with this very, very interesting dialogue. Now I will read a formal message. Thank you, Madam President, distinguished CEDAW Committee's experts, ladies and gentlemen.On behalf of the Italian Delegation and myself, allow me to thank most sincerely you and all the CEDAW Committee's experts and the country rapporteurs. Likewise, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the CEDAW Committee Secretariat, the Conference Service, and last but not least, the interpreters.All the UN staff members have ensured efficient and smooth proceeding of our consideration today. I would like also to emphasize on behalf of the Italian Delegation that it has been a great honor to provide you with information, clarification, and explanation about the ongoing efforts of my country.Further information will be provided tomorrow in writing. And thank you again, really, for this very, very important moment.Thank you so much. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the Delegationfor this very constructive dialogue with the Committee. It has really allowed us to get a better grasp of the situation of women and girls in Italy.The Committee would like to commend the State Party for all their efforts and everything that they have done to address the range of recommendations made by the Committee.They will be officially communicated to you through the permanent mission with a view to implementation of the provisions of the Convention in Italy to benefit all women and girls in the country.We would recall the State Party that they have made a series of recommendations for immediate follow-up.These will be mentioned at the end of the concluding observations. And we would invite the State Party, therefore, to pay particular attention to these recommendations there and provide the Committee with informationon implementation within the established time frame. And that will be set out in that paragraph. Thank you, Your Excellency. And we look forward to your next report and a very safe and pleasant journey home.The meeting is adjourned. So a technical pause for our Committee."}

Excellency, Distinguished Madam Chair, Distinguished Members,ladies and gentlemen, at the outset I would like to express the conviction that this constructive dialogue will facilitate further progress in addressing issues for the further implementationof the rights and basic freedoms of women recognized in the Convention. Our Delegation today iscomprised as follows: Mahri Bashamova, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tokmenistan; Vepa Hajiyev, permanent representative of Tokmenistan to the UN office of Geneva; Jema Durgeva, headof the Women's Union; Kujmila Ananyazova, Deputy Head of the State Statistics Committee; ShamshadAtagajanova, Human Rights and Freedoms of the Office of Tokmenistan; and Ms. Gurbanova, Headof Reports and Data Department of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industries; Shamshad Atagajanova, Head of Democracy and International Relations; Head of International Relations Division; SenriSussoeva, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection; and Gulhabaj Atagajanova, the Department ofRights and International Relations of the Interior Ministry. Madam Chair, allow me now to look atthe main areas of Tokmenistan's policy in fulfilling its obligations on gender equality and the main legislative, institutional, administrative and other measures carried out over the reportingperiod which relates to the Convention and are focused also on the comments and recommendations of the Committee received under the concluding observations of 2018 and the recommendationsof the UPR. Over the reporting period, a number of national and international events took placeand I want to touch upon some of these. In Tokmenistan, in keeping with the program for socioeconomic development to 2022, we have constructive reforms and transformations underway in the economy.From 17 to 27 December 2022, we had a full census of the population and housing. Our governmentdecided to conduct that digitally without using paper format. Methodological instructions on preparing and conducting the census were developed in keeping with international standardsand highly assessed by the experts of the UNFPA. Among the census officers and supervisors, womenwere a significant part. As of 17 December 2022, our population was 7,057,841 persons.Almost 50% were women, 50.04% were women, 47.1% lived in cities and 52.9% in rural areas. Interms of age, most were of working age, that's 57%. The younger and older population sectorswere 34.9% and 8.1% respectively. In its active gender policy, Tokmenistan facilitates egalitarian participation by women in all areas of public, political, economic, social and cultural life.The gender policy is based on upholding national interests and the principles of international law and human rights as well as supporting the traditional values and the culture of Turkmensociety. Turkmenistan has signed and ratified a number of United Nations basic instruments for the protection of women's interests and for gender equality. Internationally, Turkmenistanhas assumed obligations and is consistently implementing the CEDL convention as well as the Beijingdeclaration program of action on women and girls. Since 2018, Turkmenistan has joined a numberof international treaties including the ILO convention of 1976, number 144 on tripartite consultation and international labor standards, the Marrakech Treaty on access by the blindand visually impaired persons to published information, the convention on combating discriminationin education, the convention on education policy, the act on amending the charter of the international labor organization, the convention on the recognition of qualifications from higher education in Europe.Gender equality is reflected in all of the national programs for socioeconomic development. One of the main areas of these is further integration of women in the socioeconomic and cultural developmentof our country. These national programs are interlinked with the SDGs including with integration of gender equality and extension of the rights and the possibilities of all women and girls,goal 5. In 2023, we adopted we underwent the 2nd voluntary national review on implementation of the global agenda on sustainable development where we provide information on the implementationof a number of indicators. We are working on further increasing women's participation in all areas of social and political life. We have significant representation of women in parliamentas a result of the elections of 2023, we elected 125 deputies to parliament, 32 of those are women,that is 26%. Likewise, the speaker of the parliament for the 3rd time is a woman. Women are alsorepresented in state bodies and the local executive and representative bodies, local self-government, all political parties registered in our country. In the local representativebodies, women represent the 28.8% and the local self-government bodies, that's 28%. In the structureof the foreign ministry of Turkmenistan, 26.4% of public servants are women, 21.5% of those have the rank of diplomat. One of the deputy ministers of foreign affairs is also a woman.In the foreign diplomatic representations, we have 9.7% of women at the diplomatic level.The permanent representative of Turkmenistan to the United Nations likewise and four women have been granted the highest state award of hero of Turkmenistan, two of those are female diplomats. The deputy president of the cabinet of ministers and deputy leader of the local executives and the rectors of a number of universities as well as chief editors of a number of media outlets are women. Women are also active in businesscurrently 22.4% of entrepreneurs are women. Over the reporting period, we have been implementing the recommendations developed taking into account the comments of the treaty bodies with a national plan of action on the rights of women in Turkmenistan. We have a national plan of action on gender equality in Turkmenistan 2025 which aims to ensure the conditions for equalparticipation by women and men in all areas of activity. That plan has seven strategic pillars, strengthening and improving the legislative basis to ensure gender equality, ensuring gender sensitive health care, supporting equal access to education, preventing gender based violence against women and girls, increasing the economic rights and possibilitiescities of women and girls, increasing participation at all levels including in the political and public areas, strengthening institutional mechanisms to support gender equality. Within the legalreforms underway 2018 to 2023, in order to strengthen the mechanisms for protection promotion of human rights, we adopted new legislation and made amendments to the existing codes andlaws including the family, labour, social, criminal and other codes. In 2020, together with the representative of UNFPA, we carried out a selective study on the health and situation of women inthe family in Turkmenistan covering key topics that affect gender based violence. We have developed a roadmap on implementation of the recommendations from the study to 2025 with tangible actionsto address the key results and more detailed information is contained in the reports to this committee. Our government working with the UN and international organizations is takingsteps to ensure the rights of refugees and stateless persons. Over the past ten years, over 30,000 people have received citizenship and some 6,000 have received residence permits. In the run-upto the 32nd anniversary of the independence of our country, our president signed a decreegranting citizenship to 1301 persons and residence permits to many other persons representing 32ethnic groups. The residence permits numbered 265 of those people were from 13 countries. Overthe past four years, 1,860 residence permits have been issued, 80% of them to women and 8,068people have been granted citizenship of those over 55% are women. Turkmenistan is working with international organizations including the Executive Committee for the UN structures ongender equality and broadening the rights and possibilities of women 2022-24, the Executive Committee of UNICEF 2024-26. Turkmenistan was also a member previously of the Commission onthe Status of Women up to 2022. The international actions undertaken within these commissionscontinue to improve achievement of the qualitative results on obtaining international standards on gender equality. Within its mandate, the Ombudsman carries out activities to uphold theguarantees for state protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens including ensuring gender equality. In focusing on gender equality in the Central Asian region in August 2021 atthe initiative of Turkmenistan within the consultative meeting of heads of state of Central Asia we had the 1st dialogue of women from the Central Asian states with representatives of the statesof the region exchanging experience and approaches to further promotion of gender equality. Likewise at Turkmenistan's initiative in May 2022 in Ashkabad we held the interparliamentary forum and dialogueof women of the countries of Central Asia and Russia. The topic was the role of women in public and political life and socioeconomic development. Distinguished members, one of the goals of thenational plan of action on gender equality in Turkmenistan is eliminating stereotypes that lead to discrimination against women. In that connection we are carrying out strategic actionsfor the further transformation of the public mentality ensuring the need for social equality of women and men. We regularly have campaigns to raise awareness of the convention on theelimination of all forms of discrimination against women. The national legislation and the national plan of action among women, men, young people in Ashkabad and in the regions and also throughthe media. In order to improve public awareness on gender issues the representatives of the women's union of Turkmenistan working with members of parliament carry out measures on gender. Thegovernment supports NGOs that protect women's rights including the union of women which is the leading association. This regularly carries out information campaigns in Turkmenistan includingon issues of gender equality. Gender topics are also included in the training courses of the civil service academy for middle managers. The Supreme Court of Turkmenistan has an informationcenter which holds seminars for judges in order to improve public servants' awareness of humanrights and gender equality. As regards education we have a state program on state youth policyto 2025. A program for the improvement of activities of preschools for the early development andthe training of children to 2025. The outline of improvement in Turkmenistan of teaching of natural sciences, the framework on the development of digital education, the framework of improvementof teaching of foreign languages and we have primary middle and higher vocational educationon all topics where girls may study any subject. Women are studying sciences and technical subjects. This allows us to improve our country's socioeconomic development and the competitiveness of womenon the labor market. The number of girls in higher vocational establishments for 2024 was 45.4% and in secondary vocational establishments was 65.7%. The state social policy focuses onthe socioeconomic adaptation of children with special needs. They can receive education like all children in our country regardless of the level of their disability. We have 17 establishmentsfor children in that category where there are some 5,000 pupils. There is international cooperation on education which is which provides support to young people in education in various countries.The number of girls in higher and middle vocational education abroad is 33% of the total number of pupils studying according to intergovernmental agreements. On health, our government focuseson maternal and reproductive health as a priority. In 2021 we adopted the national strategy healthymother healthy child healthy future on protecting maternal and child health to 2025. Maternalmortality was reduced three fold from 2015. It went down from 3 in 2015 to 1.7 in 2022. To improve the health of future mothers we have an instrument to assess the quality of serviceson family planning and we have identified risk at risk groups. To 2022 we had observation of positive trends in reducing teen pregnancies in the age range 15 to 19. This indicator in2022 it was 22.9 per 1,000 live births among teenage girls. As regards employment, we have raised the level of economic activity of women. In 2019, the economically active populationhad 45.8% women and it is now over 48%. In large and middle sized enterprises we have womenemployed at over 44%. In 2019, that figure was at 41%. The percentage of women in leadershipposts is 22.4%. The Labor Code guarantees that employed women with young children and children with disabilities have additional benefits. As regards persons with special needs, the stateguarantees their right to vocational education, to employment support and to self-employment. There is a particular legislative act that establishes quotas from 2 to 5% of the number of postsin enterprises for specific categories who require state support. In 2022, 2023 with UNICEF support, the international speech synthesizer for the visually impaired was adapted to our state language.In 2020, we have carried out work to assess the need in this respect. This synthesizer has now beensuccessfully adapted to our state language. As regards the census in 2022, at the recommendation of the Washington Group on disability statistics, we for the 1st time obtained information on peopleaged over 5 with difficulties walking, seeing, hearing and with memory. Every year through presidentialdecrees, we raise the level of pensions and benefits including disability benefits. And the women are represented at 56% among recipients of that benefit. As regards implementation of the rights of women inrural areas, our legislation does not contain standards or provisions establishing different rights for urban and rural residents. Rather, we create conditions for equal access by all to medicalcare, education, technical training, employment and housing. The census shows as of 2022 that in ruralareas, employed women were 49% of the general population of working age. And 50.1% of employedwomen in Turkmenistan as a whole. 20% of the working rural women were working in enterprises, 22% weretenants, 8.6% were individual entrepreneurs, 13.5% had professional or vocational education and one-thirdhad higher or higher vocational education. Distinguished members, all of this shows that our country is working consistently to fulfill the main provisions of the international convention on the elimination ofall forms of discrimination against women as well as the standards of the national legislation on the protection of women and girls. This convincingly confirms that Turkmenistan as it undertakes socialand economic reforms and democratic transformation is prioritizing the protection of the rights of women and girls. During our dialogue, we will try to answer the questions of the members of the committeeand provide additional information to shed light on the direction and the nature of further work to achieveprogress on gender equality. I thank you. For your very detailed opening statements, I wish to draw on behalfof the committee, I thank the Delegation for her introductory remarks and I take note of all the achievements that the State Party has recorded since 2018 and I thank the head of Delegation. Distinguished Delegation,as you are aware, the procedure for the committee for the consideration of periodic reports is for questions to be posed by a number of experts following which the Delegation will be given an opportunity to respondto those questions. Following that, another group of experts will be given an opportunity to pose questions and the Delegation is again given the floor to respond. The experts questions will be asked largelyfollowing the order of the Articles of the Convention. This procedure is allowed throughout the two meetings of today. I would like to remind the Delegation that the committee will aim to complete its considerationof the implementation of the Convention by Turkmenistan by 5 p.m. today. The dialogue will be webcast live on UN Web TV. I wish to draw the Delegation's attention to the need for careful sign managementthroughout the day and I encourage the Delegation to provide precise, short, direct and appropriate responses to experts' questions as well as to indicate when a response cannot be provided. In that case, yourDelegation should take note of the questions that cannot be answered immediately and you may request to submit the pending information in writing within 24 hours, that is one working day from the end of theconstructive dialogue and in this instance, that would be Monday, the 5th of February at 5 p.m. Geneva time. In order to enable an interactive dialogue, the submission of additional information in writingshould be the exception rather than the rule. If the Delegation submits additional information in writing within 24 hours, such information should not exceed 1,500 words and should be timely,concise and answer the concrete questions posed by the experts. Please also note that such information will also be published on the CEDAW website for the 87th session as it forms part of the public dialogue.Lack of or inadequate replies to questions raised by the Committee may result in follow-up questions and eventually may be reflected in the concluding observations of the Committee. I should also liketo indicate that if necessary, the Delegation may be asked to limit its responses should this become necessary due to time considerations and I crave your indulgence in advance should that happen.I will now call upon the experts who wish to pose questions under the various Articles of the Convention. Experts are also reminded to respect the time limits for questions. Where questions are notsufficiently answered, experts will be given an opportunity to ask follow-up questions for 2 min only. We will start the questions relating to Articles 1 and 2 of Part 1 of the Conventionand I would like to give the floor to the country rapporteur, Mr. Elgun Savarov. You have the floor for 6 min , please. Thank you. Madam Chair, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, let me warmlywelcome Your Excellency Mrs. Mahdi Pashumova, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Wepa Hajiyev,permanent representative of the Republic of Turkmenistan and all honored Delegation members of Turkmenistan. Your Excellencies, Turkmenistan's traditional developed family and women policyimplementing many awareness raising projects on the prevention of violence and trafficking creates state shelters and hold lines for victims adopted several national action plans during these years.State policy directly based on the supporting demographic situation and implementing nationalstandards on human rights protection. At the same time, I appreciate the state party activities for the harmonization of legislation and measures including for the adoption of international standards.During this year, the government of Turkmenistan signed the national action plan for the gender equality to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwiseprint disabled. I hope the new law on social services which positively developed to introduce specialized service on the social work for the vulnerable population amended to the criminal legislation especially with Article 162. Turkmenistan realized its 2nd voluntary national review forsustainable development goals in 2023. However, Turkmenistan continues scoring law in international rankings. For the gender inequality index, Turkmenistan was just 0.177 at 43 ranks out of 170countries. For SDGs 5, gender equality performance in international rankings, there is a challenge in achieving the respective SDG targets remain and there is a score show with the decrease. As for the December 2020, only 20% of indicators needed to monitor the SDG from the agenda perspective wereavailable. This is a real gap especially in statistic data what is happening at this moment, especially gender equality policy and women access to the services. Still did not adopt its special law addressing all forms of gender based violence against women including domestic violence and sexual violence.The situation regarding women rights and gender equality in Turkmenistan has been deteriorating in recent years unfortunately. This is evident in the way women are informally forced to follow dress codes and adhere to the moral standards that discriminate and include women and girls from accessingtheir rights. The media and social network actively promotes stereotypes and gender roles emphasizing the importance for women to maintain family harmony and adhere to moral conduct of girls and women.In 2018, CEDAW already recommended amending the definition of discrimination against women which prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in private and public spheres to the constitution.What kind of activities are done on this important legislation during these years? The harmonization of national laws with respect to the convention. What is the status of customary law vis-a-vis national civil law and its impact to the effective implementation of the convention? Convention visibility. Why stateparty did not incorporate it directly? Internet access is heavily censored with many social media networks, messages, applications, new sites and other resources have been arbitrarily blocked in the country. You know at this moment in the statistic what we got from United Nations and other alternative resources,1,200,000 domains were blocked in the country. Women who drive cars are almost discriminated against in Turkmenistan. Especially we get this fact from 2019 to 2021. Women drivers were refused jobs as ataxi under the same time limited in access to the licenses. According to the state parties, the law to 2014 was public association was amended and they are including the special norms in the better way. At the same time, serious obstacles to opportunities of civil society organizations in Turkmenistan,limited number of public associations are registered in the country. How many NGOs are registered at work on women rights, especially on gender equality? What is the budget for NGOs and procedures of the granting?NGOs limited access to the grants and limited participation in the resolving community problems, international representation. For example, why we did not see any NGOs which came from Turkmenistan for this session today? Female prisoners are subject to particularly several perceptions. They are doublevictimized with the sexual and physical violence in the correctional facilities in detention. We have the information that female prisoners do not have proper medical help in the places and facilitation. Limitedstatistic data and different problems which including here. I will not go directly to the different questions. I will go to our visibility. What kind of measures did the state partner to adopt increasing visibility of the Convention and optional protocol? They are not including text of the Convention andprotocol in the web page of state agencies, e.g. , Minister of Education or Minister of Labor. It is not translated in the Turkmen language and not including in the official web page. How many cases in decision of just referred to the convention and Articles 143 of the criminal court of the Republicgoing against fighting against gender-based discrimination? What specific measures have been taken to all levels in Turkmenistan to ensure that women, girls, victims of continuous and distributed access to information or available assistance including free legal aid? Please provide anyinformation that state party plans to develop for collecting and analyzing gender disaggregated statistics at the national level. What kind of reforms are planned to do? When will state partyreform justice and the correction facility system? When will state party increase women's staff in detention service which are important, increasing women's staff representation in facilitated places?What's a real problem in the process of the Convention limitation in Turkmenistan? And the last I will say in the Russian language. Turkmenistan recognizes universal standards for human rights.It recognizes the priorities of international law in its constitution. Now we will look at the legislation of the country which has transformed over the past years. Women's policy must be in line with theConvention. We are most of all interested in the questions of implementation. Thank you for your attention. I will now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the questions. Membersof the Delegation should introduce themselves as they respond to the questions. And I would ask that you do not take more than 15 minutes. Thank you. Mr. Safarov, thank you very much for your questions.Of course, there are things that we could discuss, of course. But the representative of Parliament willanswer your questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning, colleagues, participants, experts.I'm a member of the Parliament of Turkmenistan, a member of the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights. There is no discrimination in the legislation or the institutes of Turkmenistan. The code onsocial protection, the employment code or any other legislation, discrimination in any of its forms is prohibited. The violation of rights leads to accountability by the legislation established inTurkmenistan. With respect to the development of a special law prohibiting all forms of discrimination,the Parliament of Turkmenistan is discussing its advisability. In the comments in the Committees of the Parliament, there have been more than ten meetings with representatives of the scientificcommunities, experts and specialists on this issue. And we are also studying international practice in this context. In line with the Constitution of Turkmenistan, the Majlis is responsible for adoptinglaws and implementing and overseeing their implementation. It's also responsible for providing official interpretations. In line with this, the Majlis carries out a monitoring of the nationallegislation including by the administrative and through the administrative and criminal code. We alsoverify any violence or abuse against women and ensure that conditions are proper. We verify whetherthere has been any forced marriages and there is responsibility that is attributed for such offensesin the criminal code. There is also criminal liability for the abuse of minors and thethere is a list of dangerous acts and offenses which entail penalties under the criminal code. Thelegislation is being improved and on the 1st of January, 2023, our legislation has been brought in linewith standards in particular there has been an Article with respect to abortion, forced abortion that has beenintroduced. But there has also been legislation introduced to prohibit the abuse of real or artificialdependents on others. Leaders of social organizations bear responsibility. There is an analysis on thelegislation with regard to gender sensitive approach. Thank you for your attention. Could we add anothercomment from another member of the Delegation, please? Good morning. Mr. Safarov, thank you very much foryour questions and thank you for the opportunity to answer those questions. With respect to information, desegregated information, disaggregated information on gender, on violence and discrimination on gendergrounds, this is an investigation that took place on the 5th and the 6th, after the 5th and 6th round and this was in cooperation with UNICEF and is available on their site. There is also information that isprovided as an MDG indicator on the site of the state statistics office and so we find those indicatorson that site. They are available. Currently we are undertaking the 6th round of the statistical survey where we have another module that was introduced on violence against women. These two indicatorsof the MDG 5.11 and 5.12 on violence and abuse against women are available there. But there is broader information, desegregated, that is available and that relates not only tothe SDG indicators 5.21 and 5.11 and they are available on the UNICEF site as well. Thank you very much for this information. Thank you. And the Women's Union will now also add a few words. There is no suchthing as a dress code. There is such a thing as tradition. Just show me one person who was forcedto wear traditional dress. There is no such person. Thank you. We don't force anyone. Our women lovetheir national traditional dress. We don't force them. This is the choice of every woman. I'd just liketo say that recently there is increasing interest in our traditional clothes. So come visit our country and you will see it with your own eyes. There is no such thing as a dress code in our country. Thank you.You would also like to add a few words here. In Ministry of Internal Affairs with respect to the discrimination against women drivers and driver's licenses in Al-Shabaab and all major cities in thecountry, there is an automatic testing and examination software that exists for receiving a driver's license. This includes verifications of the knowledge of future drivers of the code, thelegislation and has the technical and practical aspects in two steps. The theoretical exam is carriedout by software and the practical exam is carried out directly at a driver's automated driver's testing site. This technology has led to a reduction of the contact between police and the citizens andhas removed the human factor for verifying the theory and the practice. This means that the road police in fact can in no way influence the result of the examination and this includes any gender aspectsand this proves that there is no gender discrimination in terms of driving against women. We would like to give you some statistical facts. Between 2017 and 2023, there were over 9,000 driver's licensesthat were granted throughout the country. We also believe it's useful to state that the there arediplomatic representatives that took part in this automated testing facility and are familiar, they are familiar with the process from beginning to end. Thank you. Thank you. If there are any otherquestions, we still have some time so we can hear some more replies. We are happy to see you,Distinguished Members and thank you very much for such a broad overview of our activities in the area of gender equality. You have put forward a lot of questions. There are specialists here who canconduct a dialogue with you. I would just like to note that in our country and this is the head of our Delegation who noted this in her statement as well, from 2015 on, we have national plans of actionin the area of human rights and I think you are all well aware of this because all of this information is reproduced in the reports and it was reproduced in the previous reports as well. The scope ofthese questions as you heard the head of Delegation are specifically included in the goals and purposes of this plan and our work is carried out systematically to implement this plan but you are all experts,you all understand that these issues cannot be resolved overnight. We need time, we need scientific analysis, we need to study international experience and by this I mean successful internationalexperience and we need to adapt this international experience to our national experience and this process is specifically what we are engaged in now. The Government is now carrying out a comprehensivestudy of all these structures and all the questions that you have raised. So I will not now dwell on each of these individual questions. I think experts will ask questions but we do have all the information youneed and it is with pleasure that we will convey to you the, e.g. , information on the survey of domestic violence which is a process that was a lengthy and a very careful one. You all understandthat this is a very sensitive difficult issue which comes into traditional family concepts and so youunderstand the difficulties here. There are other areas where the members of Parliament and the representative of Government will give you information on but with respect to the implementation oflegislation, I would like to say that that is one of the most important issues in our plan of action. Now we are developing the 3rd plan to counter human trafficking and each of these plans contains as one of its 1stpoints the improvement of national legislation and the implementation of international obligations underall of the international acts that our Government has acceded to. And now I would like to point out that we have a new Parliament, a new younger Parliament. Over 40% of the Parliament now are young specialists, young experts. So we are now also building capacity in the area of human rights including in terms of gender equality. Wework very closely together with Parliament and in our working groups which the Parliament sets up when developing draft laws, there are civil society organizations that are present. These are not necessarily NGOs that deal only with women's rights but these are organizations which in their mandates have the opportunity to do so and do some work in those areas. And as we continue thisdialogue, I can give you specific examples. I will leave some time for my colleagues. I think they can provide additional information. But I'm pleased that you outlined these questions because these are specifically issues that we are working on as any other Government. Thank you. Thank you very much, Delegation, Distinguished Delegation. And I will now yield the floor to Mr. Sapporo for follow-up questions for 2 min , please. Thank you.I thank the representatives of the Delegation for the answers provided. The issue is really that the CEDAW Committee and the human rights mechanisms as a whole undertakes dialogues and presents assistance to countries by pointing them in the right direction and our issue here is women's rights, the removal of harmful stereotypes in the human rightsstereotypes. And this, in fact, is something that we do with respect to all states, all Governments and such stereotypes also exist everywhere. Unfortunately, I put some questions which did not receive an answer. For example, the integration of the CEDAW Convention and the translation of it into the Turkmen language so that the citizens, the women, men and children of Turkmenistan can understand their rights. Andthen there is an Article of the criminal code on discrimination on gender basis. So we need information on how many cases have been brought, how much training was carried out under the CEDAW Convention over the past four years. I know that for many years and even today, the educational system in Turkmenistan represents only 60% to 70% ofenrollment depending on the regions. So we want to know how many criminal cases there were, how many references there were in court cases to CEDAW or to the optional protocol, to the protocol of CEDAW. And this is what we would like to know over the past four years. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Safra. I will give 5 min . Thank you. I will answer immediately. Theconvention to which Turkmenistan exceeded has been translated into the state language, has been collected into a compendium and is available on a disk. It is also available on the sites of our government sites. So there is access to those conventions. In addition, our institute regularly issues the human rights collections volumes on all theinternational instruments relating to gender equality and on our national legislation as well. The last time we issued such a volume was in 2017, and in 2020, we issued one on children's rights. On the holding of seminars now, unfortunately, I can't say how many there have been over the past four years, but I can say that we regularly work with the UNFPA, representative, therepresentative in Turkmenistan with embassies that are accredited in Uzbekistan and with other organizations. And now we are planning actions in all the vilayats of Turkmenistan along with law enforcement officers. And this is something we are carrying out in the OSC offices in Turkmenistan. In addition to this, we have a project on theimplementation of the national plan of action on human rights, and within the framework of this activity, we hold seminars in all the vilayats of the city of Ashrabat on the basis of our human rights center, which is open, which has a branch in every one of the vilayats. Our institute now has a comparative law institute which was established withwith Germany. And this also provides a training for law enforcement officers on the risks, and human rights risks and the implementation of international standards, taking into account case law and international obligations. So this is work that is being carried out. And I could ask perhaps the representative of the ministry of internal affairs whether she has any information on the number of judges or participants in such seminars, but what I can tellyou is that there is information on this in our 6th periodic report, and that was those were the facts that were available when we provided this information. But this work is continuing. Now we are discussing issues relating to our latest project for implementation of international standards, and there are also several components forimproving the competencies of law enforcement officials. So this is a process that is underway. Thank you. On the situation of women in the penitentiaries, women's penitentiaries in Turkmenistan are fully in line with international standards. In order to support the health of women who are sentenced, we have fivesquare meters per woman that is allocated, and that is in line with the penitentiary code of Turkmenistan. Beyond the main facilities available, we also have special facilities set aside for pregnant women and women with their children. During and after birth, we have all services that are required, that are provided. We have a children's house, which is a specialbuilding that is set aside for prisoners and their children up to three years. There are improved living accommodations that are provided, and all the hygiene facilities are available. There are also improved nutrition facilities that are available for these women. There is also a all the other facilities that areavailable, e.g. , bathing houses and hairdressers and so on. With respect to your question, women in penitentiaries, the penitentiaries have audio recordings and video surveillance. There are also other factors I would like to note, which is that the supervision is carried out primarily by female guards who have access to the sites. Maleemployees only guard the outside perimeter of penitentiaries and basically have no opportunities for any kind of personal contact with women detainees. Therefore, the questions that were asked are, in fact, not confirmed in reality. I would also like to comment on the question of the medical care for detainees carried out. This is carried out in the women's facilities ofthe medical services provided in each of the penitentiaries, and the full range of medical services is available. We can send written information to give more detailed answers to Mr. Safarov's questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. We will now move to questions relating to Articles 3 and 4 of Part 1 of the Convention. Wehave the understanding that the Delegation will send in written responses to Articles 1 and 2. I would now like to turn the floor to Ms. Marion Bethel who will be taking Article 3 for 4 min , please. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning. I join my colleague in welcoming the Distinguished Delegation of Turkmenistan to this constructive dialogue. We commendthe State Party for its national action plan for gender equality 2021 to 2025 which identifies national goals, objectives and priorities to continue advancement in the realization of gender equality. We regret, however, that the State Party has not established a specialized ministry or department dedicated to the advancement of women's human rights, nondiscrimination and gender equality. A functional national women's machinery is central to Article 3 and has a directcorrelation with the effective implementation of the CEDAW Convention. It is, therefore, critical that the State Party has a well-structured and resourced national women's machinery. Has the State Party elaborated a national gender policy on which the national action plan is based for the advancement of women across sectors? What are the priority areas of the policy and the national action plan? Are there time-bound measures, indicators and targets and adequate monitoringframework? In your replies to the list of issues at paragraph 54, you state that the NAP, the national action plan is monitored and evaluated on a regular basis. What, then, are the principle findings of the most recent review in regard to this policy and plan and are they in alignment with CEDAW and the SDGs? What targets and priorities were assessed and achieved on this last review? How effective is the action plan's outreach into the rural areas beyond the capitalareas? Does the plan have public awareness educational campaigns to popularize its policy programs among all women, especially vulnerable women, inclusive of women with disabilities and rural women? How is the media being engaged to promote these strategies? Has the action plan established and operationalized an interministerial committee in order to effectively deliver on its mandate? Given the need for efficiency and effectiveness of the national action plan, what is the staff's strength and expertisedeployed to the plan? Is there adequate capacity and training to undertake the state party's priorities and deliver them in a systematic way? What mechanisms will be used to ensure that the implementation of the national action plan is effectively coordinated? I now turn to women, peace and security. We note that the state party has not engaged with the 13/25 Security Council resolution in regard to establishing a national action plan. This course of action appears to be adesign with the state party's national development agenda, gender equality policies and other relevant areas within the domestic and foreign policy of the state party. I note that the state party's interdepartmental commission has established a working group on international humanitarian law. Would the state party then consider drafting a national action plan in regard to women, peace and security? As the state party is aware, a national action plan are strategy documents thatoutline a course of action on the WPS agenda and underscore objectives and activities. Would the state party, therefore, consider taking steps to establish an NAP to demonstrate its commitment to develop concrete measures to enhance the participation of women in decision making processesrelating to post-conflict policies and strategies? In regard to the Ombudsman Office and National Human Rights Institute, in November 2016, the parliament adopted the Ombudsperson Act and in June 2023, the office requested accreditation with GANRI. This review is scheduled to takeplace in 2024. The Paris principles require NHRIs to be independent in law, have control of resources and to also have a broad mandate. Is there currently a competency in the officethat includes receiving and hearing matters related to violations of women's human rights, gender equality and nondiscrimination on the basis of sex and gender? In what specific ways is a gender perspective incorporated into the work of the office of the Ombudsperson? And what measures are in place to increase the institutional capacity ofthe Ombudsman Office? What are the financial, human and technical resources available to the office to carryout its mandate and address human rights violations including in cases involving women? Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms. Bethel. I will now call on Mr. Elgun Safarov to take on Article 4 and then we will yield the floor to the State Party. Thank you. You have the floor, please, for 3 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You must understand the need for temporary special measures and introduce it as they are essential to secureequal opportunities in participation and competition in various fields of social life where social health and economic burdens may be placed to women as a result of gender stereotypes of their roles in maternity, e.g. . Unfortunately, in Turkmenistan, there is no quota system nor any on the ground of the legal including the legislation. Turkmenistan applies to the special measures on the representation of women in the municipal top management leveland some other instances. There is not clear identification or the temporary special measures incorporated in the regulatory system and mechanisms. The current practice used in the country is related to the appointment of the female deputy governors at the regional level the two-year term. However in the practice it is including especially the deputy level and if you go to the high level it is a different situation. I don't want to go into the statistical data. It is not the questionnow. It will be later in Article 7 and 8. But when we go to the special temporary special measures, does the state party plan to amend the election code to implement the temporary special measures such as the minimum quotas for women representation in elected and appointedbodies, outreach and support programs and targeted recruitment, hiring and promotion to achieve substantive gender equality particularly in political and public life? What kind of activities adopted by the state party was understanding acceptance of the temporary special measuresin context of the overall object of purpose of the Convention? Another two questions, what kind of prevention measures were undertaken for the prevention of the negative results of women and girls of COVID-19 virus? We know that it was worldwide virus situation, COVID-19,what was done during these years, especially 2021, to prevent such kind of results of the COVID-19. Any statistic data on positive discrimination acts implementation? Thank you very much. Thankyou very much, Mr. Sakharov. I will now yield the floor to the state Delegation for 15 minutesso that we can have time for another round if need be. Thank you. Thank you very much foryour questions. My colleagues will now add information as regards a special departmentfor women. We have the union of women that involves all women including women leaders, all women including women leaders, the union of women of Turkmenistan which I mentioned in my openingstatement and my colleagues will now say more that's working hard on gender issues, on legislation,on life situations as well. So now you will hear more detailed information from my colleaguesbut the state is in no way resting on its laurels. It is moving forward seeking input internationallyfrom experts. There is work underway. I would like to give the floor to the union of women. I will try to answer some of those questions. Our women's union seeks to raise awareness amongwomen, improve their social activity in our society. It is active on gender issues and genderequality as well as improving the rights and the possibilities of women, protecting women and their family, teaching the younger generation to respect national values, developing patrioticfeelings and every year in order to improve the status of women, our women's union carriesout events such as the competition woman of the year and there are nominations that takeplace. This gives a positive image of contemporary women leaders and women entrepreneurs and shows the participation of women in the democratic process underway. Among students in highereducation we also have a beauty contest in order to improve public awareness of genderequality. Our women's union activists have meetings for young women and girls as well as representativesof the local authorities and in all of the Willeyettes we recently had rural meetings on creating favorableconditions in the family for the raising of children and gender equality and the newspapers publishinterviews on gender issues. On the central TV channels we have programs on gender equality and family health, my family, my fortress and other such programs. All of this is carried out by the women's unioninvolving the media and our website also is used for that purpose. Thank you. I would like now to givethe floor to the representative parliament on legislation. Thank you. As far as quotas go, wedon't have provision for a quota for women in elections under our legislation but the women in Turkmenistanare well represented in the higher state bodies and in education, science, sport, culture, business, aswell as in political activity. The legal basis for temporary special measures is the constitution andvarious laws and subsidiary legislation related to our international obligations. The political basisfor the temporary special measures is the national goal of our government and parliament. Thank you.On health, if we could also hear, please. Thank you. Good morning. I'm from the health ministrylike other countries, Turkmenistan is working hard to integrate within WHO to face the challenges arisingfrom the pandemic. If the speaker could please slow down. We have a response plan to the coronavirusand in 2020, through presidential edict, we adopted that plan. During the two-year period I may just make a request that you speak a little slowly so that the interpreters can translate your intervention.Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to 2022 as I was saying. We had the technicalgroup working with WHO. It came to the WHO group came to Turkmenistan and given the various internationalcontacts and our geographical situation, since the emergency started, we took the relevant measuresto prevent the entry of the virus into our country in order to protect our territory and stop the spread of the virus as well as to carry out monitoring and protect our citizens arriving from abroad. All ofthe willets adopted control points and units to isolate and observe those who had recently arrived.All of those posts and the state borders had disinfection facilities to disinfecttransport vehicles and there was emergency medical care provided as well as delivery of samples tolaboratories. On the roads, we also had observation points for internal migration and persons movingwithin willets had to undergo thermal screening and provide medical documentation on their health.In all forms of transport in the schools and universities as well as in other places, we regularly had disinfectioncarried out. We stepped up the efforts on epidemiological monitoring. We stepped up laboratorymonitoring of the environment, drinking water, food, the air and the soil. There was awareness work carried out with the public in border areas and indeed throughout the country to take preventive measures wearingmasks, observing social distancing and other useful habits to avoid the virus.From 2021, we had vaccination starting using the AstraZeneca vaccine. The head of the Delegation, I believe that those interventions can be presented under Article 12 which is on health. We are nowconsidering temporary special measures that the country has adopted as well as the national gender machinery. If we could keep responses focused on those so that we can then deliberate on health issueswhen we get to Article 12. Thank you. Distinguished members, I would like to speak about the measuresunder COVID which, of course, directly I wouldn't say was spread in our country but since Turkmenistanis a member of the international community, the global pandemic did affect social and economicposition. We do have trade and economic as well as cultural links with many other countries and thosecountries which suffered the pandemic or other situations were able to impact on our country'seconomic position as well. In 2020, we developed together with WHO representatives and adopted inJune of that year 2020 a plan of emergency measures to combat the pandemic with a set of measures to alleviate the adverse impact of the global pandemic on the social and economic situation of Turkmenistanwith a focus on the more vulnerable population groups in keeping with the principle of leaving no one behind. The measures sought to improve the quality and access to healthcare and show socialprotection and basic social services and provide macroeconomic stimulation and cooperation as well as supporting the social fabric. If I may, since we have limited time, perhaps we could move on and comeback to this later. Thank you. I just want to say a few words in response to Ms. Bethel's questions onthe national gender equality plan. Since these issues are dear to our hearts, the members of the interagency commission on the international obligations of Turkmenistan on human rights and internationalhumanitarian law will know that the commission was set up in August 2020 and it has been preparing national reports since then, working on concluding observations, preparing recommendations on joininginternational treaties and it coordinates implementation of the national plans of action. As regards the national gender equality plan of action and I should also say that the commission is one of the statebodies. In addition, we have the ombudsman and the committee on the rights and human rights and freedoms under Parliament and institute on law and democracy and the MEDLIS. So under the commission, as I wassaying, the interagency commission, there is a special working group and you were quite right to saythat's on international humanitarian law, that group. There is also a working group on combating trafficking which has a number of civil society organizations involved and there is a working groupon monitoring domestic violence which makes recommendations to the commission and coordinatedthe preparation and the implementation of the roadmap that was adopted as a result of the study.So these structures are the bodies that carry out the gender policy of our country.On monitoring, we do carry out monitoring of implementation of our national plans including on gender equality. Now, how is that done? Firstly, at meetings of the interagency commission, theleaders of organizations provide information on implementation of the goals under the plans.There is a rubric under the lead ministry which has indicators and results and that's done in connectionwith the STGs. So during the discussions, there are some recommendations made as well.On assessments, yes, we do carry out evaluations of the legislative acts that we get from parliament.That's done in rural areas as well. We do work with rural areas. The group goes, a group goes to theto the Williettes and we meet the representatives of the ACIMs, the social representatives responsible for implementation of the plan and with the other people involved in implementing the plans. I could tell youa lot about the plans but I know that we are short of time. It is a very interesting and important topic and I'm happy to answer these questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would now like to givethe floor to Ms. Bethel for follow-up. Can we do it in less than 2 min ? Thank you. Thank you, Chair. I would like to thank the Delegation for its responses to my questions and I'm still concernedabout some of the specifics that I had asked for. One, under the national action plan, yes, you did say that you have a regular review and so what I was asking for is what are the priority areas of thenational action plan and can you tell us about the success of one or two of those areas? Very specifically, please. In regard to the women, peace and security, I got no response to that and so I still would liketo ask you, given that you have an intercommission on humanitarian law, would you consider drafting a national action plan under 13/25 Security Council Resolution to achieve the objective of the workingof women, peace and security? And again, under the Ombudsperson question, I wanted to know is theregender perspective and is there a competency that the Ombudsperson has to hear violations of women's rights and to give the kinds of rulings that are required. Thank you. Those three specific areas.Thank you very much, Ms. Betel. I will now give the floor to Mr. Sakharov for less than 2 min ,please. Thank you. Thank you very much. It will be less. There was a question on positive discrimination or affirmative action. Unfortunately, I didn't get an answer to that. I know that Turkmenistan has donea lot of work to do to protect mothers, e.g. , mothers of many children. There has been affirmative action in your 2018 report. There was mention of that. And I would like now to know about statisticaldata on positive discrimination. What has been done? What has been done, e.g. , under the Labor Code? Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Sakharov. I will now give the Delegation like 10 minwith the suggestion that those responses that you do have data on, you can provide them in writing. You can consider that. So 10 min , please. Thank you. The representative of the Ministry of the Interior,please. Then we will have additional contributions from the Office of Statistics on women's safety.On this question, Turkmenistan is one of the safest countries. According to the investigation on Cluster 6in 2015, the majority of women and girls feel safe when they walk in their neighborhoods at night, andthat's 72%. This is according to one of the SDG indicators. Some others never go out alone at nightwhile it's dark. In 2019, the global terrorism indicators also carried out an investigation, andaccording to them, Turkmenistan is in place 138 low down the list of the Risk of Terrorist Act. So it is considered as one of the safest countries in the world. To a large extent, this is thanks to thestate policy to ensure the safety of its population. Thank you. Good morning, colleagues. I'm arepresentative of employment and social protection. Just a few words. I believe that subsequently, we will be looking into other articles which relate directly to employment and social support, butfor now, I'd just like to say that we have carried out a major piece of work, and this is on positive discrimination. There have been excellent initiatives, e.g. , that were carried out in the context ofimplementing the recommendations that were made previously. In the period where it was not possibleto for citizens to leave Turkmenistan during the COVID period, many women, in fact, remain stranded outside of Turkmenistan and were unable to carry out their activities within Turkmenistan. To a largeextent, the situation was similar to that of men, but there was a decision to introduce an amendment to the legislation to ensure that all those who were unable to come back to their country for objectiveregions and were unable to come to work, their positions in employment were preserved as weretheir salaries. With respect to women who reached the pension age, and we have a great number of womenwho were entitled to pension benefits, they too, if they were left outside Turkmenistan during the pandemicperiod, when they returned home, they were granted pension, even an advantageous one, which they were entitled to receive during the period when they were outside Turkmenistan. That is to say, their fullbenefits were granted to them from the time that they were entitled to them and not from the time when they were able to come and claim them. There were advantageous positions where previously women wereallowed to retire at age 52 or 54. So if they the head of Delegation, thank you very much. Ms. Bethel alsoasked another question on the priorities in our national plans. I had set out the priorities in our national program in my statement, in particular regarding gender, there are seven priorities whichare outlined. If you would like, we can also add additional information on this in writing, but I did state this in my statement, health, education and other factors, there were seven in total which are covered as the priorities in gender issues and we will have additional comments now, please, you havethe floor. Microphone, please. Thank you. As the head of Delegation said, there are actions to combat domestic violence. We believe this is one of the priorities as this aims to eradicate stereotypes inour society and the work that is being carried out to monitor this is being done. We developed a roadmapand we are now implementing it and this is under the responsibility of a Working Group. So that is a result and I think that in the future we will be able to introduce amendments to our existing legislationwith a view to overcoming this phenomenon in our society. With respect to the Ombudsman, you are right, there was a law on the Ombudsman and his responsibilities or her responsibilities includesholding hearings and communicating with ministries and agencies on gender policies and as you know, the Ombudsman also prepares an annual report for the Turkmenistan Parliament where all the work carriedout over the years outlined including on the issue of the rights of women and girls. So that's a briefoverview. Thank you, Madam Chair. Regarding Article 3 and 4, I have a short comment. Regarding Article3, yes, we will consider possibility of implementing Security Council Resolution in the framework of our Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. Now we work on this issue and I think in the future we'llsend results of our work on the framework of our Intergovernmental Commission. Regarding Article 4,we hear a lot about allegedly existing quotas. I think it's a fake and it's stereotype that we see here.Regarding the appointment of deputy heads, it's not formal procedures. It's new opportunity and good opportunity for women, for women bureaucrats. We have many examples when deputy majors are appointedas directors of institutes, as ministers, deputy ministers, newspaper and magazine editors andeven deputy prime minister. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the head of Delegation and her team. I believe there were I'm not sure I want a reconfirmation from the Delegation.You talked about is it 1325 that you said you would integrate into your national humanitarian interagency because that was the question. A national action plan on UNHCR 1325 on women, peace and security.Does the State Party intend to or hope to have in place a national action plan on women, peace and security? That was the 1st question that wasn't very clear, your response. The 2nd was Mr. Safarowas asking if you were going to have legislation to institutionalize the procedures that you have now. You have introduced some measures but they are not backed by legislation. So they may evaporate overtime. The question is, is the State Party willing to put in place legislation to back these measures that are being adopted now so that they become systematized into the operations of the country?Thank you very much for your question. I'll make a brief statement and then on legislation, therepresentative of Parliament will add some comments. I said 25, not 35. On the specific legislation whichwe need to strengthen, currently there is work underway. We are making efforts towards that. The government is not sitting there without doing anything. So we are indeed working. We are working on studyingthis law. And we 1st have to take into consideration how such a law, if implemented in our country, willimpact the population, how it will work, what the dynamic will be. And so I would also like to give the floor now to the representative of Parliament but I would just like to say that there were specificlaws which were implemented. There are now existing law on women's issue on women's equality and there are some changes, some amendments to the existing laws that were introduced but we are nowconsidering whether there should be a separate law on discrimination against women and the government is working with Parliament. There is work being carried out. Experts are looking into the matter. So everythingis proceeding as it should in a stepwise fashion. The Parliament, please. Thank you very much, Head of Delegation. So I presume that the responses on the legislation, you may consider sending it in writingbecause you already have started the process. Thank you very much. We will now move to Articles 5 and 6of Part 1 of the Convention and I would like to call on Ms. Bandana Rana to take the floor for 5 min ,please. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I join my colleagues in welcoming the high levelDelegation of Turkmenistan to this constructive dialogue. You know, in the last dialogue with Turkmenistan in 2018, I was the rapporteur and I'm happy to engage in assessing the progress you have made on the lastrecommendations. I would also like to thank the Delegation for their opening statement, Madam Head of Delegation and your commitment you expressed to gear towards attaining international standards on gender equality and the reform of policies and laws for the protection of human rights of women. Yourcommitment was appreciated. I also congratulate the government of Turkmenistan and now I'm coming back to the national action plan and you will have, like my colleagues, you will have the opportunity to talk about it more. I congratulate you for adopting the national action plan for gender equalitywith support from UNFPA. One of the pillars of the plan as mentioned in your statement is preventing gender based violence against women and girls. I know you have deliberated a lot on the laws and legislations but my specific questions will be on violence against women, domestic violence andstereotypes. As for the roadmap provided by the plan, what are the specific tangible actions takento prevent domestic violence and other forms of violence against women and girls including harmful stereotypes? Domestic violence continues to be a pressing issue within the country with every 8thwoman who is or was in a marriage or relationship having been subjected to such an experience.The current criminal law does not seem to be sufficient to address this problem. In 2020 UNFP provided expertise to develop a model law on combating domestic violence and restoring harmony in the family which complies with international standards and practices. However, this was notenacted by the Parliament. As mentioned in your opening statement, the 2022 sample survey titled health and status of a woman in the family in Turkmenistan for the 1st time collected data and analyzed the problems of domestic violence against women. A roadmap for the implementation of thesurvey recommendations has been developed which includes improving legislation, developing a law to prevent domestic violence and building a coordinated support system for victims in the roadmap. So what concrete actions have been taken to implement the roadmap set by the survey,particularly related to domestic violence law and support systems? Will the state party consider drafting a specific separate law criminalizing domestic violence within the country as peryour compliance to CEDAW? Are there any consultations taking place in this regard? The adoption of a new law on social services in December 2021 was a positive development. However, the law does notexplicitly specify services for women survivors of domestic violence. How does the state party plan to modify the law to provide support to victims of domestic violence and their security? Social pressurefear against public judgment, shame and the fear of dishonoring the family are major reasons why women typically remain silent about domestic and other violence and refrain from seeking help. How does the state party plan to address stigmatization of women who are victims of gender based violence,including sexual and domestic violence? Are there any mandatory capacity building programs for judges, prosecutors, police on gender sensitive investigation and interrogation procedures, especially in ruralareas? The state party has only one shelter for survivors and one hotline service for victims of violence. However, in this regard, do you plan to expand the access to support services and sheltersas well as psychosocial counseling? On stereotypes, alternative reports state that the media and social networks regularly promote harmful traditional values and gender roles. Patriarchal attitudes are strong withwomen often being viewed as inferior to men. Though you mentioned that no women are forced to any dress code or beauty standards, there are reports of women being forced to do so. Perhaps it is an attitude in thesociety that is persistent. So what awareness raising programs do you conduct to change such harmful attitudes and address such persistent stereotypes in the society? Are there any complaint mechanismsavailable for women to challenge such unlawful actions in a safe and confidential process? What measures are there to inform women about such available complaint mechanisms? I will stop here, Madam Chair. Thank you.Thank you very much. We will now give the floor for Article 6 to Ms. Genevieve Atticheva for 5 min , please.Thank you, Madam Chair. Distinguished representatives of the Government of Turkmenistan, I welcome you at this dialogue and congratulate you on your six periodic reports and advances achieved. Despite some positivetrends and higher expectations for better protection of women victims of the risk of trafficking and exploitation, the level of governmental prevention, protection and prosecution in the field is not sufficient as observed also by U.S. Department trafficking enforcement report from 2023 whereTurkmenistan is ranked in Tier 3. So I expect an open discussion with you and fair answers on fundamentalrights of women in relation to protection from trafficking and exploitation, such priority issues. Data show that over the last years human traffickers exploit domestic victims in Turkmenistan and also fromTurkmenistan abroad trying to reach the labor markets in Turkey and the Russian Federation mainly. Turkmen men and women are exploited in forced labor abroad in the textile, agricultural construction and domesticservice sectors. And also most importantly state policies in Turkmenistan continue apparently the practice of governmental imposed forced labor to citizens. As a positive trend, we can mention thegovernment operated general hotline to report all crimes including human trafficking and the continued in-kind support for local NGOs to operate the trafficking hotline. Besides that, no data was madeavailable. No consistent data on cases of trafficking were reported and data about concrete services provided to victims either. Although the antitrafficking law from 2016 does not seem to be implemented, a newnational action plan was in course for 2023-26 and expect to have information on that. In the meantime, under the current registration regime, the state party still can't stop women from moving abroad for employmentfor very vague reasons. If the state identifies risk of a woman for becoming a victim of trafficking in persons or slavery while outside the country. That's interesting as an argument because also in your report you saytrafficking is not a substantial issue for the moment in your country. The previous concluding observations of the Committee and other reports and documents including ILO sources, the ILO sources, namedtrafficking happening in the form of widespread and systematic state imposed forced labor in the annual cotton harvest which specifically impacts on women who make up the majority of public sector employees mobilized inthe harvest from the health, education, childcare sectors and the vast majority of lower wage employees in this and other sectors. It is a long-term practice for the state of Turkmenistan and is done in extremely unsafeconditions for the persons exploited. Women are at risk also of gender-based violence and sexual harassment during this forced labor. Specific groups of women have also been forcibly mobilized for the harvest and in 2021 includedmigrant service workers with registered addictions and women accused of prosecution or other sex work. My questions are: Please indicate what measures have been taken and a concrete timeline when the state party willeliminate the severe form of labor exploitation perpetrated by the state itself. What measures will be undertaken for bringing the persons responsible to justice to prosecute and punish them and to compensate, rehabilitatethe victims. Please give a concrete timeline for amending the provision of Article 8 of the labor code if it hasn't been done yet. I have not heard. That allows for the mobilization of civilians into public work which would include cotton harvesting. Arethese changes reflected in the next national action plan against trafficking? I see with pleasure that there are members of Parliament in the Delegation today. So I hope very much we will have very concrete answers. What are the measurestaken to enforce the Trafficking in Persons Act relating to the national referral mechanism provision of protection and rehabilitation services? Government funded and supported these services for victims of human trafficking. And can you give us data onshelters for the victims of trafficking for 2022 and 2023? How many victims of trafficking, specifically women and girls, were rehabilitated, integrated to the community for this period? And what concrete prevention and protection measures againsttrafficking of women and children and of women from most vulnerable groups like minorities, migrants with disabilities, economically deprived are included in the new national action plan 23/26. There is data about severe shrinking in the space of women's NGOs andabout threats as mentioned by my colleague, intimidation and victimization of women and NGOs who dare to speak against forced labor and exploitation and violence against women. Throughout the country, this also means that organizations cannot defend the rights of women andgirls and this is inadmissible and against and contrary to the CEDO Convention. My question is what measures have been taken by thegovernment to encourage women for reporting and for the organizing of women in order to stand for their rights and outside in and outside of work? And lastly, concerning women inprostitution, just a question, when will you repeal all provisions criminalizing and penalizing women in prostitution and what measures were undertaken by theCEDO Convention? Thank you very much. Sorry, but it was important. Thank you very much, Mr. Sheva. I will now ask the Delegation if you could in 10 min to respond to the two articles, Articles 5 and 6. Thank you.Thank you very much, Ms. Rana and Ms. Tishova, for your questions. My colleagues will provide additional information but as a Turkmen woman, I'm being told that I have a dress code, that I'm forced to dress in some way or another, but I can tell you that the Turkmen dress is one of the most beautiful form of clothing in theworld. So I don't understand how we can be told that we are forcibly made to dress our, to wear our national dress. That's just not possible. Our national, wearing our national dress is a pride and the Chair sitting next to me is also wearing her national clothing. So are others in the room here. So I don't understand why this is being said. Can you tell us, is it not beautiful?So we are wearing our Turkmen clothing with pride. As a diplomat, however, we can say that we are wearing a uniform. And I think it is also a beautiful, it's manually made. In Paris even, there was a Turkmen fashion show where there was a colossal applause to our demonstration of Turkmen clothes. So on that note, we are wearing our national dress. Thank you very much.There will be additional comments now. Ms. Vandana Rana, thank you very much for your questions. They are specifically placed in the context of the work which is currently being carried out in our country on the eradication of domestic violence and on its prevention. You asked what results we had achieved with respect to the roadmap. Well, the roadmap was developed as a result of an analytical overviewand investigation that was carried out on this issue. What we still need to do is develop standard emergency procedures for the police, the 1st responders and medical professionals. These standard emergency procedures have been tried and tested. There have been seminars carried out with the workers of these bodies. And theythere is also standard procedures that were developed and teaching material that was developed on them. But in order to actually implement them in action, of course, we need to adopt the relevant law, as you are all aware, or introduce an amendment into the regulatory and legislative framework. And this is to what extent what the Parliament is currently doing as well asour own institutions. We are all working together on this. Within the framework of the discussion of the adoption of laws, we are working with other states. We are working with the National Human Rights Center of Belarus, e.g. , with the experts of that institute. And we discuss these issues with them. In addition, we need to improve the interagency response mechanism to domestic violence. We do havea response mechanism within the Ministry of Health and a separate one within the Ministry of Internal Affairs and so on. But each one is working separately. And then they provide information to each other. But they do not respond together. So that's something to work on. With respect to social services, I agree that our legislation needs to expressly stipulate these social services. But againwe have the problem of an absence of a legislative framework which we need to develop. With respect to the center, to provide services to people who find themselves in such a difficult position, we don't as of now call them victims of violence because there is no relevant legislation specifying those terms in Turkmenistan. So this theNGO and the organization are active in that area. There are two hotlines, one in Ashabad and one in Turkmenabad. It should be said that these organizations operate on the basis of grants received from international organizations. And now we are looking at the question of opening additional hotlines in Tashigud and in Ashabad, another one.With respect to the media, they highlight the question relating to domestic violence, but the context is shifted highlighting some conservative aspects. Here again there is work being carried out in the country, e.g. , with the representative of the UN population fund. We carry out training sessions for journalists specifically on gender issues. We are nowconducting events in order to guide them to properly cover such events. In addition, there are some videos which are shown on central television and we show them during the seminars as well which we carry out in rural areas. And then there is programs to raise awareness. This is a permanent part of our work directed at the women of Turkmenistan. We worktogether with the national parliament of Turkmenistan, but it is very difficult to achieve results overnight. You know that the creation or the fostering of legal knowledge and civic knowledge is something that takes a lot of time and we are carrying out work in that area. So that's on that topic. I'll just add a few words. Thank you very much, Ms. Rana. You referred to the newlaw. It is indeed a very new law to us. Even the positions, the entries of the professional classifiers are, in fact, new to us. The structure of our ministry of employment and social services have defined the profession of social workers. However, the level of educationrequired is one that we selected specifically focusing on the needs of women in rural areas because one of the prerequisite knowledge of social workers is knowledge about violence. And they also have to be knowledgeable about violence situations and human trafficking. We, therefore, do have people who provide social services currently, but theyonly provide psychosocial services. But there is some progress that has been made in the educational year 2023/2024 in agreement with the Ministry of Education and the initiative of course came from us, but the Ministry of Education agreed to work with us on this. So as a specialization in training social workers in two higher education institutions in Turkmenistan, there is work that iswill be carried out specifically focusing on these aspects because professionals, as we say, this is a very sensitive issue. And when people come to our services, there were, in fact, several cases where women who experienced such events came to our services. So we are now training workers to be able to address their needs. This is practical work that is being carried out sinceJanuary 2022. Thanks to the impact of that legislation and our indicators have shown that we do need to improve that law. And we have already prepared amendments to it. And I think that very shortly we will be able to introduce it on behalf of the government. With respect to the labor in the cotton harvest, we are carrying out major work as you probably know. Weare very actively involved with the International Labor Organization and there have been quality investigations on the labor involved in planting the fields. So this was in field visits. So this was carried out, the state statistics office carried out a separate investigation on the use of the labor force in the cotton sector. Andcurrently this qualitative data, and quantitative data which were provided by the state statistics commission has been sent to the ILO and now we are expecting an ILO mission with whom we will discuss our future actions. If this roadmap which we prepared and signed with the ILO is successful for 2023, then we can continuein 2024 and that is what we are working towards and we will know the outcome in February. Thankyou. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I do not see any flags from the experts. Maybeif you can do 1 min . Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I thank the Delegation for their positive responses and particularly for your acknowledgment that there are the mechanismscan be improved and the need for a legislative framework. In regard to because I had no time earlier, in regard to stereotypes, I wanted to come to media. As you know, media plays a very important role in reinforcing harmful stereotypes. So I was wondering if you have a gender codeof conduct for the media or how is the media, particularly online media monitored for discouraging gender stereotypes. Madam Head of Delegation, I really commend the whole Delegation for your beautiful national attire. I myself am dressed in my own national attire as well. Every stateparty should take pride in their culture but no women's rights should be violated on that basis. That is the point that we were trying to reinforce here. You mentioned in your responses with the new young parliament in Turkmenistan, which you have mentioned in your responses, wedo look forward to a more progressive and positive outlook towards women and girls in the state party. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. One minute, please. Thank you. I wouldlike to thank the state for the responses concerning the 1st issue and I see it is pending and the Committee will be expecting news on that and moving forward with law and policies. Concerning the implementation of the anti-trafficking law, I didn't hear anything about the services, theshelters, the number of victims and how is data collected. So what concrete prevention measures in the new plan and also about women in prostitution I haven't heard. Thank you very much. Thank youvery much. I believe that you have some of the data. Could we do 5 min or would you rather send it in writing? Five minutes. Thank you. Thank you. The Interior Ministry and thenParliament, please. On trafficking in Turkmenistan, trafficking crimes are a focus of the governmentas we see from the national plan of action to combat trafficking to 2022. Although from2020 to 2024, January, we did not have any criminal cases brought on trafficking. There were investigationsinto such episodes with measures taken under the legislation in 2018 to 2022, 141 staff ofthe Interior Ministry participated in 42 efforts, 90 from the prosecutor's office in 52 cases and the representatives of youth organizations also involved in 19 seminars and training sessionsto combat trafficking held in Turkmenistan and abroad. Public associations helping victims represent a network that works with the IOM and works in all of the willets to identifyvictims of trafficking and provide assistance in Ashgabat on the basis of a public association, and in other places events took place. There is a hotline which also provides advice to peopleleaving our country on preventing risks. Many public associations hold information campaigns to prevent trafficking. We have a number of telephone hotlines. The objective is to preventand combat illegal migration and trafficking. Microphone, please, for the speaker. The legislationof Turkmenistan on combating trafficking is based on our constitution and the law on combatingtrafficking which has measures to prevent this crime and on identifying victims. The lawamending the activities to combat trafficking provides free legal assistance to victims andthe legislation on employment provides that victims shall be provided with state support. Law amendingthe criminal code of 2022 adds provisions criminalizing trafficking and exacerbating circumstances,particularly where women are involved, particularly when they are pregnant or where persons arehelpless and likewise where people are suffering psychiatric illness and where coercion is usedby officials or persons in an employment relationship where documents are destroyed or in other circumstances,these are seen as exacerbating factors. The youth policy in its new version provides that young persons in difficultsituations who are victims of trafficking also fall into that category. Thank you. Thank you very, verymuch, Madam Head of Delegation. I believe if you have additional data on trafficking otherwise, are you happy for us? Okay. Thank you very much. So we will now move on to Article 7 to 9 of Part 2 of the convention and I will at thelast point call on Ms. Marion Mikko. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Chair. And I would welcome the Delegation of State Party here in Geneva to have with us constructive dialogue. According to Article 16 of the law of Turkmenistan on state guarantees of sharing equal rights and equal opportunities for women and men, women are guaranteed the right to participate in governance.Our Committee is interested how this fundamental right works in reality, like our country rapporteur stated in the beginning of the constructive dialogue.As the political landscape is heavily controlled by the state, women's participation in public is seriously limited in Turkmenistan. While women have equal rights under the law, they have significant cultural barriers that restrict their participation in the decision making process.Gender stereotypes and social unwritten norms often restrict women's mobility limiting their ability to engage in political activities. As different sources highlight, then there is over regulation in family life, underlining the abuse of women who do not have or want children.Regulation of family life makes me truly sad because this is not in the light of equality. Even more, this is far from the principle my body, my right.Women's representation is slightly less than the IPU, average 26.9%. In the state party, this is 25.5%.The share of registered women candidates for the 2023 parliamentary elections was about 16%. In fact, this gives no chance whatsoever to increase the figure of women in their legislative body.Regrettably, there is no special committee in parliament dealing with the women rights and/or gender equality.Although every 4th MEP is woman, no woman has given the chance to become the committee chair in parliament. While the speaker of the new parliament is a woman,there is only one woman in the cabinet of ministers, Madame Mamedova, who is deputy chair responsible for culture and the media. Statistically speaking, the state party's cabinet of ministers consists of 94% of men.As far as the local decision making is concerned, there are less than 30% of women in elected positions. As reported by the state party, all women acting as deputy governors in the regional district or local levels are specifically in charge of social issues.Right. There is no single woman who heads either region, province or has nominated as the city mayor. I have a few questions. First, could you please share information when will Turkmenistan not only work out but implement a strategy to promote women's equal, in other words, parity participation in public life and to raise public awareness in this respect?Secondly, as a former journalist and politician myself, I encourage media outlets to promote positive images of women as active participants in public and political life. In other words, like colleagues. Are there foreseen any media campaigns in this respect? Thirdly, although every 4th member of parliament is a woman, altogether 32 women in the parliament, the justified question arises why there has not beenbeen given the chance to no single woman to chair the standing committee. Fourth, in the introductory statement, we heard from you, Madame, that there are 9% of female diplomats in the Foreign Service. What kind of leadership programs are planned in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to increase women representation in Foreign Service? And lastly, women, peace and security, in other words, UN resolution to theUN resolution 13/25. Could you please provide data how many female officers does the State party have in police and in defense force? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I will now call on Ms. Corrine Dez Maija to take Article 9 for 3 min . You have the floor. Thank you. Thank you, Madame Chair.I, too, welcome the Distinguished Delegation. And my questions are on Article 9, as you said. And concerning this Article, nationality, there are concerns about substantial legal gaps in the system, especially regarding the following issues. The Committee notes that the definitionof a stateless person under technical law on citizenship of 2013 is not in line with the 1954 Convention on statelessness. And this may result in stateless persons not being recognizedas such. Will the state party, is my question, amend the national definition of a stateless person in line with the definition contained in Article 1 of the 1954 Convention? If not,why? The main requirements for Turkmen citizenship are generally impossible for refugees to fulfill. In addition, refugees do usually not have access to information and assistance regarding theirpotential asylum claims, including access to legal documents. Does the state party have any plans, is the question, to apply amnesty on the legal status of refugees by granting them a waiver of the application requirements? How will the state party ensure that asylum seekersand refugees have access to legal advice and documentation and the potential instances of refoulement are prevented? Will the state party allow access for the ICRC and human rightsmechanisms to access detention centers and border regions to provide help to asylum seekers and refugees? How will the state party ensure and improve data collection on the number ofstateless asylums and refugee people living in Turkmenistan? Furthermore, a stark contrast continues to persist between the legal guarantees and the de facto situations. This is especiallyevident in the following issues. Several shadow reports illustrate the continuous stigmatization and discrimination against marrying women of non-Turkmen nationality, including instancesof forced divorce. It reflects a deep seated issue within the societal and legal framework. Which measures is the state party going to introduce to combat obstacles faced by women regardingissues of marriage and nationality? In addition, according to the law and civil status acts of 2020, all children have the right to birth registration. However, several reports note our childrenin Turkmenistan will not be granted citizenship in all cases. So which measures will the state party introduce to uphold their obligation under the civil status act to ensure the right ofbirth registration for all children, irrespective of their parents' legal status? Moreover, Human Rights Watch notes that in the report of 2022, that the government's continued refusal to renewexpiring passports continue to deprive many Turkmen citizens, including many women and girls living abroad. How will the state party address these issues and ensure their ability to obtain legalstatus in host countries and thus prevent the risk of a range of human rights violations? Thankyou, Madam Chair. Thank you very much. I would now invite the state party to give responsesto those two articles, 7 and 8 and 9 in 10 min if you can. Thank you. Thank you. Thankyou for those questions. On the Parliament, as I have said, it is 26% of women. There are125 posts and they have 32. And the head of the committee, the president of the committeeon youth and educational science, that's also a woman. In Parliament, we do not have a special committee on the rights of women or gender issues, but we have the committee on human rights andthat includes discussion of gender equality. On the subject of the speaker of Parliament,as I mentioned, we have for the 3rd time in a row we have a woman elected. That does show that women in Turkmenistan are part of public life and that indeed has always been the case.Women in Turkmenistan were never hidden away. From times immemorial, they have always workedtogether with men. We never had a situation where it was men separately, women separately. Women were always advisors alongside men working with them, not in front, not behind. And I knowwhere this type of information comes from, I understand, but we have to talk about the substance, about what really is the case. We will hear from the Delegations as well. As regards marriage,however, there are many interethnic marriages in Turkmenistan. If people love each other, they get married. If they don't love each other anymore, they can get divorced. And no, the governmentdoesn't get involved in that. This is not any longer like Turkmenistan up to 1990 where a young state, 32 years old, and there are many things still ahead of us and we are moving inthe right direction with that. I would like to give the floor to the Health Ministry on thehealth questions, is that right? And the Interior Ministry on the question of the Women's Parliamentof Turkmenistan. What I would like to say is that participation in public and social affairs in ourcountry, citizens have the right to elect, to be elected to the various levels of elected authority in keeping with their own abilities and their professional level. They have equal rights to stateservice to be elected or to elect to the national or local authorities. And limitations are not acceptedon these rights. Indeed, that is covered by the law. Women participate actively in public andsocial life. As regards the measures, women are 26% of elected representatives. Thank you. Yes,if we could also hear about passports. We have just been asked about that. Thank you. Thankyou very much. I would say about some words about free movement. Here I would like to mentionthat for today there are almost 32,000 girls or women citizens of Turkmenistan studying abroadand almost I think 90,000 citizens living abroad, I mean women, for various purposes, marriage,temporary staying, working purpose and another. Regarding Red Cross, we are ready to providethe Red Cross Committee with access to our border zones, but I want to mention and saythat we don't we have only five mandate refugees and we don't have specific centers for refugeesbecause we don't have some problems or some tendencies from neighboring countries. Regardingpassports, I would say that the problem with the extension of passport, their problem wasin COVID period. Now you know that all bodies are open and our citizens who are living in abroad of country,they can free come to Turkmenistan and change their passport because in according and pursuant of ourlegislations, we don't have technical equipment for issue passport abroad country. We don't have inour ambassadors and our consular sections the same technical equipments 1st . Secondly, accordingto our law, passports for our citizens, they are printed and issued only in our country from our statemigration service. Lastly, I will say that in COVID period, our Parliament take special law and it canprovide us, I mean Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided opportunity for extending for one, for two years thesepassports. Now we don't have any problems with backing our citizens to our countries. In COVID period, if Idon't mistake, approximately 20 and 25,000 passports were extended for our citizens, women and girls. Thankyou. Thank you, Interior Ministry. Also if you could speak about female police officers, how many do wehave? Women are well represented in law and order in Turkmenistan and as you probably know, our girls can enter themilitary and law and order academies without hindrance. Talking about the Interior Ministry, I can't give you a specific figure of women working in the system, but all of the guarantees and benefits are provided. There aren't anyobstacles to women being police officers, even in the operational services side by side with men. Thank you.Thank you. Coming back to the issue by Ms. Miko on women in the foreign ministry and in Parliament,we haven't been keeping statistics, to be honest, because women do whatever it is that they wish to do. If we provide protectionto women, but where women want to participate in projects, they can do that with the women's union. They can be activists.They can hold round tables, exchange ideas, discuss what project would be better. On human rights, we have a group which alsodiscusses issues connected with draft laws and the selection of those. That group works with Parliament. We have discussion ofissues where a woman might have difficulty going and getting advice elsewhere, but she can apply to the women's union. She can usethe hotline. There is nowhere where women are to be found hiding in the corner or on the fringes. That's not something that appliesto our country. So, please, when you want to ask questions, do ask them on the subject, on the substance and not because somebody saidsomething or you heard something. You are welcome to come to our country and see things for yourselves. If you could please add something,colleague, or it is time up, then let's move on. Thank you very much, Madam Head of Delegation. I can see that we would like maybe a few follow-upquestions and they might clarify the issues that we are raising with Ms. Mikko and maybe for 1 min , if you don't mind, Ms. Mikko. Thank you.Thank you very much. I do want to congratulate your Delegation as one of members of this Delegation is representative of Parliament. So that is very important for us to have parliamentarians always in our constructive dialogues. And secondly, that is more informal way that I liked your comment, Madam Chair of the Delegation, when you said that alwaysnext to wise man, there is advisor who is a woman. If we are meeting next time, when we are meeting next time, I would like to hear that every wise number one chair that woman has next to her advisor who is a man. So if I may, then that is little request for the future. Thank you. Thank you very much. I will now ask Ms. Mikko to speak.Thank you. I would now turn to the country rapporteur, Mr. Safron. I would like to have one point specified on Turkmenistan's ambassadors, women and men. Now on the site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that is theNow on the site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs we have 41 countries in which Turkmenistanis represented. Could you perhaps specify not how many women have diplomatic status,of course you do as a Deputy Minister, but how many women ministers or how many female ambassadors work in other countries now? Now I don't want to state this data myself, but I would like tohear how many of the 41 ambassadors abroad are now women. And I think you can provide that classification also with respect to the judges. If you don't have that information now, you can send it, e.g. , how many female judges are in the administrative courts, constitutionalcourts, regular courts and so on. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Safronov. I will now ask if the Delegation can respond in 5 min to the follow-up. Thank you. Thank you verymuch, Mr. Safronov. It's a pleasure to answer that question. But I'll let my members of Delegation speak. Thank you very much. As a former Deputy Minister, I would like to say that I would liketo draw special attention to the members of the Committee to the fact that the number of ambassadors is not an indicator of a poor representation of women in the Diplomatic Services. That'sthe 1st point. And secondly, it's not an indicator of any kind of restriction to against women or to keep them out of our Diplomatic Services. Currently we have one woman at the rank ofAmbassador and she works in one of the 41 Diplomatic Representations. Formally we had three womenwho worked as ambassadors. I would like to say that after the general election of our Presidentin 2007, our former President and with our now young President, since 2010 we have been paying great attention to increase the representation of women in the Diplomatic Services specifically.The Deputy Ministry of Foreign Affairs is one example. Our female Diplomats here are already in the category of advisers at that rank and I think in the future you will see the numberof women with the rank of ambassadors or consuls and consuls general increase. But right now ourstaffing policy in the ministry is focused exclusively on promoting women. Female Diplomats nowin the ages of 35 to 40 years I think will in the near future become ambassadors, the representativeof the Ministry of the Interior. It's difficult for me to answer that question right now butwe will find information from the capital and provide you with the details you requested. And we will also be providing some further written information to some of the questions you asked.Thank you very much, Madam Head of Delegation. We will now move to Article 10 of Part 3 of the Convention and I would like to call on Ms. Genoviva Tisheva to present on behalf of Ms.Tisheva the questions for Article 10. You have the floor, please. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would like to pass some questions on behalf of my colleague, very pertinent ones.First of all, she congratulates you and welcomes you here and also she wants to say that she appreciates the proportion of female middle school students, female students in vocationalschools and the enrollment rate of female students in secondary vocational education that they have increased and that also the State Party has ratified the UNESCO Convention Against Discrimination in Education. Now concerning the questions she has, 1st , the State Party cooperates withrelevant UN agencies to introduce curriculum with international standards for quality education and inclusion and study programmes based on gender equality and equity. Have students andtheir families adapted to the new curriculum? The State Party is in the process of transitioning to 12-year secondary education system. Is there any statistics on the dropout rate of female secondary school students during this transition period? Has the State Party taken measuresto ensure that girls in rural areas, poor families and with disabilities have access to compulsory education? Second question, what measures has the State Party taken to promote more women to pursue higher education and what is the proportion of women attending higher educationsince 2018? And what is the proportion of female teachers in higher education? What major courses do most of them teach? What policies are implemented to support married female teachers to remainin the workplace? The other group of pertinent questions, persistent gender stereotypes influenceeducational choices of some young women. Has the State Party taken measures to systematically eliminate gender stereotypes in textbooks, curricula and teaching methods? Is there any content on elimination of gender stereotypes in education including in teachers' training programmesof the State Party? Further, she asks if the State Party integrates reproductive health and other related issues into life skills curricula in schools, how effective is this approach andwhat role has it played in improving women's reproductive health? Will it help guide girls to learn relevant knowledge and reduce the adolescent birth rate? Based on the statistics provided by the State Party on the distribution of students of higher vocational institutions by genderand specialization, we note that the girls are increasingly seeking to learn skills in emerging and promising fields such as science, technology, engineering, physics and digital technology and have yielded positive achievements. What specific measures has the State Party takento encourage women to study STEM, science, technology, engineering, mathematics and do female graduates in these majors have the same employment conditions and opportunities as male graduates? And also as transition with employment after education, please provide materials on the implementationof the 2018-2020 program to improve employment opportunities for young specialist graduatesof educational institutions in 2018. In the five years since its implementation, what measures have been taken to promote the employment of female specialist graduates and what is the employment of female specialist graduates and what is the employment rate of male and femalegraduates respectively? Does this program help increase female employment rate? For example,will the increase in the employment rate of female graduates encourage and drive more women to enter higher education? Thank you. And I think it will help also for the consideration of alsofurther articles of the Convention. Thank you. Thank you very much. I will now give the floorto the State Party for 10 min to respond to Article 10. Thank you very much. We have therepresentative for the educational sector who will answer, but I would like to say that education in Turkmenistan is free of charge, accessible to all. So the Ministry of Education, please.Good morning, members, and thank you very much for your questions. I would like to answer the 1st question. We have already moved to the 12-year education system and there are no distinctionsmade. Girls are provided all the access and facilities for education. With respect to gender issues raised several times today at all levels of the educational system from preschool, the educationalsystem is based on gender equality. And that is true for the social aspects, for the home aspects and for the relations with the children. The process of teaching and the home sphereare complementary. In 2008, the general educational schools teach the basics of home educationand life and there are, e.g. , issues that relate to health, to gender issues, prevention habits and the preparation for family life and other issues. I would like to point out herethat there was the issue of stereotypes. Now, in such classes, of course, there are the issuesof stereotypes that are raised. We have lessons for girls and boys which bring them to factories,to workshops so as to get them involved to an increasing degree in work that is not traditional,e.g. , for girls. We bring them to scientific parks, to chemistry facilities, e.g. , so there are already these work education trips to familiarize girls and boys with these typesof professions. Along with international organizations in implementing the government plans and strategies,we have courses for increasing improving the training of teachers in order to ensure that they used improved methodologies for ensuring gender equalities. We are also developing teachingmaterials using gender analysis materials. We are actively cooperating with representativesof UNICEF in Turkmenistan. Every year we sign a work plan and within the context of this annual work plan, we hold seminars which are for teachers on gender issues and for other participants who workin the area of gender issues. We also have workshops for parents on these same issues. We have developed teaching programs for the training of teachers. We have three methodological books for teacherson that issue in Turkmen and Russian. These are for teachers, parents and we also have a volumefor school children. We are continuing to develop manuals in line with the state policy or national values and international experience in gender oriented teaching. We are planning to hold a jointtraining seminars to develop further teaching materials on improving the qualifications of teachers in that area and we intend to implement them to greater degrees in the teaching program. Continuingon your question on inclusive education, we pay special attention in Turkmenistan to the vulnerable segments of the population and children with disabilities to ensure that they receive aneducation with dignity. For the schools in Turkmenistan, we have various events and activitiesthat are planned in line with the wishes and interests of children who have either physical impairments or other disabilities in order to ensure that such topics are accessible to them. We have special measuresfor children with impaired mobility with and with sight and hearing impairments. They are integratedinto the general educational system where there is a differential educational approach that is applied to them. If children cannot attend the general schools, then there is teaching provided for themin specialized schools. There are 17 such facilities and in every village, there is a school of that nature and there is a special schooling facility with all necessary services in order to ensurethat education can be provided to children with disabilities and physical impairments with dignity.We have assistive technology equipment, specialized furniture and additional access devices in orderto ensure that children have access. There was a question on how many teachers and girls and boysin schools. We need figures, please. Thank you for the floor. I will just cite some figures because the main work carried out in education was already addressed by the representative of the Ministryof Education. In the general schools, the number of children is growing compared to the previous fouryears. Of course, we have a greater proportion of boys. It is 51% and girls represent 49%. The teachersin the general educational schools, 32% are men. This varies between 32 and 33% over the period analyzedand the proportion of women varies from 67% to 68%. With respect to the increase of graduates fromschools, at the end of this school year, we are expecting a higher number of school children whograduate by a factor of 9,000 individuals. The proportion of boys varies from 32% to 40% in a certaintype of school facilities. The trend is now to decrease. Of course, in proportion, the girlsrepresent approximately 60%. The number of teachers in special educational facilities here, we have a larger proportion of men. There is also a trend towards a reduction. It was 48% in previous years,but now it is decreasing to 43%. Women, of course, represent between 52% and 57% in higher educationalfacilities. Students, previously, the proportions between girls and boys was 60% boys and 40% girls.In this school year, 2023, boys represent 56% and girls 44%. With respect to professors in highereducation, here the teaching facility remains approximately the same. That is to say, there ismen from 52% to 53%. Accordingly, the proportion of women varies from 47% to 48% as teachers in highereducation. Thank you. I would like to give the floor on employment. Just 1 min , please, onemployment. Ministry of employment and social support works directly on the programmes which were referred to and we aim to improve the employment situation of young professionals. We adopted a programmeto adapt youth to the labour market because currently, given the development of technology, it is, of course, a very great challenge to ensure that young people are ready for the labour market. So thisprogramme aims to balance supply and demand. When we analyse the demand from sectors, which we keepstatistics on that on our labour market, we, of course, try to match the young trainees with the needs of the labour market. At the outset of the beginning vocational training and further vocational training,we have a great demand in sectors such as, e.g. , operators of cranes, electricians,builders in various areas of construction and in the trades. So if we look at the beginning ofvocational trainings which prepare young people for such professions, we can see that girls represent only 30%. And it is not due to the fact that we are limiting girls or limiting access. It is because ofthe list of employment opportunities are in sectors which attract boys more than girls. Our legislationand employment practices provide full free access, but this is the situation and this is why we are working in that direction because there are many benefits now that have been introduced for youngspecialists, young professionals. They have 52% benefits with respect to taxation. So it is only 50% of their income that is taxed over the 1st two years of their employment. So there are someincentives to find employment. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Head of Delegation. I thinkthat was we welcome the information and the data provided. I don't know if Ms. Tsiseva has any follow-up questions, but I would like to pose questions that I don't think we had responses to.One was on STEM education. Do you have a female graduate in these majors and what specific measures are the state party taking to encourage women to study STEM subjects? And then there was the issue ofincreased female employment rates post-graduation. Have you taken any measures to increase the rate of employment of female graduates? Those were two questions that were posed that we mightwant to give you a few minutes to answer. And Ms. Tsiseva, maybe for 1 min . Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You captured very well the questions I also have as additional ones. Andthen concerning statistics about dropout rate of girls in this transition period of the 12-year secondary education, I think it is an important one. Do you have data? And also related to that,what measures have been taken to ensure that girls especially in rural remote areas with most vulnerablepopulation and girls with disabilities have access to compulsory education during this period? Thank you very much. So Madam Chair, maybe for 3 min to try to respond to those questions. Thank you.Thank you very much. On rural schools, even in the most remote areas of our country, schools followthe general educational program. So there is no problem in moving from primary education to secondaryeducation. So there are no problems of that kind. We transitioned to a 12-year program. And I can say that this is a mandatory school cycle. So we don't have a rate of school leaving. Now, girls in sciences,of course, the access to education is a national priority. And our girls and young women have fullrights and opportunities to study digital technologies and sciences. So I would like to note that we havea center for young scientists where we have active members among girls and the youth organization of Turkmenistan has also a competition for young scientists where we have winners who are girls. Andyoung women. On professions, again, that are not traditional for women, we see a greater number ofwomen entering the faculties, e.g. , for oil and the oil and gas industry and then in various technologies. Unfortunately, I don't have the statistics, but we will provide them in writing. AndI would like to say that nobody inhibits the participation of women in such activities. We live in the modern world now. And obviously our youth is developing in the same way as the youth in othercountries. We have access to education, to information in various areas. Thank you.Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Madam Head of Delegation. And I think we would like to bringthe dialogue to a close for the morning session and to thank you very much for your openness and the responses that you have given to the Committee. We will be going on a two-hour lunch break, but I willnow want to call on the Secretariat if you have any announcements. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.From 1:45 to 2:45, there will be a briefing by the Center for Reproductive Rights in Asia-Pacific on surrogacy here in this meeting room. And for the members who wish to attend the reception by thepermanent mission of China on the occasion of the lunar new year, the Chinese lunar new year today,this reception will take place on the 2nd floor. There is a mezzanine and it has already started. And just bear in mind, please, that the other briefing will start at 1:45. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to order the 2038 meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee will continue with Agenda Item 4 and the floor is once again open tomembers of the Committee to pose questions to the representatives of Turkmenistan and for the representatives of the State Party to reply to those questions. I thank the highlevel Delegation for your responses and cooperation so far and I will now give the floor to the expert Ms. Hiroko Akizuki who will be taking us for 5 min on Article 11, employment.You have the floor Ms. Akizuki. Thank you Madam Chair. I also warmly welcome the Distinguished Delegation from Turkmenistan. I address Article 11 on employment as the Madam Chair said. Firstregarding underemployment and informal work of women. The Committee welcomes that the State Party has taken steps to address the issue of the female employment. However, the Committeeis concerned that the significant proportion of economically active women are still underemployed or unemployed because of their burden of unpaid care and domestic work rooted in cultural biases,patriarchal attitude and deep rooted stereotypes. So my questions are what measures have been taken to address the underlying cultural and societal factors that limit women's opportunities inthe workforce? Are there any awareness building programs for both men and women on equal sharing of care responsibilities and other unpaid domestic work? When will the State Party adopt paid paternityleave in the national legislation to ensure the equal sharing of domestic responsibilities between women and men? Are there any plans to adopt and implement targeted time bound measuresincluding temporary special measures to create more opportunities for women to enter the formal labor market? What measures are envisaged to provide the gender sensitive social protection system neededto relieve the burden of unpaid and domestic work on women? Are there any plans to increase adequate child, elderly and disability care services to reduce the burden of unpaid care and domestic work ofwomen? Second, regarding the gender segregation and employment restrictions for women in employment, the Committee learned from the State Party's report that the female workers ratio in the traditionallymale-dominated professions are very low. The Committee also notes that the burden of unpaid care and domestic work limits women's ability to access stable, high skilled and high paid jobs. The Committee furtherconcerns that the legislation still restricts women in workplace, prohibiting them from working in the same night hours as men and from entering certain types of employment. So how does the State Party addressgender inequalities at the workplace, especially gender gaps in income and employment opportunities of women and girls? What measures have been taken to encourage women to choose traditionally male-dominatedand higher paying work? Are there any incentives for public and private sector employers in traditionally male-dominated work to recruit women? Are there any plans to amend the Labor Code to remove any discriminatoryprovisions for women? Third, regarding limited gender disaggregated data and gender pay gap, the Committee concerns that the lack of policies that address gender inequalities at workplace and society at largeexacerbate existing gender gaps in income, education and employment opportunities for women and girls.The Committee also notes that as the country reporter referred, that limited gender disaggregated data measuring social and economic inequalities impede understanding a real picture about women and girls inthe society. So is their gender disaggregated data collected regularly? Does the State Party regularly review wages in sector in which women are concentrated? What measures have been taken to close the genderpay gap? Lastly but not least, regarding sexual harassment at work, the Committee notes that there is no allegation of sexual harassment in the workplace. However, no allegation does not necessarily meanthere is no sexual harassment in fact. But it might be no effective mechanisms to report the harassment cases or less awareness on harassment. So is there any effective mechanisms for filing complaint relatingto sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination in the workplace? If not, how does the State Party ensure that the victims have access to protection and remedies? Lastly, is there any plan to adoptlegislation to specifically define and criminalize sexual harassment in the workplace with adequate penalties for perpetrators? Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you very much, Ms. Akizuki. I will now give thefloor to the Delegation to give responses in 10 min , please. Thank you. Thank you for your questions.And I would like to give the floor to the colleagues on employment and then to the Interior Ministry onviolence and possibilities for bringing complaints. Thank you very much. That's quite a large set ofquestions. We'll try to cover all of that. Of course, we base every act on legislation. The law is appliedrigorously. Men and women can choose any form of employment freely. And if we look at figures,official figures, female employment in the state sector and in large and medium-sized enterprises iswidespread and the figures speak for themselves. Of all of those working in our economy, over 48% are women, which is nearly half. That really says it all. It was just over 45% more recently. In the privatesector, 44% of all employed, this is in large and medium-sized enterprises, are women. And it was 41%five years ago. So in terms of employment, as we mentioned this morning, the impact is from thelevel of education and the qualifications of the women. That allows them freely to enter the labor market. When we are looking at the balance of supply and demand, there is some impact. There is a demandfor professions which require initial vocational education. We don't talk about male and female professions. We have moved far away from that. We don't have male and female professions. As regardsthe limitations that existed from 2018, when we had the previous dialogue, we have done a lot to change the labor legislation, including removal of the restrictions on women working in dangerous professions.Women can now choose whether they want to work there or not. But they are warned that such an occupation may have particular features because there are working conditions which are not entirely favorablefor you women. And the same is true for night work and work during public holidays and overtime. All ofthat has been reviewed. Women who have small children aged up to 18 months or three years can do that work if they give their own written consent. It was prohibited previously for women with small childrenin those conditions. But now if they give written permission, they can. But they also have the right to refuse such working conditions. Of course, there is a lot of impact from the following. For a womanto combine her professional obligations with family obligations, that can be an issue. So women choosethe working conditions that suit them. But there aren't any limitations anymore. And preschoolworks in our country in such a way that women who are employed can easily find child care during their working hours. There are groups that start early in the morning and groups that stay laterin the evening to cover different shifts of mothers. So as regards the education system, it is strivingto ensure that child care is provided. And as regards pay, should I come to that later? But looking atwomen who are working within their own homes, they are not employed as it were. They are housewives.There is support to such families, full support, because regardless of whether a woman is employed outside the home or not, she is allowed to get the child birth benefit and the child care benefit.That does not depend on any form of employment insurance. Recently we brought in a very beneficialmeasure which supports families with many children. Our state does have a reasonable number of familieswith children, seven, eight or more children. And when we looked at the social benefits to such families,of course we looked at the number of children. We have changed the thresholds and now the size of the payment depends heavily on the number of children. One child gets one figure, the 2nd child gets moreand the highest figure, of course, if you have got five, six or seven children and then eight or more. That's even more. So there is support to these families regardless of whether the mother isemployed or not. If she loses the bread winner, then she will receive the benefit for loss of bread winner for all of those children. And that also depends on the number of members of the household, the numberof dependents who were supported by that bread winner. Whether it was the mother or the father,the family is going to get the loss of bread winner benefit in those circumstances. So there is statesupport provided to families where the mother is a housewife. And we have already spoken about the lawon social services which came into force on the 1st of January. And social workers assess those familiesthat need state social support. Now, if the family has a child with disabilities, that's a particularsituation. And if I may, perhaps we could move on to the payment, the wage statistics. Microphone forthat speaker, please. Microphone, please. I will go into the figures because the main issues have already been covered by my colleagues. So on the basis of what my colleagues said, there are different wages paidfor different values of work. But the average ratio between men and women is a difference of 12%. 23%in such occupations as mining and quarrying. So the difference between there are more men working inthis dangerous work. And that's highly paid work. Therefore, the average salary can be higher formen. The same is true in construction and in transport, freight transport, both in the state sector andprivate. But we see the reverse tendency in education, health and social services there. There are morewomen. That's about 70%. And the ratio in terms of salary between men and women is 6.8 percentage points.Thank you. If you could be brief, please, on the criminal code and the channels for addressing sexual harassment. This is the Interior Ministry. Thank you. In connection with the recommendations of the Committeein Article 3.135 of the criminal code, we cover we have extended that. It is to workplace sexual harassmentand that brings criminal liability for sexual harassment in the workplace. Thank you.Thank you on the quotas. Is there time? No? One minute. The quotas as a temporary measure for multi-childfamilies and single parents, we do have benefits for them, the quotas for them up to 5% of employmentposts regardless of whether it is men or women. And as regards men who are involved who participate in this, the legislation provides it doesn't, of course, provide maternity leave for men because women aremore concerned by this. But for childcare, the father does have the right to take childcare leave. If awoman is in a place of detention or if she has lost her parental rights, then the benefit for childcare is paid to the father. And if there is no father, then it is paid to whatever close relative or other personwho is taking care of the concerned child. Thank you. Thank you very much. I see the flag. Could you just 1 min , a follow-up question for 1 min ? Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you very muchfor your all detailed answers and figures. I really appreciate that. But the only thing which I didn'tlisten is the what are you doing, endeavor, what is your endeavor to change the stereotypes betweenmen and women? Because I understand that you are providing a lot of protection for women, but what endeavor are you going doing to change men's or women's unconscious bias with regard to stereotypes?So I want to know that. Thank you very much. So, Madam Head of Delegation, you have a response. Twominutes? One minute. Thank you. Thank you very much. Changing stereotypes depends on individuals as well.They need to want to change their mentality. But we will take into account this recommendation. We havework to do on that front. Thank you. Thank you very much, Head of Delegation. We will now move to Articles 12 and 13.And I would now like to call on my colleague and friend, Ms. Nala Haida, to take on Article 12, please. Thank you. You have 5 min .Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And me, too, would like to really welcome the High Level Delegation and directly refer to the introductory remarks of the Head of Delegation which were really very much appreciated. And in those remarks, two issues of relevance to Article 12 were good news, that the high prevalence of teenage pregnancy has slightly decreased in recent years as well as maternal mortality. However, the Committee is highly concerned by the legalamendments that the State Party abortion law of 2015 and 2017, the two amendments brought in, which brought down the time limit for abortion on request from 12 to five weeks of pregnancy, not taking into account the WHO guidelines. Please explain what triggered these legal amendments. The criminalization of abortion commonly results in high numbers of women seeking unsafe abortions and in preventable maternal mortality. Restrictiveabortion laws also create stigmatization and increase vulnerability to physical and mental suffering. In order to prevent unsafe abortion and reduce maternal mortality, it is vital to provide accessible, affordable and high quality health care services as well as age appropriate sexual education and access to contraception throughout the country. I would like to know a little bit more about the free health care services in the country because some reports speak about some of it that is free and some of it that is taxed, maybe not ina very transparent way. I would like also to know if the State Party intends to reverse the legal amendments from 2015 by extending the time limit for abortion on request to at least 12 weeks and extending the current ground for legal abortion which you have already for rape and incest to include severe malformation of the fetus and risk to the health of the mother and to fully decriminalize abortion in all cases. Could you please clarify whetherparental consent for abortion is necessary for an abortion of a woman below the age of 18? Does the State Party intend to remove this requirement and could you also provide information on the health care infrastructure available to women, especially in rural areas and to disabled women and how does the State Party ensure the sexual health care facilities are accessible? How does the State Party ensure quality of facilities, if there is adequate training on sexualand reproductive health and rights? How does the state party protect doctors performing abortions from harassment and ensure the safety of those seeking and providing abortions? A major concern of the committee is also the lack of data in general on health issues, onabortion, on HIV/AIDS, on women with disabilities and information on sexual and reproductive health. Is it made to the public? How do the state party communicate with the public on its strategies, policies, statistics? And is this published online? And which measures doesthe state party take to ensure that women have access to comprehensive age appropriate unbiased nonjudgmental and age appropriate sexual education? Does the government intend to report and disclose that on HIV/AIDS? I know you have three sites but there is very little information even notsent to you on AIDS. The committee would also like to know if any research has been conducted on the root causes of early pregnancy while noting that early pregnancies started slightly decreasedand how the data is being collected and analyzed all over the country. Please clarify also whether the requirement of parental consent to access contraceptive and reproductive and sexual health services for adolescent girls has been removed. We have taken note also of the good developmentof abolishing the virginity testing and maintaining it only for cases of rape, for criminal investigation and that it is documented then as legal procedure. But some alternative reports continue to saythat this is persistent. So which measures does the state party intend to take to concretely abolish this harmful and stigmatizing practice? Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank youso much. I will now give the floor to the state party for 10 min to respond. Thank you.Thank you very much for the questions. Health is one of the main priorities of our country. I would like to give the floor to the health ministry representative. Thank you for givingme the floor and thank you for the questions. I will try now to cover those. As regards abortion, under our legislation all women in Turkmenistan are allowed to have recourse to abortion. Whydid it come down to five weeks? That is the physiologically safest term set by WHO for abortion withoutharm, without complications to the mother. But if a woman mrs. the five week mark, then theapproach is individualized and she is allowed to have an abortion. It is done in health centersand in other services and in gynecological services of hospitals. Furthermore, abortion at 11 or12 weeks involves risk screening, three screenings. The 1st is at 12 weeks. If any malformationof the fetus is found, then abortion is also possible. Then at 19 to 21 weeks, there is a2nd screening and then there is a 3rd one at 27 to 29 weeks using a Doppler and if any internal malformation of the fetus is found, then again it is possible to have recourse to abortion. Andthere can also be social indicators. 22 weeks is the ceiling generally for abortion. Thereis a commission that examines and rules. So five weeks doesn't mean that no abortion is possible later. There is an individualized approach. So that would be my response to that question. And thenwe had another question on these so-called forced virginity examinations. They are not forced, theyare not mandatory. There have not been such tests in our country or rather pregnancy tests. Theseare done tests are done when women ask for them. There is no forced testing in our country. Onthe substance, if you could be concise, please, yes? On contraception, if a girl under 16 wantscontraception, then parental consent is required because up to that age, she is a child and both parents have the right to know about medical interventions on the child. In our health system,there are some paid services and some free ones. If a woman is pregnant and the term has been set and so forth, if she has reached 12 weeks and she has started to go to gynecological consultations, theneverything including laboratory testing and so forth and any prescribed medicines, all of that isprovided free of charge to a pregnant woman. And in general terms, maternity and women's health is an issue we pay a lot of attention to. In 2020, we started cervical cancer screening throughout the country and currently 99% of girls and boys of 9 years of age are covered by the human papillomavirus vaccination. We follow the WHO's recommendations on free vaccinations and 83 million U.S. dollars were earmarked for that purpose last year. On reproductive health, we have a extensive network of reproductive clinics and within the hospitals as well, wehave reproductive health centers. There are 95 of such centers throughout the country. Women can receive consultations and those who are at particular risk receive contraception free of charge. Those are women with serious chronic diseases, women with more than eight children and girls between the ages of 15 and 19. We also have vital medication that is availablethrough the centers throughout the country and beyond these contraceptives free of charge, women may with a doctor's prescription freely go to the pharmacies throughout the country and purchase contraceptives.I missed. Research has shown that women up to 49 are in fact satisfied by the servicesthey receive. This is to the extent of 70% of women questioned answered positively and that was a survey that was carried out. Maternal mortality is decreasing throughout the countryand that is thanks to the implementation of our national strategy on maternal health and reproductive health, infant health and the health of children and adolescents. That was the 1ststrategy that brought together all these areas of work. Up to then they had been scattered under various agencies. Now they are brought together and there has been an improvement. In addition to reduction in maternal mortality, we have also seen the establishment of a threetiered service systems and we have thereby regionalized reproductive health. So our specialized services have three tiers. The 1st level is for women who are physiologically healthy throughout theirpregnancy. The 2nd tier comprises women who have some deviations from the norm in terms of their health and the 3rd tier is women who have serious health impacts. So the staffinglevels and the resources that are earmarked for these three tiers vary accordingly in order to optimize the health of the women and the infants and children. Another factor that hasled to the improvement in maternal mortality is that we have 23 different clinical protocolsthat follow the WHO recommendations on obstetrics from 1998 to 2000. Excuse me, 2018 to 2020. OnHIV/AIDS, there are six centers for the prevention of AIDS where people can be tested voluntarilythere is mandatory AIDS screening for pregnant women and for blood donors and blood recipients as well asfor medical personnel that deal with biological fluids and persons who are ill with cancer, tuberculosis andother chronic diseases. So these categories of people go through mandatory HIV testing. Every yearwe have a broad campaign initiated for awareness raising on prevention. There are video films thatare projected. There are competitions for posters, e.g. , on this topic or on various topics. Butthe focus is primarily youth and youth awareness. There is also a hotline in six centers wherepeople can receive consultations on an anonymous basis. Thank you. Thank you very much for the responses. I believe a few questions were not directly answered and I'm sure I can already seethat Ms. Haida has her flag up. One minute would be sufficient for you. Thank you. Thanks for all the reply and the details. Indeed, we are aware of these social and medical reasons that would allow womento abort beyond the five weeks. However, there is no clarity on the conditions that would apply. It simply says that it is a decision of a medical advisory commission and that after 22 weeks it is a decision of a council of dr. . The fact that this term of social and medical reason is very vague. We don'thave information on the composition of the commission nor the council of doctors nor how the criteria, which criteria are used and we don't have any information of the remedies and means of redressavailable for women to appeal against such a decision when an abortion is denied. So if this information could be provided or if you are contemplating to look into that because we remain very much linked to the WHO guidelines as we read them and it is 12 weeks. Of course, you mentioned that five is safestbut it doesn't mean that five should be the limit. Twelve is normally what country and some other country went beyond the 12 weeks and we know that one of the hardest decisions on earth is for a woman to decide to abort. So the time of reflection is definitely an important one to keep in mind. So Ijust wanted to make these comments and thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very much. One minuteto respond to that. And possibly to take on there was a mix-up in the question, the translation said test for pregnancy but the question was actually about test for virginity. So if you could just answerthat at the same time. Thank you. Thank you for this recommendation. With respect to the five-weekterm of pregnancy, that is to say up to five weeks, there is no heartbeat from the fetus. And we take into consideration our national specificity. So those were aspects that were also taken into account. Buthearing your recommendation now, I think this is something that we will be working on. It is somethingthat will guide us. And we will look into that question. Thank you. Thank you very much. And nowwe will proceed to Articles 13 and 14. And at this point, I would like to call on Ms. Marion Bethel whowill be presenting Article 13 questions on behalf of Ms. Rodaredo. Thank you, Madam Chair. The 2015state guarantees of equal rights and equal opportunities for women and men act guarantees equal rights and opportunities for women and men in all spheres of state and public life. This was an important milestone. Yet from all reports, women's opportunities for economic empowerment are limited and women stillbear the major responsibility for unwaged household work and child care in the absence of men's shared involvement and the lack of adequate child, elderly and disability care services. My questions are: Whatstate mechanisms exist to ensure the full implementation of state guarantees of equal rights for women and men in social and economic life? Are there plans to implement measures to ensure the equal sharing of domestic responsibilities between women and men and promote the value and use of parental leave throughawareness raising campaigns for both men and women? Unwaged care work responsibilities for family members often affect women's ability to engage in economic activity. Please advise on the number of child careand elderly facilities existing in urban and rural communities. Reports of enforced selective and arbitrary restrictions on women's movement are concerning. This includes the implicit non-legal ban on women driving or riding in a private car or taxi driven by a male whom they are not relatedto. This limits women's access to employment, financial independence, sport and recreation. From 2019 to 2021, women drivers were consistently refused jobs as taxi or public transport drivers. This isdiscriminatory and affects their ability to fully and freely participate in public life and robs the society of the public productive labor of women. The questions are, are there plans to remove these discriminatory restrictions which negatively affect women's mobility, employment, economic empowermentand social and recreational life in addition to other forms of public surveillance and harassment?According to paragraph 132 of the replies to the list of issues, of the 1039 land plots allocatedto members of the union of industrialists and entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan for agricultural production in 2021, 472 went to men and 54 for women and 513 for private organizations. In 2022,4616 land plots were allocated, 3715 for men and 901 for women. Questions. What factors account forthis large disparity in allocation of land plots and what are the plans to ensure more equitable access to women? What mechanisms or institutions are in place to support women industrialists and entrepreneurs in the state party and how is success measured and evaluated? Is there data on women's access to bankcredit and bank cards in the state party? We understand that published systematic and comprehensive gender informed statistical data is publicly unavailable. This makes it difficult to analyze and monitor progress in gender equality including women's economic empowerment along with other SDGindicators. My final question is what are the factors preventing the publication of an access to gender related data and statistics? Especially related to women's economic empowerment including the genderwage gap and SDG implementation. Thank you, Chair. Thank you very much. I will now turn the response tothe Delegation for 10 min . Thank you. Thank you very much for your question. I will now give thefloor to members of the Delegation on the possibility of women to find work, employment. I have alreadyanswered and will not repeat myself in terms of employment. As to women and the distribution ofresponsibilities here on this topic according to data we have in our system on the child care, I have alsoalready said that this is for men and women to take up 96% of women care for small children, 4% of childcare of small children is serviced by men. And this data is based on the recipients of the child carebenefits. A man can take paternity leave if he fully cares for his children. So there is an opportunityfor men to participate in child care and thereby to receive some benefits and compensation. InTurkmenistan we have a sort of establishment which is a house for the elderly and there are elderly whocan be housed there on a permanent basis, both women and men without any discrimination. Again on other issues I will not repeat what I said earlier on contributions to the social system we have variousforms of services that are provided under the law and not just the law. Based on that law through the ministry of justice we had four other legislative acts which were adopted which regulate the implementationof this law. And there are various services that are provided for families whether men or women. Thesocial protection services in Turkmenistan have the opportunity to provide facilities and serviceseither on an inpatient basis or an out person basis if there is a need. For example, this may concernfamily members who are under the control of their close relatives if they need safety. In terms of oursocial system we are gradually changing the structure and we are establishing shelters for children and for parents. We are also providing for child care, e.g. , for parents who wish to work and whohave children who have not been able to be registered in regular preschool facilities.The ministry of internal affairs of Turkmenistan is the body responsible for overseeing the road rulesto ensure for road safety and to ensure that drivers follow the rules and carry their driver's licenseswith them. There are general rules that are applicable to all drivers whatever their sex. There were cases where women were driving without a driver's license and this led to closer observation of female drivers.There is the road police, therefore, that has stopped women drivers and asked them to show their driver's licenses but there are no differences in the conditions that prevail regarding men and womendrivers. Returning to statistics from 2018 to 2023 we issued over 9,000 driver's licenses and againthere was no discrimination against women. Regarding the development of female entrepreneurship and loansfor their activities, the ministry for small and medium-sized enterprise was able to increase the facilities by 11% in particular for women by 25%. This is up to 2022. The share of women amongstentrepreneurs has increased to 34.6%. The development of the economy and of business has led to credits issuedfor their activities and these are issued on equal conditions regardless of sex. There are advantageousconditions given to agricultural facilities in businesses and others. In 2022, there was an increase of entrepreneursand credits given by 31% up to 31% but the share of women did decrease. The volume of credits granted to individual entrepreneurs increased by a factor of 2.5 and the volume of loans to individual female entrepreneurs rose by afactor of 4 due to the expansion of female entrepreneurship. Now on access of women to agricultural enterprises andto land. Access of women to land and agricultural enterprises is facilitated as there has been a restructuring ofthe agricultural industry. With the active participation of women farmers, there are over 1600 farms that were registered who havelong-term agricultural land leases. The proportion of women by 2023 includes increased by 5% in terms of the farming method modes. Andthere has been an increase up to 13% of those involved in farming represented by women. Women and men in agriculture are on an equal footing regardingloans given to them for their agricultural activity. Now on the participation of women in sports. In Turkmenistan, there are equal conditions forwomen and men to participate in all forms of sports. It is women and girls themselves who decide what sports they wish to engage in and women andgirls have frequently been platformed on the international arena in sports. There have been 148 sports events that took place internationally. 115 participantsfrom Turkmenistan received medals including in sports that were previously regarded as exclusively for males. There have been an 11-fold increase in participation of women in competitions and a two-fold increase of women in international competitions. Thank you.Thank you very much to the Delegation. I do not see any flags. So I believe Mr. Elkin, you would like to take Article 14 for 5 min , please. Thank you very much, dear Chair. On the data 2020 from the pension fund of Turkmenistan shows a rise in the share of female adults with disabilities. During the COVID pandemic, a number of adults with disabilities lost their jobs at the sametime the employment rates among them were already representing. The percentage of working men is twice as high as of women, 20 and 10% respectively. We say about the disabled women and girls. It was noted that women with disabilities or mothers or children with disabilities experience emotional stress. Based on the survey results which happened in your country, around 6% of children with disabilities are always often under the state of emotionalstress, helplessness, loss or interest, apathy, feeling of loss and hurt griefs. I don't want to go to the original what's happening in Ashgabat, what's happening in Balkan, it's a different situation. What about refugee and asylum seeking women, educational health and social services? Is it accessible? And if it's accessible, how many women and girls, refugee and asylum seeking women and girls get accessibility to these unpaid services, especially state services? Anotherpoint about the rural women, this paradox steps from the exchanging environment and mindsets in rural environment. In rural areas, women account for most home farm works and unpaid households workers, where widespread home farming and leasing of agriculture land results in the use of women and children is unpaid labor. I do not go to the statistic data what we have in the points from agricultural employment, comparing men and women especially when we seethat women much more including such kind of unpaid work, but at the same time I have several questions. One more point about the discrimination against LBTI women especially, what's the relation of the state government party, state situation especially on the protection of LBTI women in these cases and accessibility to state service at the same time? What about the questions of the international marriage questions, interethnicity marriage questions in your community?We won't just clarify the real situation what's happening in your country. Women or, e.g. , Jewish descent, what's happening with the marriage with the Turkmen people in your country. Just clarification for how it's happening, how many marriage you have, do you have any discrimination? I do not want to give myself answers. I want the state Delegation will clear this information about the position especially, what's happening especially between the internally, the marriage situation between the ethnicities and nationals in the Turkmenistan andwhat's happening afterwards. Questions, women and girls with disabilities access to the state services, promote the social inclusion and inclusive education of women and girls, how it's happening. Do you have the statistical disabled girls which had accessibility to the education especially? Do you have statistical disabled girls which are victims of the violence, any kind of violence, not just domestic. I say about the sexual violence, e.g. , at the same time. One more point about theHow did the state party support rural women accessibility to the desert territories? Because we know that most of the territory of Turkmenistan is under the desert situation and it's difficult to work in the agricultural structures there because it's very difficult situation. You have many natural barriers at this point. How did the state fight against this situation and create for the women and girls in the special rural such kind of situations? And one more time, I want to thank all Delegation members for open and solidanswers during the dialogue. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Savrov. Now we'll give the Delegation 10 min to respond to those questions. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. On refugees, I have already made provided information in my initial statement and we provided figures as well. On disabilities, I will give the floor tothe Delegation member and I will also ask the representative of the Ministry of the Interior. Ten minutes, please, colleagues. Please divide it up. Everyone has 2 min . On LBTI, criminal legislation is based on equality before the law. Violence, blackmail orany other acts of this type are crimes. Anybody regardless of sexual orientation including LBTI persons are protected by the law. I would like to talk briefly and this is a topic that we have touched upon already, namely equal opportunities and rights for men and womenduring the pandemic. It was mentioned that we had to establish some measures to protect and prevent the spread of the disease in our country. We introduced certain limitations. The working timetable was changed. The working day was shortened.And that took place in all enterprises whether they employed men or women. As regards protection of people who were not able to get back to Turkmenistan because they were abroad, when the borders closed, I will reiterate that their employment rights were held open and they were ableto receive their salaries under the law. There was no discrimination against women. The same is true of persons with disabilities. They had the same situation regardless of whether they were living with disability or not. They had to comply with the same restrictions and that had an impact on people's incomes but it cannot be called discrimination. Socoming now to support the persons with disabilities, in 2021 there was some data of households both in cities and in rural areas looking at the situation of children and adults receiving social support for disability and the results of the study provided information which allows our state to havesome guidance on overcoming the barriers and the gaps that there were in providing quality inclusive social services. So on that basis, on the basis of that study, we adopted the law on social services which is now in force and is being extended. Thank you. Next, please. Thank you very much. I would like to mention about refugees once again, about refugeesand state peoples, especially about firstly about Afghan women refugees. Afghan women refugees access to the state social and legal services. Early in the statement of Ms. Pashimova provided data on the total amount issued residence permit, approximately 1,860. Andgranted citizenship 8,069 during the last four years. Here I would like to inform you that among the total amount in the 1,860 residence permits, 12 were issued for the Afghan women. In determined period, 11 Afghan women received the Turkmencitizenship. Notable that this category of people with the permanent residence living in Turkmenistan have the same rights, I mean as stateless persons and as the Turkmen citizens except the right to elect and be elected. They have full access to social services and benefits. We are now going to completely eradicate stateless in this year, in 20202024. Now we have approximately about 400 stateless people. And I think in this year, we plan, grant to him all of them citizenship of Turkmenistan. Thank you. If I may, Madam Head of Delegation, could we have responses that are really focused on rural women andLGBT and I think there is one other category of people that the experts requested. If we could have just responses on those areas, rural women, LGBT and then on Semitism, anti-Semitism. Thank you.Including women who are doing unpaid work. Currently, we don't have specific figures on people doing unpaid work. We have the number of people who are doing something within their household, who is working in the economy, who is working in subsistence farming, who is working in enterprise or self-employed.But in the unofficial sector. But as to unpaid work, that's looking after children or relatives, that is unpaid work and we don't have a specific figure for that. But once we do the study, we will have, that will be done, we plan jointly with UNFPA and we will havefigures for the number of people working in, working unpaid. As regards the other forms of activity as the head of the Delegation has said, the census showed what women were doing and at what level and I have already spoken about entrepreneurs and so forth. So I believe that we have answered those questions but I could add regarding interethnic marriages in oursociety like in any other healthy society, families form and they can also be dissolved. There are no controls on that. Per 1,000 persons, marriage figures have gone up from 5 to 4 in 2020 to 5.9 in 2021. And per 1,000 interethnic marriages, theseare not limited in any way by the legislation, interethnic marriages exist and the number within the total number of marriages for 2020 to 2023 varies from 4.1% to 4.4%. That's according to the Civil Registry. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Head of Delegation and we are gradually drawing close to the end of the day. And we will now proceedto Articles 15 and 16, and I will at this point invite our expert, Ms. Ranjitha Da Silva-Davis, to kindly take the floor for 5 min , please. Thank you. My greetings to Madam Chair andto all the all women Delegation of Turkmenistan. I note with pride that it is an all women Delegation. Equality under law is enshrined in Article 15 of the CEDAW and the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights Article 7 which guarantees all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. Despite Tajikistan's strong constitutional safeguards on equality under law, there is a certain ambiguity about the application of bothformal versus informal law. A principle of the rule of law is that all laws are transparent and no law will be exposed facto or retroactive. Thus limitations on freedom of movement and bodypolicing are all part of an unwritten code that remains inconsistent with Turkmenistan's own formal legal system and the rule of law. Your Excellencies, make no mistake, we admirethe national dress of all states' parties. Our questions are on the control of women's autonomy in the name of traditional family values. Your Excellencies, are men's clothing subjectto the same strict scrutiny? Equality under law calls for right to free speech, assembly and association and movement. It also mandates due process of law which prohibits arbitrary arrests, detention and disappearances and calls for fair trial. One example of these informalprocedures that curtail women's equality under law is the case of the woman journalist, who was shortlisted for the Martin Enel's human rights award and whose travel to Geneva was curtailed. There are burgeoning reports of the detention and surveillance of women human rightsdefenders. My question to you is in concrete terms, how does the state party outlaw and punish these informal practices, these unwritten codes that violate, these unwritten codes that violateequality under law? I go on to Article 16 on family and marriage. The family is often the locus of power relations and the barometer for gender equality in society. Once again, despite rights guaranteed in the formal legal system, penumbral codes or an unwritten regime governsthe family. One of the most pervasive stereotypes in the world is the stereotyping of women exclusively as mothers and housewives in a way that limits her opportunity to participate in public life. How do you address this motherhood stereotype through education media and laws in practice?I have studied the family law code which was amended in 2023. In Article 7, the religious practice of scrap as well as other religious practices have no legal value. But there are concerns about the lingering residual practices of the unwritten web of informal arrangements.I will now outline very briefly my questions. Although polygamy is outlawed, there is an informal practice of 2nd wives. Would you consider these arrangements in the shadow of the law a form of sexual assault of young women and statutory rape if the 2nd wife is underthe age of 18? How do you guarantee the property rights, maintenance and economic rights of 2nd wives in the event of abandonment? How do you address sexual violence against 2nd wives? Since this is outside of the regime of formal law, this is important. Women have full custodyof children on divorce. Is the informed consent of the mother considered in court disputes on mandatory custody to the mother? I am concerned that it might reinforce stereotypes of women's maternal roles asher primary responsibility and stereotype women as caregivers and men as breadwinners. Although marital rape is criminalized in the law, do married women have legal support in cases of sexualviolence in marriage? Despite the prohibitions against child marriage, the clawback clauses in the law allows permission for child marriage and diminishes the impact of your law. How do you addressthrough penalties elders and family members who force marriage of pregnant teens? Can the state prosecutor or any other legal officer of the state bring cases of child marriage to court? Do courts applypenalties to those who violate anti-child marriage laws and the bodies of CEGS, the state bodies of the civil registration of marriage? Your Excellencies, there is a revival of family values. Indeed, family valuesare a positive phenomenon if they include gender equal childcare policies and egalitarian family values. How can you shape a culture through the educational system, the media, and the practice of laws on family valuesthat recognize equality and security of all members in the family? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights defines the family as the basic unit of a society. It is indeed the fact that the family is the microcosm of gender equality in society. Thank you.Thank you very much, Rangita. I will now turn the floor to the Delegation for 10 min or 15 if you want. Fifteen minutes. Thank you.Thank you very much for that cluster of questions from A to Z. Thank you very much. We are all human beings here and we are alltalking about rights, but where are the responsibilities then? A human being doesn't only get rights but also responsibilities to fulfill. That's a rule. There are laws. If I'm a citizen of a country and I can break your law, you are not going to like it. It is the same for us. We are all talking about rights. I'm sorry, but there are also responsibilities. There are laws.As regards Ms. Achilova, what I want to say is this. Distinguished women, we have different concepts. Instead of asking about our rights, we need to remember people's responsibilities including women's responsibilities. First wife, 2nd wife, 10th wife. Fine. But there are legal responsibilities, responsibilities to the state and responsibilities to the family. We can talk about dressing up and dressing up the house. We can talk about dressing up the city. We can talk about dressing up theand make up all we like, but these are all stereotypes. A person can wear what they want. If a person likes make up, they can wear it. They don't have to. That's all fine. If we'retalking about rights, we can give a woman all the rights in the world, but what about responsibilities? We have to see things in context and think about priorities. Thankyou very much. And with that, I'll give the floor to Delegation. Thank you very much. Wedo respect you, so please respect us as well. Thank you very much. As a long member of Delegation,I'm proud that I can participate in this very beautiful publica. Case with Ms. Achilova, accordingto information from the state migration service of Turkmenistan, due to important content of passport, it became unreadable. Unfortunately, this was found out only at the passport control in the airportwhen she already was leaving the country. Of course, she wasn't allowed to fly out from Turkmenistanwith this passport. You should understand that even if she flew out from Turkmenistan with the passport upon arrival at her destination, she would not have been allowed in the country which unreadable passport.I would like also to mention that Ms. Achilova, like any other citizen, can apply for a new passportand go to anywhere she wishes. I would like to note that the owner of the passport is responsible forprotection and safe keep own passport against damage. Lastly, about polygamy, I don't think that we havesome big problem and big issue. Relations between married and men and women are possible in everycountries, but we don't have some big problem with polygamy, that men have two or three wives. Thankyou. I would like to respond regarding prostitution and polygamy. The interior agencies carry analysis ofcrimes connected with exploitation under prostitution every year and on the basis of that work, we are seeing a reduction in that type of offense in prostitution. It is criminalized in our country. In2019, we had 89 such offenses. In 2023, it was 47. On polygamy, polygamy comes under Article 161 of thecriminal code. It is unlawful. It is a crime against the family and morals. In our society, it is seen asan attack on the spiritual values of our people. The man is considered to be the perpetrator. It is criminalized in order to protect women's wish and right to have a traditional family where her honor anddignity are upheld. Thank you. On stereotypes, we have spoken about equality of rights in Turkmenistan. Themembers of the household determine who ought to be the head of the family regardless of whether it is aman or a woman. According to the census data from 2022, over a quarter of households are female headed.We do not have a situation where only the man can be seen as the head of the household.There are women heading households. Thank you. Distinguished participants, I would also like to replyto one question. This is on men and violence. This morning, we spoke about our roadmap under whichwe are carrying out measures to eliminate stereotypes, overcome them. That is a very robust issue in everycountry. We are addressing this. Work continues this year among boys and young men, including in sportsclubs, in schools, in universities, in military establishments on their obligations and the nationallegislation. Working with the Ministry of Justice, our institute is working also with UNFPA to work with youngpeople, young couples who have applied to marry and who have already been married for a year or two.Like in any family, there can be various conflicts and it is not always that simpleto maintain the traditional family values these days and combine those with modern times. It is not simplefor young couples. We are addressing that together with NGOs in our country who are holding seminarsnationally to give information to young people and by the end of the year, we plan to have proposalswhich will be discussed by our specialists, perhaps in order to make some changes to the family code.On the subject of the family code, men and women are declared to be equal when they marry. It didn'talso say that they are equal when they divorce but that amendment has now been made. And under our national plan of action on gender equality which I mentioned this morning, we are developing variousvideo clips on family relationships and the inadmissibility of violence. We are also holding competitions as I mentioned. We are trying to involve not just women but also men. That is perfectly normal.I think that's all I want to say at this time. Thank you. Thank you. I would like also to add someinformation. The Women's Union in recent years has carried out many events on gender in 2022. Therewere 348 events. 197 were informative. 23 were festivals and 62 were round tables. 11 were competitions.In 2023, we had 590 events. 171 were providing information. 36 were festivals. 109 were roundtables. And 38 were competitions. In 2022, the Central Council of the Women's Union provided assistanceon employment to over 24 cases. On housing issues, there were 34 applications. 11 were family issueswhere assistance was provided. And there were 85 legal consultations provided for 2023. The figures areas follows. There was assistance provided on employment to over 20 cases on housing, over 19 cases, 9 familycases, and 60 legal consultations. Furthermore, the Women's Union has a center for business women.In the last two years, it has provided assistance on employment to over 2,000 women. And of those,six had disabilities. Thank you. Thank you. Coming back to COVID, we did a lot of work. We had anoperational plan including not only social protection or assistance but also raising our financial andhuman resources to provide support for credit and provision of some additional funds to supportbusinesses whose working day had been shortened. So nobody was left behind. Everybody got assistance.Within the plan, our statistics commission carried out a study at the end of 2020 supported by UNICEF andthe ILO on the impact of the pandemic on the social and economic position of households in Turkmenistan. Andand it found that employment was the main support for over 90% of households although they did nottalk about loss of income from employment during the measures to combat the pandemic. But 1.3% of respondents who were women said that their working time had been shortened. The measures did not leadto the loss of jobs and adaptations were made to ensure that employment was maintained during the pandemic. As regards information on violence now, as you heard from my colleague, we carried out a studyon domestic violence. We are now in the 7th round of the multi indicator cluster study whichincludes a module on violence against women and that will provide us with more information as has been mentioned. I reiterate that that information will be made available. All of the information is placed onthe UNICEF site. It is available. Thank you. As a result of our survey on the health and status of women in the family, we also have that available in English and Russian on our site. So you can readit directly there. Thank you very much for the extensive response from the Delegation. I believethat the head of Delegation, you will still have the opportunity to have a closing remark but I would now like to turn the floor to the expert for follow-up question for 1 min . Thank you. Madamhead of Delegation, I am very aware that polygamy is outlawed in the state party and that I congratulate you on. I was speaking about informal practice of 2nd wives and I was indeed speaking about therights and duties and the responsibilities of spouses or in this informal arrangement for the maintenance of their security as well as their economic security. And then finally, finally, my questions on childmarriage remain unanswered. My question was given the fact that all marriages are registered under the Zags, would there be criminal penalties against the Zags, the state body of the civil registration ofmarriages or elders who conduct child marriages for the violation of your very strict law on the books? Thank you. Thank you very much. Would you like to respond, head of Delegation, for 5 min ?Thank you very much. This question will be addressed by another member of our Delegation and then one of therepresentatives of Parliament will also add to that. On early marriage, that's the wording that we use inthe law. We can say that in our family code, the age of marriage is 18. 17 is only with the specialpermission from the authorities and with respect to early marriage, we have information from the state statistics office and I think our colleague can provide additional information regarding the practice. Onpolygamy, we have a de jure and de facto situation and we already said that in our legislation, this is prohibited. Now, as to running any investigations on this, we are not intending to conduct inquiry. Whatwe are doing is raising awareness to foster civic consciousness on this and as our head of Delegation rightly said, in addition to rights, there are also responsibilities. So this work is being conductedamongst students, young people in Turkmenistan and again, we also work together with the NGOs in our country. They are more mobile throughout the country and are able to reach all corners of the country inorder to conduct such awareness raising campaigns there. Thank you. The purpose of the family code inTurkmenistan is to provide for the equality of spouses in family relations. For example, when we speak of equality in family relations, women and men have equal rights when concluding the marriage during themarriage and this is reflected in the family code of Turkmenistan. The equality of spouses is thus veryfirmly entrenched in the legislation. As to marriage between Turkmen, marriage between Turkmen citizensand foreigners and marriages abroad, this is regulated by the law and these marriages are recognisedunless there is no evidence that such a marriage has indeed been entered into.I would like to answer your question. I'm sorry, I don't remember your family name. You were talking about marriage when there is a permission from the council of elders. There is a practice ofthis nature in many countries of the world as I understand but in Turkmenistan our government is a secular government and the traditions are not part of our legislation. There are cultural componentsin terms of the development of democracy in our countries but we have a norm which means that beforea marriage is registered there has to be a document that is shown to show that there is no niqab as wecall it that has been entered. So there are guarantees in that sense. I would like to add towhat our colleagues said by providing specific figures. Of course we already said that according to the family code any citizen who has reached the age of 18 may enter into a marriage but againaccording to the same family code a 17-year-old young person with the permission of the relevant authorities may also have the right to enter into marriage. According to the civil registry office,the Zaks which registers marriages, the proportion of such young people below 18 who have concluded amarriage varies from 0.2% to 0.4%. That is to say actually it is 0.02% to 0.04%. And most ofthese are girls. There are also boys who are 17 and who have entered into marriage officially but againvery low numbers. I would like to add you were talking about child marriage. Now this is an offensein our legislation, any sexual acts between people of younger than 18 is covered by that. The authoritiesconduct prevention and conduct activities in order to investigate whether there might have been such cases and perpetrators are brought to account if there are such perpetrators. Thank you very much,Madam Head of Delegation and the entire team. We have had a very long, exhaustive, inclusive discussion.We thank you for the details that you took in responding to some of the tricky questions about practices and stereotypes. Such stereotypes occur all around the world and in fact our next generalrecommendation GR 41 we have just started is going to be focusing on that because it is a prevalent and pervasive problem around the world. So it is not peculiar to talk but we do appreciate the responsesthat you have given and the effort that you are making to be able to address them and contextualize them within your law, the legal and policy frameworks that you have. So this brings, this concludes theconsideration of the 6th periodic report of Turkmenistan. I would like to thank all of the experts for their questions and comments and the representatives of the State Party, particularlythe Head of Delegation and her team for the responses and the explanations that you have provided and the consent to certain suggestions that we have made which gives us indication that working with you going forward there are key areas that we could work together and we thank you very much for that. I believethat the Head of Delegation would like to have some closing remarks and so I would give you the floor for like 5 min to have your closing remarks. Thank you. You have the floor, Madam Head of Delegation.I would like to 1st and foremost, of course, thank you Distinguished Members of the Committee, Distinguished Chair. I would like to thank you. Of course, in an ideal world there would be no questionsand no problems and there would be nothing to work on. But we will be continuing our work on our newlegislation taking into consideration international law and the recommendations that were made. So we dohave our homework and we will continue to work, of course. We have, as I said, a young Parliament andthe Parliament, too, is represented today and it will also come forward with new draft laws and new initiatives which will, again, bring Turkmenistan another step forward. So thank you very much,Members of the Committee, for your support, for your statements, for your warm words as well. We willcontinue to work and we will continue to participate in all debates on gender policy and thank you verymuch. May I add another few words? As the Chair said, any answers that have remained unanswered, we will beproviding replies to by Monday before 4:00 p.m. in writing and the Embassy will convey them to you.Thank you. Thank you very much. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the Delegation for the constructive dialogue with the Committee which has provided us further insight into the situationof women in your country and opportunities for closer engagement with you. The Committee invites the State Party to accept as soon as possible the amendment to Article 20, Paragraph 1 of the Conventionconcerning the meeting time of the Committee. In that regard, the Secretariat will send a model instrument of acceptance with further explanations to your permanent mission shortly. The Committee commends the State Party for its efforts and would encourage you to take all necessary measures to address thevarious recommendations of the Committee which will be formally communicated to you through the permanent mission for purposes of a more comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Conventionthroughout the territory of the State Party and for the benefit of all women and girls in your country.The Committee also reminds the State Party that it selects a number of recommendations for immediate follow-up. These are mentioned at the end of the concluding observation. It invites the State Party to pay particular attention to these selected recommendations and to submit information ontheir implementation within the deadline defined in that same paragraph. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. And we look forward to receiving your next periodic report. The Committee will now convenein closed meeting. The meeting is adjourned."}
{"title": "", "text": "Your Excellencies, Distinguished Colleagues and friends, I am very pleased to declare open this meeting of the Human Rights Council for the intersessional panel discussion on theWorld Drug Programme. You may remember that in its resolution 52/24, the Council decided to hold this intersessional panel discussion on human rights challenges in addressing andcountering all aspects of the World Drug Programme. Informed by the findings contained in the report prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which was presented to theCouncil at its 54th session with the symbol A/HRC/54/53. The meeting is accessible to personswith disabilities through the provision of international sign interpretation and real-time captioning together with the other accessibility measures. Let me for this purpose warmly welcome Mr. HighCommissioner, Mr. Volker Turk who will deliver the opening statement. His Excellency, Mr. Filbert Johnson, Chair of the 67th session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs will deliverremarks by video message. I'm sorry. Let me also welcome our distinguished panelists, Mrs. Christine Stigling, Deputy Executive Director and Assistant Secretary General of the Joint UnitedNations Program on HIV/AIDS who is in person with us. Mr. Jean-Luc Lemahieux, Director of the Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, equallyin person with us. Ms. Anne Fordham, Executive Director of the International Drug Policy Consortium, also hopefully present with us. Mrs. Adiba Kamara-Zaman, Commissioner of the Global Commission on DrugPolicy, equally here with us. I would like to encourage all speakers to intervene in an interactiveway by making comments and asking questions that directly relate to the panelists' intervention and the discussion. The list of speakers will close in 15 minutes. The speaking time limitis 1 minute and 30 seconds for all. A maximum of 40 speakers will be accommodated. Those who will not be able to take the floor due to time constraints will have to upload their statementsto the online system to be posted on the HRC extranet. After this introduction, I have now the great honor to give you the floor, Mr. High Commissioner. Please. Mr. President, Delegates,panelists, I'm glad to open this discussion which is indeed urgently needed. Human rights ought to be central to all policies that tackle the world's drug problem. Currently, this is far from the case. Iencourage the council to continue ramping up its engagement on these topics and to infuse a human rights dimension in all fora where these issues are being shaped. We have the representative ofUNODC and UN aids here and indeed very relevant discussions are taking place in fora that your organizations service. Your discussion today is particularly vital in light of the upcoming midtermreview of the 2019 ministerial declaration on the world drug problem. It's a key opportunity to recommend changes to drug policies over the next five years, strengthening their advancements of humanrights and in doing so, making those policies more effective. Our report that was mentioned identifiesseveral policy areas of serious concern. They include so-called war on drug policies, including the militarization of drug control which often subjects people to a range of serious violations ofhuman rights, compulsory drug treatment, over incarceration and related prison overcrowding and we have seen in many parts of the world what this can lead to. Use of the death penalty for drug-relatedoffenses is of grave concern. Other issues include lack of and unequal access to treatment and harm reduction. Policies regarding drugs need above all to advance human rights including the right to healthand unfortunately, we have seen more and more policies in recent years that are better groundedin public health and rights-based approaches. The report of my office points to global efforts to move away from the death penalty for drug offenses as well as a number of national initiatives to shiftaway from punitive approaches by decriminalizing drug use and possession, setting up alternatives to incarceration and broadening harm reduction steps that are in line with our recommendations. For example,in the United Kingdom, Scotland published two months ago a draft outline of its charter of rights for people affected by substance use which it plans to finalize by the end of this year. The draft isfirmly grounded in the international guidelines on human rights and drug policy and nourished by community consultations. Colombia continues to implement significant human rights-based changes to its drugpolicies to focus on prosecuting those who benefit most from criminal activity and dismantling criminal networks while protecting vulnerable people from harm. Pakistan ended capital punishment for drug-relatedoffenses in July last year. Malaysia has removed its mandatory death penalty for drug offenses and the resentencing of hundreds of individuals on death row is underway. In India and Mexico, recent legal reformshave emphasized alternatives to incarceration in some cases. Ghana has recently adopted legislativechanges in the direction of a public health-friendly drug policy which needs to be followed up by meaningful initiatives for alternatives to incarceration and access to treatment, healthcare and social services for people who use drugs. The report also highlights increased focus on human rights in drug policydiscussions in international fora and greater participation of civil society in national and global decision making processes that are related to drugs. Building on these positive developments and similar progress in several other countries, we must strive to move the world away from an ineffectiveand harmful emphasis on prohibition and punishment. Drug policies must include evidence-based and gender sensitive approaches to harm reduction and be part of broader efforts to end racial and gender discriminationin policing and criminal justice systems. Harm reduction services can have very positive impact for drug users and communities. In this and every other respect, drug policies need to uphold the rights ofpeople who use drugs and this also means that people who inject drugs and who may develop infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS must have access to medical care in an atmosphere of respect. Alltreatment for drug dependence must be voluntary and provided by qualified health professionals. The decriminalization of drug usage can be a powerful step forward. To turn an economy away from thecultivation of illicit crops, it is important that communities including farmers, women and indigenous peoples are meaningfully consulted on options for alternative livelihoods. We also need measuresthat can take control of illegal markets such as responsible regulation that can eliminate profits from illegal trafficking, criminality and violence. And overall, people who use drugs, affected communitiesand young people as well as civil society organizations participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of all policies on drugs. I urge all actors to engage with my office, the council's special proceduresand our UN colleagues for expert advice on human rights based approaches to these and other issues in line with UN common position on drugs. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. High Commissioner. Thank you for havinghighlighted the human right dimension in relation with the promotion of drug policies throughout the world. We also thank you for the very important input of your office in this global issue. Thank you, sir.As announced before, Excellencies, dear colleagues and friends, we now will before I'm hearing our dear panelists, I will now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Philbert Johnson who will deliver as announcedbefore a statement via video message. Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating you, Ambassador Umar Seneiba on your election as the new president of the Human RightsCouncil. I have no doubts that under your guidance the council will continue to make significant stridesin the promotion and protection of human rights around the world. While I would have liked to join you in person, I appreciate the opportunity to share some inputs to this important discussionthrough this message. The commission on narcotic drugs as you are aware serves as the central policy making body within the United Nations system for addressing all aspects of the world drug problem. This includesa strong commitment to upholding, namely to respecting, promoting and protecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms in our efforts. We must help ensure that all people can live in health, dignityand peace with security and prosperity. I am both honored and humbled to lead the commission at this crucial point when we prepare for the midterm review of the 2019 ministerial declaration. From 2014 to 22ndMarch, the international community would gather in Vienna to take stock of the progress we have made over the past five years. On 14th and 15th February, we will have a high level segment with a general debate,interactive multistakeholder round table discussions as well as a range of high level events. I also launched a pledge for action initiative to mobilize Member States to pledge concrete impactful actions alongthe challenges outlined in the 2019 ministerial declaration. This initiative is gaining momentum and it provides an excellent platform to spotlight specific areas in relation to the world drug problem. I hopethat all Member States present in today's discussion would consider making their pledges in March in Vienna. We have also embarked on the negotiations of an outcome document to be adopted at the opening withthe high level segment that would focus on taking stock and accelerating action to address the challenges identified in the 2019 ministerial declaration. As you may know, one of the challenges in the 2019ministerial declaration specifically addresses the compliance of drug policies with our international human rights obligations and the international drug control conventions. It is a challenge that wetake very seriously and I believe this meeting of the Human Rights Council can contribute to our deliberations including in the period ahead as we move to 2029 and a final review of the implementationof all our policy commitments. As the President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we need to work together constructively to find solutions. As the platform for addressing all aspects of the worlddrug problem, the commission provides a forum for the many stakeholders engaged. We very much value the interventions and contributions we have received from Geneva throughout the preparatory process leadingup to the review, in particular in the context of the thematic discussions during which participants have come together to share expertise and experiences, lessons learned and good practices. The world drugproblem is a complex challenge that requires a multidimensional approach and your insights are important as we work to ensure that Member States adopt well informed policy decisions. I look forwardto a continued collaboration in the months and years to come. Thank you for your attention and I wish you a very productive and successful session. Thank you very much, Your Excellency, Mr. Johnson, for yourimportant contribution to this panel discussion and also for your kind words towards the presidency of the Council. I now have the honor to give the floor to our panelists, to begin by Mrs. ChristineStigling. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to join here today. Excellencies, Member States, civil society partners, UN colleagues, good morning. Let me 1sttake the opportunity to congratulate the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for this excellent and timely report that the Commissioner has given us highlights of in his opening remarks. As UNAIDS and asthe joint program on HIV and AIDS we engage in these discussions through a public health perspective.For over four decades the world has been responding to the global AIDS pandemic. The response has in many ways been impressive. Significant investments and combined government and community efforts leadingto an almost 40% decrease in new infections and a 52% decline in AIDS related deaths since 2010. Yet these gains hide significant inequalities. Not everyone has benefited from these successes. Andthe ones who have benefited least are people who use drugs. They are left behind in the HIV response. In 2022, the year we have the latest data for, the relative risk of acquiring HIV was 14 times higherfor people who inject drugs than for the rest of the adult population. 14 times higher. If we look nationally HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs ranges from 0 to 50%. Antiretroviral coverage from 25 toover 90%. So you see the enormity of the inequalities that are demonstrated here. Both that HIV can be prevented and that treatment can be provided for people who inject drugs. And that we are failingin many cases to do that. These inequalities are driven by structural barriers, by stigma, by discrimination, by lack of financing and investment in HIV programs for key populations including harm reduction andstructural responses. Ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 means ending AIDS for all populations and for all communities. However, to achieve that requires a radical change in our approach to drugpolicy. The recommendations in the High Commissioner's report outline many of the essential elements of that change. First, drug prohibition has failed. Punitive drug laws and law enforcement practicescreate significant barriers for people who inject drugs to access a range of benefits and services,including but not just limited to harm reduction services. Criminalization reflects and also exacerbates and perpetuates societal stigma and discrimination beyond legal sanctions. In eight ofthe 14 countries that reported data to UN AIDS, more than 10% of people who inject drugs avoided healthcare services due to the stigma and discrimination they faced. And yet 145 countries around the world stillcriminalize the use or possession of small amounts of drugs. Decriminalization of drug use is critical to guarantee access to HIV services and the report we are discussing here today emphasizes that effectively designed and implemented decriminalization is essential to ensure the right to health of peoplewho inject drugs. Harm reduction programs, particularly needle and syringe programs and opioid agonist therapy are crucial in the HIV response, demonstrating time and again the efficacy in reducing HIV incidents.However, these programs are underfunded and unavailable to the majority of people who inject drugs. And many times when they are available, they are not available at scale. Over 80 countries globally have either needleand syringe programs or opioid agonist treatment or both. However, in 2019, UN AIDS reported only 1%of people who inject drugs live in countries with the recommended coverage of both services, a number that has not substantially changed in the past five years. Women who inject drugs experienced double the risk of acquiring HIV due to gender norms, inequality, sexual violence and engagement in unsafe sex work.Data from 16 countries reporting to UN AIDS showed that the median HIV prevalence amongst men who inject drugs was 9% while it was nearly double for women who inject drugs. Addressing stigma, discrimination and gender inequality involves removing obstructive policies and laws and investing in programs designedto enhance HIV initiatives for women who inject drugs. Therefore, we welcome the report's recommendation to adopt gender sensitive drug policies that respond to the specific needs of women. To meet the aboveneeds, we need to rebalance investment in drug policy towards health-based approaches. Across 45 countries reporting funding data for programs for people who inject drugs, actual spending only amountedto 7% of the estimated resource needs. Even for that small amount, almost 70% of those funds came from international donors rather than from domestic resources. Finally, the core of a human rightsapproach is participation. Organizations led by people who use drugs must not just be included but must be leading the response. A 2021 study found that peer involvement in harm reduction services led to reducedHIV incidence and prevalence, increased service access, acceptability and quality, changed risk behaviors and reduced stigma and discrimination. Yet 45% of countries reporting to UN AIDS said they do notinvolve people who inject drugs in HIV decision making processes, rendering them the key population group that is most excluded from HIV decision making. Despite positive progress like decriminalizationof drug use in some countries, implementation of harm reduction programs and involvement of civil societyin drug policy, there is much work ahead. It is work that must take place across our different hubs in Vienna, in Geneva and in New York with human rights and in particular the right to health serving as thefoundations for our work in every UN parliamentary and community forum. I commend the High Commissioner for Human Rights once again for an excellent report and urge everyone here to incorporate its findings inyour discussions wherever they may occur. I thank you. Thank you very much, Ms. Stigling, for yourstatement which shows in a very detailed way the very important remit of your organization and its effort to combat the effects of drugs, especially in the field of health care. Thank you very much. I willnow give the floor to Mr. Jean-Luc Lemieux on behalf of UNODC so that he can contribute to our debate as a panelist. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, President. You are inviting me to be part ofthis panel and thank you as well, Christine, for your appeal to see more funding and scaling up of programs related to harm reduction and injecting drug use. We are very much welcomed. Good morning,Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies. It is a pleasure being here with you, respecting, protecting and promoting all human rights, fundamental freedoms and the inherent dignity of all individuals and therule of law is crucial in the development and implementation of drug policies at all levels.The body of international law establishes human rights that are universal and inalienable and the international community has continuously stressed that to effectively address and counter the world drug problem, anypolicy or action must respect and preserve those rights and must be in line with the purposes and principles of the chart of the United Nations as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.UNODC implements its mandate to support Member States to prevent and address not only the nonmedical use of drugs, crime and corruption but also to promote health, justice and peace for all. Human rights is oneof the three embedded cross-cutting teams of the new UNODC strategy spanning from normative policy work,research and technical assistance delivery. UNODC was proud to join all stakeholders at a high level event in Geneva to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and weannounced at that occasion human rights pledges that covered the entire spectrum of our work. Let me turn to some specific issues related to the world drug problem. Protecting the health and welfare of individualsand society is the fundamental aim of the three international drug conventions. Being a source of international public law, the conventions represent a commitment of state parties to implement obligations arising fromthem, mindful of obligations stemming from other legal instruments including human rights law. The report of the office of the High Commissioner addresses several important human rights related challengesfaced in many parts of the world. The world drug problem is complex and multifaceted and constantly developing. We are all aware of the proliferation of synthetic drugs and the major threat to healththese present. At the same time, research indicates that while drug potency has gone up, risk perceptionhas gone down. Additionally, the Internet and the growing vulnerability of the south contribute to the challenges in developing most effective responses. One additional aspect of crucial importance I wouldlike to highlight today is the right of the child to be protected from drug use and associated disordersgrounded in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 25% of the world population are children,people below the age of 18. The children population is particularly vulnerable to the negative health and social consequences of substance and drug use. Evidence has shown that the earlier children startto use substances, the more likely they will be to develop mental health disorders including substance use disorders. However, too often our narrative has left children behind. At the end of last year,UNODC has launched a new initiative, CHAMPS, child amplified prevention services and we have pledged to promote the right of health of 10 million children vulnerable to starting to use drugs by amplifyingthe resilience in 10 countries over the next five years. We also hope that early prevention of drug use in particular among children and young people and other vulnerable populations would also be partof future human rights discussions related to the world drug problem including by the relevant Treaty bodies in Geneva. UNODC stands ready to provide expertise and scientific evidence in this area.Young people are the voice of today and tomorrow. They are essential to accomplish our mandates, enhance the rule of law, improve human security and pursue justice, integrity and health priorities.Youth can uphold human rights for future generations and instill in them a sense of the significance and worth. Another aspect we would like to highlight today is the right of the individual to healthingrained in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Ensuring access to essential medicines to improve our quality of life and living without avoidable and treatable pain are but a few illustrationsof these rights. International law protects the health and welfare of every person and established with the adoption of the Convention of Narcotic Drugs and the Convention of Psychotropic Substances,a timeless and science-based foundation for the realization of that right. The scheduling system has been designed to be responsive to the evolution of scientific knowledge on drugs, the liability for abuse, the dependence potential and the value in therapeutics. The report of theoffice of the High Commissioner recommends for states to consider developing a regulatory system for legal access to all controlled substances. Obviously what is meant is establishing national systemsto ensure availability of and access to controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes.This is incidentally not a consideration but rather an obligation of all state parties to the Conventions.As a conclusion, Mr. President, let me go beyond and touch briefly upon thematic areas that very much cut across with the world drug problem. Our prison reform work contributes to the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and to the protection of other rights of persons deprivedof their liberty. Our legislative and policy advice, training and capacity building promotes alternative measures to conviction and punishment and delivers programs focused on rehabilitation and reintegrationof offenders and young people in conflict with the law. Given the complex multifaceted nature of the world drug problem, understanding and working in all these areas is of great importance. Allow me toreiterate the utmost importance of basing our work on science and reliable data. This ensures that decisions we make as a UN entity are grounded in evidence and in line with agreed upon legalcommitments for which we as the UN are accountable for. As I have mentioned before, Mr. President,UNICI stands ready to share its expertise on any and all of these areas. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Lemahieu, for this overview of the ONDC concerning the world drug program and alsothe various activities you are carrying currently to face the consequences of this unfortunate problematic. Thank you so much. And now I'm pleased to give the floor to Mrs. Anne Fordham. Madam, you have the floor.I'm sorry, Madam. I have to announce that the list of speakers is closed according to our rulesto inform all the Delegations present here. I'm so sorry. Please, you have the floor, Madam.Thank you, Mr. President. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, it's a privilege to be part of this distinguished panel today. It has been over a decade since United Nations human rights bodiesbegan breaking down the silos that separated drug policy and human rights. Through tireless efforts, the office of the high commissioner for human rights and other human rights entities have had a trulytransformational effect on global drug policy debates. They have shown a spotlight on the catastrophic impacts of the so-called war on drugs which can no longer be denied or downplayed. And I feel confidentthat sooner than later this critical work will transform the global approach to drugs. It's my honor to represent the international drug policy consortium, a global network of over 190 NGOs fromover 75 countries who come together to promote drug policies grounded in human rights and social justice.For decades, the unrealistic goal of achieving a society free of drug abuse has driven drug policies based on prohibition, criminalization, and harsh punishment. The harms caused by these policiescan only be repaired by making sure that civil society and community organizations play a central role in bringing forward evidence and lived experience to inform and shape drug policies.Member States and UN bodies have a responsibility to honestly listen to civil society and affected communities, including people who use drugs, subsistence farmers, producers, people who have been incarcerated and all those who have been disproportionately impacted and to reflect on howto reform a global system that has so clearly failed. I begin on a sobering note. As we have heard today, the United Nations is in the midst of conducting a midterm review of the current global drug strategy,the 2019 ministerial declaration on drugs. In December last year, IDPC launched a shadow report to evaluate the progress made by the international community in addressing the 12 challenges identifiedin the 2019 ministerial declaration. The conclusion is that little to no progress has been made andthat the situation remains grave. Despite billions spent every year on drug law enforcement, the illegal drug market is thriving and militarized responses are fueling violence and conflict. Drug related deathsremain at a historical high, over half a million deaths per year driven in many places by a deadly, toxic and unpredictable drug supply while access to harm reduction, treatment and other support servicesfall dramatically short of what is needed. Access to controlled medicines for pain relief and palliative care also remains low to nonexistent in many parts of the world. Our report also highlights that in allregions, the human rights impacts of drug control have either worsened or remained unchanged.These abuses are widespread and range from the ongoing use of the death penalty, extra judicial killings,arbitrary arrest and detention, mass incarceration and cases of torture masquerading as treatment. There is also widespread discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age and socioeconomic status. In some,we absolutely concur with the High Commissioner's finding that the world drug situation has a major impact on the enjoyment of human rights. The United Nations system, both in Geneva and in Vienna, needs to recognize this reality and initiate a process of institutional transformation that brings an endto the current paradigm. The good news is that global drug policy is poised to change. For instance, this panel has been convened at the request of the historical 2023 Human Rights Council resolutionon human rights and drug policy which broke the taboo at the UN on harm reduction and recognized the centrality of gender, indigenous peoples' rights and racial justice in drug policy debates. Such progress would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The resolution also requested the preparation of thereport on human rights challenges in drug policy presented today, a truly groundbreaking documentthat presents a clear blueprint for global reform. At its release, the report was welcomed by a joint statement of 134 NGOs urging Member States to take on the High Commissioner's recommendations and thereport is already being used by advocates for reforms all over the world. Drug policy itself is shifting.By the end of 2023, 66 jurisdictions in 40 countries had decriminalized drug use and possession for personal use, a measure endorsed by the UN common position on drugs and described by OHCHR as apowerful instrument to ensure the rights of people who use drugs are protected. Over 3 million people live in legal systems that have regulated drugs like cannabis for recreational use, thus checking the power of organized crime and the pressure of the police on people who use drugs and marginalizedpopulations. Many other jurisdictions will follow soon. At the request of Bolivia, the WHO recently initiated a critical review of the status of the coca leaf under the UN drug conventions, a measure that could end the global prohibition on the coca leaf, thus reinstating the rights of indigenouspeoples that have used the plants for centuries. Human rights bodies have been indispensable in building this global moment for change and their contributions will not end anytime soon. To give you two examples, the UN special rapporteur on the right to health will release this year a much expectedand much necessary report on harm reduction within the framework of the right to health. And the Committee on economic, social and cultural rights continues to make progress towards the adoption of a general comment on drug policy which began in 2022. The office of the high commissioner for human rights mustbe praised not only for the landmark 2023 report but also for tirelessly supporting advocates and civil society seeking reform at both international and national level. Their presence in Vienna has been consequential and needs to be continued and strengthened through regular reporting and interventionsat the UN commission on narcotic drugs. However, in spite of this progress, the contribution of human rights mechanisms has been limited in scope and inevitably depends on the personal interests of each mandate holder. If we want to ensure a genuine understanding of the human rights dimensions ofdrug policies and to generate recommendations that will change the system, a further step needs to be taken. In that regard, we urge the human rights council to move towards the creation of a special procedure mandate on human rights and the world drug situation. A special mandate, either a specialrapporteur or working group is necessary to provide evidence on the broad range of dimensions in which the drug phenomenon impacts human rights and sheds light on the situation of affected communities and most importantly, to develop in a coherent and systematic way the international standards necessaryto bring a new drug policy paradigm to reality. A quick look at the themes of the over 50 special procedure mandates already existing makes clear that the scale of the human rights impacts associated with the world drug problem, over half a million drug related deaths per year and 20% of the globalprison population warrants the creation of a mechanism. I hope this is a recommendation we can discuss today and for the coming days. Finally, I wanted to reiterate that the High Commissioner's report is a historic document that builds on the encouraging momentum we have seen over the pastdecade in firmly centering human rights in drug policy debates. Our hope is that true transformational change is coming that heralds a genuine paradigm shift away from repression and punishment towardsdrug policies that truly prioritize human rights and the health and welfare of mankind. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Mrs. Ferdinand on behalf of the IPDC for your contribution to this introduction bythe panelists to our dialogue this morning on this subject. You highlighted particularly the civil situation faced globally by this phenomenon of drug in the world and particularly in connection withits human rights also dimension and we thank you also for some proposals you advised we advanced this morning. Thank you so much. Now we give the floor to you, Mrs. Zaman. Good morning, DistinguishedDelegates, Excellencies and fellow panelists. I'm honored to speak at this panel discussion today as member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy. I would like to sincerely thank the Human Rights Council for organizing this panel discussion and moreover thank the High Commissioner for deliveringan exceptional and pragmatic report on the issue of drug policy as you have heard from my fellow panelists before. The Global Commission commends the OHCHR for this report and remains a strong supporterin its work in this regard moving forward. The Global Commission on Drug Policy was founded in 2011 and now gathers 29 global leaders from the political, economic and cultural arenas. The Global Commissionthrough each of its commissioners advocates for drug policies based on scientific evidence, human rights, public health and security that leave no one behind. The Global Commission calls for such policyreform mainly by means of the five pathways namely firstly putting people's health and safety 1st ,secondly ensuring access to essential medicines and pain control, thirdly ending the criminalization and incarceration of people who use drugs, fourthly refocusing law enforcement responses to drugtrafficking and organized crime and 5th legally regulating drug markets to put governments in control. The report of the High Commissioner around which we are convening today elucidates a number ofways in which drug policies and human rights are inextricably intertwined. In particular it demonstrates ways in which policies characterized by drug prohibition, criminalization and militarizationnegatively impact the realization of a wide range of human rights protected by international law and under which Member States have obligations. Drug prohibition has failed to achieve its intended goalof a drug free world. On the contrary it has put people at even more risk by further entrenching discrimination and marginalizing populations that already face exclusion and subjugation. Counterto the intention of drug prohibition the actual number of people who use drugs has increased. Over the past decade this population has increased by 23% to an estimated 296 million people in 2021,a population that would be the 4th largest in the world if it were a country behind only India, China and the United States. By 2030 demographic factors project the number of people using drugs aroundthe world to rise by 11%. At the same time there has been a general increase in the production of illicit drugs. Punitive drug laws stemming from drug prohibition impose disproportionate criminaljustice responses which are the main driver of incarceration. In 2022 an estimated 2.2 million people worldwide were in prison for drug offenses, 22% of whom were in prison for drug possession forpersonal use. Such disproportionate responses are also reflected in the continued deployment of compulsory treatment services as a purported alternative to incarceration for drug relatedoffenses. Although numerous UN bodies have clearly stated that compulsory drug treatment is not based in scientific evidence and violates an array of human rights these centers and programs continueto operate in many parts of the world. Drug courts can also fall into this paradigm. Mandatory treatment may be presented as an alternative sentence to incarceration but this treatment is not necessarilyevidence based and may not include the provision of evidence based drug dependence medications. Meanwhile relapses of failed drug tests, a normal part of efforts to overcome drug dependence can force a personsentenced under a drug court procedure back into prison. Furthermore prohibitive, punitive and criminalizing policies have fueled and continue to fuel epidemics of HIV and hepatitis C among peoplewho inject drugs as you have heard from my fellow panelists from UN AIDS. In 2021 one in every eight people who inject drugs were living with HIV while nearly half were living with hepatitis C. Yet globallyharm reduction services are not available at the level and scale required to end AIDS with only 2% of people who inject drugs living in countries that fall within the UN recommended levels for accessto clean needles and syringes and to opioid substitution therapy. In too many countries there are no harm reduction services at all. And yet all of this happens while access to and availability of essential medicinefor pain relief and palliative care is further restricted by the international drug control systemleading to the unnecessary suffering of millions of people including children in pain with inadequate medical treatment thus violating the universal and inalienable right to health established very clearlyin the universal declaration for human rights 75 years ago. States must acknowledge that drug prohibition is counterproductive and generally not based on human rights or scientific evidence. The internationaldrug policy regime requires human rights based reform. The global commission empathically echoes the call made in the High Commissioner's report to shift away from a punitive paradigm and center drugpolicies around health, human rights, development and communities. In this sense, the expansion and robust funding of harm reduction as well as the decriminalization of drug use and possession for personal useare essential and urgent reforms. However, considering that the number of people using drugs globally is projected to rise by 11% by 2030, the most effective way to reduce the extensive harms of prohibitionistdrug policies and to advance the goals of public health and safety is ultimately for states to bring drug controls to bring drugs under control through responsible legal regulation. States must considerthe legal regulation of drugs as a sound and effective way effective pathway to undermine organized crime which can subsequently liberate resources to counter its root causes as well as mitigate any anticipatedchanges in organized crime activity. States should pursue the responsible legal regulation of drugs. Without legal regulation, control and enforcement, the drug trade will remain in the hands of organizedcriminal groups. There is also a public health imperative to legally regulate drugs, not because drugs are safe but because they are risky. The regulation and thereby management of risky behaviors and productsis a key function of all government authorities. Governments regulate everything from alcohol and cigarette consumption to medicines, seat belts, the use of fireworks, et cetera. If the potential risk ofdrugs are to be contained and minimized, governments must apply the same regulatory logic to the development of effective drug policies. This can be done by means of incremental regulation of lower potency drugs whichis evidence based in a process guided by the principles of human rights, public health, sustainable development and peace and security. In this sense, much can be learned from successes and failures in regulatingalcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical drugs, thus mitigating the threats of over commercialization.There is no one size fits all approach to the transition from drug prohibition to legal regulation.Each country or jurisdiction will have to design a strategy fit to its own circumstances.Regulatory approaches can also be informed by and tailored to the particular harms, risks or potential benefits of the substance in question. In practice, this can range from state monopoly control or partof part or all of the market to limiting the market to personal cultivation, not for profit models or social enterprises or limiting the size of businesses allowed to participate in a market as a means ofpreventing regulatory capture and industry lobbying. When legally regulating drug markets, policymakers must open local and national participatory processes to shape drug reforms and not exclude people andcommunities most affected by drug prohibition, including people who use drugs, young people and small scale actors in the illegal market. In conclusion, it is clear that our deliberations in addressing all aspects of the world drug situation cannot take place without putting human rights considerations atthe center. We need to operationalize a human rights based approach to drug control. The report of the High Commissioner and our discussion here today is a part of a growing recognition of this within theinternational fora. The drug control regime and the human rights based regime need to cease to behave as though they operate in parallel yet separate universes. This calls for us to go further in cementing the link between human rights and drug policy by making drug policy a standing item onthe Human Rights Council agenda and even giving the topic a specific mechanism of its own, for instance, a special mandate holder on human rights and drug policy. Furthermore, the current state of drugprohibition without legal regulation and control has quite clearly not only failed to achieve its intended goals of reducing drug use but has also had catastrophic human rights consequences. The way forward must seestates take the lead not only by scaling harm reduction, expanding access to essential medicines and decriminalizing drug use and possession for personal use, but also exploring the legal regulation ofdrugs as the path that puts control back in the hands of governments rather than criminal groups. I thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Mrs. Kamaru Zaman, for your in-depth contribution alsoto the presentations made this morning by all whom I would like to thank on your behalf also for theirexplanations, assessments provided to us this morning. So Excellencies, dear colleagues, we will now begin with our list of speakers and the 1st part, let me again remind you that all interventions from thefloor are limited to 1 min and 30 seconds. Okay. So we have as 1st speaker Singapore on behalf ofa group of countries. Singapore, you have the floor. Micro, sir. There is a technical problem, sir,the Ambassador. The micro is not open. Yeah. Okay. Can we start again? Yeah. Mr. President, I'm delivering the statement on behalf of 38 states. The full version will be uploaded on the extra net. The currentdevelopments related to the world drug problem are alarming and represent a global drug crisis.Meanwhile, the adoption of legislation in support of recreational drug use in some countries creates misperceptions of the harmful consequences of illicit drug use. The challenges posed by illicit and narcotic drugs are complex and multifaceted. That's why there is specialized UN Treaties, fora and mechanisms todeal with it. The CND in particular is the principle policy making body of the UN for drug control matters. It is hence concerning that this parallel track of political pressure detracts from the sound technical work already being undertaken in Vienna and unduly prejudices the long standing impartiality,objectivity and evidence-based work of the UNODC, INCB and CND. All UN bodies should carry out their work independently without external influence or pressure. We believe that a comprehensive andbalanced approach, Mr. President, is important to tackle this endemic problem and to prevent the harms of drugs from becoming entrenched. Therefore, we urge all Member States to set ambitious goals and not only limit their efforts to harm reduction as well as for concerted international action to address the rootcauses of the world drug problem. Mr. President, we reaffirm our determination to counter the world drug problem and to actively promote the society free of drug abuse to ensure that all people can live in security, peace, health, dignity and prosperity. Thank you. I thank you, Mr. Ambassador, for yourdeclaration on behalf of a group of countries and now the floor is for Switzerland on behalf of a group of countries. Mr. Ambassador, you have the floor. Mr. President, I have the honor to deliver the statementon behalf of the Member States of the core group of the Resolution 52/24, namely, Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Portugal, Uruguay and my own country, Switzerland. Wethank the OHCR for the report in fulfillment of the mandate of the resolution and for hosting today's intercessional panel. The adoption by consensus of Resolution 52/24 has shown that common language ispossible on this topic. However, the negotiation process and numerous amendments have also reminded us that the urgently needed shift away from punitive approaches towards an international drug policythat puts human rights and public health in the center is still heavily contested and continues to require our full attention and increased joint commitment. This shift, though, is even more compellingin the light of the recent rise of synthetic drugs which poses new challenges while the old ones remain. Let us make sure that while tackling emerging drug issues, the importance of a holistic approachis recognized and implemented in balanced evidence-based policies that address discrimination and reduce the stigma towards persons who use drugs in order to ensure voluntary access to drug services. It isencouraging that the report emphasizes recent positive developments in the stronger alignment between human rights and drug policy discussions and among international drug policy bodies. We are also pleased to note the stronger involvement of civil society. To this end, we urge states to implementthe key recommendations presented in the report and call upon parties to aim for a progressive health and human rights-based midterm review of the 2019 Ministerial Declaration. I thank you. I thank you, Mr. Ambassador, on behalf of a group of countries and now the floor is for the European Union.Thank you, Mr. President. The European Union welcomes the OCHR report and the panelists. The EU calls on all states to take a human rights-based approach to drug policy including by adopting gender responsivedrug policies. The EU remains concerned that some countries still take disproportionate or inhumane penalties or disregard the right to a fair trial and condense the use of the capital punishment in all circumstances including in this context. Treatment of drug users or persons with drug useconditions must be voluntary and depend on informed consent. The EU commends progress in countries that support the development and implementation of evidence-based policies and interventions that put human rights at the center of drug responses while countering crime and ensuring public safety andsecurity, sustainable and viable livelihoods and the health of individuals, families and communities. The EU recalls the need to maintain and improve the availability, accessibility and coverage of risk and harm reduction services and that states may develop and implement alternative or additional measures toconviction or punishment in cases of an appropriate nature in accordance with the three international drug control conventions as well as the promotion of proportionate responses. The EU recalls its drug strategy 2021 and the EU action plan on drugs 2021-2025. Further discussions on the OCHR reportwill be key for the 2024 midterm review of the 2019 ministerial declaration. The EU will remain supportive of contributions of the Human Rights Council in this regard. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir, on behalf of the European Union. The floor is for Singapore. Mr. Ambassador, you have the floor.Mr. President, my Delegation earlier delivered a joint statement clearly demonstrating that there are different perspectives on drug control policies. We are disappointed at the lack of balance in theOCHR's report in today's discussion. Apart from undermining the integrity of the international drug control system anchored in three conventions, OCHR's report ignores the immense damage and impact that illicit drugs have on societies affecting the rights of many. The deliberate oversimplificationand narrowing of the scope of the world drug problem as primarily a health and human rights issue ignores its criminal justice dimensions. Such framing deepens polarization on this issue and undermines the search for comprehensive solutions. It neither reflects the diverse context of the world drugproblems requiring tailored responses from states nor acknowledges positive examples that appear tough but are thoroughly grounded in evidence-based approaches improving the situation. Singapore's position is clear. Drug-related issues are best addressed by specialized organs with relevantexpertise like CND, INCV and UNODC. We reject the recommendations of this one-sided report which are unilaterally developed and shaped by an opaque and exclusive mini-stakeholder group of states, civil society and OHCR known as the Brandenburg Forum. We would remind the OHCR and Delegationsthat the resolution mandating this report and discussion call for full respect for state sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention in states' internal affairs. Thank you very much, Mr. President.Thank you, Mr. Ambassador for your Delegation on behalf of Singapore.I now give the floor to Algeria.We would like to thank all the panelists for their presentations. Algeria is a favored route for drug trafficking because of its geographical situation and its land borders. To this you have to add its proximity with cannabis cultivation sites in the east and market openings in the north. The policeseized 15 kilos of KIF and also lots of cocaine and other psychotropic substances coming from Morocco. Morocco has been classified as the prime exporter of cannabis in the world. Algeria knows thatthese drugs are pernicious and they can place the brakes on youth and undermine people's health and well-being. That is why the fight against this scourge is a major public health issue and a national security issue. It calls for a comprehensive prevention policy that would involve civil society andthe therapeutic treatment for drug addicts. The statement according to what is contained in thereport of the OHCR, a law was adopted in Algeria to favor a human rights-based and health-based approach to drug problems. We do feel very strongly, though, about the constant indifference of certain countriesin light of relating to the control of drugs and this is having a major impact on people's public and mental health. Thank you. I give the floor to Mexico. Thank you very much, President. Mexico would liketo express its gratitude for this panel discussion and welcomes the report 54/53 of the OHCR. During the high level event of the human rights 75 initiative, Mexico submitted a commitment for continuing todrive a human rights-based approach in international fora on the world drug problem. Promoting the human rights-based approach is necessary since when a purely security and justice-based approach was used,responses to the world drug problem had a major impact on human rights. For instance, as the report points out in its section on the death penalty, we are concerned that executions for drug-related offensesaccount for one in three of all executions carried out globally. Mexico would like to highlight the need to take into account recommendations contained in the report of the OHCR in the outcome document that will be produced following the high level session of the 67th meeting of the commission onnarcotic drugs. We would also like to reiterate the need to build greater synergies between different UN agencies so as to address in a comprehensive fashion the global drug problem and in order to contribute to Agenda 2030, including regional bodies, civil society and academia in these efforts. Thank youvery much, President. And now the floor is for Belarus. Thank you very much, President. Belarus as a party to the key drug-controlled conventions of the United Nations is committed to its obligationsin combating the world drug problem. Our state policy focuses on destroying the narcotics drug economy, protecting the life and health of our citizens and the safe development of youth and children. Belarus's comprehensive approach to drug policy and its strict criminal and administrative legislationin the field of illicit drug trafficking includes a comprehensive set of social and medical and educational measures. In particular, we have inpatient clinics, rehabilitation centers and we do call for notdiluting the national and international legal regime for drug control on account of an unfounded, hard selling approach of drug liberalization and decriminalization which does not take into account the specific physics of a given country nor the risks involved for young people. We believe in thesovereign right of states to develop and implement their own drug-related policy. We would also like to draw attention to the issue of the accessibility of narcotic substances for medical use and unilateral coercive measures which are a barrier factor for medical supplies which are hampering the abilityof people to access treatment for severe illnesses. So we would like to know how the UN bodies and the UCHR intend to react to the problem of UCMs. Thank you. Thank you, sir. On behalf of Belarus and nowthe floor is for Iran. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. My Delegation aligns itself with the statement delivered by Singapore. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the UNCND as a policy-making body with the responsibility for drug control and related matters and the UN office ondrugs and crime as the leading entity of the United Nations system and the INCB and the WHO under their treaty mandate role serves as a primary platform for addressing and countering the war drug problem.The topic should be considered through ensuring rights of all individuals, families, communities and society as a whole and cannot be limited to the rights of drug users. As reaffirmed in the resolution 52/24, the ultimate goal of the international efforts in addressing and countering the war drug problem isto actively promote a society free of drug abuse in order to help ensure that all people can live in health, dignity and peace with security and prosperity which means that all illicit drug cultivation, production, manufacturing, trafficking and abuse cannot be tolerated. There are serious challengesrelated to the protection of the human rights posed by the increasing links between the drug trafficking and other forms of organized crimes including trafficking in persons, trafficking in firearms, cyber crime and money laundering and in some cases terrorism including money laundering in connectionwith the financing of terrorism. Therefore and despite the repeated assertion that human rights platform in Geneva are not suitable for addressing the war drug problem and tend to complicate the issue, the Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates that the involvement of non-specialized international bodiesin this matter does not contribute to alleviating the challenges posed by this increasing global problem. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank you, sir, on behalf of Iran and now the floor is for Chile.Thank you very much, President. Chile welcomes the holding of this panel session which tackles a topic that we are closely following. Drug trafficking is a major threat for security and enjoyment of human rights. States have the obligation to protect their population against this threat,taking appropriate measures in order to prevent these issues and punishing the perpetrators. However, Chile is concerned by the proliferation of statements that reflect a certain incompatibility between drug trafficking and respect for human rights. Let us be clear, the incompatibility between human rights-basedapproach and human rights is fictitious. States must combat the most serious crimes while respecting human rights. So we share the concern raised by the human rights commissioner about the so-calledwar against drugs and its policies including an escalating use of force including extrajudicial killings as well as the excessive use of incarceration with a subsequent impact on the human rights ofpeople detained deprived of their liberty. Therefore, we welcome the best practices promoted by the high commissioner and we invite countries to share their own experiences so as to better combat drugtrafficking and also ensure that we uphold human rights. Thank you. Thank you, Madam, on behalf of Chile. Now the floor for Paraguay. Ambassador, you have the floor. Thank you very much, President. Wethank the high commissioner and the panelists for the report and for their comments. These reflect major strides forward on various levels and we believe that this is the way forward. We also wouldlike to highlight the numerous challenges in the field of human rights that approaches against the world drug problem continue to give rise to. We need a multidisciplinary approach which is based on humanrights and public health in order to develop appropriate public policies. In Paraguay we have been implementing the national plan which has been developed by three ministries, the public healthministry, the interior ministry and the ministry of education. Its key goal is to deliver comprehensive solutions for the rehabilitation and reinsertion of people who suffer from drug related disorders. That is to say we offer them not just medical treatments but also emotional support and we help them reintegratesociety in an effective manner. We need to move away from the punitive approach and at the same time incorporate community based services for harm reduction and we must invest in substitution therapy.We also call on the treaty bodies and other human rights agencies to continue developing recommendations so that states can adjust their drug related policies and we encourage states to include the relevantaspects of the drug policy in the various contained in various reports from the international mechanisms and to implement them accordingly. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador on behalf of Paraguay. Now the floor is for Malaysia. Thank you, Mr. President. Malaysia thanks the esteemed panelists for theirinsights today and appreciates the positive acknowledgement of the High Commissioner in his opening remarks on Malaysia's effort. We recognize the need to address the world drug problem to a comprehensive balanced and holistic approach. Malaysia has implemented a series of measures to help individualsstruggling with substance abuse and dependency. This includes 1st actively embracing harm reduction approaches with a primary focus on mitigating HIV infection rates. Second introducing alternative measures for the rehabilitation of drug abuser and dependence through community based programs andafter care initiatives and 3rd actively engaging various in assessing the feasibility of integrating medical treatment and rehabilitation methods to address drug dependency. We remain committed to continue engaging with all stakeholders as we work towards a more compassionate and community basedapproach in accordance with the relevant national policy. However, while these measures primarily concentrate on providing treatment for individuals struggling with substance abuse and drug addiction, drug trafficking remains a serious concern for Malaysia as they have profound negative effects onour communities, especially for young people. Effectively curtailing these problems necessitates coordinated and integrated international cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destinationsas well as balance between law enforcement and harm reduction policies. We seek your insight on practical strategies to strive an effective balance adopting a human rights perspective while safeguarding national security while addressing the world drug problem. Thank you. I thank you, Madam, on behalf of Malaysia. Nowthe floor is for Russian Federation. Russia. Mr. President, we regret the one-sided presentation of the issue during today's discussion and in the report 54/53 of the HCHR we are convinced of theexpediency of shifting the focus from human rights aspects of the global and national drug policies to the negative influence of illegal trafficking, production and use of drugs on ensuring human rights to life, health and the development of a safe environment. We must not forget that theultimate purpose of international anti-narcotic efforts is to build a society free from drug abuse.Therefore, the individual recommendations contained in the report are concerning such as, for instance, the recommendation on the decriminalizing and state regulation for illicit drug trafficking which directly contradicts international legal obligations of states under the three drug-related conventionsof 1961, 1971 and 1988 which call on states to recognize the production, circulation and use ofdrugs for non-medical and non-scientific purposes as a criminal offense. We are, however, disappointed that key human rights aspects such as implementation of Article 33 of the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child on protecting children from the unlawful use of drugs as well as ensuring accessibility ofdrugs and psychotropic substances for therapeutic purposes in the field of human right to health were not just missed out from the report but they weren't discussed today either. Thank you. Thank you,Madam. The floor now is for Brazil. Mr. President, Brazil thanks the panelists for their presentations.Traditionally law enforcement policies have addressed the world drug problem hoping that ending the availability of drugs will bring positive effects on public health, social relations, education and economy. This panel is a good opportunity to discuss how we can address the drug problem the other wayaround. A human rights approach shows that working on public health, social relations, education and the economy brings positive effects leading to the reduction of the world drug problem. Brazil believes that law enforcement and incarceration alone are not the main solution to this problem. Brazil iscommitted to public policies that cater specifically for our children and youth and adults with a view to the enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights. Good education, cultural activities, sports, community and family bonds, job opportunities and the absence of discrimination, all theseconditions are essential to keep people away from drugs. For Brazil a drug policy with a human rights perspective is to everyone's benefit. In the meantime, Brazilian authorities are working hard to reduce the availability of drugs and to prevent our ports and airports from being used to transferdrugs abroad while the international community work together on reducing demand with social programs and development policies that address the root causes of the drug problem. It is our collectiveresponsibility to do that. Thank you. Thank you, sir, on behalf of Brazil. I now call on France.You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, President. Ladies and gentlemen, panelists, the global report on drugs published in 2023 by UNODC is very telling. The supply of illicit drugs is ever growing and drugtrafficking networks are more and more agile and this is worsening global crises. In the face of this global problem France does not believe in a so-called right or freedom to consume drugs because drugsferment conflicts, violate human rights and destroy environment. The negative impacts of drugs on public health are considerable especially as regards addiction, overdoses and mental health as well as the transmission of AIDS. Only a comprehensive approach can ensure that we can respect humanrights in our drug approach and this is the UN's Convention's approach. We need to address the issue and treat public health. Thank you. Thank you for that statement. Now I give the floor to Amnesty International.You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. Amnesty International welcomes the report and it the recommendations to transform ineffective and ill conceived approaches to drugs. Decades of prohibition and criminalization have left a legacy of violence, disease, mass incarceration, suffering andabuse. It is usually the poorest and most marginalized communities who are suffering as a result, devastating lives and turning communities apart. Prohibitionist policies have failed to decrease the use and availability of drugs over the years and have instead undermined the rights of millions,exacerbated the risks and harms of using drugs, deepened inequalities and intensified the violence associated with illicit markets. As the international community embarks on the midterm review of the 2019 Ministerial Declaration and begins considering commitments beyond 2029, it is essential toensure a sustained paradigm shift towards drug policies grounded in the protection of public health and human rights. Mr. President, we urge states to use these report's recommendations as a roadmap to adopt new models that put the protection of people's health and rights at the center. Thisshould include the decriminalization and responsible regulation of drugs as well as the expansion of health and other social services to address drug related problems. Lastly, we urge this council and all states to ensure that human rights are at the center of international drug policies, including bybringing the resolution on drug policy and human rights to the attention of the council every two years and providing a mandate to the office to periodically report on these matters. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, sir, on behalf of Amnesty International. And now I give the floor to International Harm Reduction Association, Mrs. Berkshine Naomi. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, Mr. President. Harm ReductionInternational welcomes this important report and renewed attention by the council. We wish to highlight three key challenges raised by the report. In 2023, we witnessed a devastating unraveling of progress on abolition of the death penalty. Harm Reduction International's upcoming global mapping of thesituation will report over 450 drug related executions in 2023. This is the highest figure in eight years, with almost one in two people executed done so in the name of drug control. International cooperationand development funding has misguidedly been invested in punitive approaches for decades. States must divest from punitive responses that violate human rights and invest in rights-based policies that put affected people 1st , including harm reduction. We remark on the report's strong recommendation inthis regard. Despite decades of evidence showing that harm reduction is cost effective and saves lives and has strong UN endorsement, the availability of quality services remains dire. Direct and structural racism leads to black, brown and indigenous people facing additional barriers to accessing these alreadylimited services. These and other challenges detailed in the report can only be addressed in a coordinated and concerted way, guided by scientific evidence with communities leading the way. We urge all relevant stakeholders to continue questioning violent, costly and ineffective policies and to continue mainstreamingdrug policy issues within the wider UN human rights system. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. And now I give the floor to Alliance Internationale pour la Défense des Droits et Libertés. You have the floor. Mr.President, International Alliance for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms strongly supports the report on human rights challenges in addressing and countering all aspects of the world drug problem prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We would like to underline one moretime the importance of the move from punitive to health and human rights based drug policies. We especially want to highlight the recommendations in Paragraph 66 and 68A of the report. In Paragraph 66 it specifiesthat the need of alternative development is a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants to focus on the needs of the global south and improving living conditions of communitiesthat depend on the drug economy. More attention should be given to the rights of the indigenous peoples in the design and implementation of the drug policies. Also in Paragraph 68A it is specifiedthat to adopt alternatives to criminalization and elimination of drugs by considering decriminalization of usage and take control of illegal drug markets to the responsible regulation to eliminate profits fromillegal trafficking, criminality and violence. We believe much more work is needed within the legal system to eliminate profits from illegal trafficking. Mr. President, I thank you. I thank you, sir. We have nowexhausted the 1st part of our list of speakers and we move then to the 2nd part, 2nd speaking slotto begin with Cuba. Cuba, you have the floor. Thank you very much, President. Cuba reaffirms its zerotolerance policy regarding the production consumption and trafficking of drugs. The key pillar of our policy in the face of the drug scourge is the preventive pillar which ensures that our country is neitherproducer nor transit country for illicit drugs. The three UN drug related conventions and the commission on narcotic drugs and the UNODC need to continue and forming the global legal frameworkfor drug control. This framework does not run counter to human rights instruments. On the contrary, they ensure the social and technical and legal conditions necessary for the full exercise of human rights.The UNODC is led by guiding bodies which are crucial for coordination within the system for tackling the world drug problem. This problem must be tackled in a multisectoral fashion and not bepoliticized. President, international cooperation is the key for tackling this scourge. We must abide strictly by international law and the principles enshrined in the charter such as the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of states and the noninterference in domestic affairs as we tackle the world drug problem. We must avoid the use of terms, the definition and scope of which is not clear for all states parties. We do not favor the use of terms and actions which could undermine thecurrent monitoring and control system for drugs. Cuba will continue to cooperate with all relevant states and bodies and will stand firm by its zero tolerance policy as we address this scourge. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Ambassador of Cuba. Now Colombia, Mr. Ambassador, you have the floor.Thank you, President. Colombia aligns itself with the statement delivered by Switzerland on behalf of the core group of resolution 53/24 and we echo the assertion contained in the report by the officeof the High Commissioner regarding the impact on human rights of the global drug problem andthe policies followed to tackle it. The final report by the Colombia's truth commission affirms thatthe policy to combat drugs and drug trafficking has perhaps been the most significant obstacle in efforts to consolidate peace because it is ineffective when it comes to preventing consumption. It is aperpetuating factor for armed conflicts and it has caused very severe harm to human rights, securityand development. On the basis of Colombia's experience, President Gustavo Petro advocates a human rights based approach in contrast to the purely punitive approach which over the course of 50 years failedto achieve its goals. Colombia has adopted a new human rights and people centered based drug policy which gives priority to the protection of life and the environment in accordance with achieving total peace. We recognize the transnational dimension of the world drug problem and, therefore, Colombiaconvened a regional conference which this year will discuss the need for fresh approaches in drug policies. However, the council has a lot to contribute to discussion on challenges for human rights inconnection with the world drug problem and drug policies. That is why we are very much in favor of developing this panel. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador for your declaration on behalf ofColombia and now the floor is for Australia. Thank you, Mr. President and thank you very much to the panelists. Australia strongly advocates for drug policies, initiatives and programs that balancehealth and law enforcement principles are based on scientific evidence and which adhere to and promote respect for human rights. Through our national drug strategy a key priority for Australia is ensuring a range of treatment services are available and accessible to people who use drugs withoutdiscrimination. Particular focus is given to tailoring services to priority populations such as young people, indigenous Australians and clients referred from the criminal justice system. Our commitmentunder the 2021 political declaration on HIV and AIDS to design and deliver HIV and health services free from stigma and discrimination remains steadfast. We must ensure people who inject drugs including peoplein prisons have access to the full range of HIV related interventions and health services. Australia calls for global abolition of the death penalty, particularly abolition of the death penalty for drug related offenses. Imposition of the death penalty for drug related offenses is inconsistentwith international human rights law and there is no conclusive evidence that it is an effective deterrent. Australia will continue to work with our international partners including civil society to ensure domestic and global drug policies adhere to human rights obligations and promote principles ofnondiscrimination and harm reduction. We would like to thank the panelists for highlighting that the UN special rapporteur on the right to health is preparing a report on harm reduction within the framework on the right to health and we would like to ask what other existing mandates existthat could do more on the world drug problem noting the scale of the problem. Thank you.I thank you, Madam, on behalf of Australia and now I give the floor to Iraq.Thank you, Mr. President. We thank the panelists for their informative presentations. Drugs are a globalproblem and need joint efforts globally to reduce risks. However, each country has the sovereign rightto adopt appropriate national legislation to protect its society. Iraq reaffirms its ongoing position tocombat drugs and adopt effective radical solutions in keeping with the international legal framework.That will help us to counter this challenge in focused fashion instead of wasting our efforts and will allow international specialized agenciesto address the issue in keeping with their experience and mandates. We are committed to combating drugs through a specific national strategy. Iraq has reviewed its laws on drugs to limit useto medical and scientific purposes only. We have updated our laws for early treatments, diagnosis,and support to drug users. We have alerted society to the dangers of drugs to public health and steppedup efforts to combat organized gangs and money laundering. Thank you, President. We attach particular importanceto human rights in combating the global issue of drugs. We seek a healthy society free of drugs, but in recent years there have been tendencies to raise controversial issues internationally which are not in keeping withhuman rights commitments and the three basic conventions to combat drugs. Drugs are closely linkedto the safety of societies, particularly through the marked growth of the issue of synthetic drugs linkedto violence. To address this effectively, the role of families in prevention and detection must be a focusand we must prioritize the empowerment of social institutions. As UNODC has mentioned, we must protectsocieties from the use of drugs. Thus, the current guidelines we believe harm the rights of children.The report only in passing mentions certain of these issues. Drugs are a real threat to the security ofnations. As agreed among experts in Vienna, we reiterate that we must seek to ensure that lives are protected upholding health and peace. Thank you. Thank you. Bolivia welcomes this panel and thanksthe High Commissioner for the report on the challenges in addressing the global problems of drugs with the human rights-based approach and we thank the panelists for their reflections. We share the concerns of thethreat to human rights in the war against drugs. We must have balanced approaches focused on human rights which provide an adequate, timely response, protect health, security and well-being as well as traditionalknowledge and ancestral cultures. This is crucial in all responses without perpetuating discrimination patterns, particularly against the indigenous peoples. Hence, we are firmly committed to upholdingthe rights of the original peoples with a strong campaign against stigmatization of the use ofnatural coca leaf including an appeal to WHO for a critical review of coca leaf which is present inthe list of the convention. We believe that this has technical beneficial uses. The expert committee ofWHO needs to review this. Natural coca leaf is part of the life and self-determination of the indigenous peoples. We will continue to defend the rights of our indigenous peoples to the ritual use of naturalcoca leaf. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Ambassador. And now I give the floor to Switzerland. Mr. Ambassador.Thank you, President. We thank the office of the High Commissioner for holding this international panel.It is today more than ever crucial to draw on all skills within the United Nations system to improve our knowledge of the effect of drugs-related policy in keeping with the common position of the UnitedNations system of 2018. Switzerland supports the report of OHCHR which calls for increased commitment by stakeholders and states to strengthen human rights and promote public health. In line with itscommitment to the abolition of the death penalty, Switzerland strongly condemns the use of the death penalty for drugs-related offenses and calls on states that continue to apply it to refrain fromdoing so for drugs-related offenses. Current drugs policy in Switzerland was developed in the 1990s following the scenes of open drug use which was unfortunately present in Switzerland. To remedy this, Switzerland developed its policy, the so-called four pillar approach with prevention, advice andtherapy, risk reduction and repression and law enforcement which has shown its benefits and allowedus to move forward. We welcome the presence of the main architect of that policy here today. President,Switzerland continues committed to moving forward with a human rights-based approach on drugs in Geneva and in Vienna. We reiterate our call to states to implement the recommendations of the report. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Thank you, Ambassador for Switzerland. Thank you. The floor is to China.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. China has always been committed to solving the problem of drugs and continues to deepen the international cooperation on drugs. China is the 1st and the only country in the world toregulate the substance of fentanyl. We are committed to maintain and support the United Nations' threeregulations. Sorry, the technical problem is solved. Sorry for the hitch-up. Please go ahead, sir. Goahead. China. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. China firmly upholds and supports the existing international drug control mechanism funded on the three UN drug control conventions and supports the leading roleplayed by the UN commission on narcotic drugs and the UN drug control policy-making body in addressing the drug problem. It is necessary to strengthen law enforcement and judicial measures while at the same time taking full account of health and human rights by enhancing the treatment and rehabilitation of drugabuses and giving equal importance to the reduction of food supply and demand. China believes that the principles of a holistic, comprehensive and balanced approach set out in the three drug control conventions and the 2009 political declaration and plan of action should continue to be upheld and implemented.Lopsided emphasis on any aspect or aspects should be avoided. At the same time, measures should be formulated with the full respect for sovereignty of each country, take into account its national condition and stage of development and encourage pragmatism and realism. China is ready to work with all partiesto make new and greater contribution to global drug governance. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir, on behalf of China. And now the floor is for Netherlands. Thank you, Mr. President. The Kingdomof the Netherlands aligns itself with the EU statement. The report of the office of the High Commissioner identified the lack of and an equal access to treatment and harm reduction services as a major area of concern. Drug dependence treatment and harm reduction have been an important part of our drug policy fordecades. Harm reduction measures are a crucial remedy to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS infections.It is crucial that these services are easily accessible and available for everyone, contributing to equal access to treatment as part of the human rights to health. We urge the international community to address the barriers that hamper access to services like multiple forms of stigma and discriminationagainst people who use drugs, financial barriers or the fear of legal repercussions. Finally, we want to raise our concern about repressive drug control measures that violate human rights obligations suchas arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, extra judicial killings and the death penalty. We call upon the Member States concerned to lift these measures. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir, on behalfof Netherlands. Now I give the floor to South Africa. Madam, you have the floor. Mr. President, South Africa welcomes this very important report. In line with the report's recommendation, unequal access to treatment and harmreduction, we invite Delegations to a high level side event entitled end inequalities, end AIDS on the fast track scaling up evidence-based services to address transmission of HIV and viral hepatitis among peoplewho use drugs to be held at the 67th session of the CND in March 2024. My Delegation implements a human rights health gender sensitive age appropriate evidence-based law enforcement approach in addressing and countering the world drug problem. This approach is informed by our commitment to the three drug controlconventions and international drug policy obligations as well as our domestic legislation whose fundamental concern is to safeguard the health and welfare of humankind. South Africa's candidate for the INCB electionsin April 2024 is an embodiment of these values. South Africa continues to call for the mainstreaming of affordability access and availability of internationally controlled substances for medical purposes whose consumption levels in Developing Countries are often not sufficient to meet the medical needs of populations.In conclusion, South Africa is convinced that the implementation of the three drug conventions and human rights obligations are complementary and mutually reinforcing. I thank you. Thank you, Madam, on behalfof South Africa. Distinguished colleagues, I have been informed that three Delegations requested the floor after the closing of the list of the speakers. If there is no objection and in conformity with thepractices established, I now will give the floor consecutively. So, the floor for Delegation ofPanama. Thank you, President. We thank the panelists for the presentations and contributions. The globaldrugs problem is complex and multifaceted. It requires a response not only from the security perspectivebut also intersectional public and public health with gender and human rights approaches. The Human Rights Council and the office of the High Commission play a crucial role in providing information andsupporting states to move forward in a human rights based approach. We agree with the concerns in the report of the office of the High Commission including inequality and access to treatment andthe harm reduction as well as militarization over imprisonment, the use of the death penalty for drugs offenses and the disproportionate effect on women, children, young people, people of Africandescent, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable and marginalized groups. We support the recommendations to abandon punitive models and develop drugs policies which are effective based on human rightswith additional periodic discussions in the Human Rights Council and recommendations in the UPR. Thankyou. Thank you, Madam. Now the floor is for Vietnam, Delegation of Vietnam. Mr. President, the Delegationof Vietnam is concerned by the threat of the drug problem globally, threatening security, health and happiness, especially of young people. We are of the view that comprehensive measures are needed at alllevels based on experiences, scientific foundations and international cooperation. We reaffirm the main role of Member States in developing an effective and comprehensive approach to addressing and counteringthe world drug problem. Vietnam welcomes the principle role of the CND, the UNOVC and the INCB as the policy making body of the United Nations for drug control matters. The three basic conventionsat the 2019 Ministerial Declaration constitute the cornerstone of the international drug control system and play a central role in developing national and international prevention strategies. We recognizethe world drug problem is complex and transnational in Asia and reiterate the urgent need for strengthening international cooperation to address and counter the world drug problem. That should be a collectiveeffort pursued in a constructive and politicized manner. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank you, sir, on behalf of Vietnam. I now call on Morocco. Thank you, President. According to thereport, the 2023 report of ONDC, the number of drug users was some 13 million, considerably more thanprevious levels. That means that over 23% more use drugs in 2021. The number of people suffering fromdisorders has risen to 39 million, a 45% rise in ten years. These are alarming figures reiterating the need to mobilize against the global drug problem in this context of rapid, profound change whichcomplicates challenges to combat this scourge. It calls on us to increase international consensus and reaffirm our determination effectively to address the global drugs issue, promoting societies free ofdrugs use so that everyone may live in safety, peace and dignity. This can only be achieved through innovative strategies, through regional and international cooperation based on trust, not byclosing borders and rejecting coordination. Thank you. Thank you, Madam, on behalf of Morocco. We come back to the list of NGOs and national institutions for human rights and I give the floor to the IDPCconsortium. We welcome the report of the office of the High Commissioner and thank them for the special attention given to people who use drugs in humanitarian and crisis settings. I'm delivering the statement on behalf of the IDPC consortium and SCUN. SCUN is a harm reduction and outpatient treatmentcenter for substance use disorders operating in Lebanon since 2003 and a country that criminalizes the use of drugs. Since its establishment, SCUN has continued providing its services through a war, the spillover from the Syrian crisis, a pandemic, a devastating broad explosion and a financialcollapse. What we have learned is that in times of crisis, people who use drugs are scratched off the list of priorities, especially in places where they are criminalized. In fact, substance use treatment and harm reduction interventions were not listed as part of humanitarian planning in Lebanon despite the factthat in terms of crisis, the risk of developing substance use disorders increases. In line with the commitments made in the ministerial declaration to leave no one behind, we reiterate the recommendations made in the report to address the specific vulnerabilities of people who use drugs in crisis byproviding health and protection services within humanitarian frameworks and further urge Member States to ensure the continuity of harm reduction interventions and substance use treatment in crisis to prioritize medication as part of emergency response planning and to broaden the UN responseto drugs to include humanitarian and human rights agencies. Thank you. Thank you, Madam, on behalf ofIDPC. And now the floor is for input limited also by video message. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this intersessional panel on human rights challenges in addressing and countering all aspects of the world drug problem. My name is Judy Cheng and I'm Executive Director of theInternational Network of People Who Use Drugs. The health, social, political and economic harms produced by the global status quo of drug policy are impossible to deny. OHCHR's report gives a clear rundown of thelitany of rights abuses driven by the war on drugs. A blunt policy instrument which has caused death, disease and violence on a daily basis for hundreds of thousands of people. And yet the hunting downand systematic destruction of our community causes merely a blip in the public consciousness, precisely because our lives are not deemed to be of sufficient value. Input fully welcomes the report's recommendationson decriminalization and legal regulation and stress an imperative for follow-up action and systematic engagement on the issue in the hallways of Geneva, Vienna, at country and grassroots levels. Peoplewho use drugs should be front and center because our voices and experiences as people at the brunt end of unjust drug policies have value and must be recognized. Thank you, Madam, on behalf of INPUT. And the lastspeaker on my list is Drug Policy Foundation. You have the floor. The Council on behalf of Transform Drug Policy Foundation for this opportunity to speak here today. The High Commission's report brings much neededhuman rights scrutiny to a policy area that has long been marginalized in human rights debates despite the egregious systemic human rights abuses associated with global drug control that the report so carefully details. Millions of people incarcerated and denied access to essential medicines and services, hundredsof thousands killed in drug war violence or arbitrarily detained in forced treatment centers and thousands illegally executed all in the name of a demonstrably failed war on drugs. We endorse the High Commission's report and its analysis and all its recommendations and we particularly welcome the bold recommendationson regulation to challenge prohibition itself, one of the key structural drivers of so many of these problems. We further hope that the Council and the office of the High Commissioner will recognize the critical importance going scrutiny in this area. This issue must not return to the shadows where it hascowed for too long. We would therefore very much welcome exploration of options for how scrutiny could be systematized, ideally of a special procedure mandate on human rights and the world drug problem.Having attended the commission on narcotic drugs in Vienna for many years it is clear rights discourse needs to be brought far more center stage in their deliberations. Human rights should be central to all UN debates but at the CND they often feel like an afterthought with those championing the war on drugsreluctant or unwilling to engage with the human rights consequences of this failed paradigm. We hopethat this report and the ongoing scrutiny of the Council and the High Commissioner on this issue marks a turning point and that going forward the Vienna and Geneva UN institutions can work more closely to protect and enhance human rights in the context of drug control. The war on drugs is inreality a war on people, particularly the most vulnerable. It is a failed and counterproductive policy model and we share the commitment of the High Commissioner to bring it to an end. Thank you.Thank you, sir. Also as last speaker on my list as I said before, so excellencies and distinguished colleagues, we now I would like to recall that Delegates inscribed on the list of speakers whocould not take the floor during this discussion will be able to upload their statements to the online system to be posted on the extranet. Now we will give back the floor to our dear panelists fortheir concluding remarks and let me just let you know that what we can accommodate is two to 3 min for each of you, dear panelists. So Mrs. Adiba Kamaluzaman, to begin with you, madam.Thank you very much. I would 1st like to address the issue on the impact of the world drug problem on children. While international agreements regularly refer to the need to protect children and youngpeople from drugs and the drug trade, recommendations however rarely extend beyond prevention of drug use and age appropriate drug treatment. While fundamentally important, these aspects do not represent the fullrange of issues children encounter nor the full range of children's experiences. The punitive approach towards the drug issue proves to bring forth a number of harms including displacement, food and incomeinsecurity, health harms and violence associated with crop eradication. They include children losing parents due to incarceration, spending their early years in prison with their mothers and growing upwithin communities subjected to intense street level policing or gang violence or affected by parents' criminal records that scar the entire family for life. They include children randomly tested fordrugs at school subjected to strip searches and sniffer dogs and they include children pulled unnecessarily into the criminal justice system or forced into drug treatment even subjected to arbitrary detention and abuse. So ladies and gentlemen, clearly the global commission on drug policycalls on today's deliberations in addressing all aspects of the world drug situation cannot take place without putting human rights considerations at the center and operationalize a human rights based approach to drug control and we welcome the report of the High Commissioner and our discussion heretoday as part of a growing recognition of this within the international fora. We once again reiterate that the drug control regime and the human rights based regime need to cease to behave as thoughthey operate in parallel yet separate universes. This calls for us to go further in cementing the link between human rights and drug policy by making drug policy a standing item on the Human Rights Councilagenda and even giving the topic a specific mechanism of its own such as that called by Australia in a special mandate holder on human rights and drug policy. Thank you for your attention. Thank youfor your final remarks. And now the floor is for you, Mrs. Fordham. Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this rich discussion. There are two points on which I would like to respond. Firstly on the questionof whether drug policies can be discussed outside of the Vienna setting. We note that the CND is the policy making body with prime responsibility for drug policy at the UN. However, this does not meanthat the CND retains a monopoly. CND resolutions as well as the 2016 outcome document and the 2019 ministerial declaration have welcomed and called for contributions from all relevant UN entities. Thisincludes the UN human rights bodies in Geneva. Human rights bodies including the council and the office of the high commissioner have an unequivocal mandate to promote and respect the enjoyment of all human rights by all people. And this is clear that it includes the human rights impacts of drug policy.There is no written in exception with regards to drugs. And this has been recognized by many treaty bodies and special procedure mandates that have incorporated these issues into their reports and recommendations. The issue of coherence on drugs across the UN system has been a matter of greatimportance and has been recognized by the UN system itself and in 2018 the UN chief executives board under the leadership of the UN secretary general adopted the UN common position on drugs which commits all UN entities including the human rights bodies and the UNODC to promote drug policiesthat center on health and human rights including the abolition of the death penalty, harm reduction and the decriminalization of drug use and possession for personal use. In fact, the findings and the recommendations of the recent OHCR report are firmly grounded in jurisprudence on human rights and drugpolicy that has been built over the last ten years by human rights mechanisms which includes over 200 recommendations by treaty bodies and a growing number of thematic reports by special mandates. A close reading of the report also shows how it's grounded in dozens of submissions by nationalgovernments, national human rights institutions and civil society. In answering the question of which special procedures could address this issue, please note that 16 special procedure mandates released a statement on the 26th of June last year to call for an end to punitive approaches to drug control. Amongthese were the working group on discrimination against women and girls, the special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the independent expert against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity amongst many others. However, as noted in my earlier statement given the gravity ofthe situation we do feel that a new special procedure mandate specifically focused on drug policy and human rights is warranted. Secondly, on the misperceptions of drug use related to legal regulation and decriminalization, this is an issue that has been raised by a few statements today. It is truethat OHCHR adopted a courageous and groundbreaking position when it included in its report a recommendation for Member States to consider legal regulation of drugs for nonmedical purposes. It is indeed the 1st UN agency to endorse legal regulation and that is very welcome given the widespread human rightsviolations associated to prohibition. But it is not the only authority to do so. Many countries including Uruguay, Germany and Malta have framed their initiatives to regulate cannabis as a tool to protect human rights, protect youth and fight organized crime. We agree that there is a need for any drug policyto monitor and evaluate legal regulation and its effects both negative and positive on health, human rights, development and security and we call on all relevant UN agencies including OHCHR to participate in such evaluations. In fact, a responsible regulation of substances like tobacco have enabled governmentsto increase taxes and provide key information about the substance that has enabled them to reduce levels of use while addressing tobacco related harms without harsh judicial measures. Thank you again for your continued commitment to ensuring the involvement of civil society and community in all aspects of drugpolicy and for your consideration here today. Thank you for your final comments also. And now I give the floor to Mr. Jean-Luc Lemahieux for his conclusions. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much,President. I would like to welcome anybody to join us at the upcoming midterm review as well as theprocesses which are ongoing leading up to that review. I think Mr. Philippe has known that we didn't hear anything else than there is a need for a balanced approach with respect for the human rights forindividuals and societies alike and to keep it short, I would like to refer which I stated earlier, it is of utmost importance that we base our work on science and reliable data and that we ensure that decisions wemake as a UN entity are grounded in evidence and in line with agreed upon legal commitments for whichwe as the UN are accountable for. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Lemahieux, for your conclusions.Now I give you the floor, dear Mrs. Christine Stigling also for your final remarks. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me be short, but I want to thank Member States and others, other Delegates here today fortheir rich statements. I think I'm particularly delighted to hear all the experiences that countries have shared in terms of their progress being made in health and human rights in relation to drug policyand for people who use drugs. And also ensuring the access to critical drugs and medicines for medical purposes. I think we have heard rich experience sharing here today which we need to acknowledge aswe are thinking about the midterm review that so many of you have spoken about. I wanted to make a comment from the perspective as the Secretariat of the only joint program within the UN and note that this seemsto be a problem that is complex, it is multifaceted and many have mentioned that we cannot discuss the issue of drug policy in silo but we need to acknowledge that it touches all parts of the house, all parts ofthe UN and it touches all parts of our societies and of our lives. So it is important to continue having these discussions here to benefit from the experience of our human rights experts and in a forum dedicatedto human rights. As the HIV response we have greatly benefited from a truly multisectoral response with the joint program as I have said bringing together 11 UN agencies including UNODC and that has allowedus to bring resolutions and discussions here to the Human Rights Council, to the World Health Assembly as well as the General Assembly in New York but also to the CND in Vienna and that has allowed us totackle an also equally complex problem which was often seen at the beginning as a medical problem in a multifaceted way and has ensured that we have a stronger more effective program and approach andI think the same should go for our discussions on drug policy. So I urge all of us to learn from what we have done well addressing a complex problem here in the UN. Let me end by saying that we welcome thereport again and we are looking forward that the discussions that we had here this morning will inform discussions that we will have soon next month at the CND in Vienna so that we don't create another silo having a conversation here about human rights and have a different conversation in Vienna. So I'mhoping we are bringing both together. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much for those concludingremarks. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates and friends, I believe that it was a very timely thing to convene this panel discussion and indeed the presentation of the report by the Office of the HighCommissioner was also timely and it gave rise to the debate we heard today with some extremely importantcomments from our panelists. We are faced with a very serious issue with very deleterious consequences at the global level both in terms of health and in terms of security and other matters. We have alsoheard of approaches that sometimes converge, other times not so much. They are more mixed. But all of this goes to show how important it is for the Council to discuss this. This brings us to the end of thepanel discussion this morning. I would like once again to thank the High Commissioner as well as the Chair of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and our panelists and I would like to thank all you participants, Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies for your contributions to the discussion.I hereby close this meeting of the Human Rights Council for the intersessional panel discussionon the world drug problem. Thank you very much."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good morning. I call to order the 1699 Plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for participating in the meeting today. I would like to propose that our order of business for the day is as follows: First, we will consider theapplication of the Holy See to participate in the work of the Conference in a formal setting. Second, we will turn to the program of work and open the floor to allow Delegations to exchange views on this matter. This exchange of views will occur in an informal setting for Member States only. Thank you. We now proceedWe now proceed to the consideration of the participation of the Holy See in the work of the Conference. As announced at the last Plenary meeting on Thursday, 1 February, today the Conference will consider the application from the Holy See to participate in its work during the 2024 session. This application is contained in C.D.3/WP.653/add 3 which has already been circulated electronically by the Secretariat. We will therefore decide on the application from the Holy See. May I take that the Conference decides to accept this application to participate in our work in accordance with its rules of procedure? It is so decided. Before we turn to the program of work, does any Delegation wish to take the floor? Ihave on my list Pakistan, South Africa, Iraq, Iran, and Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Pakistan. The floor is yours, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. At the outset, let me thank you for steering the work of this body, particularly on the difficult issue of observers.We would like to congratulate the Holy See along with 21 other nonmember states for being admitted as observers this year in this body. Mr. President, today this Conference successfully addressed the application of the Holy See which holds the status of a nonmember observer state in the UN system just like the state of Palestine. As we argued in theprevious meeting, it should be possible to do that because of C.D.'s clearly laid out rules of procedure. However, it is regrettable that the application of the state of Palestine was blocked on frivolous political considerations rather than on legal grounds as it was then claimed. Going forward, we hope that our future decisions are guided by consistent standards, multilateralism,inclusivity and fairness on the issue of observers. I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Pakistan for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from South Africa. You have the floor, Madam. Mr. President, my Delegation would like to also once again congratulate those nonmembers that have been admitted as observers to the Conference on Disarmament for 2024My Delegation welcomes the resolution and welcomes the decision taken on the 1st of February on the stalemate on the matter of the consideration of the request from states that are nonmembers of theconference to participate in the session this year. We are, however, concerned that the considerationwas based on a draft decision as this marked a deviation from past practice and the 1st time that a formal decision was made on the procedure for taking action on the request from nonmember states of the CD. In this regard, my Delegation wishes to place on record that South Africa does not viewthis decision in any way as setting a precedent for the future consideration of requests from nonmember states. It is fundamental that we do not introduce an additional layer of procedure before request of nonmember states to observe the work of the CD is considered. My Delegationfurther recalls that prior to this, there has been no formal decision on the procedure for taking action on request from nonmember states and the conference has almost always based itsconsideration on past practice of a consolidated list of requests consistent with decision CD/10/36. We note that this practice has worked for the Conference on Disarmament in the past with no record ofrequests being rejected prior to 2019. Accordingly, we encourage the Conference to revert to what was the status quo for decades prior to 2019, ensuring inclusiveness to the participation of all interestedstates, including the share of Palestine and the policy in the work of the CD, reaffirming the importance of multilateralism and the principle of inclusivity in the work of the Conferenceon Disarmament. We also wish to express our regrets of the inconsistent consideration of applications and also to just reaffirm South Africa's commitment to the Conference on Disarmament.I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of South Africa for her remarks and I will give the floor to my Distinguished Colleague from Iran. You have the floor, sir. Thank you verymuch, President. I'm speaking on behalf of the Arab Group that would like to congratulatethe Holy See in participating in our work in 2024. My group believes that the participation of observers is necessary to promote transparency, multilateralism and inclusiveness in orderto have a robust exchange of views. Observers make it possible for us to understand better the questions under review. We should implement non-discriminatory criteria related to the participationof observers in this Conference in order to ensure that the work of CD is crowned with success on a continued basis and avoid double standards. We are looking forward to the participationof Palestine in our work in line with the Rules of Procedure. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Iraq for her remarks and I would like to give the floor to my Distinguished Colleaguefrom Iran and thank him for his forbearance. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me join previous speakers in thanking you for your all efforts you have made in order to taking forward this critical issue of the request for nonmembers of the Conference onDisarmaments to participate in discussions and deliberation of Conference on Disarmaments as an observer. Iran supports and welcomes the participation of the HADISI as an observer in the 2024 work of the Conference which holds the status of nonmembers of observer statesin the UN system just like the state of Palestine. However, I just took the floor to recall that the observership of the state of Palestine, a state that enjoys the same status in the UNand is also a full-fledged member state of the Biological Convention and Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons was rejected by some members through resorting to some false arguments. Lastweek Iran and many other Delegates including the G21 criticized politicization and exercising double standards on the issue. This week once again we witness another aspect of double standardsby Delegations who preach to others inclusivity and multilateralism. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Iran for his remarks. I also thank the DistinguishedDelegates of Iran and Pakistan for the kind words addressed to the Chair. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of the Syrian Arab Republic. The floor is yours, sir. Thankyou very much, Mr. President. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Holy See. I willbe acting as an observer during the 2024 session of the CD. This demonstrates the determinationof the Holy See to participate fully in disarmament efforts and to combat proliferation. In thisrespect I would like to reiterate that the acceptance by the CD of the request made bythe Holy See is in line with Chapter 9 of the Rules of Procedure. It would have been alsojust to accept the request of the State of Palestine following the request made by the Holy See. Nevertheless, the members that contested the request made by the State of Palestine duringthe previous session and the same members accepting the request made by the Holy See, this shows that there is no legal foundation for their contestation of the request made by Palestine.This demonstrates their political objectives based on discrimination, selectivity, all of that to prevent the Delegation of Palestine from contributing to the discussions here inthe CD and also to create a smoke screen for the atrocious crimes committed by the State of Israel against Palestinians in Gaza. Thank you, President.I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the Syrian Arab Republic for his remarks and I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Turkey. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, Mr. President. We welcome the Holy See as the newest observer of the CD. We lookforward to working with them along with other observers that joined us last week. We underline that the Holy See and the State of Palestine have the same status of nonmember observer state in the UN system. Likewise, they are both eligible to apply for observership of the CD in linewith clearly laid out rules of procedure of the CD. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Turkey for her remarks. I would now like to give the floor to my old and Distinguished Friend from Egypt. The floor is yours, sir.Thank you, Mr. President, for giving my Delegation the floor. I would like to congratulate the Delegation of the Holy See for joining our August buddy as observer. We look forward to working hand in hand with all observer states. Also in this regard, I associate my statement with the statementof Iraq on behalf of the group of states members of the Arab League. Mr. Chairman, impartial objective inclusivity is the principle that Egypt always supports regarding the participation of all observer states in the work of the CD including the Delegation of the State of Palestine. Welook forward for inclusivity, impartiality and objectivity in this regard. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank my Distinguished Friend from Egypt for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Delegationfrom Saudi Arabia. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Given that this is our 1st statement, we would like to congratulate you on presiding the 1st session of our conferencefor 2024. You can rely on our full support and we are confident that you will succeed in this task. We also thank you for endorsing the request for participation as observers for this conferenceand I thank all countries for their constructive cooperation. Mr. President, my country meets the opinion of other countries that are interested in the work of the CD. This is the sole multilateralnegotiating forum in the field of this argument. We need to double our efforts in order to achieve a balanced and comprehensive program of work that meets all the aspirations of the MemberStates in addition to all our important contributions in the field of this argument. Mr. President, my country aligns itself with the statements of our groups and we support the request ofthe State of Palestine to be present at the CD as an observer. The State of Palestine, an observer of the United Nations, has also the right to join many international mechanismsnamely when it comes to protecting basic freedoms, human dignity, human rights and this argument is at the helm of such rights. It is important to hear the voice of the State of Palestinein this important forum. We look forward to more contributions from our part in the works of the CD namely with regards to the work planned and scheduled for the current year. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Saudi Arabia for his remarks and give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegate of Algeria. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like at the outset to reiterate our thanks and appreciation for your efforts whenit comes to facilitating the work of the CD, namely the progress achieved at the level of reaching decisions regarding the observers at the CD. We would like also to congratulate andwelcome the participation of the whole EC as an observer in our work for our session for2024. However, on the other hand, we deeply regret that the State of Palestine did not see its application or request granted as an observer for political consideration that are not clearly based on therules of procedure of the CD. Thank you, Mr. President. Distinguished Delegate of Algeria forhis remarks and for the kind words addressed to the Chair. I now give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United States of America. The floor is yours, Your Excellency.Thank you, Chair. I will try to be brief. I will not repeat the reasoning that I iterated last week with respect to our views, our legal views on the status of Palestine as a state. I would simply liketo state for the record that the United States does recognize the Holy See as a sovereign state and that explains the difference in our voting between those two entities. Thank you. I thank His Excellency,the Ambassador of America for the United States of America for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. You have the floor, sir.Thank you, Mr. President. My Delegation would like to join the previous speakers in expressing its regret that the request from the state of Palestine has been rejected due to political consideration. We acknowledge the legal status of the state of Palestine eligible to request and participatein the work of the city. My Delegation reiterates its position of opposing politicization and double standard in the work of the city. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate ofthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea for his remarks. Excellencies, Distinguished Colleagues,I would now like to propose that we use our remaining time today to carry out an initial exchange of viewson a possible program of work for the 2024 session. I would like to have an open discussion and hear views on this matter. Before giving the floor to Delegations that wish to discuss this topic,I propose to adjourn the meeting and proceed with our discussion in an informal setting for Member States only. For technical reasons, Conference Officers will require some time to make the necessary arrangement.I ask for your indulgence and patience. Would you like the floor immediately? The Distinguished Ambassador, His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United Kingdom has sought the floor. You have the floor, YourExcellency. Thank you, Mr. President. Apologies for interrupting you, but I wanted to ask for some clarification on your proposed way forward. You say that you want to proceed in an informal setting for Member States only. It has been the longstanding practice of this conference that states whom wehave invited to participate in the work of this conference also be included in informal settings.Can you clarify your intentions on that, please? Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. I have adecision of the conference taken at the 633rd Plenary meeting on 22nd August, 1991, before me, which hasguided my statement. However, if it is acceptable to all, I propose to give the floor to the Secretariat for a clarification on the procedural aspects of this matter. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President.On the matter of participation of nonmembers of the conference and its work, as the president just mentioned at the 633rd Plenary meeting on 22nd August, 1991, the president of the conference read out thefollowing presidential statement which was agreed during the informal open-ended consultations on the improved and effective functioning of the conference on disarmament in document CD/WP.410. The relevantpart read, I quote, in connection with rules 34 and 35 of the rules of procedure would deal specifically with invitations to states not members to participate in the work of the conference. It is the sense of the conference that the Secretariat shall adopt the following, the current practice as follows:Nonmember states invited by the conference to participate in its work may unless decided otherwise by the conference participate in formal Plenary meetings, informal Plenary meetings on substantive items of the conference and meetings of subsidiary bodies established in accordance with rule 23 withouthaving to specify in advance which ones, end quote. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. You have the floor, Your Excellency from the Ambassador of the United Kingdom. Thank you, Mr. President. Let methank the secretary for his explanation. That tallies with my Delegation's understanding of the situation as well, in which case are you asking the conference to decide otherwise, i.e., to exclude nonmemberstates from the following informal session? And if so, can my Delegation ask why that proposal is beingmade? Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. It is, I believe, a question of interpretation of what constitutessubstantive work on an agenda item or not. In this, I'm guided by what has been past practice on thismatter. And that is how I had proposed to proceed. If the conference would like to guide or advise meotherwise, if that is the view of the conference, as I said, the role of the president is simply to reflectthe wishes of the conference, then I'm happy to do so. But it is my understanding that this is the practicethat has been established or has been followed in the recent past. Yes, Your Excellency from the United Kingdom, you have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. We are, of course, in your hands. It has been my experiencein the conference that we have not excluded non-Member States from these sorts of discussions in the past.Perhaps through you, I could ask whether any Delegation has any objection to non-Member States participating in the informal discussion to follow. My Delegation certainly wouldn't. Thank you. Thank you, YourExcellency. I address the question of His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United Kingdom, to the floor.I see I see that Canada and the Russian Federation in that order have sought the floor. I give the floorto my Distinguished Colleague from Canada. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President.We would agree with the proposal made by the United Kingdom. We have heard a lot of references to inclusivity and from our Delegation's point of view, we do not see a reason why we would need toexclude observers given that we just have now included a certain number of observers and ask them to participate in our work. So we would fully endorse that they be invited to participate in thesediscussions. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Canada for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from the Russian Federation. You have thefloor, sir. Thank you, President, and good morning, colleagues. I would like to take the floor on theissue that is under discussion. Our Delegation considers that here we are considering the examinationof documents and the possibility of taking a decision on those documents. So we are talking about the process by which traditionally we would adopt decisions without observers participating. And asfar as I recall, the meetings of 2022 when we were discussing the outcome document of the conference,the report of the conference, that was the case and Delegations did not object to our proposal that we excluded the possibility of observers discussing and taking decisions on the finaldocument, the outcome document. So I don't see how that situation is different from the situation today. So how today's situation is different from the situation at the end of the session in 2022.It is our view that discussions and in particular informal discussions on potential draft program ofwork of the conference should be participated in by Member States of the conference and if it is then submitted to the open plenary session, then observer states will be able to make their comments andtake part in the discussions if they so desire. So for today's consultations, we believe we should have the meeting without the participation of observers. And the last point, we consider thatthe US was not correct in linking the decision taken at the last meeting on the participation or not of some observers with the questions that we are discussing now. We consider that it is not correctto link these issues. We are discussing now a question which is not related in any way to the subject being discussed by the conference at the last meeting. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate ofthe Russian Federation for his remarks. I now give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador ofSwitzerland. You have the floor, Your Excellency. Mr. President, for our Delegation, it is an issue oftransparency and inclusivity as the General Assembly requested us to do. We should accept observer states and their participation in our debates as often as possible. So our preference is as follows:That we accept observers' participation in our debates and in all of our discussions today in particular. We see an inherent contradiction in the fact of accepting their participation this week andthen at the very 1st opportunity leaving them out of our discussions and deliberations. Thank you. Ithank His Excellency, the Ambassador of Switzerland, for his remarks. I see no other Delegation requestingthe floor. Thank you, Distinguished Colleagues. There is obviously no consensus on the presence ofobservers during an informal setting. I see that His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United Kingdomhas sought the floor. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Sorry again for interrupting your flow. But my understanding of the decision that the Conference reached in 1991 was that if the Conference decided otherwise unless the Conference decided otherwise, nonmember states would be assumed to beable to participate in informal sessions. That to my Delegation at least suggests that we would need a consensus decision to exclude them. But can you perhaps clarify what your understanding of thatdecision is? Thank you. I see that the Russian Federation has sought the floor. I give the floorto the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation. You have the floor, sir. President,I ask for the floor for a 2nd time to explain the position of our Delegation again. Our Delegation completely agrees with what you said, that it is a question of the interpretation of the decision of1991. We believe that the interpretation here is not necessary when we are talking about states whichhave received observer status and their right to discuss substantive issues. I would say again thattoday we are not having consultations on substantive matters under the agenda. What we are to discuss today is to discuss the document submitted by you that we are to examine as a potential program of work.We do not see any need to have observer states participating in this process, especially as, as I have already said, such a practice has not existed up until now. Nonmember states at a conferencewhich are observers have not taken part in preparing documents and in taking decisions potentially on any such documents. Of course, we fully support the position of our Distinguished Colleague from theUnited Kingdom that when there are substantive issues being discussed, of course, the Delegations from those states which have received observer status would have the right to participate in those meetingswhenever we are discussing substantive matters. There is no interpretation, no other interpretation possible of that and I completely agree with what was said on that particular matter. I would repeatthat today we are not talking about discussions on substantive matters. We are talking about technical issues, how we are going to structure our work. They are matters of procedure and such procedural questions are not substantively fleshed out yet. When we are looking at the language ofdocuments and not specific items under the agenda, it is a different issue. So I consider that it would be sensible to follow the decision of 1991 and to start our informal consultations without the participationof observers. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation for his remarks.I see that Mexico has sought the floor. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President.At the outset, I would like to thank you for all of your efforts to carry out your work as president. We understand the difficulties that you are facing and Mexico would like to help you in the best possiblemanner. We have listened to the positions of the UK, Canada, the Russian Federation and other countries.And obviously what we are beginning to see is that we are seeing different controversies in our discussion and the differences between a substantive and procedural debate here in the CD. Now, other internationalfour have a way to determine the nature of the discussion in line with different characteristics.But the CD on the basis of the way it takes decision does not have such a possibility. Now,there is a clear message that is seen in the decision is trying to ensure the involvement of nonmemberstates. And in this respect, I think that the one way to interpret the essence of the 1991 decisionshould be the practice that we had after that in connection with such decisions. There is no doubt that in the discussions, the decision on the work of the conference related to the program of work,what happened before, most cases that none observer countries were allowed to participatewithout any review by the conference. And we have accepted their participation except in cases whenthere were objections. So we should look at this work not simply as an adoption of the program work butrather as a substantive review on issues of substance that Member States and nonmember states may consideras priorities for negotiations here during the CDE session. In this respect, from the point of view of my Delegation, this cannot simply be seen as a procedural issue, but it is indeed related toquestions of substance. This is why my Delegation would like to kindly request the Delegation of the Russian Federation that we move forward with our informal discussions with the inclusion ofnonmember states. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Mexico for his remarks and give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Canada. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President,including for your patience in giving us the floor for a 2nd time. But we would indeed endorse what Mexico just said. I think we all agreed in this room that observers should participate in the substantivediscussions, but there is nothing in the text that has been read that says that observers must be excluded from procedural discussions if we were to agree that these are procedural discussions, which as Mexicopointed out isn't absolutely clear from the beginning. But the way we see it is there are no reasonsthat have been made explicit in terms of having to exclude observers. They need not be excluded and in the sense of inclusiveness and transparency as has been often repeated today, we suggest that we arenot in a position where we have to interpret the text that has been read as an obligation to exclude the observers. We should therefore include them in our discussions. Thank you very much, Mr. President.I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Canada for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, President. I wish to notethat our Delegation is ready to immediately move to discussing the document that you presented to us and to discuss the formulations in it, but I would repeat again that now we are talking about working on adocument, so drafting of a document, exchanging views on a document which would be adopted by state parties, so the Member States and not observers. I agree that the opinion of observers on many mattersin the conference, in particular on substantive matters, is important, is really valuable in many cases, but we are going to be focusing on a document, drafting a document, and that is completely up tothe Member States, to their conscience, to their responsibility. If we now start to discuss this in an enlarged group, we don't really understand then what is the composition of the conference. At theend of the day, it would be a meeting of Member States plus or we agree on an enlarged composition adding in another 21 states, so we wouldn't be 65 states but would be 86 states having the right todraft documents and to influence decisions. I would repeat again that observers will have several opportunities to take part in discussions on any potential programme of work once we move to thepoint of having it discussed in an open plenary formal meeting and we cannot avoid discussions on this matter in official formal meetings. Those will happen, so we don't see why it would be expedientfor observer states to take part in this process at this point. We are not talking about inclusivity and multilateralism. That's not an issue. I don't really understand what is being said here. If we saythat observer states will not be taking part in an informal meeting today, I don't really understand how it would be violating those principles. On the contrary, I believe that if we can as 65 Member States work intensively, fruitfully on a document and come up with consensus wording, we would then beable to submit such a document to the broader group in a formal meeting that would be much more productive and that would be much more in favour of the principles of inclusivity and multilateralismthan us having 86 states discussing the drafting of a document together. So I just think that it would be more effective for us to work on the document as Member States and our Delegationis really looking at what is expedient, what would be effective in our work that we intend to carry out today. Once again, as I conclude, I would repeat that our Delegation is ready to straight away movein the next 30 seconds to move to discuss the document which was submitted to us in an informal setting without the participation of observers. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the RussianFederation for his remarks. I have before me the requests of Ireland and their excellencies, the ambassadors of France, the United States and of Germany for the floor. Before I give the floorto them, I would like to say that the CD is a unique institution in which the President does not havethe powers to adjudicate or to arrive at a ruling. The President only articulates the consensus decision of the Conference, the consensus understanding of the Conference and consensus means that everyoneagrees there is a disagreement. I can propose in my personal capacity that I will extensively briefall observer Member States about the proceedings of what transpires in the proposed informal sessionif that proceeds and I request that this be considered as a basis for compromise. All Delegations have raised very important points and I take to heart and I'm sure other members of the Conference do the verysubstantive issues that have been discussed. I will, of course, give the floor and I'm bound to by the rules of procedure to those who have sought the floor but I would request their excellencies and mydistinguished colleague from Ireland to keep what I have just said in mind and proceed with thediscussion in an informal setting on the program of work as I had proposed at the beginning of this session. Thank you. The Distinguished Delegate of Ireland has sought the floor. You have the floor,sir. Thank you, Mr. President. It is a unique institution and you are in a unique position and thank you for all your efforts so far. You don't have long to go but I know it will be intense untilthe end of it. Taking in the spirit of what you said but I do want to I think there is important points here, agree with the comments made by the colleagues from the UK, Canada and Switzerland and also believe the understanding offered by Mexico is completely correct in terms of mapping out the situation wefind ourselves in. The principle of inclusivity is paramount here and I think as our colleagues from the UK had mentioned we are at risk of inverting that decision on the understanding as I believethe Member States here are seeing it and are putting forward to you. On your latest proposal, I have no doubt on the quality of your briefings and we have seen them and we have appreciated them but I dothink that is a suboptimal outcome and not one which we would like to see. So while we understand what you are attempting, I think more fundamentally is keeping to the spirit of how we understand thedecision and how we ensure the effectiveness of the CD and operating in an inclusive manner. Thank you.I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Ireland for his remarks and for the kind words addressed to theChair. I give the floor to Her Excellency, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation. Can I requestthere are no points of order in the CD, however, if you insist. All right. Okay. Please. The Russian Federation has the floor. Ambassador, may I request your forbearance. Let me hear out what the RussianFederation has to say. I do apologize, President. There was a problem with the interpretation. I didn'thear what your patience for a minute. In English, I say that I may have a solution. Therefore, I wouldlike to speak 1st . Please. You have the floor, Your Excellency, succeeded immediately by the Russian Federation. Thank you, Madam. Thank you very much, President. Do you now have interpretation? Yes,the microphone is on, so you do have interpretation now. Thank you. Perhaps there might be a solutionso that we can overcome these difficulties. Indeed, President, you have proposed to us that we have an initial exchange of views on a potential program of work. And I have heard many Delegations, includingthe Russian Federation, saying that they are prepared to discuss the substantive program of work immediately. So I would suggest, President, that we move to a formal meeting which would allow us to overcomethese difficulties. Many Delegations at the start of the session insisted on inclusivity. We also wish to see this body being fully inclusive. So in a formal meeting, we could immediately moveto do what you have suggested, which is to have an initial exchange of views on a potential program ofwork. Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation followed bythe United States of America. President, I see that we are thinking along the same lines now. In mystatement, I also wanted to make the point that we start to work on this document which was submitted by you in an official formal setting. So that's what I wanted to say in my point of order. Sothat would help us to overcome the problem that has emerged. The Russian Federation hasthings to say. We are prepared to say these formally in an official meeting. We have proposals on the program of work. And we would be happy with either format. But we only have about half an hour left of our meeting. So I don't think we will really be able to carry out all of the work that you had hopedthat we would carry out and that we would like to carry out in just a half hour meeting. And the timelimits, time constraints are an important argument for us to say that perhaps observer states would nottake part in informal consultations because of the time constraints. So if we need to listen to all states, we would need much more than half an hour. So we would suggest that we move our discussionsto Thursday and have them in the formal official meeting. I think that would suit everyone. Thank you. I thank the Her Excellency the Ambassador of France and the Distinguished Delegate of the RussianFederation for their remarks. And I do believe that this is a way forward. I now apologize to His Excellency the Ambassador of the United States for not having given the floor to him earlier. The flooris yours, Your Excellency. Thank you, Chair. I understand that there are no specific rules of procedure and points of order in the Conference on Disarmament. Nonetheless, I'm a little amazed that our Russiancolleague gets to speak any time that he wants and the rest of us are asked to wait, especially when this is the one Delegation that is blocking basically trying to invert the practice of the past andcreating new obstacles to consensus that did not exist before. However, all that said, I actually I support the French Ambassador's suggestion that we have an initial view on the program of work. OurRussian colleague keeps referring to a document which has yet to be circulated to this body, let alonethe observers. So it is rather difficult to have an initial exchange of views on a document which officially does not exist. But that said, we would look forward to such a discussion before we startdrafting on a document and a decision. Thank you. I thank you, Your Excellency, once again for your forbearance. And I believe that the contours of a solution are emerging and I will try and articulatethat solution before I close discussions on this matter. His Excellency, the Ambassador of Germany, you have the floor, sir. I can be extremely brief after having heard the proposal putforward by the Distinguished Ambassador of France which I think is a solution to our problems and the way forward. As far as my Delegation is concerned, I have made always clear that we advocate for aninclusive Conference of Disarmament. So this is not a secret body. We have seen ongoing procedural struggleon the decision on the observer candidates. Now we have a procedural struggle on the status of the observer candidates. So I think this bickering over procedural questions is just one purpose that makes us losetime and I think we have work before us and we should immediately start with our exchange on the proposalput forward by you. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you, Your Excellency, for your remarks. Thankyou, Excellencies and Distinguished Colleagues. I propose that we use the remaining time to carry out an initial exchange of views on a program of work for the 2024 session. I would like to have an opendiscussion and hear views on this matter. Before giving the floor to Delegations that wish to speakon this topic, I would like to say that time is indeed short and we will continue with these discussionson in a formal setting at the next plenary which will be on Thursday, 8 February, 2023 at 10:00 a.m.I had proposed to have a dedicated session on a program of work as we had dedicated sessions onthe issue of participation of states non-member. I would like to hear and I believe the conference wouldlike to hear the views of Member States on the issue of the program of work on my view articulatedduring consultations and during informal meetings that the way forward that this presidency wouldlike to propose is based on the 2022 program of work with minimal changes. I have been consultinginformally, bilaterally and in group settings on a number of ideas that I have had about compromiselanguage. Most of you are aware, if not all of you are aware of this language. I would like to hearyour views on whether this constitutes a way forward or not. Let me articulate again what I am trying tosay so that there is no misunderstanding. It is my view that the best way forward would be the 2022program of work with minimal changes. At this stage, I would like to hear your reactions and any specificlanguage that might constitute these minimal changes to the accepted to the 2022 program of work. I wouldalso like to inform the conference that I am that the presidency collectively is trying to find agreementon the issue of subsidiary bodies, particularly on the identities of the coordinators and on the number of days that the subsidiary bodies could meet should a program of work be adopted. Having said that, I nowgive the floor to the Russian Federation and any other Delegation that would like to speak. I seethat Egypt followed by Iran have sought the floor. Okay. The Russian Federation has the floor.Thank you very much, President. Of course, I will share with you our considerations about a potential program of work or rather about a possible decision on how to organize the work of the conference duringthe 2024 session. But I would like to still clarify, we are in a bit of an unusual situation here. Wekind of understand what we want to talk about and I was quite clear about in my mind about the document and the proposals that were made by you on the basis of which we held bilateral and multilateralconsultations, something that we would like to discuss right now. Now, the Distinguished Colleague from the United States says that we do not have any document. We do not have any proposals. We have nothing to discuss. But you just said yourself, Mr. President, there were proposals and as far as Irecall, there were at least three proposals, different proposals. So we are somewhat confused right now. If you would like to hear our views about the program of work right now, well, our views are very simple. Theprogram of work of the CD should be fully in line with the mandate. That mandate is about negotiations. Then the program of work should be connected to a process of negotiations on legally binding documentsthat the CD must not only consider but also work on them to propose that for the adoption by the international community. Now, about the decision from 2022, it is not fully in line with the position ofthe Russian Federation that I just expressed. And we have some additions that we would like to make to that proposals. We have some comments. So if we are ready right now to discuss the 2022 document, thenwe are ready to do that. Now, if we now are going to discuss some proposals that were made by you, President, proposals on this text, that will be something completely different. So we are not veryclear. We still feel that we are in this unusual situation. And I think that a serious discussioncan be held only after we when we clarify this point to begin a serious consideration of the potential program of work during our next session. We will hardly be able to achieve anything in the remaining15 minutes. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation for his remarks.Before I give the floor to my old and distinguished friend from Egypt, I would like to say that I havesaid that it is my understanding that this presidency would like to proceed on the basis of the 2022program of work with minimal changes. If Delegations would like to propose additional language in respect of those of what constitutes what could constitute those minimal changes, I would like them to statethose formulations or proposals that they might have. I now give the floor to my old and distinguished friend from Egypt. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. The Delegation of Egypt would liketo thank you for the professional and transparent manner you have been stating our work, both procedurally and substantively. Being previously in the very same position one year ago, we fully can understand thelevel of challenge trying to forge an aspired consensus amid challenging tense and international security environment. Nevertheless, let us all recall that our guiding document, our constitution,the SSOD 1 negotiated and adopted at the moment of binary extreme polarization during the Cold War.During this moment of tension, we need most to exercise and at most ration in real spirit of compromise to preserve our platform of engagement, the CD. The CD is of no exception. Egypt stronglybelieves in its mandated role of this body, the negotiating mandate. On another hand, this body plays an indirect role in addressing as well as mitigating many of the global strategic challengesby bringing everyone under one roof. Having said that, Mr. Chair, let me assure you the best fair agreed draft is the one that should make everyone equally unhappy. Your approach based on previously consensuallanguage that responds in a balanced manner to extreme asymmetrical concerns is commendable. Egypt supports your approach. The conference should be able to take stock of its previous success, build andproceed forward. The CD needs to attain a minimum level of continuity in its work. Consensus and compromise should guide our work at this stage. Mr. Chair, it is out of consistency during our thepresence of Egypt last year, we have presented a very similar approach and we have wished it could have been adopted. That's why in the same of the consistent Egyptian approach towards the CD, we fully support this approach taking stock of previously agreed language in a very balanced manner. It isin our position is very rational. It is a clear reflection of what we say inside and outside of the room of the need to preserve this body and the need to keep it forward. In order to preserve it, we needaction. It can be only words. This action cannot be received except in the level of compromise and consensus achieved. Having agreed on something should be not surprising to agree on it later on.Having said that, Mr. Chair, we will not take much more than this, but this is the spirit we look forward to see in the room. Thank you. I thank my old and distinguished friend from Egypt for his remarks. Inow give the floor to my distinguished colleague from Iran. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me also join what has been said by my distinguished colleague from Egypt in thanking youand commending your all efforts you have made in a very professional and transparent manner will advance even before the start of the year 2024 in order to give a clear picture to all members of the Conferenceon Disarmaments what is ahead of us and what your method of work would be. We thank you and appreciate your work. We all have a clear and common understanding that the Conference on Disarmaments is the singlemultilateral Disarmament negotiating from that established under SSOD 1. Our main concern is to keep this mandate of the Conference on Disarmament. The 2022 decisions on the work of the Conferenceon Disarmament has been achieved through the same professionalism that you have made. We arrivedto the text that all of us agree to be a basis for our work during 2022. We share your views that thebest way to take forward is the text that has been accepted in 2022 and we fully support your way and we as for us Iran concerned my Delegation will exercise the maximum flexibility and compromise in order toadvance our work towards the fulfilling the mandate of the Conference on Disarmaments. We fully supportyour way and your method in this way. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegates ofEgypt and of Iran for the kind words addressed to the Chair. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Iran for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Pakistan. You have thefloor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. At the outset let me 1st state that when we came to this meetingwe came prepared to participate in the discussions on the program of work and in our understanding as wellwhen you convened the meeting we have been under the impression that you want to get priorities for the program of work for this year. We do not share the assessment. We may not share the assessment atthis stage that the program of work that we will adopt will look like 2022 decision and some changes.However, at the outset we would like to share our priorities with this body through you. We are prepared to do that in a formal Plenary meeting. We are prepared to do that in an informal Plenary meeting. And for this I have some remarks as well that I would like to share with this conference andthrough you. And I don't know if we have sufficient time but if you permit me then I would be very happy to share those remarks right now. There are no time limits on interventions in the CD. My friendfrom Pakistan, you have the floor. Please continue. We appreciate the outreach and consultations that you have undertaken on this issue including in the regional groups in the past few days to discussseveral ideas that we have heard. As you would recall from the general statements that have been delivered in this body over the past two weeks almost all members of the conference have drawn attentionto the complex international security landscape and its challenges. Rather than inaction, the situation adds to the urgency for this body to do its part. Our endeavors should be a pursuit of genuinemultilateralism while fully taking into account the contemporary realities of international security landscape in all its dimensions. This would entail advancing the notion of security that is responsiveto the interest of all states, fully taking into account the legitimate security concerns of each and every member that is by truly practicing the principle of undiminished and equal security for all. Mostimportantly, we should aim to adopt a balanced and comprehensive program of work as a means and a basis towards fulfillment of this body's mandate. Mr. President, our Delegation clearly articulated itsviews in our previous general statement on what and as to how the CD should proceed this year. The realityas also attested by the conference records is that there is currently no consensus to commence negotiations on any agenda item. We have also increasingly witnessed disagreements impactingthe process and procedure of conducting our work. Our challenges in the CD remain a function of the policies, actions and developments pursued by its members both inside and outside these conferencehalls. While the CD must contend with the reverberations of these realities, it certainly does not mean that the conference should not undertake any work. In our view, the CD should continue to resume substantivework on all its agenda items. In doing so, we must take into account what has worked, what has not,and also recognize what the needs of today are. It is equally important to avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary or subjective approaches. We must also not let the perfect become an enemy of good. It is inthis spirit that my Delegation considers the 2022 decision as the most practical least common denominator to build on. In 2022, we were able to adopt reports of two out of five subsidiary bodies. Lack ofconsensus in other subsidiary bodies was not because of shortcomings in the mandate laid out in the 2022 decision. In fact, larger geopolitics and the ever persistent differences in approaches under thoseagenda items inhibited progress. Mr. President, we also agree with those who argue that 2022 decision was adopted in a certain context, and that context was the culmination of intensive efforts that hadspanned over several years. After 2018, various iterations were tried to come up with a working model in the CD under respective CD presidencies. It was only in 2022 under the Chinese presidencywhen we were able to unlock that compromise which enabled us to undertake intensive work in subsidiary bodies. In the absence of any major changes in the positions of key players, we must avoid reinventingthe wheel. Instead of undertaking another drafting exercise on the positions which are well known and well entrenched, we should simply adopt the 2022 decision as it is and save ourselves the precioustime. It would be important to commence our work in the subsidiary bodies sooner than later to give ourselves sufficient time. Mr. President, lastly, I would also share the perspective of the membersthat the ultimate objective of the substantive work in this body should be to develop and reach understandings that can eventually pave the way for negotiations, especially with the view to fulfillingthis body's that is nuclear disarmament. I wish to take this opportunity to also echo the call made by many members over the past two weeks in their general statements regarding the salience and significanceof negative security assurances as the 1st step on this pathway. We also support the proposal of establishing an ad hoc committee on NSAs as the most practical step forward to enable this body infulfilling that mandate. Our discussions in 2022 on NSAs revealed that there is no fundamental obstacle to or insurmountable difficulty in pursuing outcome oriented work in this crucial area. Neither have weheard from any member as to how meaningful progress in this area leading to formalization of NSA commitments into a legally binding instrument undermines the core national security interest of any state. Mr.President, an objective assessment makes it abundantly clear that of the topic of NSAs as a low hanging fruit represents the most realistic option for progress at this body in short to medium term. Atthe same time an opportunity to tangibly respond to the increasing dangers of the complex international security situation. My Delegation will continue to engage with you and other members of this body in a constructive and pragmatic spirit to resume substantive work on all agenda items in a comprehensiveand balanced manner. I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Pakistan for his remarks. I now give the floor to his Excellency the Ambassador of the United States of America followed by Nigeriaand Mexico in that order. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with much of what has just been said and I appreciate the remarks of our Pakistani colleague. We too like Russia, like Pakistan, like others wouldlike to be a little bit more ambitious this year and we have already outlined some of the things that we would be willing to look into. We are prepared to engage on a number of these issues. But I also want to be practical. My understanding is we are going to have a meeting on Thursday which will be informalplenary session to discuss the program of work or the decision on work. I think it would be useful to have at least for this one initial meeting understanding that negotiations on the margins,consultations, I don't want to impinge on your prerogatives in any way. But I think it would be useful to have a discussion of a text which you have described as 2022 plus something. And let's seewhat that text consists of now. Let's see how Delegations react to that and let's see if that will provide a means to conclude this exercise and agree on a decision on a program of work.Thank you. I thank your excellency. I now give the floor to my distinguished friend from Nigeria. You have the floor, sir. Thank you for giving Nigeria the floor, Mr. President. At the outset allow meto commend you on your spirited efforts to lead the work of the city since your assumption of its roleof the 1st presidency of the 2024 session. Cognizant that your tenure as president of the city this year is nearing a conclusion, my Delegation wishes to place on record profound appreciation forthe inclusive and transparent approach you have adopted so far to assist our deliberations this year, particularly the long-standing issue of the observers' participation in our work. On thisscore, I assure you of the support of my Delegation as we continue to work towards achieving concrete outcomes. Mr. President, adopting a program of work for the city remains a fundamental principlethat ultimately determines the tenor of the year's deliberations. This critical aspect remains one of the most challenging tasks encountered under the 1st presidency of the year. I believe the EgyptianDelegation can confirm this. In this context, my Delegation welcomes your decision to avoid the usually lengthy discussions on what could be the most suitable course of action on the adoptionof a substantive program of work for the city. Your approach to adopt the consensus-based proposal introduced by the People's Republic of China during the 1st presidency of the 2022 session of the cityis indeed a milestone that best suits this purpose, given the circumstances, of course. While it may notbe the most ideal, the Chinese proposal has provided the city with a glimpse into what might be achievable in the spirit of multilateralism. Indeed, the creation of five subsidiary bodies promoted substantivediscussions in the city in 2022, albeit with minimal progress considering that only one subsidiary body report was adopted. On this note, my Delegation wishes to also place on record that in an ideal scenario,we would have preferred a situation where the city would not apply the same strategy adopted in 2022 and hope for different results. We are, however, flexible and willing to compromise in the spiritof multilateralism. Indeed, your proposed language in addition to the program of work adopted in 2022 reflects a commitment to ensure that discussions in the respective subsidiary bodies are held in acomprehensive and balanced manner, while also promoting accountability amongst Member States.We are also of the view that inclusion of a legally binding perspective where appropriate is a unique opportunity for inclusive discussions, particularly as it concerns non-nuclear weapon statesin the context of nuclear disarmament. In conclusion, Mr. President, as a non-nuclear weapon state, my Delegation welcomes considerations for legal instruments to be negotiated, particularly onNSAs and against the production of material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.This is with a view to promote accountability in the absence of nuclear disarmament, while also ushering this forum into an era of tangible progress through the respective subsidiary bodies. You have our support.I thank my Distinguished Colleague from Nigeria for his remarks and for the kind words addressed to the Chair. The last speaker on today's list is Mexico. The interpreters have kindly given us a few extra minutes. Thank you for that, interpreters. Mexico, the floor is yours. Thank you very much,President. Well, you said there are no limits in terms of time on statements in the CD, but we do have some technical restrictions. I'll try to be brief. First, I would like to thank you for the transparentway in which you have been conducting your work. And we really praise the way you have been handling these issues. We believe that in the regional consultations we expressed the skepticism ofMexico has connection with this format, but I will not go into any explanations of that. But ifthe CD is to make a true analysis of the documents that is in front of you, theprogram of work then as was said by the Russian Delegation is something that we shares. The decision of 2022, I think we should think about that. And we have to remember what took place in 2022 and theresults that were achieved, but it is also important to look at the context, both institutional and substantive, e.g. . And this is just one example. Now, on space security, we are in thecontext where we have a GGE. We have two mandates that were extended to open ended working groupsto discuss issues of space security. That did not exist in 2022, but it exists today. So this is indeed something that requires the thinking of the CD. If we are to create a subsidiary body, how will itinteract with the other groups? And what are the differences? What is the value added in comparison to other groups? And the same applies on other issues. Now, on another issue that my Delegationbelieves where we had over the last 12 months some substantive discussions relates to the mantra process, how to improve the work of the CD. And one of those aspects is, I believe without doubt,something that we all recognize on the need to better integrate the work of the CD with other bodies,especially those that are working under mandates of the UN General Assembly. Wecan have a list of all the resolutions of the UNGA and all the discussions and we don't take that into account. Well, that would be a bit unusual. So we have to look at how to better integrate allof that. And this is why my Delegation was a bit skeptical. So I do hope that what I just saidis something that will contribute to the substantive work. And I think that we should add Paragraph 4.Should substantially analyze and advance the mandates of the UNGA resolutions which explicitly call for specific tasks from the Conference on Disarmament. I think that this is something that will give usbetter substantive clarity related to work of others without having a direct implication on what we do. But this is simply taking into account what others are doing. And we will see that the differences arebetween the work of the different groups. But if those mandates exist and we can perhaps integratethat work into what we are doing here, we believe that this could be a step forward to the implementation of the mandate that this Conference has. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Mexico for his remarks and for the kind words addressed to the Chair. May I request you to send us your proposalin writing so that we can reflect upon it. Thank you. Thank you very much. The last speaker on today's list is Her Excellency the Ambassador of France. Does anyone else want to take the floor? We have the limitations of the interpreters' indulgence towards us. I see no other requests. Madam, you have thefloor. Thank you, President. I'll be brief. But it seems important to me to indicate what is indeed truly important in this program of work. As you know, France supports in a very constructive manner all ofyour efforts to reach an agreement on this program of work and ensure that we have substantive progress here in the CDE in line with the work that has already been carried out here. This is why we shouldtry to use in the best possible way the preparatory work to work when the context permits to work towards a negotiation of legally binding instruments and disarmament. As many other speakers have said,France supports the establishment of subsidiary bodies through the identification of areas where we can achieve progress. In this respect, we fully support the beginning without delay, the beginning ofnegotiations on a treaty related to FMCT and the mandate of CD12/1999. We believe that this subject is indeed fully ripe for negotiations and will help us achieve progress in the area of disarmament byensuring quantitative limitations on production of material. The negotiations on FMCT is supported by a large group of countries and this is why it is necessary that the program of work and the subsidiarybodies reflect that priority. Secondly, the question of outer space also requires that we continue our dialogue between all identified stakeholders to see what are the most relevant measures that can preventexisting threats in line with the agreements that already exist today in the GGE and the agreements that will be achieved during the work of the two other GGEs that have obtained a mandate from the GeneralAssembly. We have to have a flexible mandate that will not prejudge the results achieved by others.France will also be very constructive in connection with work that will be carried out in any other subsidiary body or committee that will be established by the CDE as part of a balanced program of work,including on radiological weapons, understanding that this is a very different type of weapon system that is different from nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. So I will shorten my remarks inorder to simply insist on the most important points. Thank you. I thank Her Excellency the AmbassadorFrance for her remarks. We have come to the last speaker of this session. Permit me a few reflectionson what has transpired today and on the way forward. It is thank you firstly for the verytransparent manner in which the Delegations that took the floor shared their views and their proposals.I think these were very constructive contributions which in a formal setting which give us and whichgive the Conference an idea of the priorities that many members would like to find reflected in theprogram of work. Now, it is my prerogative, it is what I feel as the Chair, to propose a draft programof work. Whether I choose to do so formally or informally remains a prerogative of the Chair. Whether you choose to consider it formally or informally is the prerogative of the Conference.The informal proposals have an established role and the process of informal consideration of theseinformal proposals have an established role in multilateral practice. I propose to continueto continue with those informal consultations and see how this draft emerges. Of course, it is the prerogative of the Member States at any time to discuss this or to seek a discussion of these in aformal setting. But the point that I would like to make is that informal discussions of informal proposals are established practice in the multilateral system. It is not my understanding that the Conferenceon Disarmament has a carve out in that respect. So what I will do now as Chair is I will move forward with those informal consultations on ideas that have been articulated either formally or informallyin plenary or in consultations conducted in accordance with the rules and with establishedpractice. I will then come to a considered assessment in my role as President and soon to be outgoingPresident of the CD whether there is scope for consensus or not. Once that draft decision is presented to the Conference, members have two options. They can either agree or they can disagree.That is where we currently are. We are that is how I in the interests of transparency and in continuationof the process of the transparent process with which we have conducted this presidency is how I intend to proceed for the next few sessions. No other Delegation has sought the floor today. I willconsult informally as to whether a formal discussion on the agenda of the work will aid the process ofarriving at a consensus on a program of work on Thursday or not. As of now, what I had said earlier which is a part of the record is that there will be a meeting on Thursday but I will review the decisionin view of what I hear during informal consultations and I will communicate to the membership whether we will have in accordance with their wishes whether they whether it will be productive to have a formaldiscussion on Thursday or not. After that, in accordance with established practice in which the CD meets only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I will basically have one more plenary, one or two moreplenaries left and I am in your hands as to whether you feel that a compromise can be arrived at onthe proposals that have on the ideas that have been circulating. Thank you very much. We have cometo the end of our meeting this morning and thank you for your constructive meeting for your constructive participation. The meeting is adjourned."}

So, I would like to assure you that the Delegationwill engage in today's interactive dialogue with opponents and frightenedness. This national report of Greece provides a concise overview of the developments and challenges our countryhas faced over the past decade. Spanning from the previous examination in 2013 to the present and the particular emphasis on actions taken in the last five years. I would like 1st toall to thank the Committee for making available to my country the simplified reporting procedure which allowed us to prepare a more focused and streamlined report. The drafting process wassignificantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been able to overcome all of us such difficulties and present the main developments in the field of gender equality and the fightagainst discrimination. Based by women and girls, comprehensively with a particular emphasis on the most recent advancements and challenges, the drafting of the report was coordinated bythe Delegation for Human Rights of the Minister of Social Cooperation and Family in close cooperation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs as well the relevant ministries and the Greek Parliament.This has involved extensive interministerial cooperation aimed at incorporating all necessary information in a coherent and consistent manner. Notably, we have actually included input fromacademia and non-governmental organization offering a more comprehensive picture of the situation of women's rights in Greece. A draft of the report was also submitted to the National Committee for Human Rights of our national human rights institution also. The commissions in scienceand comments have been considered in view of finalization of our report. Before I begin to present the main challenges and achievements in comparing discrimination against women andgirls, it is crucial to emphasize that my country prioritizes gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Although we recognize the progress may be slow, but significant effortshave been made in recent years to promote the principle of gender equality in everyday life.In this endeavor, the expertise of the Committee and the tools provided by the United Nations for addressing gender equality issues are invaluable for us. The recommendation of the Committee adopted in the context of the previous evaluation cycle have been translated and disseminated for informationand action among the relevant stakeholders. During the follow-up procedure in 2015, the General Secretariat for Gender Equality complied the information and appraised the Committee and the issuesrequested to be prioritized. Both the Committee's concluding observation and the national report have been published in the website of our Secretariat, of the General Secretariat, serving as guidelinesfor the formulation of our national gender equality policies. One of the primary challenges Greece has faced in recent years is the community impact of economic crisis, the migration crisis and the COVID-19pandemic. The economic crisis coupled with the prolonged implementation of austerity measuresnegatively affected the entire population and social and labor relation to a great extent.Women found themselves in a more precarious position, both economically and socially.This was underscored by various organs of international organization including this Committee. Furthermore, due to the economic crisis and the ensuing immigration, particularly of young and educating individuals,our country experienced a population loss of 3% from 2011 to 2016. According to the Hellenic statistical authority, the overall population in Greece is projected to increase slightly until 2050.With the elderly population expected to rise by 12% from 2011 to 2050. These figures highlight the serious demographic challenge further exaggerated in the economic crisis. After the conclusion of the economicadjustment program, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged at the beginning of 2020, causing a tremendous impact on the health and well-being of people, of employment, of the economy. The most significant challenge forour country during the pandemic was initially to curb the spread of the disease followed by addressingthe reputation on work and the economy. Excess inequalities by economic crisis create gender gaps during the pandemic, effectively affecting the female population. The primary burden of responsibilitiesrelated to caregiving for dependent family members at home fell on women. Professions that experience a great workload and stress such as healthcare, social care and education were disproportionately representedby women. Additionally, part-time and low-wage occupation primarily involved women. Moreover, during the implementation of specific measures on movement, there was a surge in incidents of violence againstwomen characterized as shadow pandemic. Data collected at the European international level suggests that the consensus of the health crisis on women were disproportionately greater than those on men.In this concept and in response to the gender inequalities by the crisis for previous year, it was decided in 2019 based on government priorities that portfolio of gender equality should be transferredto the minister of labor and social affairs. A deputy minister was appointed with specified responsibilities for these issues aiming to place greater emphasis on women participation in employmentin labor market. The component general secretariat along with its organization was placed under the minister of labor and social affairs to ensure optimal oversight and target policy planning for enhancingwomen's employment. In 2023, following the recovery from the pandemic, a new minister was established, the minister of social cohesion and family with the aim of integrating at a higher level the policies ofhuman rights of gender equality, the rights of the children and the rights of valuable social groupsin order to achieve the social cohesion. The areas of importance of the new minister also include demography and family support policies. The portfolio of gender equality was then transferred to theminister with the creation of the general secretariat for equality and human rights. The general secretariat for equality and human rights formally known as the general secretariat for democratic family policyand gender equality remains the government agency responsible for planning, implementing and monitoring policies related to gender equality across all sectors, the horizontal approach. Additionally, its mandate hasbeen expanded to include the promotion and protection of human rights. The transfer of the general secretariat to the new minister along with the human rights portfolio reflects the comprehensive approach that not only allows but also places human rights at the core of social policy and visibility. The Greekgovernment prioritizes the inclusion of visibility of girls, women and the LGBTQI community. As it is proven by the adoption, the expansion of initiatives such as a panic button, an application addressed forviolence against women from the 1st of January in 2024. Additionally, the extension of the business equality label aims increased women's participation in the labor market in the companies and entrepreneurspromote equal opportunities policies within businesses. Furthermore, the government supports the demand for marriage equality within the LGBTQI community. Gender equality policies are implementedunder the national action plan for gender equality elaborated by the general secretariat every four years. The current action plan has been drafted following extensive conclusion with public entitiesand non-governmental organizations. Its priorities are fully aligned with international standards for gender equality as defined within the framework of the United Nations and the European Union. So thenational action plan is structured around four axes, preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. The 2nd , equal participation of women in the decision making process. Third, equalparticipation of women in the labor market. And 4th , gender mainstreaming in sectoral policies. In order to be effectively coordinating and monitoring the implementation for the action plan, contact pointshave been designed by the ministers so that actions can be implemented jointly with aim of the horizontal integration of the principles of gender equality in public policies. Numerous meetings between the generalsecretariat and the ministers responsible for implementing gender equality actions are taking place during the drafting of the ministers' annual action plans. This illustrates the intercontextness of the annual actionplan with thematic actions like the national action plan on gender equality. It particularly confirms the endeavor to incorporate thematic horizontal policies such as gender equality into the initiative of everyminister, thereby of the whole government approach to gender equality. In the current action plan, as in the previous one, we focus addressing multiple discrimination. It is highly prioritized recognizing the complexity ofindividuals' experience and identities. The commitment to tackle multiple discrimination reinforces the integration of policies aimed at promoting equality across diverse aspects of public policies and publicinitiatives. Beyond the national plan for gender equality, Greece has placed emphasis in recent years in interministerial collaboration concerning gender equality and human rights coordinated at the highestgovernmental level by the general secretariat of coordination of the government at the presidency of the government. Due to the complexity of the issues and ongoing crisis in recent years, which necessitycoordinated actions and specialized multidimensional expertise on the subject, a centralized planning and monitoring of a serious horizontal action plans for human rights has been introduced. Gender perspective isinherent in these plans. So this includes the national 1st , the national action plan for persons with disabilities. This plan serves a comprehensive roadmap providing an unfied framework for the substantialprotection and further enhancement of the rights of persons with disabilities. Consolidating actions fromall relevant ministers. It underscores the state's responsibility for the wellbeing of individuals with disabilities and is being prepared with the participation of the disability movement. Second, the national actionplans for the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation. It presents the national effort to establish a society with zero tolerance for instances of sexual violence against children. It emphasizes theneed to create a cultural that prioritizes the safety of children and eradicate the sexual violence. The national strategy for equality of LGBTQI individuals. Encompassing emerging issues, this provides a set ofguidelines principles and proposals grounded in the principles of equality and the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, identity, characteristics, gender expression. In this framework we arehappy to inform the Distinguished Member of this Committee, I'm really happy for that, that the draft bill of equality in civil marriage was submitted in our Parliament last days. So establishing the Greek legal order, thesame-sex marriage aiming to achieve equality and legal protection for all families. The institutionalization of equality in marriage also extends to the equal rights of children in the same-sex couples that already exist. Thenational action plan on women, peace and security. Aligned with the United Nations Security Council agenda on women, peace and security, this plan represents the Greek government's commitment to implementing this agenda. The actionplan addresses the disproportionate impact of armed conflict on human rights and security of women and girls. It is a five-year policy document destined to enhance policy coherence and gender mainstreaming since it complies fully withthe relevant national legal and institutional framework. The action plan is regularly mainstreamed in the annual action plan of the ministers and implemented under the coordination of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in close cooperation, ofcourse, with the general Secretariat of coordination of the presidency of our government. We should emphasize that the social policies are also reflected in the national strategy for social inclusion and poverty reductions for the period of2021 until 2027. This constitutes a national strategic plan to respond to the needs of the valuable groups of the population after a difficult period of economic and health crisis. Also worth noting is that the national strategy and action plan forOMA, social inclusion for the period 2021 to 2030, one of the main pillars of the strategy is to empower women and youth throughprogram cofounded by the European Union, Council of Europe and the European Economic Area in order to achieve comprehensiveresults. For the implementation of the policies described in all these action plans and national strategies, we fully utilize the necessary sources from the state budget, from the European social fund and the resilience and recovery fund. In the Greek resilience and recoveryplan, particular investment and reforms have been devoted to social inclusion of the most valuable groups and to the digitaltransformation and social protection. These reforms will contribute significant to the promotion of gender equality. Next I would like to refer to specific actions and achievements of recent years in the context of gender equality. A significant step forward worth emphasizing is the adoption of the law for substantive gender equality in 2019. This law introduces a gender mainstreaming approach and aims to eradicate genderinequalities in both public and private spheres. Notably, the concept of gender impact assessment and gender budgeting were introduced into legislative text for the 1st time in the field of combating violence against women, a significant milestone was achieved withthe certification of the Council of Europe in 2018. In 2023, Greece submitted its 1st report to the Council of Europe and committed to implement the recommendation put forth bythe Convention Committee of experts. To protect women and girls from violence and harassment in their working environment, the ILO Convention on combating sexual harassment in the workplacewas ratified in 2021. Greece was among the 1st eight countries to endorse it in the national legislation. The funding for the networking for structural supporting women victims of gender-basedviolence has been secured. This includes 44 consulting centers, 20 shelters and a 24-hour SOS helpline. The legal aid program for victims of domestic violence continues to implementregardless of the income criteria. In 2020, I would like to underline that we emerged to the MeToo movement in Greece. A governmental specialized electronic platform was createdwith information and supporting material, sexual harassment and abuse. Since 1990, 73 domestic violence services have been established throughout the country, aiming at coordination, supervisingthe guiding policy regional services and addressing cases of gender-based violence. One of the services operated within the Hellenic police headquarters. In the field of equal participation of women in political decision-making, our country in addition to the legislative framework andestablished quotas undertake awareness raising campaigns. Moreover, throughout the gender equality observatory, it monitors electronic electoral procedures, collecting data for thecandidates. As regards the representation of Greece on boards of directors and companies, it is progressing gradually. To further improve this trend, we are currently working in thetransposition to national law of the EU directives and improving gender balance. In the field of enhancing women's participation in the labor market, notable achievements include the transpositionof the European directive on work-life balance in 2021, the ratification of the ILO convention on the right to work fee from violence and harassment and the introduction of gender equality laborfor business meeting specific criteria. Furthermore, the upgrading of the labor inspection body to an independent authority and the designation of the Greek as promoting principles of equaltreatment and in case supervisory power constitutes this milestone. In the field of gender mainstreaming, a noteworthy initiative is the implementation of the European Commission technical assistance. Project aims to introduction of gender impact assessment in the public policy and budget. Theobjective is to enhance the capacity of public administration to integrate the gender representatives into the budget. Additionally, it is important to note that there is ongoing collaboration with all ministers to enhance the integration of the gender perspective into the action ofeach one of them. Madam Chair, Distinguished Member of this Committee, against the background of recent achievements in looking towards the opportunities and challenges ahead, it isimportant to reflect lessons learned and discussed for the future of gender equality in Greece. The upcoming period will establish the strategic framework for gender equality issues both with the European Union through the creation of the new European strategy and within the contextof the platform for action. Therefore, it is crucial not only to access the implement actions but also to set the directions towards which we aim to progress with the ultimate goal ofachieving substantive gender equality. Building upon the aforementioned achievements, the government's programming for the upcoming period in gender equality encompasses the significant goal ofequal participation of women and men in the labor market. Empowering women and girls increasing their participation in STEM, professions challenging gender stereotypes and ameliorating the position of working women, raising the percentages of female representation in leading position andpromoting women's entrepreneurship remain high priority for our political agenda. In this context, a comprehensive network of policies have been developed to concretely support women. We take a grade and we are proud for that, establishing a task force for climate crisis and gender underour coordination with the support of encouragement of the Greek government, a team conversing with scientists, local government, NGOs, members of civil society and this task force is activelypreparing an action plan. This plan aims to address the significant impacts on women and contribute to achieving sustainable development goals of UN, particularly emphasize of the target 5, butnot only target 5. We want to alongside with the goal 13 on climate crisis but also in the goal 7, affordable and clean energy and goal 3 about the health and well-being. Our projectfocuses on natural disasters and extreme weather phenomena, recognizing that these events affect women more than men. This action plan is expected to be published by summer of 2024. This initiativelays the foundation of integrated roadmap guiding us in adopting policies to reduce the climate gender gap between men and women. During the four-year period from 2023 to 2027, we willbe given high line to the issue of gender-based and domestic violence in all forms along with implementation of preventive measures and support our victims. Specifically efforts will focus on upgrading and ensure the sustainability of the network of structure for women victims ofviolence. New modern diagnostic risk prevention tools are being introduced and awareness and education activities are intensified with the framework of the established Convention as well as under European law and national legislation. Simultaneously framework for the accommodationof women victims of violence and their children requiring immediate removal from their family or partner environment is being organized through an operational nationwide network of structures for women victims of violence. The functioning of the observatory for the gender equality monitoringmechanism of implementing policies at local and regional level as horizontally and sector policies for the all high risk victimization groups is strengthened. All the aforementioned initiatives are expected to significantly contribute to enhancing the protection of victims of gender-basedand domestic violence. And I would like to conclude, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to provide us engage in the constructive and frank dialogue. I want to assure you that your experience and guidelines will serve us the compass for shaping our national policieson gender equality and human rights and empowering women and girls in my country. Thank you, Madam. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the head of Delegation for her very comprehensive introductorystatement. Ms. Maria Gavuneli, President of the Greek National Commission for Human Rights will now address the Committee for 5 min . Thank you very much, Madam. It is really a pleasureand an honor to address the Committee again today after the short exchange that we had yesterday. I would not repeat my statement of yesterday, but I would really like to concentrate on whatI consider the two most important issues, if you like. First, a general observation. And that general observation is that as I indicated yesterday, Greece is among the very few countriesin the world that have achieved full equality in law. There are 14 such states in the World Bank catalog and that is not a negligible achievement. We consider that a success story and we wouldlike to build into that in order to address the very considerable challenges in the implementation of such equality tenets. The reason I have and the Committee, the Commission has identifiedhas been established administrative practices that change slowly and certainly much slower than required for the effective compliance with rules and commitments undertaken by the competentGreek authorities but also by society as a whole. We would continue to work on that, but in order to start with this kind of work, to identify, codify and eventually address suchdeficiencies, the Greek National Commission has completed the 1st ever report on the status of women in the country to be used as a benchmark and reference point for future developments.Madam President and members of the Committee, you do have a copy of the report in front of you, but I understand that it is also part of your folder in electronic form. We intend to present this report formally around the 8th of March celebrations, but we would be very happyto also incorporate your suggestions and recommendations therein before we produce the final copy. Let me concentrate to a number of issues that we would like to highlight. According to the genderequality index compiled by the European Institute of Gender Equality, Greece has demonstrated the lowest scores in all fields of gender equality for the past decade. That's not an enviableposition. It can be to a certain extent attributed to the economic crisis, but this is not enough. Currently there has been a significant increase in areas such as health or the domain of workparticipation, but scores have remained deplorably low in areas such as women in position of power in spite of the long existence of quotas. We at the Greek National Commission, we have launcheda campaign on TV, radio and online to boost the chances of women actually elected during the three electoral campaigns that we had in 2023 and we intend to repeat that exercise duringthe campaign for the European Parliament elections in June 2024. The result of our campaigning during this past year has been a 5% increase in elected representatives. It's not spectacular,but it's a 1st step, if you like, and we do hope to see better. What we can ascertain at this point is that the issue has been squarely put in the political dialogue and for that weare very, very happy. A 2nd point. The Greek National Commission recognizes improvements in securing the presence of women in the labor market, including the adoption of the latestILO Convention on harassment and violence at work. Very speedily indeed, I may add. However, the unemployment rate for women remains high, mostly because of below the radar work practicesthat confine women to low paid work without social benefits, creating a work environment without effective protection where sexual harassment incidents are consistently under reported andthe gender pay gaps remain unabated. Of particular importance in that respect, we find the balance between personal and professional life, especially in view of the very severe birth deficit problemGreece would face in the next decade and of which the Secretary General has just referred to. We are particularly encouraged in that respect by the recently introduced obligation for allemployers above a certain size of establishment to provide child care services in situ. Nonetheless Ms. Gavinelli, I ask you to conclude your remarks. Thank you. Also on the authorities to continueinvesting in policies to support women in order to enter, reenter and remain in the labor market including the provision of sufficient child care services as well as dependent person careservices. And we would like to make sure that such balancing extends to working from home in the aftermath of the pandemic where the same requirements need to be safeguarding includingthe right to disconnect. We, Madam, in the Greek National Commission would continue to work forthe effective equality in practice and we stand here to assist you but also the Greek state in performing our duties and obligations in that respect. Thank you so very much. On behalf ofthe Committee I thank Ms. Gavinelli for her statement. Distinguished Delegation, as you are aware the procedure for the Committee for the consideration of periodic reports is for questions to be posed by a number of experts followed by posed by a number of experts followed by following which theDelegation will be given an opportunity to respond to those questions. Following that another group of experts will be given the opportunity to pose questions and the Delegation is again given the floor to respond. The experts questions will be asked largely following the order of the Articles ofthe Convention. This procedure is followed throughout the two meetings of today. I would like to remind the Delegation that the Committee will aim to complete its consideration of the implementation of theConvention by Greece by 5 p.m. today. The dialogue will be webcast live on UN Web TV. I wish to draw the Delegation's attention to the need for careful time management and I encourage the Delegation toprovide precise, short and direct responses to experts' questions as well as to indicate when a response cannot be provided. In that case your Delegation should take note of the questions that cannot beanswered immediately and you may request to submit the pending information in writing within 24 hours,one working day. From the end of the constructive dialogue, that is by Wednesday, 7 February at 5 p.m. Geneva time. In order to enable an interactive dialogue, the submission of additional informationin writing should be the exception rather than the rule. If the Delegation submits additional information in writing within 24 hours, such information should not exceed 1500 words and should be timely, conciseand answer the concrete questions posed by the experts. Please also note that such information will also be published on the CEDAW website for the 87th session as it forms part of the public dialogue.Lack of or inadequate replies to questions raised by the Committee may result in follow-up questions and eventually may be reflected in the concluding observations of the Committee. I should also like to indicate that if necessary, the Delegation may be asked to limit its responses should this becomenecessary due to time considerations. I will now call upon the experts who wish to pose questions under the various Articles of the Convention. Experts are also reminded to respect the time limits for questions. Where questions are not sufficiently answered, experts will be givenan opportunity to ask follow-up questions for 2 min . We will start with questions relating to Articles 1 and 2 of Part 1 of the Convention. I would 1st like to give the floor to Ms. Natasha Stott-Desposia, the country reporter for Greece. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning, everyone.I warmly welcome the Delegation and the Secretary General. I thank you for your opening remarks, comprehensive opening remarks, but also the fact that you acknowledged that the role of CEDAW and its recommendations is to provide, as you say, a roadmap towards sustainable gender equality. That'swhat we're about. So we look forward to this constructive dialogue. I also thank the President of the National Commission for her contribution as well. It's an honor to be the task force rapporteur for Greece. Incidentally, my country has one of the largest groups within the globaldiaspora as well. But home to rich ancient history, we know that your country has been a world leader when shaping modern systems, civilizations, philosophy, culture, democracy, indeed a foundingmember of the United Nations. Even though Greece has experienced one of the largest increases on the EU gender equality index since 2020, as you have heard, it is still rated 24 and has only scored 58 pointsout of 100. That's a low ranking. I acknowledge, though, your state party efforts towards achieving equality and promoting the rights of women and girls as you have outlined in your answers to the list of issues, but also in your statement today. I'm particularly interested in your comments, finalcomments in relation to the gender perspective in terms of climate change. We look forward to talking about that further. You also mentioned the 1st horizontal law aimed at achieving substantive gender equality. You have introduced the idea of gender mainstreaming, gender budgeting. You havegot mandated quotas that have been introduced for board governance, sports club governance, for research, but also for political parties, political positions. But we also note, as you have done, that 24% of theparliament is female. So there seems to be this gap between, as we have heard, good laws, good constitution, good national action plans and implementation. So I thank you for your comments about the need for evaluation and for monitoring of national plans. Again, we will explore that further. The committee alsorecognizes your updated national action plan for gender equality. As you mentioned, it has got a more considered reference, more thorough reference in relation to women with disabilities. We also look forward to hearing more about the recently established national council for gender equality. I see eachuniversity has comparable mechanisms. It would be good to hear about that during the dialogue as well.We commend the state party on the 2019 amendment to classify sex without consent as rape. I also acknowledge the work of civil society in that achievement. Similarly, you have got laws 479 from 2021 and 4604 from 2019 which prohibit the promotion of gender based violence, discriminationand hate speech and create a positive obligation on the media to advocate for images of individuals who are equal and free from gender stereotypes. However, violence against women and girls remains pervasive. We know from the daughters of Penelope that one in two women murdered in Greece was killedby a spouse or intimate partner and we know that one in four women has been or will be a victim of abuse in her life. You mentioned the impact of COVID as well. With one of the largest coastlines in Europe and with the presence of conflict in near European and Middle Eastern regions, we recognizeyou receive a huge influx of refugees and asylum seekers and we are really interested in the treatment of those people. I also note the barriers faced by Roma women and girls, particularly in relation to housing and education. Again, colleagues will explore that in future Articles. In relationto Articles 1 and 2, Your Excellency, in the concluding observations of the 54th session of the Committee, we noted the general lack of awareness of the Convention and the optional protocol in your state party, particularly in relation to rural and remote women and thosein minorities. So what are you doing to raise the visibility of the Convention and its associated protocol and how are you disseminating that information? Your report also mentions victims of certain crimes such as gender-based violence offenses are provided with free legal adviceirrespective of income. So I ask what measures are taken to ensure that parties involved, particularly those victims of abuse, are given counsel who are specifically equipped to deal with the sensitive and specialized nature of those offenses. I also note the Greek Ombudsman's role in mediating betweenpublic administration and citizens in order to help the latter to exercise their rights effectively, particularly in the cases of anti-discrimination and equal treatment. Please provide data on the number of complaints in relation to such discrimination over the past five years, noting the Ombudsman'srole as a mediator and inability to impose sanctions or annul administrative decisions. What steps are being taken to ensure that these complaints result in tangible resolutions for parties involved? And finally, please provide information on how many migrant women and girls have free accessto legal representation, in particular what measures have been taken to ensure that migrant women who are in detention are not only aware of their legal rights but are able to exercise them. I look forward to aconstructive dialogue. Thank you. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to Articles 1 and 2.Yeah. Thank you so much for this concrete remarks that you highlight and this is something that we have already mentioned and we try to focus and to face in our country. We have a specific statistical datacollection in our country under the Hellenic Statistical Authority but we know that this is a challenge. We know that we need to have more concrete data in order to have specific policiesto face the issues of gender equality and to have more visibility for women and girls. That means thatwe have under the general Secretariat of Greece and our minister try to have an assistant from EU. We have a technical assistant trying to help us to work in a horizontal way of the way of collecting data.We have specific observatories but we need and this is the true because here we are just to exchange our views and try to find a better way to working. We have difficulties to collect the data to be on timeand to be through the ministers and the policy and the Hellenic policy and the different observatory.This is something that we have also now in our priorities trying to have under the Secretariat of the Presidency of Governance to have every month data from different ministers. That means that notwe can resolve everything but try to have a common way of thinking about the data, about what we tryto select and how we can compare between each other and we have every year an integrated approach of howwe go in the statistics. It is important to say that yes, we have and I'm happy for that. You mentioned a lot of crucial things that we think about as the Parliament and the percentage of women in ourParliament is just to 24% and something that yes, it is better than the previous one but we know what we need to do more. This is the way that we try to encourage the young women and the women, the girlsand the women with campaigns to be part of our public participation. But we need more to do, not onlywith the parties but also with the NGOs and with the civil society. Just to clarify for the issues of the statistical data collection, as a professor in the university I know that this is a data, this is abase, the data is the base of what we have to do here and we have to concentrate more. I know that this is a challenge for us in Greece also but not only in Greece. We can start working and I would liketo give the floor to the Minister of Justice. Let's start from our, okay, from the Minister of, for ourSecretariat of equality and human rights and then to give the floor to justice. I would like to speak about political representation of women in Parliaments. You referred that there is a gap in implementation between policies, between quotas and the implementation of women, of representation of women in Parliaments.I would like to say that we acknowledge this fact that we try to implement measures to improve this situation. We have the implementation of quotas, the gender quotas have been implemented gradually at all levels since 2018, they appliedto national elections from 1/3 to 40% and defines as a unit of reference the constituency instead of the whole territory. Moreover, it introduces 40% gender quota to the Parliament elections. Also we have capacity building for women politicians and candidates. Suchan initiative constitutes the gender public debate project that was implemented between in 2019 and 2021 and ran with the participation of our general Secretariat aiming to recognize and address sexism in public discourse which is one of the major problems that women cannotproceed to take part in this in political spheres. So the capacity building is very, very important.In this project 112 women politicians were trained and educational material was developed. Additionally educational seminars were organized by the research center for gender equality with the participationof over 370 women. Also awareness raising campaigns were launched during the run up to the national regional and municipal elections held since 2015. We also systematically monitor electoralprocesses through the observatory for gender equality. Data collection and analysis of election results and candidacies enable the assessment of the trend in women's representation providingthe opportunity for database policy planning. This regarding the political participation ofwomen maybe for the national focus on the Article 1 and 2 because we don't have to go to the Article 7 or something. If we can focus on the Article 1 and 2 just to clarify that we are in the samepart, please. I will give the floor to the Minister of Justice, please. Yes? I will say a few thingsabout what we are doing in justice in Greece to improve things. Since 2022 there is the judicialstatistics bureau of the Ministry of Justice that was established and staffed in July of 2022. And despite the short time since its establishment the bureau managed to create its own digital platform for collecting judicial statistics in which after training all the judicial services of the countryit got a response from for all of the Greek judicial and prosecution authorities. And regarding the Convention the judicial statistics bureau collects data for Article 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 oflaw 3500 of 2006 on preventing the domestic violence, the number of criminal prosecution by all the countries prosecution authorities, conviction at 1st instance, actals, postponements and how manycases were appealed as well as the conviction after appeal. And at the same time regarding victims it collects the number of victims by gender and based on the perpetrator/victim relationship.Thank you. I would like to give the floor now to the Minister of Migration and Asylum, please,to give some more details about that. Yes, thank you, Ms. Chair. Regarding statistics and data collectedand processed in the Ministry of Migration and Asylum, everything is available on the ministry's website. Fora quick review, I would like to mention that we keep data regarding the legal migration, the residence permits that enforce, hold it by women, migrants, regarding the integration, we have the number ofwomen, of females that have enrolled in the integration program. Regarding asylum procedures, we keep data regarding the number of women that have applied for asylum, that have been granted internationalprotection, vulnerables that have been identified, and also regarding the reception facilities, we keepnumbers of the women that reside in our facility, reception facilities centers, the vulnerable womenthat have been identified in our reception and identification centers, and lastly, we also collect and providedata for the unaccompanied minors, girls, regarding the women. Thank you. And to be clear, we haveSorry for that, Madam Chairman. We would like to have answers on the questions regarding the legal aid, so we needto focus more on that, on the visibility of the Convention, and on the role of migration in this point. So if we can focus please on that. I give the floor to Ms. Sosu from the Secretariat, the Secretariat General on Human Rights, and please justto focus, concentrate on the specific answers. Thank you. Okay. I will start with the answer about legal aid and the provisionto legal aid to refugees, that was the concentration of the question. I would like to stress that our network of structures of the General Secretariatprovides all kinds of services to refugee women, one of them is legal counseling, and in addition to that legal counseling, the General Secretariat has signed protocols ofcooperation with the bars across the country that provide legal representation to women as well as interpretation services that would help refugee women to go to the courts. And for the years of 2022 until January 2024, we have provided legal aid to 45 women who are victims or arevictims of violence by their partners or their former partners and majority of these cases was about safety measures and the custody of the children and only one of them was a rape case. 40 of them were referred tothe association, three to Thessaloniki and one to Patras and one to Serres. None of the requested legal aid petitions was rejected. All of them were accepted. And that's allregarding legal aid. And I will continue with Obuchman and the number of complaints forthe past five years. In 2022, we had 552 complaints. In '21, 516 complaints. In 2020, 485. In 2019,517 complaints. And in 2018, 512 complaints. The majority of these complaints through the years is about discrimination in the world of work, discrimination in social security issuesand sexual harassment. With regards to Obuchman role, as you have mentioned, the Obuchman has no power for imposing sanctions or compensation and its decisions are nonbinding. In order tostrengthen its effectiveness in cases of discrimination, Obuchman can ask for sanctions after having investigated a case of discrimination and the sanctions can be imposed by the authorities, e.g. , in privatesector administrative sanctions against employers and disciplinary sections against civil servantsin public sector. All of these sanctions are according to the law. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Secretary out of equality and human rights to have some comments on the visibility of the Convention, please. About the visibility, the concerns about the visibility of the Conventions, we knowthat the visibility is not so evident as it should be. But we are trying to make the Convention as more as visible as it can be in all in the public and also in special categories of people like students, e.g. , the research center for gender equality has created a very good informational materialand has created an informational material, a very good informational material on the Convention and its operational protocol to be used by teachers and children. This is accessiblein its website. Also the Convention is being visible indirectly by our actions of our national action plan, especially through capacity building measures that are implementedto combat stereotypes. For example, capacity building in public sector employees. In this regard, we also have to mention that the national action plan on women, peace and security alsoincludes capacity building within which the CEDAW Convention is very much reported. Maybemy colleague from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could say a few more things about that. Goodmorning, esteemed members of the CEDAW Convention. Building a little bit on what my colleague just said on visibility of the Convention, as gender equality is one of the priorities of the Greek foreign policy,it's already in the operational plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We attached a great priority onthe visibility of the Convention and this is within the national framework. What we do is we have some capacity building programs which are already in the national action plan on women, peace and security. Every line ministry which implements the national action plan provides for certain seminars for the public sector, for its employees. What we do in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we organize seminars for young diplomats in the Diplomatic Academy where we present gender equality as well as the state obligations under the CEDAW. Second of all, what we do in terms of visibility, as for those who may not know, we run for a non-permanent member of the security council, so among our priorities is also the women, peace and security agenda.for the nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council. Among our priorities is also the Women in Peace and Security Agenda. If we are elected, we intend to keep high on the agenda of the UN. The issue of gender equality is the only way to build sustainable peace and security. Of course, with that, there is a DAO convention, the human rights of women and girls. For us, it is a priority if elected in theUN Security Council. Beyond that, also within our action in the multilateral fora, in the Commission on the Status of Women, we try to contribute substantially to the agenda, the gender equalityagenda of the UN. Thank you so much. I can develop more if you want on thefloor. Give the floor to the Minister of Justice. Thank you very much, Chair. My name is PanagiotisKarakonstantis. I'm a judge and I'm appointed in the Special Legal Service of the Ministry of Justice in Athens. As for the women's access to justice and legal aid system, we have already createda legal framework for all persons to apply for legal aid and certainly for women, too. If they comply with certain criteria, the main one is the low income. They have to prove that theyhave low income. In addition, we have free legal aid available in civil and criminal proceedings to victims of certain crimes such as trafficking in human beings and sexual crimes against minors regardless of their income. Moreover, victims of domestic violence seeking interim measuresfor a temporary settlement of the situation have access to free legal aid under the Article22 of the law on domestic violence that we have recently ratified. The Greek authorities have started concluding agreements with several associations all over Greece to provide free legal aid to women victims of violence regardless of their income which is an important step forward. Andas far as it concerns the payments of the lawyers providing such services in the past years, itis already provided in the bill under the Ministry of Justice that will be soon voted by the Greek Parliament and they will all be paid according to their help dealing with all these cases. Thankyou very much. Thank you. I will come back to the General Secretariat for Human Rights. Goodmorning to all Distinguished Members of the Committee and to everybody who is listening to us remotely or here. I would make just two brief comments. I don't want to tar you. I am an officer at the GeneralSecretariat for Human Rights. Regarding the Ombudsman, I would like to say that just very recently two directives were adopted by the European Council on the standards and the functioning of the equalitybodies. The Ombudsman in Greece is the formal equality body responsible for the monitoring of equal treatment of the principle of equal treatment of the country and it is an independent authority. Sothese directives which have been adopted provide further provide among other things for the possibilityof court representation on behalf of the equality bodies. So from now on maybe not maybe, the Ombudsmanwill have this additional role when, of course, the directive will be transposed in the national law. And one other comment regarding the implementation evaluation and the monitoring of the plans. Iknow you read in our report about various plans, most probably in other countries too. I will talk to you about the national action plan on gender equality. Our agency was 1st established back inthe '80s, back in 1985 we were one of the 1st countries to establish a mechanism on gender equality and it was actually the claim of NGOs, feminist organization at that time that we were created, we were established.The 1st comprehensive national action plan on gender equality was in 2010 together with the 1st our 1st national action plan on combating gender based violence. Up to then we had no shelters, no structures, just one structure for gender based violence all over the country. So in termsof implementation and evaluation, yes, we know in the past years we didn't have concrete indicators, if I might say, to evaluate our work. We did it, we did it internally, of course, we didit because we were reporting each month and annually on all the actions of the national action plan. But this last, the current national action plan for the current period until 2025 has indicators. Hasindicators and the observatory in the observatory section of our authority monitors these indicators. And as Ms. Dimadama said, now since 2019 there is a central governmental monitoring of all ministriesand of all government work done by the done at the very top level from the General Secretariat for coordination in the presence of the government. So we have a more concentrated and central systemof monitoring all national action plans, everything that the government does, which would be easier because there is a point, a focal point that concentrates all our actions and monitors usin a way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I now give the floor to Ms.Douglas Bulger for follow-up questions on Articles 1 and 2. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be brief because they were much appreciated and robust answers. I'm curious about the comments aroundthe Ombudsman's ability to recommend sanctions and would be curious if we take it on notice to find out how many times his recommendations are adopted when that recommendation is foreven though you didn't formally really report in the 54th or the 87th session in your reporting on the visibility of the Convention, it is clear you are doing things and there is one, sorry,thank you for those answers. I found one piece of interesting, a publication called The Flower of Equality which represents the CEDAW as a fairy tale for children of preschool age. I think a fewother state parties might benefit from that preschool literature. One other specific question wasn't particularly answered and that was in relation to the specialist training for thosecouncils who deal with victims of gender-based violence and abuse, if we could have that on notice. Again, I thank you for your comments, especially from the Foreign Ministry. If thatwas an election bid, I don't know if I have heard one, but there we go. Delegation can respond to the follow-up questions. Thank you. Thank you. Just to clarify about the indictment, the Secretary Generalfor Equity and Human Rights has the floor just to have a few more details about the role of theyes, just to give some more details because as I understand we want some more details aboutthe role of the yes, okay. With regards to how many of these complaints were proceeded andwhat was the outcome, I'm afraid I cannot provide at the moment any of that information. And withregards to the training of the staff that deals with refugees in general gender-based violence,yes, I will start with a cooperation of the High Commissioner for Refugees and our Secretariat was incooperation with the High Commissioner and have co-signed and designed and implementing a cycle of training actions on gender violence and abusive behaviors. These training are addressed to the staffworking in the front line and the accommodation structures of the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum provide direct services to asylum seekers and refugees. Also a lot of training regarding gender-basedviolence is provided by EXA, the National School for Public Administration and every year these trainingare revised and renewed so as to have a more up-to-date personnel. Thank you for those responsesto Articles 1 and 2 and the follow-up. We will now move to questions relating to Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention. I would 1st like to give the floor to Ms. Bandana Rana for 3 min and then to Ms. MarianneMikko for 3 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair and I join my colleague in welcoming the High Level Delegation to this constructive dialogue. It is good to see a larger composition of women Delegatesover here. Madam Head of Delegation, I would like to acknowledge the important steps that you have made in adopting and introducing a plethora of national action plans, strategies, policies, there were somany as informed by you. I also congratulate the State Party on the accession to the Istanbul Convention which came into effect in October 2018. However, in spite of all the plans and policies as data indicators,the gender index shows the progress has been slow as you have also acknowledged in your opening statement.As also shared by the Human Rights Commissioner, 53.4 out of 100 points, Greece ranks last in the European Union on the gender equality index. No score is given to Greece on the domain of violence due to a lack ofcomparable European Union-wide data. That's the source from the gender index. So what are your specific plans for the effective implementation and assessment of all the plans adopted to improve the overall status in this regard? As mentioned by you, a new ministry, social cohesion and family has beenestablished that will also address binary social groups. It's good to hear that. However, the horizontal law 2019 lacks reference to no binary persons. Does the State Party have plans to amend this law to becomemore inclusive? Greece recognized the significance of gender mainstreaming already in 2000s and reaffirmed its significance in the national action plan for gender equality 2021-2025. We share your commitmentto integrating gender mainstreaming as a policy objective within the national action plan. Which entity would coordinate gender mainstreaming and how efficient is the dual approach of gender mainstreaming and adopting specific gender equality policies and measures? I commend the State Party for establishingthe National Council for Gender Equality with advisory purpose. The role of this counseling body is seen in the evaluation and assessment of gender equality policies as well as in proposing initiatives to the General Secretariat. What are the significant initiatives proposed by this National Counciland how are they implemented? Three years ago, the General Secretariat implemented the European Union technical support instrument with the objective of gender impact assessment creation, establishment ofgender budgeting and implementing of pilot programs. How many ministries have participated in the realization of this project? Have you conducted the impact assessment? If not, when do you plan to do the assessment? You mentioned that gender responsive budgeting has been introduced for the 1sttime in your opening statement and I congratulate you for that. How will this be applied across the programs and across the line ministries? The Committee applauds the adoption of the National Action Plan on Human Rights which is necessary for the development of effective and inclusive human rights mechanisms.Kindly provide information regarding the human, technical and financial resources at the disposal of the Greek National Commission for Human Rights. I'll stop here. Thank you. Ms. Marianne Miko, you have the floor.Thank you very much, Chair. I welcome the high level Delegation of the State Party headed by Saferula Dimadana, CEFI for me for long years here in Geneva. Greece is currently ranked 24th in the EU onthe Gender Equality Index as my colleague stated just now. However, since 2020 it has experienced one of the largest increase amongst Member States. The National Council for Gender Equality established asa collective advisory council in 40 with main competence to evaluate and assess the existinggender equality policies and propose new initiatives to the General Secretariat. Greece has introduced the following legislation to enhance women's participation in decision making through theaffirmative measures of quotas. Namely, Law 4706/2020 dealing with corporate governance provides a gender quota of at least 25% on listed company boards. Law 4276/2020 dealing with the composition of sportsclubs, associations, management boards states that the number of candidates from each gender sex must be at least equal to the one-third of the number of vacant seats for election including the seat of thepresident or head of the management board. Law 4604/2019 introduces a 40% quota in favor of womenfor the list of candidates in each constituency at the national and European elections. Furthermore, the absence of quotas in the composition of councils of the public administration results in legalpenalties. For local and regional elections, Law 4555/2018 issues a 40% gender quota on the total number of candidates, regional, municipal Councillors and community Councillors. The former respectivequota was one-third. Law 43/86/2016 provides one-third gender quota in candidates for the National Council for Research, Technology and Innovation, sectoral research councils, regional councils for research,technology and innovation and the same quota for the members of scientific councils of research centers and institutes. Scientific excellence and qualifications are also taken into consideration. There is establishedgender equality committee in each university to address issues of gender inequalities. All thesementioned laws are good steps to the right direction. As the laws are applicable, the truth is that laws need to make change in real life, otherwise they remain paper daggers, nothing more. I have three questions.First, would the state party consider introducing temporary special measures to increase the numberof women within cultural, media, judiciary, social and other public areas? Second, what temporary special measures have been introduced in the past four years? Please provide data on the implementation of thesetemporary special measures. And thirdly, law dealing with corporate governance provides a gender quota of at least 25% on listed company boards. When would the state party consider increasing the mandated genderquota to 40% which is mandatory as we know within a few years as it stated in the EU directive? What has been done in this respect? Is there tabled an amendment of 40% in Greek parliament? And if yes, then what isthe status of the mentioned amendment? Thank you very much. Thank you very much for those questions. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to Articles 3 and 4. Thank you so much, my friend,Miko. And thank you, Ms. Rana, for these questions. It is really interesting to underline that we havenational plans. We have new initiatives that we try to not to have a parallel way of working in the ministers because we know that this is a trap. But we try to combine under the Secretariat of the governmentof how all these different action plans come not overlapping but cooperate together. So the role of the presidency and the government is to have this specific coordination. From the beginning of the newterm of this government before seven months ago, we have already mentioned that we need this cooperation has to be visible to all of us, to all of the ministers. And because in the minister level is notso easy, we try to have all these Secretaries General working in a horizontal way. And the gender approach is something in the human rights because this is the 1st time that in our country we have SecretariatGeneral for human rights and gender for equality. That gives us the umbrella of how we coordinate this. So when we have this specific timetable of how we go on with the national plans and with initiatives,we have every month the specific data and some initiatives and indicators. These indicators are veryyoung, junior, let's say. But we try to find a specific timetable and specific indicators to go on and evaluate the procedure. So I think that it's really early to say that, yes, we have managed to havethis evaluation. But this is something that we now start working under the government and under the Secretariat, the General Secretary of our ministers to have an overall approach and control of how we goon. From my side, yes, I'm sure that we need the ongoing procedures to try to find national action plansthat combine, not to have 10, 5 or 15, but just to find out specific action plans that combine some of the other aspects. But now at the beginning we need to have this specific data and go on with this procedure. We have theNational Council for Gender Equality. We have supporting here just to clarify that this is another mechanism in order to have about 20 people, if I'm okay, to work in this field and coordinate the procedure. And, yes,it's very important for us that this National Council for Gender Equality to have more visibility because we have the data that is really interesting to understand how we go on and have specific policies and nottake policies because we think that this is et cetera, but to have specific data and more than that, we need to have this more visibility for gender equality issues. And something that I have to say is thatfrom this Minister of Social Cohesion and Family, we have the opportunity to be more visible in all sectors.So now I have to give the floor to the Secretary of Gender Equality and Human Rights to go on with moredetails. Yes, thank you. Thank you for giving me the floor. That's a lot of questions. I hope I wrote themall down and tried to respond adequately. Regarding your question on our law, on 2019 law on substantivegender equality and whether we were thinking about making it more inclusive, yes, it is a very good point. We know that we have noticed, too, that this law might have some inconsistencies or inadequaciesregarding other laws on anti-discrimination. And I think it would be a good base for talking on howto better now that we already have national strategy about LGBTQ people and their rights, it would be avery good chance to ameliorate our legislation and hit all of those points that create coherence problems.About just one comment about the national council on gender equality, which offers consultation, it is a consultative council to the General Secretariat of Equality and Human Rights. It was established bythis law on substantive gender equality. I must admit that this law, the inspiration about this law was after Spain's gender equality law of 2007. That's what we were trying for years to pass such a law, butthen it was the financial crisis that caught us up and it was delayed somehow. Anyway, the national councilon gender equality offers participated very substantially during the drafting of the current national action plan on gender equality with suggestions and evaluation of the other ministries' input during the drafting ofthe plan. However, something very important is that there is a civil society representation in this council, which is very important for us. However, we might look at some reconstructing to better take advantage ofthe expertise of this council because maybe it should be more engaged in our implementation of policies. Regardingyour question on gender budgeting and gender impact assessment, both notions were introduced with the same law, substantive gender equality. You see that we have a very important law that we are trying to implementsomehow because and here is my personal opinion and my experience, my opinion from experience. It is difficult still to pass these ideas in the public administration. It is still quite difficult. It needstime. It needs training, awareness raising. We are at a good point, I must say, because the national center of public administration does this awareness raising, but it takes time. It takes time. That's the truth. Regarding this gender budgeting and gender impact assessment,they are provided for in the specific law, but in order for us to actually implement the law, because okay, we have the law, butwhat's going on after that? We implement a new funded program from the European Commission. So in order to implement the specific provisions and start including in practice the gender budgeting and gender impact assessment tool, because they are both very useful tools of gender mainstreaming, that's what we are trying to do. We implement thisEU funded project. So the program provides technical assistance to four pilot ministries in Greece. Before the government, before the national elections, it was an hour change as a ministry, because we now belong in a new established ministry. There were three. These ministries were three. Now they are four. It's us, the ministry of social cohesion and family, it's the ministry of finance, because budget finance goes together, the ministry of labor and social security and the ministry of interior, because it has all theeach of these ministries has a very specific role to play in what we were trying to do. The budget of the project is 400 approximately 400,000 Euros. So it provides technical assistance to these pilot ministries to mainstream gender in the selected policies. We selected specific policies for us. It is due in September 2024, but we have actually managed to take anextension of this program, so as to have the chance to extend the implementation on gender budgeting and gender impact assessment to more ministries, or even local government if we manage to do that. There are six other participating countries in this program in general. So far we have organized workshops. We have organized on gender budgeting and gender impactbudgeting and gender impact assessment with international expertise. We have done one visit study in Canada. I have personally been involved in this project. So I can speak to you fromexperience. It was very, very interesting and very elaborative. And we had gender budgetingtrainings of the pilot ministries in Greece. Now we are expecting in a couple of weeksthe gender impact assessment training and gender expert, the gender impact assessment expert will come to Greece and give a two-day training to selected employees of the four ministries,of the four pilot ministries. And finally we are going to develop yes, yes, yes, I'm sorry.Yes, please. Gender impact assessment and gender budgeting methodologies for the ministries butwe are not there yet. The project ends in 2024. We had some delay because of the elections. So we are not there yet. It is all about this project regarding gender impact assessment and genderbudgeting. And I'm finishing now of the nonbinary. We have a start meeting with NGOs that work inthis issue under the umbrella of the LGBTQI community. And we think that we need more todo. But now we are trying to open the dialogue with civil society and public dialogue abouthow we will take initiatives about this issue. So we need more time, please, just to be honestwith you, Ms. Rana. So yes, this is something in umbrella of LGBTQI rights and the same-sex marriagethat now we have in our parliament, in the Greek parliament. That means that this is the time that we have to be more experts to work more in this issue. And I think on the temporarymeasures that you have asked, well, we have made a lot of steps in order to adapt specificmeasures of how we will work with gender violence, how we have more women in representatives. Wehave the quota. We know that this is a tool and we need more education in the people ofhow we will use the tool and the quota. We have 40% in our law about the quota. And we thinkthat this is very important measure, the measure that can have specific results. Yes, we needto work more in the awareness. Yes, this is something that we need to admit. Thank you. I do not see any. Yes. Follow-up questions with Ms. Rana. You have 2 min . Thank you, Madam Chair.I really appreciate the positive responses from the State Party, particularly your acknowledgement that more needs to be done and I really hope that our concluding observations will guide you in that way. I had one question which is regarding your new agenda for peace as Greecehas committed to support UN efforts to place women and girls at the center of security policy building on the framework of the agenda on women, peace and security. You mentioned that thenational action plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 has been adopted in your statement. But I did not find any mention of when this was adopted, when was it launched, and becauseyou said it is a five-year plan, but when was it launched and how were civil society and women engaged in the development as well as in its implementation? Thank you. I give the floorto the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Retales, please. On the national action plan on women,peace and security, it is actually very young. It is two months old. It was adopted by an interministerial committee in December 2023, so two months ago. Actually, nine ministries were involved in thedevelopment of the action plan. The same intergovernmental interministerial committee is going to monitorthe national action plan on women, peace and security. Actually, what we are going to do when we go back home, we are going to have our 1st discussion on how to implement indicators which are in alignment with indicators used for the monitoring of the national action plan on genderequality, as well as the indicators used by the EU on the EU national action plan on women, peace and security. The working group that monitors the national action plan on women, peace andsecurity, apart from ministries, it will be comprised also of statistical focal points whichmeans that every ministry will have its statistical focal point and all statistical focal pointswill develop indicators. That's with the monitoring. The national action plan also is mainstreamedin the annual action plans of the ministries and every year is coordinated by the general secretariat for coordination under the presidency of the government. The ministry of foreign affairs has a coordinated role together with the general secretariat for coordination. It's a whole ofgovernment process. Actually, we were planning to have an event to present the national actionplan, but unfortunately due to COVID and all of that, a high level member of the government who was going to introduce the national got COVID, so we had to postpone it and we are going to have this present with this event to present the national action plan near around the beginningof March, so near the international women's day. It's very timely because the national actionplan is actually delivered by the government to implement the national agenda and also inrelation to the candidacy as a nonpermanent member. I don't know if you want to implementby nine ministries, if I can give you more info. Just to be because I want to clarify and try to answer everything that we have here in our meeting, I would like the corporate governanceto give the floor to the general secretariat of equality and human rights, because it's crucial for us to have a specific answer. So, Ms. Papageorgiou, please. At the time, it's a little, you know, trying to be on time. Thank you. Regarding your question, I would like to clarify that thequestion on corporate governance and can you hear me? Okay. Regarding women's participationin economic life and the law of 2020 on corporate governance that you referred earlier, this includesthe gender quota of at least 25% of listed company boards. We, the representation of women on boardsof directors exhibits a gradual yet consistent upward trend, reaching 25.5% in 2023, an increaseof 2.5 percentage point compared to 2021. Our ministry is currently working on the transpositionin national law of the EU directive on improving the gender balance among directors of listed companies, stipulating that members of the underrepresented sex hold either at least 40% of non-executive directors' positions or at least 33% of all directors' positions. We are currentlyin the state of making a group, a committee to transpose, the law committee to transpose thedirective. So the percentage will be higher then until December 2024, we will transpose the directive. So then it will be an obligation to have a higher percentages in the boards. I thank the Delegation for those responses to Articles 3 and 4 of the convention. I would likenow move to questions relating to Articles 5 and 6 of Part 1 of the convention. I would like 1st to give the floor to Bandana Rana who will deal with Article 5 for 5 min and then to Ms. Corinda Meyer who will deal with Article 6 for 5 min . Thank you. Thankyou very much, Madam Chair. I'm happy to take the floor again and if I may continue with my earlier intervention, I hope that Greece will have its peace agenda at the center with women and security issues and wish you all the best for the Security Council elections as well.On Article 5, I would like to commend the State Party on the amendments in the Greek legal framework to the transportation of the Council of Europe's Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence and the adoption of the law for the promotion of substantivegender equality prevention and combating gender based violence 2019 as well as the establishment of the police department for addressing domestic violence in its efforts to prevent and respond to domestic violence crimes and to strengthen the protection and support of survivors of domesticviolence. It is a long sentence again. I further acknowledge the efforts in providing free legal protection to victims of domestic violence and establishing 73 domestic violence services throughout the country as you also mentioned in your opening statement. In light of newlyadjusted domestic legislation and amended criminal code on the strengthened penalties for domestic violence crimes, how do you assess the progress made in the implementation of this law and its protective measures? How many cases have been reviewed and prosecuted and how many gender basedviolence victims have benefited from special protection measures? In spite of the improved protection measures, gender based violence victims continue to suffer from ineffective and disinterested police management of gender based violence cases. It has been reported. How does the state partyplan to improve the efficiency of police forces according to newly adjusted protective measures necessary to combat gender based violence? I welcome the establishment of 62 social services including 40 counseling centers that provide psychosocial support and 21 shelters all over Greece. Hence,with the adoption of a law from 2019 for state funding and operation of counseling centers and shelters, please report on state plans to increase the capacities of social services and how accessible these services are to women from rural areas. We have received information from alternativesources that one in four women in Greece experience abuse in their lives and one in two women who have been victims of femicide have been murdered by the hand of their partner. Does the law from2018 ensure legal prosecution for the act of femicide and if not, does Greece have a plan to do so? During the COVID pandemic, the number of domestic violence cases against women significantly increased as you also mentioned that there was a surge on domestic violence. Can you informus of your gender responsive COVID program what measures have been introduced to strengthen the national capacity to address the needs and violence faced by women and girls during humanitariandisaster and crisis times? Additionally, the integration of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation in the Greek criminal code implies the strength and punishment for such practices.Unfortunately, being aware of these practices are in communities with strong patriarchal relations towards women. Does the state party intend to allocate additional funds for advocacy projects aimed at preventing harmful practices? I commend the state party on the new law on audiovisual mediathat stipulates the promotion of media free from gender stereotypes and the new law on substantive gender equality setting out provisions against gender stereotypes and discrimination in mass media and advertisements. How do you assess the implementation and monitoring of such provisions? How effectivehas it been? Keeping the focus on the deconstruction of gender stereotypes in mind, can you pleaseshare what innovative awareness raising and educational campaigns are conducted to enhance a positive and non-stereotypical portrayal of women and men irrespective of sexual orientation? The Committee is very concerned about violence faced by asylum seekers but this will be addressedby Madam Rapporteur on the Article 14. I will not elaborate here. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Browner. We now turn to Ms. Detmeyer for Article 6. Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, welcome thehigh level Delegation and my questions concern Article 6 as you said. The Committee commends the state party for the amendments of the criminal code but notes that Article 323A still does not comply withthe protocol concerning the issue of consent. Also the situation of vulnerability is not included as one of the means. The Committee notes, however, that the non-punishment clause has been adopted and acknowledges the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court on consent. Does the state party consideraligning the trafficking law to the protocol on the issue of consent and if not, why? How are the law enforcement and judges trained on trafficking, especially on the new legislation and the conceptsof consent, non-punishment and the use of a vulnerable situation? I ask this question because sentences of perpetrators are often low, often suspended as if the gravity of the crime is not appreciated. Howwill the state party see to it that these serious crimes are punished accordingly and that the courts deal with these cases in an acceptable time frame as noted by the European courts on human rights? The 1st step to a successful fight against trafficking is the identification of victims. There seemto be, however, significant gaps in formal identification procedures of victims. How does the state party ensure that the identification of victims does not only depend on the presumed victim's complaintand her or his cooperation in the investigation of criminal proceedings? The Committee acknowledges the difficult situation the state party is in as a 1st perception country for a large number of vulnerablewomen and girls in a migrant or asylum situation and has concerns about the following: How will the state party strengthen the mechanisms to identify victims of trafficking in asylum and refugee camps? Womenin migrant and refugee camps are vulnerable to organized criminal groups for sex trafficking in makeshift brothels. What does the state party do to prevent and fight this? In situations where vulnerability of women andgirls for rape and gender-based violence is high, is there enough knowledge to identify trafficking amongst this? Are victims of trafficking informed about their rights, notably their right to reflection period? Isthe expertise of relevant organizations, NGOs, psychologists, healthcare staff taken into account during the identification procedure? Is an individualized risk assessment conducted before any forced removals in compliancewith the obligation of non-refoulement? In March 2023, Greta issued its 2nd report on Greece. Many direct actions were urged, notably in relation to labor trafficking. Undocumented women and girls are easytargets for labor exploitation. Has the number of labor inspectors been increased and the capacity strengthened? Have sufficient resources been made available to the labor inspectorate? And has a training system for the laborinspectorate and law enforcement been put into place to ensure adequate identification of victims of labor exploitation, especially women and girls and protection of their rights? Roma girls leave school in their earlyteens. They are forced to marry, subsequently forced to beg or commit crimes. All of these fall under the new wording of the new law on trafficking. The Committee knows that ethnicity is not registered by the state party, but does thestate party keep track of these cases? If not statistically, then at least anecdotally. Is this on the agenda as a serious trafficking problem and how is this form of crime prevented and what is being done to protect young Roma girls and keepthem in education? Despite the fact that prostitution is legalized, many brothels operate illegally. How does the state party ensure that women forced into prostitution can be identified, treated and protected as victims oftrafficking and not as just prostitution? And I have one extra question that the Committee has asked before and will probably ask again and would like very much like to get information on. We would like to get the information about thewhereabouts of over 500 girls and boys, mostly Albanian Roma who have been rounded up by the police in Athens before 2004 and disappeared from a state run care home. Can the state party provide information on the progress made in this investigation? Thankyou, Madam Chair. Thank you. And I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the questions under Articles 5 and 6.I'm really happy that we have so well prepared women here to ask us a lot of very, very interesting questions and that we are well prepared alsoour Delegation with the answers. So just to go further, I would like to start giving the floor for Istanbul Convention and the law forthe equality. It's something that we are very skeptical and we try harder and harder and harder to work in the victims of the gender violence.Thank you for this question. So I have to give the floor for the Article 5 to the General Secretariat of Human Rights and then we have the opportunityto have some additional information. Please. I will start with some remarks regarding some answers regarding trafficking. 2019 marked the launching of theGreek national referral mechanism for the protection of victims of human trafficking and on the establishment and operation of a national identification andreferral system for victims of human trafficking in the framework of which the day-to-day operation of this mechanism was assigned to the National Center for Social Solidarity,under the coordination and supervision of the Office of the National Reporter on Human Trafficking. It should be noted that according to law 2022, due to the event of a max influx of displaced foreign citizens, established the obligation of all the authorities to inform this mechanism upon identificationof a trafficking victim. This mechanism has a mandate to collect and register cases of actual or presumed victims of human trafficking, both presumed victims and those granted the victim status are included regardless of when and where the offense of humantrafficking took place as long as the protection services linked to the trafficking experience are currently provided to them. These cases are identified by the competent actors such as public authorities or civil society organizations. The mechanism follows up with the reported cases and all further referrals of protection of services and designs and operates a data recording systemmonitoring and statistical purposes. This mechanism has expanded its impact and the significant developments and we see gradual and steady increase in number of cases reported since2019 and publication of four annual reports regarding reliable data on victims' history of human trafficking as well as victims' current situation. This mechanism provides continuoussupport to front line professionals provided by the National Referral Mechanism. This support is given by team of experts of ECHA and as well as a lot of training activities both in personand online. This activity, these trainings target national authorities including the Greek asylum services and NGO staff. Also other capacity building activities target to national authoritystaff. So regarding the cases of human trafficking, we would like to note that for the years 2021,'22, '23 and '23, '20, '26 and '35 cases respectively of human trafficking were investigated and 409new common cases were prosecuted for human trafficking. Convictions for human traffickingresulting in deprivation of liberty penalties were 91 for 2022 and 92 for 2023. The numbers are referred to the cases in which the sentences were not suspended and conviction in 1st instancefor the years 2021, '22, '23 were 126, 121 and 215 respectively. In the 2nd instance, courts were42, 112 and 77 respectively for the mentioned years. I don't know how much time we have. We have somany questions. Okay. Okay. I would like to concentrate on the services that are provided. I will tryto be short. First level protection services available and accessible upon the identification of a human trafficking victim following a relevant risk and needs that needs to be assessed include health care,medical, material assistance, legal counseling and representation, accommodation, psychological and social support. If the presumed victim is a child, specialized protection services for children and assistance forappointing a guardian are made available. Interpretation services are also available at all times. A detailedservice map is included in the mechanism handbook. I will be short in the numbers that we have on thetrafficking victims. In total in 2020 we had 80 women and 35 girls and most of them were asylum seekers.And they were from African countries. To finalize a little because we have a lot of contributions here in this human trafficking, it is something really important for Greece and we try hard in very difficult circumstancesto work on this field. So I would like to give the floor now to the Minister of Citizen Protection, please. Mr.Thank you. One of the most important measures taken in the field of law enforcement in the fight against domesticviolence or hate crimes and hate speech is the establishment of special services through the country. Of course, the operation of these services is always guided by the provision for support and holistic services to the victims oreven if it is domestic violence victims or hate crime and hate speech victims. I mention hate crime because many vulnerable people are protected by our law for hate crime and hate speech and always guided by the prevention ofsecondary victimizations. Briefly and not to say too many things, numerous trainings have been the staff ofthe Hellenic Police has attended numerous training regarding to detect and prosecuting and investigating these specialcases to inform the victims to avoid secondary victimization as I said. Many tools are in use by the personnel ofthe Hellenic Police such as the guide for the panic button which was put into operation in addition to improve thepolice response to domestic violence incidents and to assist the work of the police personnel involved in the management of the relevant cases and to achieve the best possible coordination of the competent regional services of the corpse or they havebeen issued to them based on the current legislation and the directions of the prosecuting authorities. Furthermore, guide for police response to incident of domestic violence and the manual for police response to incidents of domestic violence havebeen issued which include informative data and clarifications concerning the provisions of the legislation describing protocols,procedures, also cooperation with the civil society, cooperation with different stakeholders and key players to improve the investigation ofthe cases. Regarding the statistical data, we have to accept that we have an increase. If, of course, it's an increase, it meansthat we can better investigate and debate the cases, but also we must accept an increase. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now we would like to give the floor, please, to the Minister of Justice to have their contribution. Thank you for passing the floor. So according to that question and having to do with trafficking, I would like to add some things.On the initiative of the Ministry of Justice and in cooperation with the national reporter for the fight against human trafficking, a special Working Group was set up for the protection of victims of human trafficking striving for a comprehensive picture and evaluation of the situation in Greece. The aim is to form a forum for communication, fermentation and formulation of guidelines by the core competent service agents. The composition of the Working Group includes representative of the police, theprosecutor's office, the judge, the office of the national prosecutor for the fight against trafficking in human beings and the team of the national center for social solidarity that supports the operation of the national mechanism report on the protection of victims of trafficking in human beings. The Working Group against human trafficking meets from July 2021 until now at least once every two months and undertakes initiatives and practical action that will strengthen the protection of victims from human trafficking and willcontribute to the compliance of our country with its international obligations but also to the consolidation of good practices based on the recent legislative amendments and choices of the state. On the initiative of the Working Group and in cooperation with the deputy prosecutor of the Supreme Court, the Greek Supreme Court who is responsible for human trafficking issues, the number 7 of 2022 landmark circular of the prosecutor's office of the Supreme Court was issued in2012, the project regarding the issue of identifying a person as a victim of human trafficking which further strengthens the rights of victims of human trafficking. And at the same time, the Ministry of Justice in collaboration with a national school of judicial offices arranged training seminars for active judicial officers on the topic rights of humans and criminal acts with an emphasis among other things on victims of humantrafficking. Also relevant material is included to the courses of the school's curriculum. Finally, the Working Group drafted a concise guide on the rights of the trafficking victims and the implementation of joint actions with the competent bodies of the Greek police. In addition,a special investigator for victims of human trafficking has been appointed. The Working Group raised the issue before the administration of the Athens court of 1st instance and the deputy prosecutor responsible for victims of trafficking. It is noted that now Article35 of law 5028 of 2003 provides that special investigators are appointed in the court of 1st instance of Athens and Thessaloniki for the cases of human trafficking and crimes againstsexual freedom and the economic exploitation of sexual life and illegal trafficking, employment and labor exploitation of citizens of third-party countries as well as related crimes. Thank youvery much. Thank you so much. Now I would like to give the floor to the ministry of migrationasylum, crucial ministry. Thank you. I would like to from our side, from the side of the ministry of migration to add some things about the trafficking and the measures taken toprevent trafficking in particularly in migrant and refugee women. During the period 2020 to 2022 the Greek reception and identification service provided to its staff training sessions in collaborationwith organizations such as European Union agency for asylum and social action and innovationcenter in the following topics, reception of vulnerable persons, human trafficking and training of health professionals on human trafficking. Moreover the national referral mechanism for the protection of humantrafficking victims is a coordinating mechanism which monitors all stages of victims protection beginning with their initial detection and identification followed by the provision of protection services andsupport during the legal process up to their voluntary assisted return to their country of origin or integration in the country of arrival. In the field of integration the program promoting integration ofthe refugee population into the labor market in the framework of the Greek national recovery and resilience plan has been formulated by the social integration directorate of the ministry of migrationand asylum and is funded by the recovery and resilience facility. Its implementation started within the year 2022 while it is planned to last for three years. One of the eight sectors of the program isreferring to the care and assistance of vulnerable groups, the prevention and combat against human trafficking through better possible training of the field professionals. The specific sector aims toinform and educate the beneficiaries who reside in open accommodation facilities for prevention and combatting against trafficking. The sector will contribute to social integration of beneficiaries of international protection and of 3rd country nationals legally residing in various areas ofGreece. The aim is to expand their ability to collaborate with competent authorities as it is appropriate depending on the case. For example, with the police, health professionals, et cetera.Specifically, the implementation of the sector requires the accomplishment of three key deliverables.First of all, a specific terminology glossary for human trafficking translated into selected languages of the participating beneficiaries which has been developed and approved by the ministry of migration and asylum in order to help participants to better understand the topics of trafficking vocationaltraining. Secondly, a vocational training program to recognize and help the trafficking victims. And3rd , the promotion of the activity to inform the authorities about it. For the promotion of the 3rd activity, the design of the relevant material is already completed.Furthermore, in 2023, four vocational trainings for trafficking have taken place in areas around Greece with the participation of 3rd country nationals, both women and men and professionalsin the field of asylum. During the training, the participants were informed about definitions and terms used in the relevant field, the specific terminology glossary, different aspects of trafficking and ways to identify potential cases as early as possible and relevant national agencies.The presence of the deputy minister of migration and asylum highlighted the importance of this initiative. It is important also to highlight that so far during these four vocational training, 53women in total have been trained. The prevention of trafficking in human beings is expected to be enhanced through the work of the newly established general secretariat for vulnerable persons andinstitutional protection within the ministry of migration and asylum. Its mandate focuses among others on the prevention of the phenomenon of trafficking and the protection of potential and recognized victims of trafficking in persons, specifically a department for the protection ofvictims of trafficking in human beings will be established within the general secretariat dedicated to the protection of such cases providing guidelines and capacity building to front line professionals.An exemplary good practice is the national emergency response mechanism for unaccompanied minors which aims to act proactively to prevent unaccompanied children from being trafficked for sexual exploitation, labor exploitation or forced criminality as well as to provide support and protection to children,victims of trafficking. And here I would like to conclude briefly just to finalize. Yes, please.Also that there are safeguards, gender sensitive safeguards also in the asylum procedure. Thank you.Thank you so much. Just I would like to insist just for a few minutes, sorry for that, for the Roma issuesjust to clarify a few things and I will give the floor to the Secretariat for Social Solidarity and fight againstpoverty of our ministry, please. Just for a few. Thank you, Secretary General and thank you distinguished members of the Committee for this opportunity for fruitful dialogue and exchange of views on issuesof common interest. With respect to early marriages of Roma girls, there is actually no information that the phenomenon is linked to trafficking. It is indeed a very serious and complex issue in Greecebut it is mostly related to the living conditions among the community. To this end we would like to1st and foremost note that these marriages they are not recognized by the Greek state. They are neither religious nor civil marriages. Instead they are customary marriages that take place within the community. This does not mean that the Greek state does not understand the seriousness of the issuewhich is linked as I said with poor living conditions and also high school dropout rates. To this end thegovernment through the national strategy and the measures provided therein aims at gradually lowering the percentages of early marriages for young girls mainly by focusing on the empowerment of Roma women as well as by increasing their participation and education in the workforce. One of the most effectivepolicy measures so far is that we have linked welfare benefits such as the general minimum income, the child benefit and the housing benefit to regular school attendance in order to reduce schooldropouts and indeed registrations to compulsory education are increasing since the beginning since the implementation of the measures and dropouts have been reduced. Second our experience has shown that women are the core and soul of the Roma family and this is why the contribution to the reductionof early marriages is priceless. To this end we aim at raising their awareness both as women and as mothers through programs co-funded by the EU and the European economic area. I would also like to referto the efforts made in local administrative level through the function of the Roma branches. They are part of the community centers and so far 66 operate all over Greece. About 250 social workers, educators,medical staff, psychologists. Just focus on the human trafficking and then in the next articles we candevelop more the issues of the labor if it is possible and maybe if I may interrupt you and give the floor to Ms. Diakoumakou just to focus on the trafficking and to concentrate on that. Thank youand sorry for the interruption. Thank you. I would like to give you some information on the special measures to support women victims of violence. So one of the most important initiatives in theministry of social cohesion and family that started during the pandemic refers to the provision of guaranteed minimum income to women victims of violence. Sorry for the interruption. If we needto jump to the Article 5, please give the floor to the ministry of labor and then go back to the Article 5, if I may, please. Okay. So I will give the floor to the yes, just to be not to jump from one to another.To the trafficking and thank you, Madam. Thank you. May I go? Thank you, Madam General Secretary. On behalfof the ministry of labor and social security, with regard to the issues raised on labor inspectorates,their training and the identification of victims process. In 2023, the labor inspector aiming to improve the way labor inspectors act and develop their ability to deal with cases of human traffickingfor the purpose of labor exploitation conducted four training workshops in Athens, Thessaloniki and Heraklion Crete. The workshops organized by the labor inspectorate and the NGO A21 Greece were addressedto labor inspectors and to members of the Hellenic police while two of these workshops were held underthe auspices of the office of the national rapporteur on combating trafficking in human beings. These training courses included among other training curricula, the indicators for identifying potential victims of human trafficking and guidelines for cooperation between the law enforcement authorities.Within the same framework in June 23, inspections have been coordinated at seven checkpoints for the detection of illegal migrants and declared work in illegal operation of enterprises in cooperation with the security directorate of the Hellenic police for combating human trafficking and under the supervisionof the public prosecutor's office. The operation was accomplished with the forwarding of the related reports to the competent prosecutor of the Athens Plenary Court in August 23. Additionally, the laborinspector under the auspices of the European Labor Authority and Europol participated along with mixed inspection teams of labor inspectors and LO officers in joint action days against trafficking in humanbeings carrying out nationwide inspections in June 23. For the agricultural sector in particular, the joint action days were resumed in September 23. Overall, since 2022, when the labor inspectorate startedoperating as an independent authority, there has been a 13% increase in the inspections conductedin comparison with the previous year. And also, the fines imposed. So it's. So we finalize? I just wantedto mention that in view of strengthening the framework, the legislative framework, we are in the process ofcontinuing with the ratification of the 2014 protocol to the 1st labor convention No. 29 with a framework to be completed in June 24th. Thank you. Thank you. Just to give the floor for 2 min only because I would like to jump to the Article 5. We need to finalize and we have limited time, please, and this is something we need to Yes, and Madam Head of Delegation, I think we spent a long time on Articles 5 and 6 and I think we have tomove on because my colleagues may have questions that they may want to ask and then we Yes, we need the dialogue. So we finalize with the Ministry of Citizen Protection 1 min , please. Andwe finalize. Yes, please. Thank you. Thank you. And really soon. To complete with the question regarding the disappearance of children from the Agia Varvara institution during this period,in the framework of the implementation of the program protection and social care of children on the street, foreign minors who were arrested for begging following a verbal order of the Athens, the competent Athens prosecutor were released and taken directly to the Agia Varvarachildren's city for hospitality. This procedure was followed for minor children up to 13 years of age who either had no parents in Greece or their parents did not come to collect them because they were staying illegally in Greece. Furthermore, it is noted that with the ordersof the Athens prosecutor's office of 1st instance, preliminary investigations were carried out by the subdirectorate for the protection of minors, the directorate of security of Attica in order to search for evidence of any offenses committed against the minors hosted in the AgiaVarvara children's village which were submitted to the prosecutor's office. We have to go a little further and then sorry for that, we are going to answer the very interesting questions in moredetails, please. Thank you, Madam Head of Delegation and I would like to see if my colleagues have any questions that they want to ask because if you do, we want them in a written response. Yes. Ms.Natasha. Thank you, Chair. Again, I thank the Honorable Delegation for their specific answers. I just want some clarity around the child marriage questions and I acknowledge the official madethe point that it is not recognized under state law so it is not allowed in Greece per se. However as we know it is complex and related to issues relating to poverty and other things but thereis the opportunity for some families to opt for Sharia law, so basically under the civil code. I'm wondering if there are specific and forgive me if I didn't catch this but specificnumbers around the number of child marriages in Greece and secondly because of this sort of dual judicial system, is that something that Greece would consider amending or investigatingconsidering there are still child marriages in the state party? Thank you. Could we have a response to that in less than 1 min , please? And then we will move on. Thank you, Madam Chair.I would like to give a legal reply to the question that you raised with regard to the implementation of the Sharia law. I would like to stress that it is true that the Sharia law is applied on some family and inheritance law matters of the Muslim minority race but this has nothingto do with the conditions for the conclusion of marriage. The legal framework governing the conclusion of the celebration of marriage within the Muslim minority race are exactly the same as for the general population and recently the presidential decree has specifically harmonizedand explicitly harmonized the conditions for the conclusion of marriages within the Muslim minority race with the general provisions of the civil code. So my colleague will give more details on this issue but we have to keep it separate from the implementation on the verylimited and exceptional implementation of the Sharia law on some family and inheritance law matters of the Muslim minority race. Thank you very much. We will now move on to questionsrelating to Article 7 and 9 of part 2 of the convention. So I would 1st like to give the floor to Ms. Marianne Miko who will address Article 7 and 8 and then to Ms. Jia who will addressArticle 9. Thank you. Thank you very much, Chair. Since 2020 Greece has experienced one of thelargest increases of the gender equality index that I already mentioned but although there is a 40% agenda quota in the candidate lists in each electoral constituency at the nationaland European elections only 24 of seats in national government in national parliament were heldby women in 2022 in Greece which is lower than world average. 44% of positions in the ministerof foreign affairs are women and high level positions at public administration entities are very close to being gender balanced, 47.5% in top positions. Furthermore, Greece encourages the submission of women for various United Nations bodies. Four candidates have been elected asindependent experts of all whom were women. Congratulations. Her Excellency, Ms. MariaAikaterini Sakeloropoulou is the 1st woman to serve as President of the Council of State,the country's highest administrative court and the human rights advocate. Ms. Despina Chaspis Vassiliou Tsouvelis is the historical 1st female secretary general of the Council of Europe,a body which brings together MPs of 46 Member States of Council of Europe, the oldest and largest human rights organization in Europe. The State Party's project, gender public debate run byGeneral Secretariat during 2019 to 2021 aimed at addressing existing barriers for journalistsand women in public debate. 120 media stakeholders were trained in identifying, responding and preventing sexist and gender discrimination at public debates through targeted workshops for journalists, mediapractitioners and students of media faculties. In addition, 100 women politicians and candidates wereable to enhance their skills in election procedures and in identifying and responding to sexism and gender discrimination in public debates. But still questions remain. First, does the State Partyplan to continue running the gender public debate project or similar initiatives beyond 2021? What was the gender breakdown of participants in these workshops? Second, despite the 40% gender quota inthe candidate list, only 24%, as I told of seats in Greek Parliament, were held by women. Globally we are more and more underlying in gender equality analysis the need for parity. Has this subject hadany reflection in the State Party debates about women in decision making process? What is the status of parity principle in electoral law as far as the candidate list is concerned? Is there any notion to amendthe electoral law with so-called zebra or zip electoral list where men and women have equal visibility for the electorate? What initiatives do the State Party have in place or plan to increase the representation ofwomen in Parliament? Thirdly, please update the committee the number of female judges, justice officials and tribunal auditors and detail any plans of voters in place to increase representation of women in the justice system.Lastly, please provide the data about female officers in police and defense forces and the data about female ambassadors.As the representative of the Foreign Ministry claimed at the beginning of our constructive dialogue, that gender equality is priority in the Greek foreign service. Could you clarify does that mean that Greece is planning to become a part of the group of countries of thegreatest foreign policy? Thank you. I now give the floor to Ms. Gigi for 3 min . Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the fact that the State Party has sent a high level delegation for the dialogue with the committee. Since the last dialogue, the State Party has introduced a series of legislations, policies and plans to promote gender equality and has become one of the European countries'with the greatest increase in gender equality index since 2020, which is appreciated. Greece's legislation has a long history and has a great influence on civilization. The committee hopes that the State Party's achievements in gender equality will contribute more to the world just like its history and culture. I would like to raise the following questions on Article 9. First,the committee has noted that the issue of nationality is not mentioned in the State Party's report. Please provide the most updated data on the number of stateless women and girls in Greece. Does the State Party have a standardized system to identify and register the nationality of refugees and migrants in Greece? If not, is there a plan to establish such a system? Second, Para 40 of the report points out that apoints out that according to law 22/26/2004 legal aid is available before all civil, criminal and administrative courts for stateless persons provided they have legal or habitual residence in the EU. How can stateless women and girls without legal or habitual residence get legal assistance in that case? Third, migrant and refugee women and girls are often vulnerable andare more likely to become stateless. What measures has the state party taken to help them get access to education, employment, healthcare and other services and to provide interpretation for statelesswomen with language barriers so that they can access facilities such as shelters, crisis interventioncenters and maternity hospitals? Fourth, just now the President of the Greek national commission pointed out that it is a long process to fulfill the commitments of CEDO. I notice the stateparty has not ratified the European Convention on nationality. Does the state party plan to ratify the Convention in the near future? Fifth, can the children of stateless persons born inGreece automatically get Greek nationality? Has the state party taken measures to protect their equal rights and realize nondiscrimination? Thank you, Madame Chair. I give the floor to the Delegation to respond to Article 7, 8 and 9 and could you do that in 15 minutes, please? Thank you.This is a challenge. I will try to just say a few words from my side and give the floor to the Delegationto give some data, some specific answers. Well, the plan for the gender equality debate in political level is going on with very specific initiatives. One issue is the awareness in the campaign andwe need to encourage more women to participate to our elections and we have quota for that.But more than that, we need some role models. So we try to have the President of Greece, a woman, and it's really important to empower and enforce women in the more high level positions, not only in the public area but also in the NGOs and the civil society and give them a voice andtry to have more visibility. Because of the 15 minutes, I would like to give the floor to the Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, please take the floor to go on in specific data and then we have to respect, please, the 15 to 20 maybe minutes. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.So on the political representation, okay, you have, of course, reported all the data. I would like to refer to the measures that we are undertaking to enhance the women's political representation in women's political representation. We understand that they are barriers.A study of the research center for gender equality conducted that examined all the factors contributing to women's under representation in political life. The findings validate the barriers to women's representation in the political sphere can be categorized into three main groups, structural and social factors, the prevailing male-dominated culture in politics, and the diverse modes of gender socialization that fail to promote women's engagement in politics.So to effectively address these barriers here that are hindering women's participation in the political sphere, the state has adopted a comprehensive integrated approach that responds to the multifactorial nature of their under representation by enacting legislative measures related to the reproduction of stereotypes in the public sphere, implementing projects aiming at identifying and addressing of sexism and conducting awareness raising campaigns that combat sexism in political life.Also it empowers female candidates through workshops that alongside capacity building serve as a means of networking and educating women to overcome the divide between private and public life. This direction is supported by a comprehensive set of initiatives promoting the work/life balance such as the labor reform law, the development of care structures for children and other dependents and the establishment of the equality labeling companies.Additionally, policies for the equal representation of women in the labor market also exist. As regards the gender public debate program, this project ran between 2019 and 2021 with the participation of our general Secretariat aiming to recognize and address sexism in public discourse.And these women I referred to this one earlier, the program, it has ended, it has ended, the program 2021. So we are going to undertake other initiatives in this direction.Yes, yes, yes. We also have some initiatives of the National Center for Public Administration and Local Government, Center for Public Administration and Local Government, which is going to be carried out within 2024. This concerns training seminars for local government officials and elected officials to increase their participation in representative bodies and institutions, education of electors, and the creation of a leadership academy in order to strengthen the abilities of women to acquiretheir positions of responsibility. Also, we have awareness campaigns that were launched during the run-up to the national, regional, and municipal elections held since 2015. A campaign, for instance,a view of 2023 national elections, the general secretary initiated a campaign by releasing a video spot with the slogan \"We vote for women, we change policies.\" In 2019, the research center for gender equality in collaboration with the general secretary and the Ministry of Interior launched a campaignwith the slogan \"I am running\" to motivate women across the country and encourage their participation ascandidates in the upcoming elections. That was the most, okay, thank you. Just to go a little slower. Now I have to go to the Ministry of Justice, please.I have some interesting data. Thank you. Thank you very much for giving us the floor. Since you have already mentioned about our president of theGreek Republic, I can add to that. Mrs. Achelaropoulou, the current president is also a former judge. She was the president of the Council of State of the Conseil d'Etat a couple of years ago and I would also like to mentionthat the number of women in judiciary in Greece is already very high. I would say that during the past decade it has risen up to 60% of all judges serving now in Greece and thatapplies to the candidates that apply to become a judge and the people that are actually succeeding in the examinations and they become trainees in the national school of judges and after atraining session they become judges. If needed we can provide you with statistics from the national school of judges about these numbers. And I would also like to point out that both the president of the Supreme Court Mrs. Klapa and the chief prosecutor of the Supreme CourtMrs. Adilini are women and the president of the Council of State is also a woman. And if I remember well but I'm not sure about that, the president of the audit council that hasbeen appointed a couple of months ago is also a woman. So I suppose that on terms of providing opportunities to women, the Greek judiciary system is very well prepared. Thank you verymuch. I think that the Article 9 and if we can clarify a little more and just focus on. Yes,we go on with the Minister of Foreign Affairs but I would like to say that in the justice we have I think that the women are more than men when we have the exams. If we have any percentageabout that from the Minister of Justice because I think we have some data about that. I will give the floor because we need time to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and then maybe we can comeback on that. Please. Thank you, Madam Secretary General. So in relation to numbers for women and men ambassadors as of the end of January 2024 at the central service of the Ministryof Foreign Affairs out of sorry 81 heads of directorates and units, 43 are men and 38 arewomen. And at the foreign service out of 135 heads of missions, 94 are men and 41 are women. Now in relation to the question on the feminist foreign policy since gender is part of our operationalplanning and strategic planning and a priority for feminist for foreign policy. Well actually since there is no single definition of feminist foreign policy and each country defines feministforeign policy as they think, there are certain countries, e.g. , that partners and that we follow on the way they work, they define foreign policy by putting priorities for ours or others they put gender in diplomacy or gender in international development policy. For us itis very important that for us gender and sexual orientation is priority for our foreign policy, but I think that you cannot single out foreign policy and say foreign policy is feminist and the other policies are not. So I think that the national policies go in the direction of feministor gender inclusive, gender sensitive, gender responsive. So yes, I think that foreign policy goes in that direction along with other policies. I cannot say feminist foreign policy because our minister doesn't call that feminist foreign policy. But it is very, as far as I can sayit is very gender sensitive, gender responsive, gender yes. Thank you. Thank you. Just to saythat we have 72% of the judges are women. And we have already introduced a specific seminarlesson let's say in the sorry, but yeah, this is something that we have National School of Justice have a specific lesson about the yes, I thought that you have to mention that, sorry. Yes, I think the ministry has to mention this sentence because it is reallycrucial. Yes, about the training of judges in Greece. Yes, just to underline that the national school of the judiciary provides initial and service training to judges and prosecutors. Initial training is mandatory since 2022 and covers topics such as human rights, family law, gender based and domestic violence and the treatment of victims. And also local bar association in Greece reportedlyoffer optional and service training on gender based violence to practicing attorneys, training them on the Instable Convention and on violence against women. Thank you. Thank you so much and go on in the Article 9, Madame Chair and I give the floor to the Ministry of Interior please. Thank you Madame Secretary. Dear Madame Chair, Distinguished Member of the Committee,my name is Johannes Machoudakis and I'm working in the Ministry of the Interior. Now about the Convention on statelessness, I would like to point out the following. Although Greece has not yet signed the aforementioned Convention, our country is of course a party to the UN Convention relating to the status of stateless persons of 1954 with no reservation.Furthermore, even though the Greek citizenship is mainly acquired by birth, the Greek citizenship legal framework regards the principle of use solely as fundamental. The supplementary adoption subject to conditions of the principle of use solely aims at eliminating exactly the occurrence of statelessness at birth and firmly supports the action set by the European Convention on nationality that every person should have at least one nationalityat birth. Therefore, the Greek legal framework regarding citizenship includes provisions that either prevent statelessness through use solely as a principle or facilitate the naturalization of a stateless person. Specifically, under Article 1 of the Greek citizenship code, a child born in the Greek territory acquires Greek citizenship by birth provided otherwise he or she becomes stateless,since he or she cannot acquire the citizenship of the parents or due to unknown or undetermined citizenship as long as the inability to acquire foreign citizenship is not due to parents' refusal to settle the matter. Thank you for your attention. Thank you so much. So we go on for the Article 9, yes, and we need I'll give the floor now to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum to give us more data. Thank you.Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Just to give you a quick overview of the matter of statelessness in our asylum procedures, a nationality assessment is a part of the asylum procedure. So through the personal interview of the asylum applicant, a nationality assessment may belaunched in case of a stateless person. Approximately 70 applications for international protection are lodged by stateless people per year. And as for the data, so far we have registered 318stateless women who have been granted refugee status in Greece. As a last point, I would like that I would like to make is the status and the benefits that stateless people have access to during our asylum procedures. The refugee status is the most common status provided andgranted to stateless people along with subsidiary protection. So every it is more it is most probably that a stateless people, a stateless person will acquire the refugee status and after that, they will have access and the benefits to the labor market and all the other benefits that refugees have access to in Greece. Thank you.Thank you so much for those responses to Article 7, 8 and 9. And my colleagues have follow-up questions, Ms. Miko and then Ms. Boniface Alfonso. Thank you very much, Chair. Thank you all those answers of what I proposed my questions. I expect that there will be answer in written manner as far as female police officers and defense officers are concerned. That's all right. Butwhy I asked about parity is just because that 24% is not sufficient in your Parliament. And 40% hasn't brought I mean made that larger or deepened gender equality. So that's why that parity maybe to think about if lists are sort of like for seen for electorate, men, women. And so that is more rapidneed sort of reaction to get more women into Parliament. So I do believe that maybe that parity is somehow reflected, if not, then just this kind of gesture from our side tomention something which is working. Thank you. Thank you very much, Chair. In 2019, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommendedto Greece that they withdraw their reservation on the vote for persons with disabilities. And I would like to ask the State Party of Greece whether with regard to steps taken to protect the rights of women with disabilities and the preexisting restrictions on their right to vote,have you done something in response to that recommendation that such restrictions be lifted made by the CRPD? Thank you. Yes. What I would like to do right now is to have the Delegation take note of the question on parity issue and the reservation issue and I would like to moveto Article 10 of the convention and then we will come back and have the answers to the parity issue, the reservation issue and Article 10. Yes. I now give the floor to Ms. Fatima for fourminutes, please, on Article 10 of the convention. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I would like to use this opportunity to welcome the Delegation and thank you for the tone ofthe constructive dialogue so far. I 1st of all want to begin by commending Greece for your educational outcomes, that 93.3% of girls and boys complete school and the adult literacyrate is high and girls have represented about 53% of graduates in general education and at the other levels, exit high school, they also perform very well. I also commend you for yourlaw number 4604/2019 which provides for gender mainstreaming in curriculum and teaching materials as well as career guidance and teaching. I would like to ask how you assess the impact of thisbeyond the completion rates, beyond figures. Then let's move to STEM and the horizontal subjectmatter segregation. It still continues and attracting girls to STEM and ICT is one of your pillars. Now, the question is have the girls good digital action plan scholarships continued to be awardedto female students in ICT since 2014 and do you have plans to extend this to other areas beyond STEM? Furthermore, was any support provided to scholarship recipients to obtain paid employmentfollowing the completion of their postgraduate studies and what temporary special measures are you considering? We also commend the law which establishes the gender equality committeeand my question is as an advisory body, what steps is the state party taking to ensure that these recommendations are actually being implemented within universities? Let me again continue togo on and thank you for your human rights education and especially I read a very novel part of your state party report that shows that it is done through the learners doing pictorial representations of human rights. What I'm interested in knowing or the committee is which aspects do they tendto predominate in this pictorial and what is lacking and how do you fill that out? My next question on leadership is inspired by Madame President of the Greek commission for humanrights intervention. In light of the gender index which she gave and the fact that women are lagging behind in leadership, we have just heard that, what do you have in schools 1stand 2nd cycle education to empower girls and build their leadership skills? Are girls encouraged to be prefects in core educational institutions so that they begin early to demystifymale leadership and having the ability to challenge and deal with violence and bullying? I know you do this for the teachers but now we are asking for the girls themselves. Now, the next onewill involve sexuality education and the fact that you have programs on this that involve hospitals and so on. My concern here is to move it beyond medicalization to human rights, ageappropriate issues of power in the sexuality education. We move to inclusive education and Madame Chair, I think I am going to transgress the time by three quarters of a minute. Now, inclusiveeducation will not only deal with disability which is important and we note your action plan for persons with disability, but we also want to ask whether you have included things like period poverty andwhether we have programs in place to support the putting of sanitary materials to address this. Now, we will look at the education of minorities. The 240 positions of Islamic teachersthat you have put in your State Party report, how many of these are women? And how do you engage to collaborate on the responsibility of this initiative with the community in lightof the fact that they have it is known that some schools were transferred from the community to the community. So it is important to have this continued collaboration. And again, I will end withthe refugee education and ask whether you give psychosocial support, whether the lack of documentation prevents their being in schools and how you address other issues of transport and so on. Finally, theissue of language, how do you ensure multi-language, bilingualism which is part of the concludingobservations of our committee. I thank you and my deep apologies for going beyond the point.I thank you for your intervention on Article 10, Madam, and it is now time for us to have lunch. So I will ask the Delegation to be prepared to respond very directly to the questions that Madam Betama has put and you have also got theparity issue and the reservation issue. So we will begin there at 3:00. Thank you. This afternoon we will continue withagenda item 4 and we will promptly reconvene at 3:00 p.m. The meeting is adjourned. The private lunchtime briefing by NGOson Oman will take place from 1:45 to 2:45 in office 1058/1060 and you have received the link to connect also to the online platform for those NGOs which will be connected remotely."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to order the 20/42nd meeting of the committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. The committee will continue with agenda item 4. The flooris once again open and we will start with the head of delegation responding to the issues around parity, reservation issues and then we will look again at Article 5, responses toArticle 5 and then 10. Madam head of delegation, you have the floor and we have agreed a timeline on this. We have an agreement together. We will respect. Thank you. Thank you so much. So about the parity issues, it is really important for us. In Greece we have started a long discussionbefore we vote for the electoral law to have 50/50%, 50 women, 50 men and this was something that we really want and we really push all the feminist organizations. Okay. I would like tobe honest with all of you that we need more time for that. So we stand to the 40%. 40%, it was something that we can say that started the discussion, the kickoff of the 50/50 forus. And we try to have the zipper model, you know, in our candidates for the whole state.We have a specific list for the whole state of every party and there it is the best way to have one women and one men. Honestly again we have a long, long discussion about that.We will see. I cannot say yes or no and if we are in a positive path but it is something that the feminist organization, parties and the civil society try to push. Now we havethe reservation issue that it is really important. So I will give the floor to the general Secretariat for equality and human rights. Thank you. Just a sentence from my side. Regarding the country'sreservation on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, what we can say is that the reservation mirrors our national and the EU legislation providing for the differenceof treatment by reason of the nature of particular occupational activities. That's our answer. Soyes, we can go on. So what we will do now is we will have the Delegation respond to questions under Article 5 which were not responded to and then we will move to Article 10. Thank youso much. Thank you so much. Okay. Some more notice in issues of the violence and gender-based violence. So thank you for asking us. So I will give the floor again to the general Secretariatfor equality and human rights. Please. Regarding the budget allocated to the network structures,for the period of 2016 and expanded until 2023, for the operation of the shelters, the numberis 11,576,000 Euros. Regarding the operation of the counseling centers, the number is 9,682,000Euros. And for other actions of the program, the number is 3,277,000 Euros. Their funding is included in the new programming period and the national contribution to this budget isabout 20%. There is going to be an assessment at the end of 2025. Regarding the questions about femicide, we would like you to know that an increasing number of people recognizethat women are murdered because of what they are, because of their women. The term femicide is accepted in our social dialogue for the past two years. However, we believe that establishingfemicide as a separate offense in our legal system is not necessary at this point. As it is covered in Article 299 of criminal code, it is a serious crime, it is a felony and punishedwith life imprisonment. When it comes to sentence imposing, judges evaluate each case individually and they grant a more lenient sentence accordingly. The Greek criminal code is about to change,it is about to be reformed and the existing domestic violence legislation is under amendment and modernization in order to be in line with the Istanbul Convention. It will pass as an act in the Greek parliament very soon. An attempt is made to adapt the law to contemporary socialconditions and to the need to protect the family, minors and victims of domestic violence, especially women. Regarding data about domestic violence, what should be noticed is that we have a majorincrease in the incidents of domestic violence reported to the police. In 2012, the fileswere 1,630, while in 2022, the number is 10,131. In our general Secretariat, we have made we havesome measures, specific measures for the protection of women. One of them is the panic button, which is a digital application given to women victims of domestic violence who after installing iton a Smartphone have the possibility to immediate and safe notification of the Greek police in cases of domestic violence, stalking or others. This application is installed on Smartphonesregardless of the mobile telephony provider. And 81 women have this panic button by the networkstructures. 1046 have this application from the police and 217 messages have activated thispanic button. These are calls that were addressed to the police. Regarding the COVID period, the general Secretariat implemented a series of measures and good practices in the context of the COVIDpandemic to respond to violence against crime and domestic violence. During the extraordinary measures of movement restrictions in Greece, the Secretariat assured the accessibility of women survivors to the national network structures with a legal framework aiming at allowing survivorsand their children movement so as to timely seek help and support from the professionals of the counseling centers and safe centers across the country. And at the same time, ensure the health safety of the staff and the safety of the beneficiaries. Moreover, the Secretariatprovided the network staff with guidelines on teleworking, recommendation on the remote gender based violence case management and data protection. The staff of the network was ready to assist any woman who asks for their support with the informed consent of the survivors. They proceedto offer their services and support either remotely via telephone or online or with a physical presence or by taking all necessary measures in preventing the transmission of the COVID disease. Thankyou. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think we started in the 5 min . Okay. Thank you. All right. We will now have the Delegation respond to Article 10, the questions posed under Article10. Something that we need to focus on because we work hard and we have positive steps in this article in Greece. We have more to do, yes, this is for sure. But we have a good Committeeand try to have the interministerial work in order to have the best results. So I will give the floor to our Minister of Education to take the floor, please. Thank you. I try to, youknow, stuck a little to the time. I know we have a lot of things and I'm very happy for that. But please, we have a limited time. Thank you. Madam Chair, Secretary General, DistinguishedMembers of the Committee, I'm from the Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports. Regarding the issue of bullying, the Ministry introduced in 2023 the law living harmoniously together breaking the silence, regulations to prevent and address violence and bullying in schools.We seek to prevent instances of violence and bullying in primary and secondary educationby nurturing trust within the educational community. An active Scientific Committee has already been established and works for the evaluation and development of protocols for addressing and dealing with incidents of interschool violence and bullying. As part of this endeavor, a nationwide anti-bullyingcampaign is about to commence in early March 2024. Regarding psychosocial support, this is provided by psychologists and social workers placed in all school units aiming to deal with school dropoutof students from vulnerable social groups. As well as by school life counselors who guide, advise and inform the educational community. Concerning refugee education, the objective is not only about achieving learning goals but also about the smooth psychosocial developmentof refugee children. A good example is that of the education system response to the influx of Ukrainian students, cooperation with UNICEF was intensified to support refugee students'socio-emotional needs with the help of psychologists and social workers at UNICEF creative activity centers. There was also cooperation between UNICEF and non-governmental organization for the provision of telephone and face-to-face interpretation in Ukrainian so that language does not constitutean obstacle to schools, to student schools' enrollment and attendance. To this end, there was also development of bilingual handbooks with information on how to register in the Greekeducation system. As for female graduates, the ministry cooperates with the Hellenic Statistical Authority for the collection of data which is used to guide and inform the introduction of new top level policies. According to published available data from the years 2015 to 2022,the employment rates of recent graduates between 20 and 34, there is a stable upward trend for both genders with the rates for female recent graduates rising from 44.1% in 2015 to 66.5%in 2022 while for male recent graduates rising from 46.4% in 2015 to 65.8% in 2022. In the field of special education, Greece has been implementing the strategic action plan for the equal access of persons with disabilities to education and moreover the introduction of a new law in educationin 2021 reformed the supportive educational structures with an inclusive orientation. As for members of the Muslim minority in Greece, this can attend minority schools, Islamic religion schools and public secondary education schools. Regarding the issue of Islamic religion teachersbased on the available data for the current school year overall, the number of female Islamic religion teachers has increased from 22 out of a total of 1880 for the school year 2022to 2023 to 24 out of 90 for the school year 2023 to 2024. With regard to gender equality committeeswith the most recent law in 2022, their scope is further expanded to include other forms of discrimination besides gender emphasizing the prevention and addressing of sexism, sexual harassment and any form of harassing behavior within the institution. All 24 higher education institutionsin Greece have established gender equality committees and 22 of them have developed action plans which are uploaded and available on their websites. Lastly, as for scholarships, excellence and financial status serve as the primary criteria for the allocation of scholarships and financial supportby the state. The legislative framework currently excludes the consideration of gender as a parameter.Now I will pass my floor to my colleague from the institute of educational policy.Thank you. Regarding the integration of the gender mainstream in the curricula, last year 15 existing curricula were revised and 35 new curricula were produced. During this process, a guide for theintegration of gender perspective in curricula and teaching books and materials was created by a working group established by the institute especially for this purpose and it was used with a specific aim of integrating the gender dimension and setting the overall framework of an inclusive education which activatesstudents without discrimination. Regarding the writing of the new textbooks, a process that has been launched a couple of months ago and according to the quality guide principles that must be met, content and imagesin books must promote acceptance and respect for diversity, not reproduce stereotypes, not raise issues of bias, not include sexist references and not offend sexual dignity. As for sexual education in the aspectof human rights, the subject is included in the skills laboratories and specifically in the 3rd thematic cluster entitled care and act and it concerns educational activities of knowledge and criticalthinking as well as life skills activities on gender, on human rights, combating discrimination and gender violence, concepts that are directly related to the fight against stereotypes, discrimination against womenand the formation of a consciousness with respect for every human being. We must say that there are also eight integrated programs posted in the digital repository of institute concerning issues of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics. Regardingthe cooperation with the community in general, there is a process of evaluation and approval of educational programs which are designed and submittedby various stakeholders such as social partners, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. The programs aim to educate, raise awareness and empower students regarding among other issues relating to human rights, social inclusion and equal opportunities, prevention and combating violence and aggression, combating discrimination of allkinds, deconstructing gender stereotypes and shaping democratic awareness. To conclude, in order to implement measures in school to promote women and girl's choice of nontraditional fields of education and career paths especially to STEM and ICT fields but also leadership, the school vocational guidance as a core subject is implemented in the context of the skill laboratories as an umbrella model. The aim is for students to understand all the alternative educational pathways, educational opportunities, theand study options at each level of education and to link them to further education professions and the labor market, as well as to gain self-awareness and self-perception of all the personal characteristics that make up their professional identity and to deconstruct stereotypes that characterize specific professional groups. Thank you.Thank you so much. Just to add about the period of poverty and the school absence for women and girls, we have already prepared and implemented a pilot program at the beginning of this year in Athens and Thessaloniki, the biggest countries for 200 girls. We share about more than 10 million products and have a campaign to support the women and girls in the school absence. Thank you.In order to clarify that the issues of the period for every woman is something that we can face and, of course, to support financially some way these girls and push them to stay at the schools. So we have a discussion now to have another pilot program and maybe to extend to the whole country. But this is something that we now have in ourschedule. I will have in a few months, maybe weeks, some news about this. But now it is something, an initiative that we discuss because we have found out that it is really important for the girls. Thank you. I thank the Delegation for their full responses to Article 10 of the convention. And I ask Ms. Vedema if she has any follow-up questions.Thank you very much, Madame Chair, you know the nail on the head. It is more in the area of comments. And I thank the Delegation for the comprehensive scope of answers well distributed. The part that I am missing a bit but you don't have to give it to me because it is probably not that concrete yetFor example, for the gender mainstreaming in the curriculum, it was the impact, but that would depend on if an impact assessment has been done and how. Then for the gender committeesin the schools, it was also the extent of the implementation. So the sexual education also, the answer given, yes, that was what was in your State Party report, but I was focusing more on the human rights aspect and the issues of power, how they were integrated.So this is a dialogue. At this point, we are just dialoguing. It is not a cross-examination or question and answer. So once that aspect is understood, I'm happy that we can rest ithere. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Betamar, for those comments. And I think that should make a conclusion to Article 10. So can we now move on to Article 11 of Part 3 of the Convention?And I would like to call on my colleague, Mr. Elgun Safarov, to make his intervention on Article 11. Dear ladies and gentlemen, the new law on substantive gender equality encourages publicand private enterprise to develop equality plans to prevent all forms of discrimination against women and encourage equal opportunities for both male and female workers. The pandemic and geopolitical conflict have resumed the progress and worsened results for women in the workplaces,creating a risk of forming a permanent scaling in labor market. Greece currently has one of the lowest employment rates among women in the European Union. The financial crisis and consecutive austerity measures implemented by the government have disproportionately affected the level ofemployment among women and their ability to enter the labor market. At the same time, issues such as the gender pay gap and the underrepresentation of women in certain sectors of the labor marketpersists. The 2022 labor force participation rate among females was 44% compared to the males being 58, despite this woman representing only 29.4% of those employed in senior and middlemanagement in 2029. Women do 2.6 times the amount of unpaid workers when compared to the male counterparts in Greece. According to the 2018 data, the unemployment rate of women withdisabilities is close to 27%. It's an efficient law and it boosts the rate of women without disabilities 50% and with men with disabilities which are 36. According to the gender equality index of the European Institute for Gender Equality, 51% of women between 20 and 64 wereemployed in 2019 compared with 71% of men. Only 30% of women hold a full-time position which is showing that women mainly in Greece are working in informal sector. Women earn about 15% lessthan men on the monthly basis at the same time. The gender pension gap is only 25% at the age of 65 and 79. Access to the labor market is also hampered by the high rate of ineligibilityfor parental leave, preventing women from balancing their work lives and family duties. 2016, 62% of women aged 20, 49% were ineligible for parental leave in Greece. The main reason for this ineligibilitywere unemployment, contact type such as self-employment and inadequate length of employment. Among the employment population, 32% women and 37% of men were ineligible to parental leave. Only 4%of women work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics making Greece one of the countries with the lowest share of women working in STEM Europe. I will not go to the statistic data. I will go at that moment to the questions especially. What about data? Please provide the data, currentdata on employment rate of women with disabilities. Women in terms of unpaid work, what kind of statistic data you have for the protection of this kind of category of women? Women minorities in public and private sector representatives, especially Roma and Turkish minorities, whatkind of progress did the state party implement for increasing women from national minority in labor market, especially? What strategies are currently being implemented by the state party to minimize gender-based barriers to carry progress for women? Sexual harassment in workplace.I know that you adopted and are using especially the common legislation on this point especially, but what about specialty implementation and court decision statistic data on the sexual harassment in workplaces? And maternity leave, which is important at the same time, the pay of comparablesocial benefits without loss of former employment and what about the pension inequality, pension gaps? Thank you very much. I now turn the floor over to the Delegation to respond to questionsraised under Article 11. Thank you so much for this questions. We give us the opportunity toask and give a lot of our data, thanks. We are really ready to say specific things and I will try to have because we have the time limitation to be very careful. I will give the floor 1stto the General Secretariat of equality and human rights and then I conclude a few things that we want to add, please. According to the Hellenic statistical authority data, the unemploymentrate in 2023 declined to 11.2% compared to 12.3% in 2022. It is noted that this rate represents the lowest unemployment rate since 2009, yet women's unemployment rate is 64.4%, it is almostdouble compared to the percentage of men. Although it decreases gradually since 2015. The low participation of women in the labor market is recognized as one of the key problems of the Greek economy with a significant impact on productivity as the average education level of those outsidethe labor market is high. A major barrier to the labor market participation is the lack of quality care services for children and older people. Some other data I would like to refer have to do with gender segregation in the labor market which is a reality for both women andmen. Employment rates in the education, health and social work sectors are 22.8% for women compared to only 8.2% for men. With regard to the gender pay gap, it has decreased by twopoints since 2015 to 10.4 in 2021. Statistics on gender pay gap in Greece are accumulated according to the EU indicator gender pay gap in an adjusted form based on the methodology of the structureof the earning survey which is carried out every four years. The latest available data refer to the year 2018. The survey referring to the year 2022 is still in progress and the datawill be available at the end of 2024. As regards the gender pay gap that you mentioned, we have measures in the national action plan to reduce it. Over time we have included in specific actsof the national action plan specific measures to strengthen women's employment, both the previous and the current action plan in the implementation period 2020 and 2025 include measures to reducethe gender pay gap. Specifically actions to include, to increase women's participation in work, the introduction of an award procedure for companies to receive the equality level that you alsomentioned. Actions to reconcile work and family life through the neighborhood program and actions to eliminate stereotypes and occupational segregation already in schools and related education. Furthermore,we have the Pegasus project addressing the gender pension gap in Greece which was implemented in the period 2018-2020 and examined the issue of gender pension gap on a multifaceted basisand made policy proposals which are incorporated into the current gender equality action plans. A tool was created on the project's website to calculate also future pensions. Also we are envisaging the transposition of European directive for the balanced representation of women on theboards of listed companies as I already mentioned before in the previous session. I would likemaybe to give the floor to my colleagues from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security to continue further for the contribution of the Ministry of Labor from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs please.Thank you. Briefly on the terminology point and the question raised by Mr. Safarov. In Greece, we recognize one minority, the Muslim minority in Greece which has been established by the LausanneTreaty and is protected on the basis of the religion of its members and not on the basis of an ethnic origin. So we have one minority, the Muslim minority in Greece defined as a religious one on the basisof international law but also on objective criteria stemming from international law. Just a clarification on the terminology. Just one phrase we clarified it and this is really important. Thank you, Mr.Katanas. So now we give the floor to the Ministry of Labor please. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the floor. I would like 1st to start regarding the references for the work life balance provisionswith regard to paternal and other leaves. So let me refer to law 4808 of 2021 although already includedin our report. Some things should be further clarified. There are provisions with regard to paternity leave, 14 days paternity leave by the employer for biological adoptive and foster fathers. We have recent data available from the information system where all employers register their employees' data. For the year 2023, 14,50057 male workers have received paternal leave. 6,500 for employers have granted such leaves which are on average 12.5 days out of the 14 days that I have just told you maximum. Furthermore, there is the parental leave provided for in law which is equal to the minimum statutory salary as well as a proportion of Christmas and Easter bonuses and of leave allowance.Which is paid by the public employment service. Also, this leave in case of multiple births is paid for two months more. For single parents, they are entitled to double the duration of parental leave and the amount of the allowance as well. With regard to carers' leave, it is up to five days annually although without pay. The entitlement of paid time off fromwork for the working parent or carer is up to two times a year for urgent family reasons. Also, the entitlement for any working parent of children up to 12 years of age or carer to request flexible working arrangements for caregiving purposes such as in particular teleworking, flexible working hours or part-time work. New entitlements for the equal treatment of working foster mothers of children up to eight years of age with biological mothers.Seven working days of paid leave whenever they undergo medically assisted reproduction methods and prohibition and validity of the termination of the contract of employment relationship of a working father by his employer was established for a period of six months after childbirth. Finally, by a circular from the Ministry of Labor, the clarifications were broadened, the scope was broadened of theleave for single parent families from six to eight working days per year with pay to working parents or 3rd persons who have been assigned the exclusive childbirth by court order and to working parents who have been assigned the exclusive custody of the child. Other legislative initiatives, current ones, by law 50/43 of 2023, one day paid leave per year for a gynecological examination was also extended tofemale workers in the private sector previously established for the public sector. Twenty day paid leave without any condition was established in case of death of a child. Also, the special maternity protection leave and benefit was increased from six to nine months and there is the option established for the mother to transfer to the father a part of the special maternity protection leave and benefit up to seven months. Finally, the entitlement to specialmaternity protection leave and benefit was extended to all insured persons who have received the maternity allowance from the electronic national social insurance institution and this is extended to female lawyers with a paid mandate, freelancers, self-employed persons and farmers. With regard to other policies, employment policies to address the issues of unemployment and low employment ratethat you mentioned, let me refer to the national strategy for active labor market policies 2022 to 2030, which is a holistic strategic framework for the formulation and implementation of active labor market policies in Greece and boosting employment and tackling unemployment at enhancing the capacity, skills and employability of the labor force as well as at improving the current conditions within the labor market. It is structured tofeature around four strategic axes, the 1st of which is strategic axis 1, enhancing employment and tackling unemployment and long-term unemployment. The aforementioned axis incorporates specific measures for women who face disproportionately higher unemployment rate than men. Also may I refer to the national strategy for youth employment 21/27 with the horizon of 2030 recognizes the need and promotes measures for the youth also addressing the gender gap in youthemployment. And final reference to the recovery and resilience facility, significantly contribute to creating new jobs. According to the national recovery and resilience plans, Greece 2/0, provision is made for the creation of 180,000 to 200,000 new quality jobs until 2026 solely through its own actions and permanent increase in real GDP by 6.9% and6.9%. I will not refer to more horizontal measures with regard to minimum wage and seniority benefits that also women are benefited from and give more time to my colleague from the public employment service to be specific with programs. Thank you. Thank you. I'm from the public employment service. This year, we are in the process ofIPA has implemented a number of employment programs with increased wage subsidies for female workers and with emphasis on vulnerable social groups. Specifically, the IPA implements an employment subsidy program for businesses and employers aimed at hiring 1,200 unemployedpersons for vulnerable social groups such as persons with disability, women victims of domestic or gender violence, transgender people, human trafficking victims, et cetera. The program subsidies the employment for a period of 12 months with the option to extendthis period for another 12 months. The subsidy per employment mark for the beneficiaries amounts to 90% of the wage and non-wage cost and up to 800 Euros. Furthermore, businesses participatingin this employment program for persons with disability can also participate in the ergonomic workplace adaptation program. The aim of this program is to promote the access of persons with disability to their workplace. IPA covers 90% of the cost for the necessary expenditurefor the ergonomic workplace adaptation up to the amount of 2,500 Euros. September 2022, the program stopped receiving applications. The budget is 33 million Euros for the employmentprograms and 125 million Euros, 25,000 Euros for the ergonomic workplace adaptation programs and is funded by national resources. Also, DIPA launched in December 2022 a business subsidyprogram for the creation of 10,000 new jobs in the private sector for workings faced the greatest labour market barriers such as persons with disability, women victims of domestic or gender violence, transgender people, human trafficking victims, single parents, mothers returning tothe labour market after raising their children and have at least one child up to the age of eight. The program subsidizes the employment for a period of 12 to 24 months. The subsidyamount amounts to 75 of the wage and non-wage costs and up to 700 Euros. This employment program is funded under the recovery and resilience facility and the total budget amounts to 111 million Eurosand is still implemented. Moreover, a business subsidy program aimed at hiring 5,000 unemployed people aged 18 to 66 with particular emphasis on the green economy sector and women launched lastyear and is still implemented. The subsidy covers up to 80% of wage and non-wage costs for 15 months.The budget amounts to 49 million 880,000 Euros and is funded under the RF. Also, a business subsidyprogram aimed at hiring 4,000 unemployed aged 30 plus in the more developed regions with particularemphasis on women launched in 2022. The subsidy covers up to 50 to 75 of wage and non-wage costs for 12 months. This program is provided by the Greek state and the European social fund and the budget amountsto 26 million Euros. Moreover, a business subsidy program aimed at hiring 5,000 employed people aged 30 plus in the region in transition with particular emphasis on women launched in 2021. The subsidycovers up to 50 to 75 of wage and non-wage costs for 12 months. This program is co-funded by the Greek state and the European social fund and the budget amounts to 32 million Euros. Also, a program aimedat subsidizing business initiative for the employment of 2,900 young freelancers aged 18 to 29 with particular emphasis on women launched in 2021. The subsidy lasts 12 months and the amount of supportfor the new businesses is 14,800 Euros. This program is co-funded by the Greek state and the European social fund and the budget amounts to 43 million Euros. Thank you. Thank you. And I think some ofthis data, we can come again to the Article 13. Thank you so much. So now we have to go to the general Secretariat for Social Solidarity and Fight Against Poverty. I'm reminding the time is running.The Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family, we try to safeguard that all dependent members of the family has access to social care facilities so that especially women will not have to interrupt their careers due to care responsibilities. We try to remove barriers in both affordability and availability,especially for children by increasing supply of the early education centers and by subsidizing the cost for the family. In order to increase supply, the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family since 2018implements a program funding municipalities to create new nurseries. Since 2018, almost 10 million Euros have been allocated for the establishment of 300 new nurseries which will serve almost 4,000 infantsand toddlers. At the same time, our main program for early child care is providing vouchers to cover the expenses for child care facilities, especially for low income families as an important tool tosupport parents through access to affordable child care. The program is co-financed by the European Social Fund and from national resources. Indicatively for the period of September 2023 to July 2024,the total budget of the program sums up to 341 million Euros. The program in the 1st years of its implementation was financed by European Union resources. After legislation passed in 2022, it is funded alsoby the regular state budget and it is worth mentioning the gradual increase of the national resources that between 2022 and 2024 have been doubled and that all families that were eligible for the programreceived a voucher from nurseries. Furthermore, in order to increase the number of places in nurseries for babies aged two months to half and two years old, we will finance through the recovery and resiliencefund a new program for the creation of new early child care services, baby centers. The creation of 2,000 new places has a total budget of 70 million Euros and will cover 50% of the cost. Lastly, I wouldlike to give you some important information on the measures we intend to take for long-term care which will enhance women's condition given that according to 2021 report on long-term care elaborated by theSocial Protection Committee of the Council of the European Union, in Greece women represent 95% of the total number of formal long-term care workers. The Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family has startedto elaborate and is going to develop until June 2024 the national strategy for long-term care implementing the Council of the European Union relevant recommendation on access to affordable high-quality long-term care.In this strategic text, the challenges that we have to address is to make care more accessible, affordable, better quality but also measures will be adopted for carers for their professional development and they are training a lifelong learning. All the challenges will be addressed through the collaborationof the responsible ministries mainly social cohesion, health, labor and after social dialogue with the relevant stakeholders. Especially for Sorry for interrupting. We don't have time. Thank you somuch. Just for 1 min for the Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights. Just for 1 min ,please. And we will finalize with that. Thank you. A few notes regarding the Labor Inspectorate. An independentdepartment to monitor violence and harassment in the world of work has been established. According to Article 17 of law 2021, this Article specifies the extended competency of the Labor Inspectorateas regards incidents of violence and harassment to provide the affected persons under Article 3 of lawfor 2021 with increased safeguards and ensure that all parties responsible shall fulfill their obligations in accordance with the law. Also, Article 19 introduces a provision for special sanctions againstthe employer with the respective reinforcement of the role of the Labor Inspectorate in case his established obligations are breached whether the breaching is committed by himself or a worker and the employer does not take the measures under Article 12 while his treatment shall be restricted in theevent of retaliation by the employer against the affected person. In addition, the Ombudsman whichis the independent authority is designated as the competent body to monitor the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities. Under this Article 25, a special cooperation scheme is establishedwith the Labor Inspectorate which is also an independent authority and the competent national mechanism for monitoring the application of labor legislation as well as for the imposition of sanctions in the context of complex and labor disputes which fall within the responsibilities ofthe local labor inspection units. Mr. Safarov, you have the floor. I see you have a follow-up question.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very much for your answers in this point. I got thevery common answers in this question. Thanks a lot for the understanding of the real situation. We didthe legislation but I have to clarify one point. Maybe I'm wrong. Just clarification from your side.I know the definition in your country about the sexual harassment especially. I know what's happening in the penal code. You have Article 337 in penal code on sexual harassment. What about sexual harassment in workplace and how many cases I want to clarify one more time, cases in court decisions or investigatedespecially on sexual harassment in workplaces. Just a number. Have you doing it or not at this moment? Is it working or not? To make a clear situation at this point. One more point, if you can compare lastten years, it will be wonderful because it's report 2013 and this year. One more point, what about the position of the state about the ratification? International Convention of the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and ILO Convention, Domestic WorkersConvention. Thank you very much. It's clear to understand. One more point, due to the clarification, what about women disabled women in employment? I gave the question, you gave the common answer. What aboutthe special programs and what about the numbers? How you making this as it will develop especially. Thank you very much. Thank you. You have the floor and then I'll give it back to the Delegation.Thank you, Chair. I'll be brief. This is more a cross-cutting question if you like and I'm happy for it to be taken on notice. I understand your comments about empowerment of women in the workplace, removing obstacles and you talked about challenging and eliminating stereotypes in order to do thatthrough the education process. Similarly when answering questions about education, we heard about some of those programs and even when Ms. Mikko was asking about parliamentary and political representation, there was a discussion around role models and stereotypes and encouraging womento get involved. I would like at some point to get a sense of what men are doing. So what and how men are being engaged in this process because as someone said to me earlier, it's one thing for women to see strong role models and for young girls and women to understand what they can do but they might wantto run for Parliament or vote for women for Parliament. But if men's attitudes are not changing and boys, we have a problem. I suspect that might be something to consider in the wrap-up. Thank you, Chair. Thank you very much. I turn it back to the Delegation to say I need you to be very specificand targeted in your responses to the questions asked under Article 11 about sexual harassment and then the two conventions and then the question on stereotypes. Thank you. Thank you. You are soclear. So I cannot say again the same thing. We have to be very clear and very specified and please highlight two or three aspects that we have already prepared about this issue. We have the clear questionhere. So the secretary of the equality and human rights briefs. I have a small note regarding the employmentof women with disabilities. The disability employment gap is at a high level and yet it is more pronounced for men than for women. Women with disabilities, 43.7 of employed persons with disabilities and theirunemployment rate approaches 26%. The activity rate of women with disabilities is 23.6%, lower than the one of women without disabilities but slightly higher than the one of men with disabilities.With regard to your questions, yes, with regard to your questions on domestic workers, I would like to saythat Greece has not ratified the ILO Convention 189 on domestic workers due to certain legal impediments that prevent its ratification, most prevalent of which the constitutional safeguard for the sanctuary of the home. Consequently, although labor inspectorate inspects any private or public workplace or facilityor place where workers may be employed and therefore houses too, a house search is allowed only when and as specified by law and always in the presence of representatives of the judicial authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 9.1 of the constitution. Notwithstanding the above restrictions during thelast five years, 2018 to 2022, the labor inspectorate handled 20 labor disputes in the sector of private households. Also the legislative framework in force provides for protection of the domestic workersunder dependent work contracts which are insured with the EFCA, the insurance institute via a labor voucher and are entitled to receive Christmas and Easter bonuses as well as holiday bonus and holidayallowance as held by the Supreme Court in its decision number 690 of 2017. However, there are issues for the domestic workers that live in the employer's home, live in domestic personnel for whom the provisions on working time may not apply. In any event, at present, the ratification of the set ILO instrumentis not highly prioritized by either the Greek government or national social partners in the view of promoting 1st ratifications of fundamental and governance ILO instruments such as the forced labor protocol that I mentioned earlier today, newly adopted instruments and the labor inspection andthe cultural convention. With regard to your reference to the informal sector, I have sorry, areference to make with regard to a new measure which was adopted in December 2023 and is expected to help undocumented migrants to have access to formal employment. The new legislative provision aims ataddressing labor shortages in Greece and reducing informal economy. It is expected that around 30,000 undocumented migrants will be benefited from the measure, among them a considerable number of women in service sector. Asylum seekers may also make use of this opportunity under conditions. If you wish furtherdetails on that, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum would gladly thank you. Thank you. Okay. SoMs. Diakoumakou from the General Secretariat for Social Solidarity. Thank you very much. I would like asregards special measures for the entry okay. Just two points. One point to have the answer for our colleaguehere but try to concentrate on this, please. Well, a flagship initiative of the Greek state which will support women's integration in the labor market is a personal assistant for persons with disabilities. Thenew policy supports women to live independently to enter the labor market, supports also family members, mainly women who are carriers of persons with disabilities to enter the labor market and the program also establishes a new professional personal assistant which regulates and so far unregulated market inlong-term care. The pilot program is now being implemented with a total budget of 40 million Euros and2,000 beneficiaries disabled are expected to be benefited. Thank you. I think we can we finalize and then maybe we can go back if there is specific questions. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you for thoseresponses to the follow-up questions of Article 11. We will now move to Article 12 of part 3 of the convention and I call upon Ms. Leticia Boniface Alfonso. You have exactly 4 min to make yourpresentation. Thank you. Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chairperson. I welcome the Delegation of Greece and I will askquestions on health. In the midst of the country's economic crisis, one of the biggest challenges regarding healthcare was the lack of a suitable appropriate budget which led to a reduction in quality of healthcareprovided. The WHO estimated that 10% of the total expenditure of the public sector was on health. What percentage is earmarked for women's health? Will this percentage be increased in the immediate future?Despite the cuts in resources, we should commend the state party on the progress made in vaccination against HPV which has been provided for free through the national vaccination program for girls andadolescents. Similarly, the Ministry of Health has focused efforts on improving the national detection program which includes early detection tests for breast cancer and variant cancer. My question is whetherwomen and girls in rural areas, Roma women and migrant women also have the same rights and access to these services. What is being done to ensure that? Moreover, in accordance with the information oncare for pregnant women in 2021, over half of all births were done by cesarean. Is this a choice made by women or is this a public policy? Could you shed light on that for us, please? Furthermore, how areyou preventing adolescent pregnancy, teen pregnancy? Are you rolling out specific campaigns for teenage girls and boys on the use of contraceptives, e.g. ? You have a national action plan for personswith disabilities 2020. In addition to that, what extra measures have you implemented to ensure accessibility for girls with disabilities in terms of access to hospitals and health care centers?The general recommendation 32 of this committee stressed that pregnant and breastfeeding mothers should not be subjected to detention. The question then is whether currently there are migrant and refugee women whoare pregnant and in detention in Greece. According to data from human rights organizations, we have been told that there are pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in detention and that there are problems with food supply and water provided in these centers. How is the state party going to ensure that women and girls,particularly pregnant women, have suitable access to sufficient food and nutrition in detention centers? What is the state doing to ensure that pregnant women and breastfeeding women who are detained have accessto appropriate facilities, e.g. , for breastfeeding mothers if there is a place for them to breastfeed hygienically? What is the state doing to provide assistance for prenatal and postnatal careand ensuring that migrant women can have access to that? On HIV, UN AIDS recognizes that in 2022 deathsdue to HIV/AIDS of women over 15 were less than 100, but it seems that the number of women living with HIV/AIDS aged over 15 is 2,800. What is being done to assist them? Regarding the recent ruling of theEuropean Court of Human Rights in the OJ and others' case versus Greece, it would seem that blood tests for female sex workers with HIV/AIDS without their consent, that this violated the European Convention.What measures are you planning to take, particularly regards blood tests in police stations andthe lack of timely monitoring and follow-up to medical procedures? Thank you. Thank you for that intervention. I now turn the floor over to the head of Delegation to respond to those questionsin a timely manner, keeping track of our timeline. Thank you so much. Time is running again. I wouldlike to give the floor to the General Secretariat for Equality and Human Rights to start for this answer, please. Thank you. A lot of questions. I will try to answer as many as I can. First of all, itshould be mentioned that for 2024 the total health expenditure amounts to 12.8 billion Euros, an increase of about 900 million Euros compared to the corresponding forecast for 2023. To this is added1.5 billion of the health recovery fund. This augmented budget for health services allows for expanded resources enabling the Ministry of Health to address a wide range of healthcare needs, including the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Four priorities have been set by the Minister of Healthto improve the health of the country's population, the treatment of inequalities in access to health services, to promote productivity and quality of health services so as to minimize negative patients' experiences and the contribution to the national health system for social and economic development.So the Ministry of Health is implementing horizontal actions for special groups, including the peoplewho are who have severe problems, psychosocial problems. I don't want to say too many things, but there are programs that are foreseen to be implemented in the framework of the national action plan formental health 2021/2030 which encompasses establishment of new health and mental health services for children, adolescents and adults and their families, services of counseling and psychological supportfor minors, adolescents, elderly and family members who are sufferers of chronic diseases.As regards the women in rural areas and their access to health, in this programming of the Ministry of Health, there is the implementation of the program which entails preventive examinationsto vulnerable groups in remote areas for the period 2021/2025. It includes the creation of a network of health services to cover patients holistically. The aim is to provide additional services throughthe operation of mobile health units on a regular basis to provide primary health care and prevention in all remote areas, islands and mountainous areas. This also includes the program for the preventionof breast cancer. The program is addressed for women aged 50 to 69 years old who are in Greece and have a social security number and incorporates the digital technology in order to make it easier for women to have their examinations easily, directly and free of charge. The free examinations include digitalmammography, clinical examination, clinical mammogram. Over 50,000 mammograms were performed in the 1st quarter of implementation and approximately 3,400 women were diagnosed at an early stagewith the potential for more effective treatment and cure. Also, what else? The other mattersthat you have referred to is the care for pregnancy and the issue of cesarean sections if it is a choice of women or a choice of state. Of course, it is not the choice of the state. It is the choice of womenprobably. We know that the amount of cesarean sections is very high.But the Ministry of Health is taking some actions to try to overcome this. Okay. We have the naturalbirth legislation. It is the law 49.99 of 2022 which establishes natural child birth centers in public hospitals with the gynecological and obstetric clinics and in private hospitals with correspondingdepartments. The same law creates also in-house obstetric services to promote the physical and mental health of the mother during pregnancy and child birth to provide specialized care for each woman and her newborn and to support and empower the woman and her partner in assuming their parentalrole. Home-based midwife care is also developed. Also another measures that is implemented is by midwives associations throughout Greece who provide seminars to pregnant women on normal child birth.We have also the guidelines issued by the Hellenic Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology on the subject.We also have to say that in our country, artificial determination of pregnancy or abortion is legal under the conditions of Article 304 of the penal code. Artificial determination of pregnancy was 1stallowed in Greece by law in 1978. Currently, the artificial determination of pregnancy is, of course, punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years when performed without the consent of the pregnantwoman. The determination of pregnancy is permitted when the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks, when the pregnancy is the result of rape, seduction of a minor, incest and abuse of a woman unableto resist and has not exceeded 19 weeks, and when there are serious indications of an abnormal newborn.Okay. I think we can give the floor to the Ministry of Migration as well because there is a lot of things there to refer. Please, take the floor and I remind you once again the time is running. Yes,thank you. I will try to keep it as short as possible. Now, regarding the reception facilities for themigrant women asylum seekers and refugees, we have we can mention that there are separate safe zone areasfor pregnant women. There are separate areas for the unaccompanied minors, girls. There is a psychologicalmedical care unit in every facility in every reception facility that take care of their needs. Also, there are midwives that inform the women about their care, prenatal and postnatal care. Also during our asylum proceduresin the reception facilities, there are special post special rooms to breastfeed their children. There arelet's say guardians through NGOs that take care of the children so as to fully concentrate on their asylum claim while they are interviewed, they are being interviewed. We have recreation areas in the receptionfacilities and accommodation is accommodation is provided to women in the reception facilities. I usethe term reception facility and not detention center because we have controlled centers under the responsibility of the reception and identification service in the islands and in the mainland also.These are not detention centers. These are controlled centers on the islands for the safety of allrefugees there. And in the mainland, we have open type accommodation centers. Thank you.Just a few words about HIV that you have been asking. There are policies addressing HIV that have been rolled out with the aim to further contain the spread of the epidemic and resolve the practical problems for HIV positive citizens. First of all, I would like to clarify that in the Greekantidiscrimination legislation, HIV positive citizens are protected under the ground of chronic disease.And this there is a very recent law that added apart from employment, this recent law added social protection, insurance, social insurance, education, access to services and goods and taxfacilitation in all the fields where the antidiscrimination law is applicable. Furthermore,there is a law with specific legislative provisions that provide targeted protection for people with HIV by establishing a designated patient registry, allowing electronic prescription of antiretroviraltherapy, provision of prep prevention treatment, reserve the right to foster care and procreation for people under treatment and the organization of medically assisted reproduction units for HIVpatients. These are ongoing projects, planned projects. There isn't something very specific to say about that. Yes. I'm finished. Thank you. Thank you so much. It is ongoing project and programsbut I would like to highlight that it is really important for us and it is high in our agenda and I'm sure that we are going to have news and specific timetable and initiatives in the next week. So we areopen here to discuss more this issue. It is really important for us. Thank you. Thank you to the Delegation for their responses to the question and there are no follow-up questions. Thank you. We willthen move on to Articles 13 and 14 of Part 3 of the Convention and I call on Yamila Gonzalez-Ferrerfor 3 min to speak on Article 13 and then Article 14 for 4 min . Thank you, Chair.I would like to join my colleagues in the Committee in expressing our gratitude to the high level representation of Greece for this constructive dialogue. Bear in mind the economic and migration crisis that the State Party has endured in recent years, one which has had particularly negativeeffects on women among the most vulnerable groups. We would like to know, perhaps ask for additional information to what you have provided already about measures included in action plans for gender equalitysince 2016 in order to promote economic empowerment of single mothers, of refugee women, of asylum seekers, of older women, of women with disabilities and of Roma women. What have these measures been? What budgethas been earmarked to empower women and guarantee equal opportunities? On granting micro credits,an area in which you have over ten years of experience already, what has your assessment been on its implementation and effectiveness? Additionally, the execution of the European Investment Bank in Greecehas granted loans to the tune of 543 million Euros for new, 550 million Euros for new business ventures, including financing specifically for businesses targeting youth employment and women empowerment.Out of these loans granted by main Greek banks as part of this project, would you mind outlining the percentage of funds that are especially earmarked for women business owners? This report, is it onlyfinancing or does the project also include educational and social support for women and entrepreneurs and women that positions of power? What have been the criteria for obtaining these loans, especially specialcriteria for rural women, women with disabilities, single mothers and those belonging to other minority groups?In our view, it is very important that the Institute of the Confederation of Professionals, Artisans and Traders of Greece included the gender perspective in all its measures and initiatives and that it is producing and publishing on its website some scientific studies and texts on matters relatedto gender equality and the fight against discrimination. And then based on these studies and other studies that may be developed in the country, what are the state party's plans to include innovation and digitization in order to improve the economic empowerment of women? What new perspectives do olderwomen have and women with disabilities in order to reduce their levels of poverty? Thank you. Thankyou. Article 14. Thank you, Chair. My questions relate to Article 14, in particular migrant women and also addressing the impact of climate change. According to World Bank data, only 20% of Greek residents live inrural areas. A study of Greek farmer women published in 2017, which you referenced in your state party report, identified dominant gender perceptions related to female farmers, recorded the obstacles they faced and established proposals for greater participation of women in the rural economy. In 2016, women accountedfor 34.8% of farm or livestock holders, showing a slight upward trend. But can you update us on this figure and detail any specific grants or programs in place to support rural women to acquire propertyand/or livestock? I note that Greece suffers the largest climate-related economic losses of any European country. In 2022, the loss per inhabitant was three times the European Union average. Iacknowledge the implementation of the national climate law, 49/36 of 2022, and commend the recent adoption of agenda perspective in environmental and climate policies. Thank you for your remarks this morning, Secretary General, especially because of the disproportionate impact of climate change on womenand girls. However, we have actually heard criticism about the state's approach to climate adaptation, where local authorities have been referred to as untrained, underfunded and understaffed in this area. I'm wondering if you can detail the programs in place to support women and girls who have sufferedthe effects of recent climate change, particularly the economic effects of climate change disasters and their outcomes. Secretary General, we have heard how Roma women face severe discrimination and exclusion. Colleagues have talked a lot today about that. There are concerns about the increasing gender gap ineducation and employment due to early marriages. I do note there is an inconsistency of the reporting on the exact number of Roma women and girls in Greece. I'm wondering if the State Party can please clarifythis figure for us. I note your colleagues' comments earlier about how groups are counted and it's on the basis of religion and not ethnicity in the case of Thrace, e.g. . But would you considerexpanding the census procedures and questioning to include those which identify linguistic, religious and ethnic diversity so as to assist the state to identify women belonging to these intersectional minorities? Finally, through you, Madam Chair, I turn to a significant concern for our dialogue.And that is the alleged push backs of refugees and asylum seekers and the treatment of women and girls in detention. There is an estimated roughly 108,000 forcibly displaced stateless persons in Greece. Werealize that this is a great issue for your country, places a lot of pressure on you due to such sort of regular movements. But we understand from the National Human Rights Commission and others thatthis situation has improved over the last seven, eight years. However, NGOs including the Border Violence Monitoring Network have asserted that detention has become an intrinsic part of the push back process and is being used as a method to inflict inhumane treatment against push backsurvivors. So I ask what steps has the State Party put in place to ensure that women and girls are protected from such violence in these environments and what mechanisms are in place to monitor and hold accountable authorities that may be engaged in such abuses of power. And those alleged abusesinclude things like sexual harassment, physical beatings and the withholding of food and water.Further to this in 2021, BVMN documented 69 cases of refugees of which they claim at least 20.2%demonstrate detention which would meet the threshold of secret or incommunicado detention.Does the State Party have plans to address such alleged detention practices? And I note the terminology about control centers I think earlier but perhaps that can be explained further. How many ofthese women and girls have unconditional access to family members, an attorney, an independent physician while in detention and what has been done to ensure that they are aware of their rights while seeking asylum and what mechanisms are available to them to report and seek legal justice for these reportedincidences of violence and abuse. Thank you. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to Articles 13 and 14. Thank you so much for the interesting question and because we are here tohave a dialogue between us, you give us a start for a very fruitful dialogue in this very, very crucial issue that also in Greece and European Union will work a lot. So I would like to start from theGeneral Secretariat for equality and human rights and I think we have a lot to say about this very crucial issue and for your position. Please. The questions raised on back loans and accessto financial credit which to my own disappointment too are not going to be enough or adequate becausewe haven't had the chance, not the chance, we haven't got availability of data from the banks on the percentage of the loans granted to women. We know they have special programs, not a lot, but we don't havedata on the percentage between men and women that received such loans, women entrepreneurs. However,as a result of the recent, quite recent law of 2020 introducing micro credit provisions which are introduced for the 1st time by legislation in Greece and this law is already mentioned in thereport, there were three organizations officially licensed by the bank of Greece to provide micro credits. They haven't provided us with specific data, one of them because the other two don't have data. They informed us that they don't have available data yet on women. But the Greek investmentbank has set the goal and is already planning to create a special micro credit fund only for female entrepreneurs. It was announced in the end of 2023. So micro credits, it is a very new field in Greeceand I really hope that it will work because it is already being implemented even in the beginning. There is also consultation led by the Greek government in order to proceed with special scheduled productsto guarantee equal opportunities for women in this new micro credit provision. Nothing specific yet, though. And finally, I'm going to mention a few words about the gender innovation lab for women whichwas established as an initiative from the general Secretariat of equality and human rights and the ministry of development. There is a branch in this gender innovation lab called innovation unit for women established in the end of 2022, it is very recent too, to act as the lab's business arm and promoteissues of innovation and entrepreneurship of women in Greece. What they do, they participate in European projects on digital skills. They operate as scientific consultants in digitalization projects. Itdoes mentoring work with NGOs for startups as well as individual entities and it has also developed and created an extended network of cooperation including gender equality committees of the research centers,European international organizations and companies, mostly mentoring for the time being. I don't want to take any more of your time. Just for some data, in 2022, for the startups, 23% of women was thepercentage of owners of startups and the penetration of female entrepreneurship in 2022 reached 25.5% inGreece. We need work. Go to the next to Ms. Yakumaku from the general Secretariat for social solidarity andfinding against poverty that we have very crucial projects there. Please, Ms. Yakumaku. Thank you very much. As regards the fight against poverty, I would like to mention that we have a national strategy forsocial inclusion and poverty reduction 2021 to 2027. All the categories and groups that were mentioned such as women with disabilities or elderly women are included in the specific actions. I would like nowto give you some figures on poverty disaggregated by gender. In the period of 2010 to 2024, we observed similar movements, notably during the years of the financial crisis, the gender gap in poverty ratesnarrows although female poverty rates consistently surpassed those of males. Since that time, the gender disparity in poverty rates has been eliminated with women experiencing slightly higher poverty rates comparedto men. As of 2024, the relative poverty rate for women stands at 19.4 while for men it is 18.2%. As regardsthe poverty rate in Greece by age group, in 2004, the elderly population over 65 years of age exhibitedsignificantly higher poverty rate of 28 compared to the overall population, 18%. However, this rate gradually decreasedover the years, reaching its lowest point at 12% in 2018. And now it is at 15.8%. As regards persons withdisabilities, now we are going to elaborate a new strategy, national strategy of the rights of persons with disability from 2024 to 2030 where all issues will be addressed. For the time being, I would like to inform theCommittee that in May 2023, as regards financial support of persons with disabilities, welfare disability benefits were increased by 8%. And I would also like to mention that disability benefits by law are not consideredan income and persons with disabilities receive any means tested welfare benefit that they entitle to such as child benefit, housing allowance, et cetera. As regards older women, I would like to mention that there are two schemesof financial support, two welfare benefits addressed specifically to elderly persons aged 65 years and over. The socialsolidarity benefit for uninsured elderly which covers living expenses and the housing allowance for elderly. As regards socialsolidarity benefit, the amount can be up to 360 Euros per month. And according to recent data, 33,000 persons receive thisbenefit while women are 2,000, almost 2,000 and men almost 10,000. We notice that the percentage of women beneficiaries is higherthan for men. As for women, it was more difficult to cover the minimum insurance period for pension entitlement. I would also liketo mention to this specific programs for the categories mentioned, for the groups mentioned, but I would like to mention also theminimum guarantee income which is the horizontal program implemented in Greece to address extreme poverty which following a pilot implementation in2014 was added in the Greek welfare state since February 2017. I would like also to mention that in the revision of the Greek constitution in2019, a clause was incorporated in Article 21 according to which the state shall take care to ensure that all citizens enjoy a decent standard of living by means of a system of minimum guarantee income as is specified by law. As regards this benefit, it starts from 216 Euros per month. And I would liketo mention that it was increased by 8% from December 2023, marking the 1st adjustments since the beginning of its implementation. Actually, during for the time being, there are 200,000 applications approved and 52% are submitted by mail applicant and 47%47% by female applicants. And I would also mention here that what is our main purposenow is to increase the complementary social services, benefits and goods that are linked to this benefit and activation services that is the promotion of beneficiaries intothe labor market. I would like to mention here that during the COVID pandemic, this for the 1st time, this benefit addressed also the support of women who were victims ofviolence and were living in shelters. Actually, it was an exception to the rule. So since 2021, the minimum guaranteed income is provided also to women living in shelters forvictims of violence, while the rule is that the benefit is granted to households and not to persons who accommodate in public or in private social structures. And most importantly, I wouldlike to mention here that in case that these women leave the shelter and they enter the labor market, they are still and they have income from salary services or from community services programsor any other program of work, their wages are not calculated in their income and they are still eligible for minimum guaranteed income for one more year. The provision is to support womenin this transitional period of their life. Sorry for interrupting. Okay. I think I have to givethe floor to the Ministry of Citizen Protection, please. The principle of non-refinement in the Geneva Convention is a cornerstone of the international legal framework for the protection of refugees.Strict adherence to this principle applies to any form of forced removal. The Hellenic Police has circulated clear orders and guidelines regarding the actions of its personnel for the protection of fundamental rights and dignity for all migrants or refugees arriving in our country, especially women and children who are in vulnerable positions, paying particular attention to their rights to apply for international protectionand the legal remedies provided for it. It is clarified that no 3rd country national who applies for international protection and until his application has been examined shall be returned in full compliance with domestic and international law and especially in accordance with the requirements of the Geneva Convention. Furthermore, to try to be briefly, the Hellenic Police which is the competent authorityconducts border surveillance, that is with full respect of the fundamental rights of every 3rd country crossing illegally the borders as enshrined in the respective international and EU law. Just to add about recently monitoring of compliance with fundamental rights has further been strengthened in Greece. The legislation has a provision for theestablishment with the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum of the post of fundamental rights officer responsible for the collection and preliminary evaluation of complaints regarding alleged fundamental rights violations during the reception of asylum procedures and a special fundamental rights compliance committee with the mandate to monitor the relevant procedures and the implementation of the international EU and international legislation in the fields ofborder protection and granting of international law. And just to close with the police arbitrariness, efforts deployed to prevent police arbitrariness do not constitute a fragmentary response to emerging incidents but seek to further promote and ensure a human rights protection culture and to take account of the reports and recommendations of international bodies calling for robust action by the Greek authorities for the prevention and handling of acts ofillegal treatment. For this purpose the implementation of the relevant orders by the Hellenic police headquarters is continuously monitored and when necessary additional measures are taken immediately. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I will give the floor to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum. Please we have to finalize in a few minutes this article. I can understand that it is really crucial for us to clarify for Greece a specific issue for pushbacks and formigrants. It is very crucial for us. So just for your patience for one or two more minutes. Thank you so much. Please. Yes. Regarding the position of the fundamental rights protection officer in the Ministry of Migration and Asylum we need to highlight that regarding reception conditions and asylum proceduresin Greece the fundamental rights protection officer collects, gathers all complaints made and forwards the complaints to the national transparency authority. Also we have established a committee for compliance with fundamental rights within our ministry and this committee is responsible for monitoring the procedures and implementation of nationalEU and international legislation in the areas of protection and granting of international protection. Thank you. Thank you. And just clarifying, give me a minute that I want to be clear about that Greece collects sex disaggregated data on theon the 12 critical areas of concerns of the beginning platform for action. Just to clarify concerningin the collection of quality data in the central level, data collection which covers grounds of discrimination such as gender and age in the most developed in Greece as well as across Europe. Data collection on disabilities, really important, is gradually improving partiallydue to obligation of Member States have the regard under the article 20 sorry 31 of the United Nations Conventions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Data collection on the discrimination grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientationand gender identity tends to be the least developed. Regarding the broadening of consensus question this is really important also. This is a matter that the state will examine in collaboration with the Lenin statistic authority and independent authority is the competent body to ensure thequality and continuous improvement of the country's statistics. Just to clarify the issue of the statistics for us it is really important. Now I will give the floor to Ms. Zerva to the General Secretariat for Social Solidarity and Fight Against Poverty for 1 min just to conclude.One minute please. Thank you. With respect to data on Roma populations it is true that they are not registeredas Roma. So we usually use special criteria as well as the element of self-identification to collect data. In order to form a more specific image though the General Secretariat for Social Solidarity conductedin 2021 a nationwide mapping of Roma settlements in cooperation with the municipalities with high Roma population as well as Roma organizations. In total 145 municipalities completed the questionnaires basedon field visits and available administrative data. Currently we are preparing the online platform where all the data will be publicly available to all. The main results though of this mapping arethat there are about 120,000 Roma people in Greece, that is 1.13% of the country's population and 34.3%of the population is children aged between 0 to 15 years. 33.6% are women over the age of 16 and 32.1% are men. In order to verify and further segregate our data the General Secretariat will update thisnational mapping in the framework of the Roma platform program for the period 2023/2025 funded by the EU rights equality and citizenship program. One of the main actions of this project will also be areport on Roma socioeconomic characteristics at national level such as housing, education, health and social inclusion in order to create a database with their needs and expectations. Thank you. Thankyou so much. Just to clarify that we work a lot in the issues of climate crisis and we have a new task force that is the 1st one in Greece under our Secretariat and we have already found out that a lot of thethe issues after an earthquake or after the disasters three times more women are more valuable than men. If we take into consideration the poverty issue 70% of women are more close to the poverty thanmen. All of the effects of the climate crisis are worse and worse for women. So we prepare a report on this issue. We work very close with the NGOs, with the universities, scientists and other ministries inorder to prepare something that will give us the guidance to work for the 17 SDG targets that is really important for us to implement and have very positive steps in our government and to finalizewhich is the way of economic empowerment of women because unfortunately when we have floods in Greece in Thessaly region we have a lot of women that they are in more dangers than men. That means that they arenot secure and they don't have the skills to face this catastrophe and unfortunately most of the women stay with children and the elderly waiting for orders from the men to take the 1st step. All of thesethings we try to conclude in a specific report that we are going to finalize in the summer of 2024 and we will be ready to share with you. It is really crucial and important to work on that. Okay. So ifwe can go to the next I thank the Delegation for their responses to Articles 13 and 14 and you have a comment I assume. A quick comment. Firstly to thank you for those constructive answers. Secondly toacknowledge the Greece does play a disproportionate or has a disproportionate load in relation to refugees and asylum seekers and not all countries have to deal with that. I acknowledge that but you can understand the Committee's concerns when it is brought to our attention or claims and testimonies are made thatpeople have been held or detained in secret or in improvised sites such as stables, abandoned buildings and derelict railway stations. Information on that in writing would be appreciated and I do acknowledge and thank you for the concise elucidation of the international law. I do acknowledge that peoplecan enter illegally but as you know just because someone does so doesn't necessarily mean they can be pushed back and I grant that's not a legal term but under the Geneva Convention we know collective expulsions and the principle of non-reformal, that is a standard principle. Again I acknowledge thereference to the European Court of Human Rights which has effectively legalized the process but I'm just asking the State Party to consider some of the tactics that are used as well as ensure the protection, particularly of women and girls who may be migrants, refugees or asylum seekers in this process. Thankyou. Thank you very much for that response. We will now move to we will now move to part 4 of theConvention which covers Articles 15 and 16. Our colleague who has responsibility for this particular Article is not with us today. So I will be reading her intervention that she has drafted and it concernslargely questions on family law and the law of 4800/2021 and the reforms of that law. So the questions that she is asking are regarding the legislative reforms of that particular law. Are women forcedto undergo mediation even when there is an indication of domestic violence? Does the specialized training for judges in cases of family disputes to the national school of judges include training on domesticviolence? Are mothers accused of bad exercise of parental care if the child refuses to be in contact with the father? Are other reasons for the child's refusal investigated and how? Are there statisticsof how many mothers and how many fathers are ruled to be badly exercising their parental responsibilitiesand the sanctions imposed on them? Would the state party adopt a rule on equal matrimonial property division upon divorce and death to reflect the value of care and equality within the family and to guarantee women the option to leave marriage including abusive marriages without the fear ofpoverty? Are there statistics on divorce and parental separation as risk factors for women's and children's poverty? The committee applauds the state party for changing its law so that the recourse to a Muftiin matters of marriage, divorce or inheritance is now only possible with the agreement of those concerned.What measures are taken to educate Muslim girls and women that they can refuse the religious tribunal's authority and turn to a civil court? Can the state party provide statistics on how many still opt for a Mufti in family matters and the Muslim population? And on judgments of civil courtsoverturning a Mufti's judgment that discriminates against girls or women? And finally, can the state party provide current data on how many girls under the age of 18 are in a marriage recognized bythe state as opposed to their male counterparts under the age of 18? Noting that marriages under Hanafi law which are recognized under Greek and civil law are currently permitted for children as youngas 15 years old with parental consent, what steps is the state party taking to ensure that girls are being protected from nonconsensual child marriages? And finally, was there a follow-up study on thegendered and the gendered intended and unintended consequences of the law of 4800/2021? Thank you.And I'll give the floor to the Delegation. I will give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Decafenas, please. Thank you very briefly on the question about marriage under the Sharia law.As mentioned in the question, the recourse to the Mufti is optional, voluntary and depends on the consent of both parties to a dispute. It would seem, we do not have specific statistical data but it seemsthat most members of the Muslim minority have recourse to the ordinary courts, the ordinary provisions of the civil court. I would say let's say four-fifths as a rough estimate. So the vast majority prefer tohave recourse to the ordinary, to the general legislation, the general provisions of the civil code.And as mentioned in the question, the decisions of the Mufti have to be declared as enforceable bythe ordinary courts. In most cases, the decisions of the Mufti are accepted, are declared as enforceableby the competent court. There are some examples of refusal to give this, to consider them as enforceableand the number is rather small. I think that most of them concern the competence of the Mufti becausethe civil court has the possibility to decide whether a specific dispute fell within the competence of the Mufti. It is not about the substance but rather on questions of competence. In any case, the law providesthat the decisions of the Mufti have to respect international constitution and international law, including the principle of equality. There is a specific reference to the right to equality enshrined in theconstitution. I would like to give the floor to the General Secretariat for Social Solidarity in the fight against poverty. Please, a concrete contribution specific about the issues that you have discussednow. Thank you, Ms. Erva. Thank you. I would like to repeat with respect to early marriages betweenthe Roma community, that they are not legally recognized marriages according to the Greek civil codewhich provides, which defines the conditions for valid marriages in the Greek legal systems. There are no exceptions to this process. So what we do is focus on the empowerment of Roma women and try to enhancetheir participation in education and workforce. Apart from the connection I referred to earlier on welfare benefits and the school attendance connections which has increased the rates of compulsory education, Iwould also like to refer to other measures to promote education such as the successful program funded by the ESF of the previous period on education and the reduction of school dropouts. Universities, Romamediators and NGOs worked on the field to raise awareness among Roma families, promote integration of Roma children in schools, support them with their studying and finishing compulsory education and provide counseling to parents. In total more than 27,000 Roma pupils benefited from this project which iswhy we are designing to continue it to the current ESF programming period. I would also like to refer to a few employment measures specialized for Roma. First the subsidization of business initiatives aimingat promoting employment for new entrepreneurs aged 20 to 44 from marginalized social groups. The program is funded by state and European funds and provides for the subsidization of about 400 Roma with 15,000Euros to start their own business. The 2nd program is funded by the RRF with about 3 million Euros andprovides for training and subsidized employment for about 500 young Roma in technical jobs. Please note that in order for these programs to be approved for the funding by the European Committee the gender dimensionis a prerequisite. Thank you. I give the floor to the Minister of Justice just to finalize with the lawapproach this article, please. Thank you. In 2021 Greece significantly amended the Civil Code provision related to family law through the law 4800 of 2021 on reforms regarding parent-child relations and otherfamily law issues. The law has since triggered widespread concerns in public debate as regards the impact on custody and visitation rights in situation of domestic violence. Deprivation or limitationof parental rights cannot be adopted as ancillary sanction to a criminal conviction but requires an additional procedure. Article 15.11 of the Civil Code states that all decisions on custody must be takingbearing in mind the best interest of the child which according to the 2nd paragraph of the said article are best served by the effective participation of both parents and the upbringing of the child.The law establishes additional criteria to be considered in order to safeguard the rights of each parent in the exercise of custody rights. The Greek legal system offers certain possibilities to suspend, limit or otherwise regulate the exercise of parental rights by parents who have been abusive towardstheir spouses or children. According to Article 15.37 of the Civil Code courts may withdraw parental rights from a perpetrator who has been sentenced by a filing judgment to at least one month imprisonmentfor certain offenses against the child. Article 15.32 of the Civil Code also includes the issue of judgment of the 1st instance court against the parent for domestic violence or for offenses against sexualfreedom. The requirement to undertake mediation before initial civil proceedings also includes ageneric exception in domestic violence cases. Moreover, the law, the above mentioned law considers good relations between the child and one parent as an obligation of the other parent. Accordingly,Article 15.11 of the Civil Code explicitly includes as a criterion to be considered in the assessment of the child's best interest the ability of each parent to ensure that the rights of the other parentregarding relation with the child are safeguarded. Article 15.32 also includes the disruption of the child's emotional relationship with the other parent as a ground for withdrawal of parental rights includingof the nonviolent parent. Thank you very much. Thank you. I thank the Delegation for its responses tothose very specific questions. Does the country rapporteur have anything else she would like to add at this point? No. Just to thank the Delegation for the goodwill and at times candid remarks and hopethat you will have an opportunity to address any of the questions that you didn't have the opportunity to address during this forum. I commend you on many, many good policies and good laws but we're happy to work with you on that issue of implementation because clearly it's a gap that you have identifiedand the Committee is well aware of and hopefully using your words through you, Chair, to Madam Secretary General it will be a roadmap to achieve that sustainable gender equality to which you referredin your opening statement.

The report also explained the progress made and the achievementsthat have been achieved since the submission of our combined 2nd and 3rd reports. It also showed through the core document updated in July 2019 how we have further worked on theprotection of human rights in general. Allow me here also to review the most important achievements that were that we witnessed at the beginning of this 3rd decade of the 3rd millennium that represent pillars supporting human rights in my country including the issuance of thebasic law of the state also known as the constitution amended by Royal Decree No. 6, 2021 on the 11th of January, 2021. The basic law constitutes the legal reference framework that governs thework of the various powers and separation of powers. It also defines the aspects and foundations of building the modern state, the relationship between the institutions, the responsibilities,rights, duties and mandates of the various agencies and institutions. It also ensured that every one of these organs carries out its national role in harmony and integration between theCouncil of Ministers and the Council of Oman with its two wings, the State Council and the Shura Council and ensuring the independence of the judiciary in carrying out its role. The 4th periodic report stated in paragraphs 20 and 22, the article stated in the basic lawof the state which guaranteed the achievement of equality between men and women which also affirmed the principle of justice, equality, equal opportunities among citizens. These are the pillars of our society guaranteed by the state. Article 18 of the basic law stipulatesthat life and dignity are the rights of every human being and the state is compelled to respect and protect them in accordance with the law. The basic law also guarantees many political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights enumerated in 30 articles in the 3rd chapteron public rights and duties. Ladies and gentlemen, His Majesty Sultan Haytham bin Tariq, may Allah protect and preserve him, has taken many steps and measures that prepare for the implementationof the future vision Oman 2040 which aims at having by 2040 sustainable and smart citiesin Oman in which social economic prosperity and social justice will prevail. A state in which economic growth is achieved alongside social well-being under flexible and responsible state agenciesthat enjoy comprehensive governance. And the national priority, the vision mentioned a strategic direction based on a decent and sustainable life for all. This direction achieves a numberof goals including a conscious cohesive society that is socially and economically empowered, especially for women, children, youth, people with disabilities and most vulnerable groups.The 10th five-year Development Plan is considered to be the 1st implementation plan for our Vision 2040. It includes many programs and activities aiming at empowering women economically,socially and politically. It is worth noting that all the Committees entrusted with the preparation of this plan were supervised by women. In terms of the reforms to implement Oman Vision 2040,Royal Decree No. 33/2021 was issued according to which the social protection fund was established as the official organ responsible for all social protection initiatives and programs in my country.It is an organ or entity that enjoys financial and administrative independence. Its mission is to implement the provisions of the social protection law and to cooperate with the authorities concernedwith programs of protection, empowerment, integration, care and support to all kinds to deliver these programs and to deserving groups. Royal Decree No. 50/2023 was issued regarding the social protectionfund system and the social protection law was issued by Royal Decree 50/2023 to reformulatethe protection system. Social reform in the Sultanate of Oman is the culmination of a round of ambitiousreforms led by Tawazon which is a high level national government program to achieve financialsustainability. Allow me to mention that the new social protection system has many basic features that benefit several segments of society, children, women, people with disabilities, elderly. Women's rights were specifically mentioned in most of the social protection benefits stipulated by the law,namely widows, divorcees, women with disabilities. Women were also covered in all social insurance programs, insurance for the elderly, disability, death, maternity leave insurance, job security insurance,employment insurance, work related injuries and occupational diseases insurance, sick and unusual leave insurance and expats insurance. The number of persons registered for social protectionbenefits amounted to 1,376,176 cases, 600,000 of them, that is 49% were female by the end of January2024. Honorable Chairperson, the labor law issued on July 25, 2023 by Royal Decree No. 53 of 2023to emphasize and enhance what is included in the social protection system and what the Sultanate of Oman has committed to with regards to international and regional agreements and treaties in terms of guaranteeing the rights of worker prohibiting any form of forced labor retention of the worker's passportand making a complaints and grievance system available to workers in the facility including resorting to courts in the event of arbitrary dismissal as well as other benefits. Regarding maternity protection and child care, the law included a set of articles that guarantee maternity protectionincluding the woman's right to obtain paid leave for a period of 98 days instead of 50 days in the previous law in accordance with the standards of the International Labor Organization and duringthis period, the system pays the contributions on the mother's behalf. It should be noted that the maternity leave is not linked to a specific number of children. The law has also grants women the rightto enjoy an unpaid leave to care for her child for up to one year and grants the breastfeeding worker an hour a day to care for a child. This is left to the workers to determine. The labor is countedamong the actual working hours. It begins after the end of the maternity leave for one year. The law alsoprohibits the employer from terminating the employment contract for any reason including gender, origin, language, religion, social status, disability, pregnancy, child birth or breastfeeding.In the context of reforming the legislative system, Royal Decree 23/20/23 was issued on April 16 regarding the marriage of Omanis to foreigners according to which it was approved to authenticatethe documents proving the marriage of Omanis to foreigners within the Sultanate of Oman in accordance with the provisions of law and Royal Decree.

Royal Decree No. 3 of 2019 was issued ratifying the amendment ofthe 1st paragraph of Article 20 of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and Withdrawing All Reservation to the Fourth Paragraph of the Article 15 of the Convention.We have also acceded to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by RoyalDecree No. 46 of 2020 and joined the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and DegradingTreatment and Punishments by Royal Decree No. 45 of 2020 and joined the Royal Decree No. 44 of 2020to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and joinedby Royal Decree No. 16 of 2023 to the Arab Charter on Human Rights.

Please also note that such information will also be published on the CEDO website for the 87th session websitefor the 87th session as it forms part of the public dialogue. Lack of inadequate or inadequate replies to questions raised by theCommittee may result in follow-up questions and eventually may be reflected in the concluding observations of the Committee. Ishould also like to indicate that if necessary, the Delegation may be asked to limit its response should this become necessary dueto time consideration. I will now call upon the experts who wish to pose questions under the various articles of the Convention. Experts are also reminded to respect the time limits for questions. Where questions are not sufficiently answered, experts will begiven an opportunity to ask follow-up questions for 2 min . We will start with questions relating to Article 1 and 2 of the Part 1 of the Convention and now I would like to give the floor to our country level Chair for Oman, Ms. Maya Morsi. You have the floor, Maya, please.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to bid a warm welcome to the high levelOmani Delegation to this constructive dialogue with the Committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and also with a viewto protecting women from all forms of violence. We can see that there is political will to achieve this in Oman and I would like to hail Oman'sachievements notably the adoption of the basic law through a Royal Decree. It underscores that families are the bedrock of society ensuringcohesion and equality. The constitutional definition of discrimination normally only covers Omani nationals but Omani law encompasses allpersons. We congratulate you on the amendment of the laws, the nationality law, the social protection law amongst others. This reflects Oman'scommitment to human rights treaties including this convention. You recognize that there is a binding nature in these conventions.Oman has also referred to measures taken to incorporate the convention into domestic policy. So what is Oman doing to integrate the provisions ofCEDAW into the legal framework, what policy measures have been adopted to combat discrimination against women according to the convention, specificallyhow does the basic law which was recently adopted incorporate the constitutional definition of discrimination and ensure that it is enforced? I would also appreciatereceiving information about the law which ensures nondiscrimination against women in the world of work and how are the rights of migrant workers,particularly domestic workers covered by the law. I would also like to know what efforts are being undertaken in order to ensure that domestic laws are alignedwith the convention fully. I would like to know how the Ministry of Justice works with stakeholders with a view to enacting laws which is the procedureforeseen in a cabinet resolution of March 2021. I would also like to know how the state party ensures that the convention is an integral part of the domestic legalframework. Oman has organized workshops in all governorates in order to ensure women's access to justice. Over 1300 women have taken part in these workshops.There have also been call sign I workshops among others for awareness raising. I would like to know how girls' rights are integrated into education curricula. The higher education law alsorefers to equality between the sexes and there has been research on this. So a constitutional nature has been conferred on the legal aid system in order to ensure that it's accessible to all. The government has also set up an online platform for receiving complaints and translators and interpreters are available incourts. There have been comparative studies between domestic law and the convention, too. So with all of this in mind, I would like to ask the following questions. How do you ensure that legal services are available to all women, particularly migrant women, domestic workers and women with disabilities? I would also like to know how efficient the callsign I campaign has been. I would like to know the state of affairs concerning studies on political and legal reforms. 35% of women took part in the drafting and adoption of the Oman Vision 2040. I would like to know how have you ensured that women's roles have been included in that vision and how have youassessed women's participation? I notice that you have supported regional peace efforts through reconciliation between parties to conflict. You have tried to ensure equal participation and the protection of various people's interests. I would like to know how women have been integrated into local and regional as well as international peaceinitiatives. I have noticed that Oman has lifted its reservations on Article 15 of the convention. I would like to know if you intend to lift your other reservations. Thank you very much. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the questions. Members of the Delegation should introduce themselves as they respond to the question. Please have the floor.Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Members of the Oman Delegation please introduce yourselves when you take the floor. Please be brief and to the point so we respect speaking time. Thank you. Good morning. My name is Micah Sureshi. I am an assistantin the public prosecution service, I would like to ask you for the questions on equalityand nondiscrimination. As you have mentioned, the recently adopted basic law ensures equality between men and women. There is also a provision in the basic law which states that the stateensures equality between women and men and provides care for children and people with disabilities.As for the antidiscrimination law, if you look at Article 6 on the law on interpreting legislation,it states there that there is no discrimination between women and men and this is what shouldbe understood by law. There is no discrimination on the basis of social status, origin or any other. Also in the education law, there is a provision which refers to no discriminationon the basis of language, social status or any other ground. When it comes to facilitating access to justice, there are a number of different laws that speak to this matter in the Sultanate.A number of measures have been taken to ensure access to justice in line with the Oman Vision2040. The public prosecution service and other legal entities under the higher counsel haveset up online platforms for receiving complaints. So they don't have to go, people don't have to go to the premises of the prosecution service in order to make their complaints. This facilitatesaccess to justice. There is also access to justice regardless of what language is used,thanks to the translation service and that is free of charge. Thank you. Good morning. I workin the Muscat court of 1st instance. Thank you, Ms. Morsey, for your questions. You havereferred to legal aid and whether or not the Sultanate provides legal aid for migrants ordomestic workers, a decision has been taken setting out the criteria for obtaining legalaid. This was decision 91 of 2009 which refers to the provision of such legal aid. Those provisionsare applicable to all whether they are Omani nationals or foreign citizens. All if one ofthe criteria is inability to pay for a lawyer in such cases legal aid is provided to the applicants.So regardless of the original social status of the applicant, the applicant will have access to legal aid and also online legal aid is available to all without any fear of intimidation. I thankyou. Abdul Aziz from the ministry of labor. Thank you, madam, for the questions. You askedus questions about the new labor law and antidiscrimination. This is decree 53 of 2023 which prohibits discrimination.When we drew up that law, we held meetings with trades unions and employers' representativesto hear their views on the draft law. You have also referred to access to justice for workers.Labor law prohibits discrimination. Workers are defined as anyone who is in the employee of someone else. So there is no discrimination in the law. Article 23 of the labor law refersto employers' duty to treat employees equitably and fairly. In addition, the labor law alsosets out the principle of equality. When it comes to legal aid for domestic workers, thereare departments in the ministry of labor that are responsible for this matter. So legal aidis provided to domestic workers or those working in retail. In 2019, there were over 900 complaintswhich were handled by the relevant department in the ministry. In 2021, 1615 complaints weremade. They can be made online through the ministry's hot line or through the embassies of the countriesof origin of the migrant workers. Good morning. I'm Intisada Abdullah. I work in the ministryof the economy in the planning department. When it comes to women's participation and the five-yearplans taking stock of women's needs, I can inform you that Oman is working on women's participation in the drafting of five-year plans and national policies among others. Women are key partnersin development. So Omani women take part in the implementation plans for the Oman Vision 2040. Asyou mentioned, Madam, women make up 35% of the members of committees set up pursuant to Oman Vision2040. Women's aspirations are referred to in the strategic programmes which have been adopted forimplementing Oman Vision 2040. I would also like to point out that the five-year plan which is the1st implementation plan for Oman Vision 2040 was drafted under women's supervision. So the aim isto make our long-term objectives feasible through midterm implementation plans. Some women havechaired some of the committees established pursuant to Oman Vision 2040. So women have also been selectedto manage 70 initiatives in view of their capacities. Women have been taking part in all stages of theadoption of these plans and contribute to central work plans and decentralised ones. So as I was saying,women take part in these committees and, in fact, some of them make up 60% of the committee members.Women also play a leading role in the area of wellbeing. Women also can enjoy all the services withinthe framework of the plan including in the area of wellbeing. We seek to empower all groups such aswomen, children, persons with disabilities. You have referred to strategies and laws to empower womenin line with their rights. Legal protection is also provided to women. We have adopted policies whichenable us to achieve a balance between professional and private life. Measures have been taken to ensurethat women participate in decision making and occupy high ranking positions at international level. This is thanks to cooperation between local authorities, civil society representatives and other stakeholders.Similarly, we also have a programme which is designed to enhance the framework for women's economicempowerment, particularly women from disadvantaged groups. We also have a social protection system anda labour market system that guarantee women's rights. I thank you for your attention.Wrong channel. Arabic colleagues, please change channel. Regarding the question on revising laws and legislations, before the issuance of the basic law which determined the social principles that clearlystipulated that the family is the core of society, the state shall respect the values of the family and ensure equality between men and women and secure the rights of children, women, disabled persons andothers. Article 21 highlighted the equality between men and women and that all individuals are equal in rights and duties regardless of sex, race, religion, social status or others. In this context, theministry of social development after the issuance of the basic law established a working group of various stakeholders from various ministries and civil society organisations to review the legislations pertainingto women and we proposed a set of laws that need to be amended. This working group was able to amendcertain laws, namely laws pertaining to social protection of women, labour law that gave women many benefits and advantages, namely working women, be it in the private or the public sector. The ministry ofsocial development and as part of implementing its social work initiative integrated all relevant initiatives,campaigns within the six pillars of the strategy of our ministry. Since we are nearing the end of thisstrategic plan, we are now cooperating with our partners to elaborate a national women plan or action plan and there will be a pillar or a chapter dedicated to women, peace and security as per the internationaldevelopments. Our ministry with social partners is keen on working with NGOs, charity organisations, legal organisationsworking in the field of women, peace and security so that we can be following up all the international and regionaldevelopments in this field. Thank you. Director of women directorate in the ministry of social development.Regarding the national programme entitled call thine eye, this is a programme about women victims ofviolence. This is part of the international campaign entitled 16 days to combat violence against women. We have worked on this campaign for four years and we have gathered indicators that reflect the interactionand the reactions from this campaign. This campaign included many initiatives, activities such asconsultation, training sessions with higher education students and also what are the mechanisms to protect women from violence. We have determined some indicators to measure the interaction in social media platforms,assessment of these initiatives and events and also gathering the opinion of the youth. Regarding the2nd section of the question regarding the assessment of the mid-period, according to our plan, we have periodic assessment of this plan. We have an assessment every six months and we measureit in terms of economic indicators, strategic indicators and others. All of this is managed by women in leadership positions. Women are an essential partner in the development process and we are keenon seeing all components of society represented in such campaigns. We are now working on the assessment of the 10th five-year plan in the midterm so that we can further accelerate the activities for thecoming period. Thank you. Ma'ani Bousaidi, Ministry of Social Development. Regarding the reservations,namely reservation number 16, this reservation has nothing to do with national laws and mechanismsand this does not prevent us from having our own reservations. Thank you. You mentioned, Madam, therevision of some laws, namely the personal status law and the social protection law. Allow me to say that the social protection law was repealed by Royal Decree 52 of 2023, which is the social protectionlaw. So this new law repealed the social security law. The social protection law comprises many provisions. We will have the opportunity to tackle them later. So the social security law was replacedby the social protection law, interpreter's note. Regarding the social security law, I amHamoud Bin Hamad, the chief of the Bureau of the Ministry of Social Development. The social protectionlaw comprises five pillars, benefits for women, widows, divorced women, supporting low income familiesand others and older women and women with disabilities. They were all entitled to some benefits accordingto the social protection law. Do any of the members of the Delegation wish to add anything, any reply? Andplease be brief in your replies if you have anything to add. I have something to add regarding the reservations. We are reviewing our reservations to the conventions we have ratified. There are threead hoc Committees within the Ministry of Social Development that review the CRC, the CEDO and the CRPD. These Committees hold regular meetings in order to examine and discuss national laws and ways toharmonize them with international agreements and we have also worked on amending some laws in light ofthe CEDO and the CRC. These reservations have do not violate the rights of women. Rights of women areguaranteed by the basic law of the state. Our basic law reiterate the principles of justice and fairness, equality between men and women and all laws under the basic law are not in contradiction with theprovisions of the CEDO. Thank you. I see no requests for the floor. I thank the Delegation for their concise and to the point answers. Thank you very much. Now we will now move to the questions relatingto Article 3 and 4 of Part 1 of the Convention and Your Excellency, please allow me to pose the question by myself regarding Article 3 as a member of the Task Force. Thank you very much. First regarding nationalmachinery, could the state party elaborate more about the national machinery? Who has the overall responsibility for protecting and promoting women's rights and coordinating relevant ministries? Isthe National Commission for Family Affairs or Your Excellency yourself, the Minister of the Social Development? Please tell us who are the members of the National Commission for Family Affairs? I guess that the members are all from the ministries. What is the relationship between the National Commissionfor Family Affairs and the Committee to Monitor Implementation of the Convention? Does the Committee to Monitor Implementation have the authority to make recommendation to the Commission for FamilyAffairs on women's issue? How does the state party ensure the effective implementation of the CEDO Convention at the government rate and the local level? Second regarding the national women's strategy,could the state party elaborate further what are the key components and the concrete objectives of the national women's strategy? In what ways does the strategy safeguard the rights of women, children, andpersons with disabilities? What are the gender indicators to measure the progress and the impact of the strategy? How does the state party implement, monitor, and evaluate the progress of the strategy?Is the strategy supported by an appropriate budget? What percentage of the government budget does it account for? Thirdly, regarding the Oman Human Rights Commission, I learned from the statement that thestate party adopted the lawyer degree 57/2022, strengthened the independence of the Oman Human Rights Commission by introducing the mechanisms for appointment of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of theCommission. So is the change enough to obtain a status accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions? When actually does the state party expect the Commission to obtain a status?What measures have been taken to strengthen the authority of the Oman Human Rights Commission?Where does the Human Rights Commission's budget come from? Can the Commission manage its budget independently?The Committee knows that the Human Rights Commission received 101 communications regarding women's rights during 2017 to 2023. So could the state party share examples of complaint cases on women's rights andtheir outcomes? How does the Commission ensure the timely and effective resolution of human rights relatedcomplaint? First, regarding the national government, non-governmental organization and women human rights defenders, the Committee notes that the process of enactment of a new law governing private associationis still elaborated in the legislative session. So could the state party tell us more about this new law?How does the state party collaborate with non-governmental organizations and institutions in implementing the national women's strategy? What measures have been taken to protect women humanrights defenders from harassment, violence and intimidation? Thank you, Your Excellency. My question followed by Ms. Egobamian on Article 4 on Temporary Special Measure. Ms. Egobamian, you have the floor,please. Thank you, Madam Chair. I also welcome the Oman High Level Delegation and congratulate the Royal Sultanate on the range of efforts to implement and fulfill its obligations under CEDAW, especially throughthe use of Temporary Special Measures, TSMs. Oman commitment is evident in the increased political rights granted women through the Royal Decree No. 75/2020. This has resulted in 16% of cabinet posts heldby Omani women and another 18% appointed to the Council of State. From the 2020 Census, women commendably constitute 31% of government departments and 28% of CEO positions in the private sector. The progressin women's leadership in the Shura Council remains slow, growing from 1.2% in 2015-2019 to 2.3% over a period of nearly ten years. However, parity is yet to be achieved in any sector. Furthermore, the use ofroyal administrative guidelines, executive orders, quotas and other affirmative measures to eliminate stereotypes that underpin women's exclusion and under-representation in critical sectors is notvisible in priorities like the macroeconomic framework and national development plan. This use of TSMs across boards seems to reveal an inadequate understanding of their role as tools for meeting CEDAW provisions andstandards outlined in GR5 and 25. TSMs are proven strategies for effectively addressing vertical and horizontal discrimination or exclusion in a time-bound manner to achieve targeted outcomes that transformthe lives of women and girls with substantive results by harnessing women's assets, skills and potentials.My question is for the State Party. What additional TSMs will the State Party adopt to address historical gaps and contemporary challenges hindering progress towards gender equality in sectors liketechnology, housing, engineering, industry infrastructure, investment trade, to mention a few? Are there plans to build the capacity of public officials on the use of TSMs? Has the State Party considered affirmative procurement,hiring and promotion in key sectors to bridge gender disparities and what specific gender targets have been set for different MDAs in the SDG implementation plan? A UNFPA fact sheet shows literacy rates of 85.6%for females and 93.6% for males. Nonetheless, significant employment gap persists with employment rate of 20% for women versus 80% for men. How will such disparities be corrected given that with a 59% male and 41%female population, the State Party is below parity in all sectors? Please provide data that will ensure that OMAN initiatives cater to the specific needs of women given the burden of unpaid care work which curtailswomen's engagement in public life at the leadership level and weakens their ability to pursue political interests. Finally, has the State Party considered the use of gender responsive budgeting, bonds, wealth and investmentmodalities for creating an inclusive economy as a TSM? What concrete TSMs will OMAN pursue to ensure redistribution of wealth, productive resources and benefits, especially for vulnerable groups of women? Thank you very much, Madam Chair.Thank you. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the question. Thank you. Allow me to tackle some ofthe questions briefly. Then I will give the floor to the members of the Delegation to give the floor to my colleagues, especiallythe Ministry of Social Development which is mandated with all issues pertaining to women in addition to the National Commission for Women. In the Ministry of Social Development, we have a Directorate for Family Development, the head of whichis present with us. We have also a Directorate for Women Affairs presided also by one of the members of our Delegation present here today. We have also the National Commission for Family Affairs which coordinates all issues pertainingto increasing services to women at all levels and to discussing challenges and issues facing family ingeneral and women in particular. The Committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of the CEDOis the National Commission established by the Ministry of Social Development headed by the Minister of Social Development andcomprises representatives from all other government entities, stakeholders, civil society and Omani Human Rights Commission. It is a partnership between all public, private, civil society entities in order to take part in discussingall challenges to elaborate plans and initiatives that aim at implementing the various articles of the Conventionthroughout our plans, laws and action plans and also to elaborate legislative frameworks and to discuss all these laws, to review them and to put them in a frameworkthat is under the Convention. Any Convention ratified by my country has a force of law and any lawthat is adopted after ratification should take into account the terms of the Convention. That's why we respect all articles of the Conventionthroughout our laws and all laws under examination right now work on harmonizing our internationalcommitments, be it the CEDO, the CRC, the CRPD and we are fully committed to implementing these terms. We have reservations only when it comes to provisions of the Conventionthat are not in line with the Islamic Sharia. All laws are reviewed and if we have all the laws or laws that were passed in the past, they are reviewed, harmonized accordingly.There is also one main point regarding indicators and data and the members of the Delegation willdiscuss them but we would like to say that all parts of the government are coordinating to consolidate the data that we have at hand so that the data reflect the reality about the situation of women and their representation at all levels and all sectors. Many of these indicators and the data that we have at hand, the ones published, do not reflect the real progress that theOmani women have made in all aspects of life. Therefore, we say that some of the data available need more clarification and they need to reflect the progress that the Omani women have made. Omani women have contributed in all sectors. There are no barriers whatsoever that prevent the Omani women from enjoying the rights or occupying keyassociations on equal footing with women. If there is any discrimination, it is positive discrimination for women based on their key role in the society and in the family. Also,sometimes we jokingly say or men sometimes jokingly say we hope that we have an association for the rights of men in Oman on equal footing with women. And now we also have in Oman a dayfor Omani women. So this was based on a royal decree by the late Sultan, may his soul restin peace and we on this on Omani women's day, we celebrate the Omani women who have participated in culture, who have written novels, participated in the theater or have made scientific achievements.We are proud of the achievements of women in the literary field and the sports field and the cultural field and all walks of life. Also, women with disabilities have the same amountof concentration and are accorded the same level of priority especially given their special needs. We make sure that they access all the rights on equal footing with women without disabilities.So there is no discrimination against Omani women with disabilities whatsoever. On the contrary, the political leadership have paid enough attention to Omani women with disabilities and have madesure to protect them in all sectors and in all ways possible. Thank you. I would like to respond to a question about the National Committee for Family Affairs. It is presided over by theMinister of Social Development and there are members from the following ministries, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Cultural Sports and Youth, the Ministry of Media, the Ministry of Social Development, the Omani Chamber of Commerce and the Omanipolice and the public prosecution. There was also a question about the budgets of the committee. The Ministry of Finance is changing the way it finances the committee, the public budgetof the state is the main reference and the main resource to provide the social stability and social support and the women were supported by this budget in many ways. Thank you. Regardingthe Omani Committee on Family Affairs, there was a Royal Decree 16/27 that provides for allthe services and also it coordinates with all authorities. There is coordination between all the authorities working for the family affairs and the recommendations of the international andregional events on the family affairs are being followed up. Also there is cooperation and coordination with all organizations catering for family affairs and financial resources arebeing allocated for family care within Oman. Laws are being enacted and the executive regulations of these laws are laid out in order to make sure that they are implemented in a way thatcaters for the well-being of families in Oman. Also there is another committee which is the committee on monitoring the recommendation of CEDAW. It is another independent committee formedof the current members and presided over by the Minister of Social Development. Thank you.On the question about how does the state party work or implement the women's strategy at the level of governorates, there are different directorates and departments that cater for the needs of women in all governorates. It is not just in Muscat. So these directorates provide the servicesfor women in all fields in coordination with other partners. Regarding the strategy as we said in the answer to the previous question, in the women's strategy we try to work in many fields and it isalso part of the strategy of the Ministry of Social Solidarity until 2025. The strategy places some basics and pillars that contribute to the advancement of women based on a human rightsapproach. Regarding the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities, we have a lot of partners that cater for their needs and the executive plans of the strategy have been putin place. We are now also working on a national plan for the women's the women's strategy that will be in place and this plan aligns with Oman Vision 2040 and with the Sustainable Development Goals.Also regarding the communications, the 101 communications referred to the nationalhuman rights commission, we are looking into these communications and we are trying to identify theappropriate intervention that would address the situation of these women. Sometimes women arereferred to specialized institutions that cater for their needs and we cooperate with other partnersto address these issues. Microphone. Regarding the plans for the implementation of SDGs,the Sultanate of Oman has taken a participatory approach to implement the SDGs. We have put in place national mechanisms that complement one another. We have a high level national committee combining members from the public and private sector, the civil society, the council of Oman,and the committee also features high level participation by women, young people and other groups.The committee also supervises and monitors the reports on the progress made in the implementation of SDGs. We have also a dashboard that shows the progress made in the achievement of these SDGs.Sultanate of Oman has submitted its voluntary report of the SDGs in 2019 and currently we are working onthe national the next national voluntary report to be reviewed in July of this year. The report will cover the progress made in all SDGs including the 5th SDG on gender equality and also it addressesthe progress made in the economic and social and political empowerment of women and the protection of women. The report, the national voluntary report will be made available to the UN and alsothis is in general. Also the women's participation in committees and working groups are now up to 43%.Thank you. Also regarding the question on the Omani Human Rights Commission, I would like to say that the Omani Human Rights Commission after the relevant decree was issued it has been aligned with Parisprinciples. It has financial independence and it has financial allocations from the Ministry of Financeand also the commission will be again re-audited by GANRI and also I would like also to tell you aboutthe procedures taken regarding the women who report any kinds of harassment. I mean women human rights defenders, the Omani police and prosecution and other law enforcement agencies receive all of thesereports and response to them within 24 hours and the complainants do not even have to go in person to the law enforcement authorities but they can submit their reports or communications electronicallyand the investigations start. Thank you. Regarding the political participation of women, the Sultanate of Oman sees to it that women participate on equal footing to men in all levels and in key positions.Omani legislation did not discriminate between men and women and the right to stand for election or to be elected. The women represent a high percentage in the municipal councils. We have six members inthe municipal council and also women have participated in the 10th period of the Shura Council until between 2023 and 2026 and also they accounted for more than 40% and also there were 65%of the candidates were women exceeding the percentage of men and also the voters, the women voters accountedfor 48% in Oman. Women have also been chairs of four main committees that monitor the electoral process.The law on the appointment of the members of the Shura Council issued by Royal Decree 54 of 2023 provided for electronic registration of the candidates including also the persons with disabilities. Therewas a digital platform titled vote that also caters for the needs of persons with auditory disability andvisual disability. Also a training manual was issued for women to enable women to be elected and to maketheir voices heard by the entire society. A number of packages and measures were put in place including four training programs in cooperation with the Arab Women Organization and also a targeted women andleadership positions. Also we stressed that our development plan over the next four years will include a lot of women and will make sure that women are featured highly in our community.Good morning. I'm from the committee regarding the economic initiatives that cater for women's needs. Regarding the economic initiatives that target women, the Sultanate of Oman is continuing with a program to empower women, especially women with low income and women with disabilities. We have a number of smallprograms and businesses for women. We are also providing outlets for marketing the products of women. Training programs are also put in place for the economic empowerment of women. The number ofwomen benefiting from these programs until 2023 numbered 1926 beneficiaries. Also we launched themaximum initiative in 2023 which is a digital platform that provides marketing for the productsof these women and also works as an e-marketplace for such products. The women beneficiaries from theseplatforms are now 70 beneficiaries. Also we have programs for the empowerment of women with theinmate women in prisons in cooperation with the Omani police. There are comprehensive programs that enable them to start businesses in the future and to find some outlets for marketing their products. Wehave 47 programs targeting 21 inmates. My name is from the Ministry of Education. With regard to theadditional measures taken to address challenges in access to the science and technology fields by women, the head of Delegation has mentioned in her opening statement that the Spanish news agency EFEhas referred to the closure of the gap between the two genders in Oman. The Sultanate of Oman was mentioned as being one of the countries that saw the closure of the gender gap in science andtechnology and mathematics. It has also exceeded some countries in the economic, the organization for economic and cooperation and development in Europe and also the national statistics center inOman has mentioned that the percentage of women in science and technology and engineering and mathematicsare now outnumbering men. They accounted for 53% in pure mathematics and 53.1% in chemistry, 51.9% inphysics and also in the relevant scientific colleges, women accounted for 71% and also females outnumberedmales in scientific colleges, the percentage were 46% compared to 45% males. Regarding illiteracy,illiteracy reduced in 2021 by it was reduced to 5.8% compared to 6.3% in 2018 which shows that thereduction is going in the right path and in the right direction that we aspire for in Oman.Regarding women and their presence and participation in political life, the ministry over the past fouryears have been implementing strategic program that is gender based and for the review of national plansand the targeted and the plans and the targeted and the workers and the government authorities and we have completed this program in cooperation with the regional and international organizations like ISCWA and the Arab women organization.

The ministry of social development this year has also signed a programfor cooperation with the Sultanic academy for administration to build the capacities of a numberof women to enable them to stand for the election and to participate in the political life in Oman by standing for election and being elected in the ministry and the council so that we can haveeffective women leaders who can participate in elections and to be elected and to become effective members of the society regarding the building the capacities of officials working on women's field inthe ministry of social development and in the judiciary and in the law enforcement agencies.A program of cooperation has been launched with the higher judicial council to enable the workers and the council to improve their capacities. We have three especially on three agreements, the CRC,the CDAO and the CRPD. There is a program for training persons on the contents of the variousconventions including this one. Good morning. I work in the statistics office. With regard to science andtechnology, please allow me to inform you that Omani women are professors in higher education in thesefields. 36% of students in these subjects are women or were but this rose to 42.1% in 2021/2022. Withregard to women's contribution to research, there are 34% of researchers who are women. This reflects a clear increase compared to previous years. Thank you, says the head of Delegation. I would like to knowif there is anyone else who wishes to take the floor. With regard to stereotypes, when we look at life in the Sultanate, then we see that there are no stereotypes of women. Women are well integrated.So as I was saying, we were trying to answer the question on stereotypes. As I was saying before,Omani women have reached high level positions. Women participate in public and political life in ameaningful fashion. Women hold key positions and you can see that from the composition of the Delegationhere today. The Sultanate has taken measures in order to combat gender stereotypes in the field ofeducation. We have adopted laws to this end. We have disseminated the contents of the CEDAW conventionand there are pamphlets and booklets with the contents of the convention to combat stereotypes and to notlock women into preconceived images. We work with various organizations represented in Oman such asEsquah and the Arab League on capacity building programmes for women. These activities are undertakenin the framework of various ministries' activities including the Ministry for Social Development. We strive to ensure that women play a predominant role in social and economic life and to ensure public andpolitical participation. The Head of Delegation, I thank you very much. Dear members of the Delegation, could I please request that you be brief in your replies? We have very limited time to respond. Iwould like to know, ladies and gentlemen, if you have anything to add. A follow-up question. First, regarding the NGOs, how does the State Party try to coordinate with the NGOs? The 2nd one is Iunderstand that the Human Rights Commission will be accredited a status but still it is not effective. How do you try to the Human Rights Commission independent? Thank you very much. That is two quick questions.So please give me answer one or 2 min . Sorry, excuse me. There is another follow-up question fromMs. Agobamian. Ms. Agobamian, you have the floor, 2 min . Thank you very much. I want to appreciate the Delegation for all of the questions and all of the responses. However, it appears that some of myquestions were not properly interpreted. The questions that I raised were the types of temporary special measures that the State Party has adopted and the training that has been provided for state officials onthe use of temporary special measures. Has any such training because I know you have talked about a lot of training but I am talking about training on temporary special measures and the 3rd is because such a training would cover appropriateness of the training, effectiveness of the training and would set targetswhen you would know that you have actually achieved the target that you set as a country. The other question I raised was about the issue of budgeting. I asked whether you had a budget system, a gender responsive budgetsystem, a wealth bond or any kind of because I have heard you have small programs but what targets did you set in those sectors that you would then say you have achieved that target? And the last question wasyou were talking, trying to respond to stereotypes. My question was not on stereotypes. There is an article on stereotypes. I said what targets have you set in how to redress stereotypes? Did you set any in anyparticular sector because you responded about STEM? I didn't really ask about STEM. I said you have high level of education. However, there is low employment of women. How do you reconcile both? You are investingin women's education but we are not, women are not visible in the employment market. Thank you.Non-governmental organizations but could you give us, add the answers to the how do you defend the human rights defender? Thank you very much. Could you give us briefly your answers? Thank you.Thank you. We will try and clarify the situation by stating that NGOs play an effective role and holdmeetings with competent authorities on relevant human rights issues including women's children's andpersons with disabilities' rights. We listen attentively to NGOs' views and for certain programmeswe have a partnership with NGOs and work with NGO experts in order to build the capacity of governmentofficials. We also have partnerships with UN entities such as at UNICEF and with ESCWA, the Economic andSocial Committee for Western Agency. So we have partnerships and when I say we, I'm referringto the Ministry for Social Development and we work on trying to improve the services we provide to women, children and persons with disabilities. We also try to improve the training of state officials workingin these areas as well as for family members. We know that girls and children face challenges inthe settings in which they live. We raise awareness about cases of abuse, of exploitation in homes,schools and workplaces. The ultimate aim is to ensure that women can enjoy the same rights as men. We havea strong legal framework but we face the challenges of the mindset of certain people. We raise the subject of individual freedoms and I would like to underscore that our society respects women and attributesappropriate value to women's skills and competencies. The very highest authorities in the country consider that development can only be achieved when there is a true partnership between women and men.Development does not depend on one group rather than another. Thus we call upon both women and mento engage. When it comes to appointments to high office, there is no discrimination against either women or men. That's the culture, that's the mindset that we work on. We try totake advantage of everybody's skills and competencies. When it comes to the budget forprograms, we have a general budget, not a specific women's budget but we have a budget for women'sprograms within certain ministries. I can give you an example of my ministry. In the Ministry of Social Development we have a budget for women's empowerment. In order to try and ensure that women will holddecision making positions, we work on the basis of partnerships and try to implement programs whichwill disseminate a culture of female empowerment. We also have a strategic four-year program with theaim of ensuring women reach decision making positions in both the public and private sectorthat they attain positions in ministerial councils or in the Shura Council. So we try to identifywomen who have the appropriate skills. We provide them with support so that they can attain these key positions. We also try to ensure that these women are well prepared for electoral campaigns so thatthey can disseminate their competencies and that society will place their trust in female candidates when they run for elections. Obviously we cannot influence voters as to whether they should choosethe male or female candidate. We have an online voting system and we leave it to the members of our society to choose who they feel best represent them in the various councils. So we try to empower womenso that they can influence society and drive forward change in society. We have a plan in the ministryfor social development which comprises specific programs and mechanisms which will allow women thento attain these decision making positions. We also have the necessary protection mechanisms and we are going to amend the laws and regulations in the area of labor so that we can offer comprehensiveprotection to female workers so that they have a safe working environment and that there are no obstacles to women achieving their goals. I would say that all these goals are absolutely key. We alsotry to make sure that women can play an effective role in building our society regardless of the position they occupy. So we have women working in small and medium sized enterprises and this is aparticularly important area for empowering women from disadvantaged groups such as women with disabilities. We try to identify projects that these women can take up. These are part of thefeatures of the women's empowerment plan in the ministry for social development. I will now hand over to the members of the Delegation if they wish to add anything to what I have said. Thank you. Thankyou very much because we are a little bit behind. So let us move to and then after the lunch maybe you can have a chance to add your explanation. Thank you very much. I would like to invite Ms. Vanda Naranato talk about Article 5, 3 min followed by Ms. Daniel Rinalte to talk about Article 6, 5 min . Ms. Vanda Narana, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I join my colleaguesin welcoming the high level Delegation of Oman to this constructive dialogue. I would also like to thank you for the opening statement and your commitment to build a modern Oman based on human rights principles. I would also like to congratulate you on the steps taken to prevent gender basedviolence and eradicate harmful stereotypes against women so far. The new penal code, Royal Decree No. 7/2018 criminalizes acts causing harm to persons with heightened penalties for crimes against women.However, it does not contain provisions on honor killings. Domestic violence is believed to becommon but is generally unacknowledged and prosecution of spousal assault claims are very rare. The rape is criminalized under Article 218 of the penal code relating to indecent assault. It excludesmarital rape. How has the implementation of the new penal code impacted the prosecution and prevention of gender based violence? Does the state party plan to adopt a specific separate law criminalizingdomestic violence including marital rape? What measures is the state party taking to reduce the prevalence of honor killings? The toll free protection line was launched in January 2017 as part of the national mechanism for the protection of girls which receives reports and complaints around the clockwhich is very good. The ministry of sorry, the ministry of social development, particularly thefamily protection department provides shelter care and rehabilitation to women victims of abuse. How has the toll free protection line helped in reducing violence against women? Can migrant women facingviolence easily access the shelter services? In its reply to the list of issues, the state party had mentioned that it would provide updated statistics on the monitoring of cases of violence against women during in this next dialogue. And in keeping with this commitment, can the state party provide statisticaldata on gender based violence against women including domestic violence and violence faced by migrant women on the number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions and the sentences imposed on perpetrators and reparation provided to victims? This is a heavy question but if you are not able to answer in time,maybe you could give it in writing as well. In spite of the steps taken to criminalize female genital mutilation, alternative sources suggest a relatively high prevalence of this practice. Has the state party put in place any educational and public outreach programs to raise public awareness against thepractice of FGM? On stereotypes, I commend the state party on having adopted the social action strategy for 2016-2025 which emphasizes fair family oriented policies and programs to support family stability.However, discriminatory stereotypes underscoring the subordinate of women to their husbands and other male relatives persist and undermine the rights and capacity of women and girls to develop their personal abilities and make free choices about their lives and life plans. Please share significant actions takenby the social action strategy in eradicating gender stereotypes against women including migrant women and the stereotypes they face and addressing cultural misconceptions. Has there been any impact assessment of the strategy? Has the state party taken any steps to launch information campaigns with the mediato strengthen understanding of substantive gender equality and continue to eliminate discriminatory stereotypes? Thank you. Thank you very much. Now I invite Ms. Elaine Alte for Article 6 for fiveminutes. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to welcome the official Delegation here on the occasion of the constructive dialogue with the CEDAW Committee. I will be addressing Article 6 ontrafficking in women and girls and exploitation of prostitution. I am coming back again to domestic work sector and it seems that there is some legal and policy gaps which facilitate the cases oftrafficking and forced labor in Oman. A survey conducted on Sierra Leonean domestic worker women in Oman found that 84% of the 469 workers interviewed do not have their passports with them. Withholdingthe passport has been banned under the so-called secular number 2 of 2006. However, the Committee could not receive more details on the application of this secular in the practice. So maybe you could bringus some clarifications. COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation of female domestic workers. Women reported increased working hours and other restrictions. Survey showed that 99% of domestic workers do nothave a day off a week and 80% of them work between 16 and 20 hours a day which if true and here is that is why we have this constructive dialogue for clarifications, it might be defined as a form ofslavery. Migrant domestic workers also experience restrictions of movement. According to the research, again, 91% of domestic workers are not allowed to leave their employer's home. At the same time, theso-called lease money is one of the most common tools that keeps a domestic worker bonded to her work and place. This has become a common and accepted practice which is it seems not regulated or addressed legally.Could you please comment on this? In the introductory statement by the Honorable Head of the Delegation, it was mentioned that a new labor law and it was mentioned also by other members of the Delegationand our expert was adopted on July 25, 2023. It was assured that the law guarantees workers' rights prohibiting any form of forced labor and providing the complaints and grievance mechanism for workers,including turning to the courts in cases of unfair dismissals. In this regard, they wonder if there is a clear and accessible complaint mechanism established for all cases of discrimination in thelabor world, including domestic work. How many complaints, if it works, this mechanism, it was received from migrant domestic workers. Otherwise speaking, the new law covers migrant domestic workers. Theestablishment of a specialized department within the office of the public prosecutor focused on trafficking cases signifies a determination to prosecute offenders in human trafficking cases. Alsoin 2019, the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking established a rapid intervention task force for bringing perpetrators to justice. However, between the period 2021 and 2022, it seems, Omanmade no efforts to investigate or prosecute any traffickers of migrant workers for forced labor.What explanation can be provided for this situation? How does the State Party ensure the effective enforcement of the Combating Trafficking in Persons Act which was adopted 2008? It is commendablethat there is established a specialized government shelter for victims of human trafficking which provides housing and health services for victims and food. However, it seems that the shelter is accessibleunder certain conditions. That is, it is open only for trafficking victims who would stay here longer and who would agree to take part in court proceedings as witnesses. Does the governmentconsider lifting this condition and accept all trafficking victims and survivors in need? Finally, I wonder about the situation of sex trafficking in Oman which is connected with the demand for sex marketas it is in many other countries. Prostitution is illegal and criminalized in Oman and penalties are harsh but they only affect migrant women, it seems, and never the client. Why the client is not responsiblefor buying sex in Oman if prostitution in the State Party is illegal? Thank you. Thank you very much. I now give the floor to the Delegation but I would like to remind the Delegation to speak adequatelyso that the simultaneous translator can properly translate. Thank you very much for your cooperation.Regarding question on violence against women and that there is no law on violence,the Sharia and the criminal code or penal code clearly say that any harm or act of violence iscriminalized according to articles of the law passed in 2018, the sanctions have been increased up to 15years of imprisonment in addition to ad hoc sanctions for those who are under the age of 18. In my countrythere are no crimes of honor or honor killing crimes and anyone who exercises moral violence or physicalviolence on women according to the current laws, the criminal code or other laws such as the law to combat human trafficking or law on cyber crimes criminalize such acts. According to the statisticsthat we drew from the public prosecutor office, the cases of crimes of violence against women amountup to 1,888 cases from 2017 to 2021. It is 1.4% of all the cases before the public prosecution. Wereiterate to you that the Royal Omani police and other law enforcement agencies and public prosecutorare working expeditiously whenever there are cases pertaining to women or family issues. These cases are referred expeditiously to the relevant courts. The public prosecutor believes that it is veryimportant to act expeditiously on such cases. That's why we have now an ad hoc department for family and children affairs and they examine all cases and complaints pertaining to women, family issues andothers. We have also trained the public prosecutor staff through internal training sessions or externaltraining sessions in order to be able to deal with such cases. Thank you. Head of Delegation, aclarification from the Ministry of Labor regarding the female domestic workers, migrant workers. We wouldlike to say that the Ministry of Labor through our ad hoc departments that are available in all the governorates, so we work on raising awareness to these female domestic workers, migrant workers andwe also have kind of brochures on all border posts so that we can increase the level of legal awarenessfor these migrant workers and how they can contact official channels in case of abuse by the employers or in case of any complaint. These brochures are published in many languages. If I remember well,it is translated into 14 languages, namely representing the nationalities working in the Sultanate of Oman. Regarding withholding the passports, in the previous law,there was a circular by the Minister of Labor that we should not allow withholding passports. Now, this is more enforceable, more stronger provision as it is part of Article 147 of the labor law andthose who withhold the passport of their employees will have to pay a penalty of 500 to 1,000 OmaniRials. In case domestic workers have their passports withheld, they can file complaints at the Royal Omanipolice or the Ministry of Labor. Regarding COVID-19 pandemic and the extended working hours for these domestic migrant workers, we reiterate that there are dispute settlement departments in the Ministryof Labor that examine such cases. According to the new labor law, we have quick mechanisms to settlesuch disputes and we have an ad hoc judge who examines them. That's why a quick resolution of thedispute is now ensured according to the new law. We have also a new law on facilitating the litigationprocess. It was passed in 2020. It also enables domestic migrant workers to expeditiously file complaints. Regarding restrictions on the freedom of movement, the Royal Omani police cancelled the noobjection certificate so any worker whose contract expired can choose another employer without an authorization from the previous employer who brought him into the country. There are restrictions inthis context and any Omani or non-Omani workers can still look for a job for in the period where he islooking for another job for 10 h a week and they can, as I said earlier, choose another employer without the no objection certificate from the 1st employer who brought him into the country.Regarding complaints filed by women domestic workers, we have recorded more than 934 complaints in 2022and 1675 complaints in 2023. Sanctions and measures are taken accordingly after examining the case,meeting the employer and the employee or employees and to enable them to reach a conciliation underthe guidance of a judge and which is implemented according to the law. If no agreement is reached by mediation or conciliation, they can resort to the courts. The new labor law is applied to workersin both the private and public sectors. However, the minister can issue guidance on the conditions of work of domestic workers and now we have committees in the ministry of labor that work on passing 40ministerial decrees that will regulate the work according to the law and there will be a special chapter on domestic workers according to international standards adopted by the ILO.Namely, when it comes to nonwithholding of passports, banning forced labor, allowing annual leave orweekly days of leave, health insurance and other rights and entitlements as stipulated by the law onregulating the work of workers and employees in the private sector. We also have channels of communicationwith countries of origin of these workers. There are some conditions such as imposing some conditionson the recruitment offices to send the contract of employment to the worker while he is still in his country of origin. In this contract, they should clearly stipulate the number of the members ofthe families. They will work for number of days of leave and other conditions. This is an integral partof the model contract of work that we will endorse in the future. All contracts of work should be legalized and authorized by the ministry of labor and we have a system to protect the salaries and wagesand we constantly work on protecting the rights of workers in both the private and public sector and,of course, including the domestic workers. Regarding the question on shelter of victims ofviolence, this shelter hosts victims of domestic violence and of victims of trafficking. They providesocial protection services, psychosocial support and to enable the victims to recover their confidence in themselves. We also provide healthcare services and we provide treatments in cooperation with thevarious health centers in the country. We also provide them with legal protection in cooperationwith some civil society organizations. We give them pocket money. We give them money for their travel back home and we also provide them with a ticket to return to their countries. We alsocooperate with the association when it comes to defending the rights of victims of human trafficking and with a certain law firm that is also helping us in this context and we also communicate to therelevant embassies the number of their nationals who are in the shelter. And we also work on the transfer of the kafala system of these victims. Regarding the temporary special measures toensure equality, we would like to say that our country and as part of our national entities, we have a continuing cooperation program that started in 2018 between the Ministry of Social Development and theSupreme Judicial Council so that we can provide yearly training sessions to the judges and law enforcement agencies. We also explain the provisions of the CEDO in all training sessions and we also try to reachout to the youth and to explain to them the provisions of this convention. Regarding the measures takento end stereotypes, the role has been focused on school curricula. The Ministry of Education worksthrough the general directorate for school curricula. It works to analyze school curricula through all stagesof education. So curricula were analyzed and modernized to be in line with all the developments ofthis era and the principles of gender equality were included inside these curricula and all stereotypesregarding gender roles were eliminated. Also, the state authorities have also contributed to this effort and they contributed to the concepts to be included in the curricula. Also, we have cooperated with theArab Women Organization in Cairo to produce guiding manual for educators and teachers on how to inculcatethese principles and the 1st in the grades 1 to 4 and we will also issue another guiding manual forother grades as well. Regarding FGM, the Ministry of Education is also leading a number of awarenessraising campaigns in all government rates. We are also issuing manuals and guiding brochures on the healthof adolescents and the proper growth and development of adolescents and there is also a guide on abusethat was issued in 2020 that also tackles the sexual abuse, moral abuse and other types of abuse and howthe social worker can intervene in cases of abuse of different types. The strategies of addressing anddealing with the student offenders and the students offended as well. Also, we have worked on the proper social parenting and how parents can deal with children and how they can allow them to express theiremotions and how that impacts the psychology of children. Also, the gender parity and gender equality has also been part of the guiding manuals that guide the work of social workers to enable the social workersto provide the proper guidance to the beneficiaries and also teachers and educators have been educated on the same concepts in all schools of the Sultanate. My name is from the Directorate of Mother and ChildHealth. I would like also to talk about the training programs on FGM. The Ministry of Health held a numberof training courses for health workers and also other health physicians and healthcare workers on thepractices that harm children including FGM. Between 2022 and 2023, we held 13 courses on the child law andchild abuse and the harmful traditional practices. Ten seminars were held for all groups in the society on child abuse and the harmful traditional practices on all the governed rights. Thank you.Thank you. Regarding the question on investment in women education and the claim that she does not participate or is not represented enough in the labor market, we would like to say that the economicempowerment of women is one of the main goals of the governorate of the Sultanate of Oman. We are not only working to provide opportunities for women in the public and private sectors but we have also seenan increased level of economic participation of many women for the past 15 years whether in the privateor public sectors. 82 of Omani women above the age of 15 are more active economically in Oman and alsowe are also placing an emphasis on empowerment of female entrepreneurs. We have supported their SMEsand now 40,000 institutions and small businesses are registered with the authority for SMEs that are ledby Omani women. Their percentage have increased to 32% from 29% in 2021. Also 40% of the land ownersare Omani women and also they account for a high percentage of the owners of housing units in Oman.With regard to the executive plan of the social work strategy of 2016-2025,the state is continuing its implementation of the program for the new couples, new married couples andalso they are we are providing them with awareness raising campaigns on the importance of health examinations. The beneficiaries of this program have reached in the end of 2023 641 women and also a newprogram for the awareness raising for couples have been introduced in 2023 and it has benefited hundredsof women. Regarding the question about release money, as per the new legislation in Omani, there is norequirement for a no objection certificate by the sponsor and the worker or the employer or the employee can move from one employer to another without the requirement of a previousemployer and also the employment contract can be terminated by the employee if there is any breachby the employer. The employee can resort to the court which considers the matter and finds if there isany breach by the employer and the contracts can be terminated accordingly. Thank you very much. Thereis no follow-up question. So now we move on to Article 7 to 9 of the part 2 of the convention and I now invite Ms. Nicole Amerine to discuss Article 7 and 8, political participation and followed by Ms. Rhoda Redockto discuss Article 9, nationality. Ms. Amerine, please have the floor. Thank you, Chair, Minister, Distinguished Ambassadors. It is an honor to welcome the Sultanate of Oman, one of the very 1st countries of the goalto recognize women's right to vote in 1994 and this equality and rights was then solidified by the 1996 constitution. Now more broadly, the full participation of women has always been linked to the country'smodernization and we welcome this vision, this ambition and the efforts that you have made and that you have brought to our attention today. The makeup of the Delegation is an example of this. And I mentionthese examples seeing that there is a woman's representative, the Vice Presidency of the state and that there is no discrimination in the organization of the state's council and on the law on theconsultative council. The figures are quite significant. You pointed them out as well. Unfortunately, inthe latest session during in the consultative council, even if there was significant encouragement of a trend, there are very few women who were elected to a post. All the while we note the efforts and thenominations and appointments in the Council of Ministers where five women were appointed to important positions in the ministry and we also note a trend within public administration where they represent31 and 28% as you pointed out in the public and private sector. These results, however, do not place your country at the same level of its aspirations and hopes at the regional and international level.And I would like to address with you some of the possible drivers of the parity strategy. My colleagues will speak about girls in education and how that is a really outstanding way to foster a culture ofparity to do it through policies. You also linked your 20/40 vision to the rise in power of women in all areas of responsibility in political and private life. All of these efforts go along the same line.But we have to look at the appointment policies. I'm thinking in the legal realm where there are still very few women among judges. Though there are many as attorneys, they are still quite rare as judges. AndI would like to acknowledge initiatives to address this. And then more broadly how to step up the participation of women and political life also at the local level where there is still really not stronglyrepresented. It is only by implementing a very proactive and systemic approach, one that would allow women to postulate for elections and to be supported and to receive votes that effective equitablerepresentation will be attained which will then enable your country to reach the heights that it aspires to. Have you contemplated reviewing the electoral system having a quota system, e.g. , introducedwhich whether we want it or not is the most direct way of making progress in this area. Will new electoralmechanisms be adopted? You have spoken and used new technologies, the electronic vote, e.g. . Do you plan on using these new technologies to create broader training and more significant participationof women in electoral processes? You also spoke about training programs. What is your assessment of these programs? Are they widespread? Over 60 organizations, women's organizations are presentacross the country. How do you tap into civil society to help women in the elections?Parity must also be a goal of foreign action. Your country is engaged in peace diplomacy throughout the world, not least in the region. I see that the number of women in diplomacy is, well, reaches thetotal figure of eight today. My question is do you plan on increasing that number? I would be remiss ifI were to finish without speaking about the Women, Peace and Security Plan. That is a significant step, especially for a country that, like yours, aspires for peace. What initiatives do you see onthe horizon on this topic? And as Madam Mayor Morsi pointed out, your efforts in including women in peace negotiations and in regional peace processes today, where does that effort stand? Thank you.Now, Ms. Redock, you have the floor for 4 min . Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I was really excited to be part of this task force because I come from Trinidad and Tobago whichproduces the steel band. And Oman is one of the countries that has adopted this national instrumentMadam Head of Delegation, I congratulate the State Party on all of its achievements and look forward to continued progress in the future. The CEDAW 2017 concluding observations called for the removal ofthe reservation on Paragraph 9C of the Convention and for the State Party to grant women equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their children to ensure equality between women and menwith regard to the acquisition, change and retention of nationality and to enable Omani women to transmit their nationality to foreign spouses and children on an equal basis with men. The State Party must becongratulated, therefore, on the promulgation of Royal Decree 23/20/23 which repealed the conditions of Royal Decree 98/58 to allow for the marriage of Omani women to foreign men. It was disappointingthat this change did not go further. Would the State Party please provide an update on the time frame for the finalization of the executive regulations and operating procedures of the Royal Decree 23/20/23regarding the marriage of Omanis to foreigners? What are the mechanisms in place to monitor andenforce the provisions related to this Royal Decree to ensure that it is applied consistently and without discrimination? In light of ongoing efforts to reform personal status law, are there plans to grant Omaniwomen equal rights with men with request to the nationality of their children and the acquisition, change and retention of their nationality? In light of these, would the State Party be willing to reviewits reservations in Article 9/2? The principle of equal rights for women and men is as tried in the Sultanate of Oman and allows for equality of all citizens but excludes migrants and noncitizensfrom equality before the law. This contravenes Oman's obligation under Article 2 of the CEDAW convention which condemns discrimination against women in all forms. How is the new basic law of the stateintroduced by decree 6/2021 addressing the constitutional definition of discrimination and its applicability to both citizens and noncitizens? Now you have already explained some developments inrelation to labor law, but what is the situation more generally? And could the State Party confirmwhether, as we have been advised, whether labor recruitment offices in Oman promote different salaries based on nationality and discriminate against African nationalities in general and certain Africannationalities in particular? Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Redock. I now give the floor to the Delegationto respond to the question. Thank you. I will respond to the question on the appointment of womenin the judiciary. The law of the judiciary in Article 21 does not require for members of the judiciary to be men, but it is equally available for both genders. Also the law of general prosecution stressesthat all judiciary posts and prosecutorial posts are on the basis of gender equality. Also the membersof the prosecution have the equal judicial immunity and also occupants of posts can move from prosecutionat the judiciary regardless of being men or women. Also the higher judicial council is amending its laws and legislations in this respect and adding more legislations to guarantee gender equality.Thank you. Regarding the question on nationality, the Sultanate of Oman has a principle wherebythere can be no dual nationality, which means this is the principle that we have for now, which means that a nationality cannot be transmitted to the children of an Omani woman from a foreign husband.However, the law has catered for the needs of the children, has provided them with free of chargeeducation and health services and also they have provided them equal access to services and lifted any restrictions faced by the children of Omani women from non-Omani husbands. It is notworthy also that Article 39 of the law of social protection has addressed the family income andthat it mentioned that or this law provides benefits for Omani families where one of the spouses isthe subsidy for families. So women who are married to non-Omanis can get the family subsidy in theamount that is decided by the executive regulations of the law. I would now like to answer the questionabout Royal Decree 23 of 2023 on marriages to foreign citizens. We do not have an implementingregulation as yet because the cases are clear in the provisions. Thank you.The job offices now or employment offices, they are responsible for issuingthe model contracts for employment. According to these contracts, the employer must pay a salary which is stipulated in the provisions of the contract. The ministry is currently examiningminimum wages for domestic work. There could be some problems because in certain countries, the cost ofliving is higher than in others. So how does one establish an appropriate minimum wage? We have beenreviewing this issue and once we reach a conclusion, we will inform the recruitment agencies offeringcontracts to foreign workers. Thank you. Now on diplomacy and incorporating women into the Omaniforeign service, we indicated that there are eight female ambassadors earlier but we have other womenworking in our representations aboard. We have 48 counselors or advisers in the ministry of foreign affairs who are women. We have a number of First Secretaries, 65 who are 2nd Secretaries and23 3rd Secretaries and we have a number of diplomatic attaches who are women and women are representedin local regional and international committees. I would like to answer the question concerningequality between nationals and foreign citizens. Article 15 of the basic law sets out that the family is the bedrock of Omani society and that the state shall strive to strengthen it. Women and men areequal in caring for the young, the old and persons with disabilities. This is a provision which coversnot only nationals but all persons residing on our territory. The basic law also strives to encompassrights, freedoms and duties. All people enjoy them and the law is applicable to all personsresiding on the territory. I thank you. The next speaker. I would like to add something concerning equality between nationals and foreign citizens. May I refer to Article 18 of the basic law which sets outthat dignity is a right enjoyed by all. So life and dignity are based on the human and not onbeing a national or not. Article 38 of the basic law also refers to rights of having access to justice,being free from torture, from being unlawfully arrested or detained. These cover both nationalsand foreign citizens. With regard to our text, we have a committee which is striving to ensure thatdomestic laws are all aligned with all the international conventions and treaties that we haveacceded to. The next question, the use of technology to enhance female participation in elections. Mycolleague referred to the fact that we have the election vote application which uses artificialintelligence. It is thanks to this that women's participation has increased. Female voters accountfor 48% of the electorate to the councils and the Shura Council. Women accounted for 65% of voters inthe 10th election to the Shura Council and the higher councils. When it comes to the electoral commission, it is chaired by a woman. So we can say that women can also stand for and vote in municipalelections. Furthermore, many women have been elected to serve on the municipal councils and we have seenthat the progression has been from 7 to 12. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now with regard to civilsociety organizations, we have around 60 NGOs that we are working with on providing support to women.Many women have actually been the directors of certain NGOs. There are a number of charitable organizationsand professional associations which are also run by women. So we have an agreement to promote women'spolitical participation and that is achieved through a partnership with NGOs. Thank you. As part of the2021/2026 five-year plan, Oman has set a number of strategic goals for the empowerment of women. Wehave a strategic objective on achieving a cohesive society that includes young persons and personswith disabilities. There are a number of activities undertaken as part of this program. We have also adopted laws to ensure the economic and social empowerment of women with a human rights-basedapproach. We also have a family policy which enables women to work in the labor market and reconcile those professional activities with her family life. Furthermore, we have adopted a policy onteleworking for both mothers and fathers. We also have an early childhood center or nursery so thatthe necessary care and support can be provided to ensure that women can reconcile family and professional life. As I was saying before, we have been disseminating a program through all departments andgovernorates so that they will implement programs throughout national territory. When it comes towomen, peace and security, as has been said, the ministry is working on drawing up a strategic actionplan to promote women's participation in all domains including in peace and security. The aim there is to keep in tune with local and regional developments. The head of Delegation, thank youfor the answers provided, members of the Delegation. I would also like to thank the Committee member who raised the question about women's election to the consultative or advisory council, theShura Council as we call it. Women have taken part in every stage of the elections to the Shura Council.Over 65% of votes were cast by women. How can we convince women to stand for office? That'san issue of concern for us. Oman has been trying to adopt mechanisms and action plans so that we cananalyze why women who may have all the necessary leadership skills do not run for a post on theadvisory council. We are convinced that if women stand for election to the advisory council, they willwin. But we must coordinate our efforts and invest in the energy that we find in NGOs with a view tochanging mindsets. This is the way in which we will ensure that both men and women run for office. We must make sure that people realize that men do not have a monopoly on skills and competencies. Womenhave them as well. We have a program to this end. It is a habilitation program for women so that they willrun for office in the ministry. What we are trying to do is we are trying to identify a group of women who would be willing to stand for office and run against men to achieve that election. We do hopethat that program will bear fruit. We have awareness raising programs but we run up againstthese obstacles of social mindset. It is very difficult to convince people to vote for women. We need theNGOs to work with us at the ministry so that we can achieve the results that we aspire to. We are certainlygoing to be deploying every effort to this end in the near future. We know that those women who haveserved on the advisory council have met expectations and have been fundamental in developing laws. We willdo everything we can in this area of implementation of the CEDAW convention. I thank you. Thank you very much for all of the answers. Your Excellency, I humbly request to recommend that I ask two membersto pose the questions under Article 10 and Article 11 because we are a little bit behind of the time.And then I will ask Ms. Bedema to talk about Article 10 education and later I will invite Ms. De Silva to talk about employment so that your Delegation can prepare the answer during the lunchtime.Is it okay for you? Thank you very much. Now I invite Ms. Bedema to talk about Article 10 for 4 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I also join the Delegation in welcoming the DistinguishedDelegation from the Sultanate of Oman. I want to begin by commending you for your achievements in education,the increase in net enrollment rate and the decrease in literacy, the way you have tackled stereotypes and here I would ask about what you would do for sustainability because this is an area that you canslip very easily in the stereotypes. And then the next question would be what accounts for the dropout rate? It is low but we need to know what is driving this and suggest whether the strategies you usedduring the COVID-19 could reach girls who have dropped out of school because we certainly should leave no one behind. I also commend you for the progressive elimination of horizontal segregationand the performance of the girls in maths, physics and chemistry given in the way you have commended it and given us our statistics. However, I see a gap in this STEM performance because even in sciencethere is hierarchy. And I'm wondering why in a country like yours with such a robust petrochemicalindustry we do not see that high number of girls in that education, engineering that way and in the gasbased education. This is very important because it reflects on the rights we have to education whichyou have done very well about, the rights within education which in the research I have seen gives the girls, the girls still have some hesitancy, personal hesitancy, psychological and the rightsto education where a member commented that how is it that we have invested so much in the girls but we do not see it in the kind of work they should be doing. And, of course, this also answers the question why women don't run for elections. There is some psychological basis that we should be dealingwith in elections. Then I will talk about the vertical segregation that in the employment sector we see as many women professors in especially the science areas as we have worked horizontally. Letme also talk about the vocational training and commend you for the programs you have, the seven institutions, the four that women are focused on and ask what challenges you see in that sphere. Again,what women study because they go to vocational schools. We say they are in vocational education but sometimes they are studying what is considered as the softer parts of vocational studies. So what do they study and in what proportion as compared to the boys? Then a question I was going to ask wasfortuitously broached on. We saw nothing, I saw nothing in the state party report about violence within education. But one of the Delegation members talked about violence in schools and exploitationsin schools as well as the home. So what kind of violence do you see in schools? And are you looking at the psychological aspect of violence which we asked you to look at in the last concludingobservations and make a law compassing physical and psychological violence? Because in education, especially if it's girls together, you won't see the kind of violence you are looking for. The kind of violence that is psychological, what you call micro-violence, economic superiority, that kindof thing. Are we looking at this form of violence? Finally, I would want to ask about disability. The figures look quite good. But there is still a gap that was given in today's opening remarks, about 800 andsomething boys in general and the girls are 800 and something. So we still have almost 150, 200 gap that's going on. I thank you very much. Thank you, Ms. Medema. Now I invite Ms. De Silva to talk about Article 11,employment. You have 5 min , please. Thank you, Madam Chair. I warmly welcome the Distinguished Delegation of Oman. First on Oman's economic rise, last year Oman recorded the highest economic growthin the GCC region, primarily due to the state party's increased hydrocarbon production capacity. I congratulate you on the national digital economic program that was started in 2021. In this techRenaissance, how do you plan to mitigate gender biases not only among humans but in algorithmic models, which might drive bank loans and financial decisions? My 2nd question to you on the tech Renaissance isfrom machine learning systems and large language models to generative AI and agri-tech, how are women leading Oman's economic Renaissance? The Committee would like concrete numbers of women in decision-makingpositions and the percentages of the quota for women in the innovation economy. Oman has announced smart cities and Sultan Haytham City is designated as the 1st such sustainable city. Smart cities play a majorrole in achieving the sustainable development goals, including goal 5 on gender and goal 9 on innovation. At the very cusp of this enterprise on sustainable cities, women must lead. How do you use the CDO andthe guiding principles on business and human rights to mitigate any potential risks to gender equality at this initial design stage? In setting up these smart cities, we hope the state party will use amodel of womenomics. Womenomics views women in the labor market as smart economics. Our rural women involved in smart cities which focus primarily on urban cities. Secondly, in macroeconomic theory,as women gain greater access to paid work, their bargaining power within the household rises at the same time. Will you conduct such a study on this important correlation? I'm concerned about the correlation between gender violence and economic disempowerment. What is being done to address economicdisempowerment of women in rural areas, women in agriculture and women with disabilities. I now turn to the labor code in the pipeline. I note that on 25th of July, 2023, Oman announced the new labor law forworkers in the private sector. With a consultative period of six months, this period comes to an endon February 1st. Since today is February 7th, when do you hope to promulgate it? We note the 90 days maternity leave and seven days for paternity leave in the new labor code. I repeat, Your Excellencies, sevendays paternity leave. Would you consider this an asymmetry and a disparity? Would you consider a more gender equality in practice? Would you also consider family leave for care of elders? Is substantive equalityand direct and indirect discrimination enshrined in the law? For example, in cases of indirect discrimination, how would the law deal with the new generation of stereotypes and subtle and insidious biases based onappearance, height, weight, color and social status? Oman is yet to enshrine a sexual harassment policy in the law. Would you consider establishing a new workplace accountability mechanism for sexual harassment? Andfinally, how would you harmonize the new labor law with some of the existing gaps in the law on the protection of women domestic workers? We note that the new labor law explicitly prohibits the employer from keepingthe worker's passport without the written consent of the worker. However, vestiges of the kafala sponsorship system still remains. Many countries in the GCC region, including the UAE, has abolished this sponsorship system, althoughsome remnants may remain. Your Excellencies, the repatriation and deportation processes of those in irregular migration is still not clear to me. And I know that my colleagues have also established this in earlierconversations. Access to justice is key in irregular migration. Would you provide legal resources and legal aid? As the Chair of the Delegation mentioned, the basic clause, Article 18 on the dignity of all is the grounding principle ofthe Oman constitution. And in this spirit, Your Excellencies, I ask you, would you consider the ratification of domestic workers convention, ILO No. 189? Currently, Oman leads the GCC in economic development, but has ratified thefewest number of ILO conventions in the region. Thank you. Thank you, Madame de Silva de Alves. Let's stop here for the morningsession. And this afternoon, we will continue with agenda item 4. We will promptly reconvene at 3:00 p.m. and then startfrom the answering to those questions. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you. The private NGO briefing on Djibouti will be fullyonline. The link was sent to the members by Jamila this morning. And the members can also still go to the NGO briefing room whereAIRA will receive you, but you will have to connect online because all the NGOs are connecting remotely. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to the order of the 2044th meeting of the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee will continue with Agenda Item 4. And I now give the floorto the Delegation to respond to the question which was raised in this morning under Article10 and 11. Madam, Head of Delegation, please. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. We shall now startwith some replies to questions that were put to us before the break and then the questionsprior to the Articles 10 and 11. So the floor is yours, sir. Thank you, Your Excellency. Iwill reply to the three questions. First of all, a question about NGOs by the Chairperson and coordination of their efforts. Another question about the National Human Rights Commission andits independence. Royal Decree 126 of 2008 stipulated that a law on combating human trafficking wasdue to be passed according to Royal Decree 126 of 2008. Based on this law, we establishedan ad hoc independent Committee which is the primary Committee also called as the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking. It was established in 2008. It comprises representativesof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Prosecution, Royal Omani Police, the courts, Ministry of Justice, education, health, development, labor, information and the National Human Rights Commission,the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the General Trade Union. This commission workedon an action plan to combat human trafficking and organized the training sessions to all relevant law enforcement agencies. The Vice President is a woman. She is present here represented in our Delegationand present here today. We have a hotline which is available 24/7 in order to receive any complaintsabout human trafficking. Second answer regarding the Human Rights Commission. This is a totally andfully independent commission as per Royal Decree 57 of 2022. Its Article 1 stipulated that the OmaniHuman Rights Commission will be established and it shall be independent and it shall submit all itsreports directly to the authority as per Article 16 of the same Royal Decree. Last question regardingeconomic initiatives and promoting the role of women. According to Royal Decree 52 of 2023, a socialprotection fund was established and Article 14 of this decree stipulated that the Ministry of Social Development shall promote economic initiatives and economic also integration initiatives. Thankyou. Thank you, Your Excellency. Regarding the Rapid Intervention Task Force, it was established in2019 and it is still operating to this day. We have statistics regarding cases that were placed inAl-Wifaq shelter. Three cases in 2020, 16 cases in 2021, 14 cases in 2022 and 36 cases in 2023.Regarding the hotline, it is 1100. We also have another hotline that was inaugurated recently affiliated to the Ministry of Social Development, 1555 and there is another hotline affiliated to theRoyal Omani Police. There is also another hotline affiliated to the Ministry of Labor, 80077700.It is about labor-related complaints. We also have a website for the Commission on Combating Human Trafficking whereby it is possible to also file complaints via the website. Regarding cases beforethe public prosecution, crime of human trafficking from 2021 to 2023, 47 cases. All cases were referredto the relevant courts and the victims were 76 women. Allow me to say that investigations are undertakenby public prosecutors who were trained accordingly and they can now be regarded as international expertsin the field of crimes of human trafficking. Regarding the marriage of an Omani woman with a foreign man,she can keep her Omani nationality as to the children of Omani women after reaching the age of 18 years old,they can file requests or applications to ask for the Omani nationality if they desire that. If there areno additional comments, we shall now move to the two questions that were put to us right before the lunchbreak. Peace be upon you. I would like to thank the member of the Committee who praised us for thereduced rates of dropouts. She asked how can you sustain that? In order to sustain this achievement, our Ministry of Education through the vocational office or department is organizing awareness raisingsessions for students and their parents and we have also a number of opportunities for the unified center of education for women and such opportunities, of course, are available to both sexes. Regardingthe reduction in dropout rates, we are working on a gradual reduction of dropout rates and we haveseveral common initiatives aiming at keeping the reduced dropout rates. The Ministry of Education established an ad hoc Committee with various stakeholders, Ministry of Education, police, nationalstatistics center and others. The aim of this ad hoc Committee is to have a unified database for children who dropped out of various schools and to determine the most appropriate channel to examine the reasonsfor their dropouts even if the rate is minimal right now and to understand the reasons to find solutions and this Committee is still examining these cases and looking for solutions. Some dropout caseswere due to marriage, disability, work or some health concerns. Our women Committees and the various governorates constantly work on raising awareness on the importance of education for women and girls. Asto the COVID pandemic, during the COVID pandemic, the government has been constantly calling for continuing education. The ministry has also provided the educational platforms during the pandemic toensure that everyone will continue his or her education and there were very strict measures for those whowere absent from the courses, sometimes because they claimed that they did not have computers or laptops, et cetera. That's why accordingly we received the decisions from the higher Committee of Educationto provide computers for all students so that they can be able to continue their e-learning or e-education. Statistics show that there is an increased percentage of women in all fields of science andtechnology. However, when it comes to working into the oil and gas sector, there are some particular rules, be it by the public sector or the private companies. There was a question aboutthe reluctance of some women to work in some sectors. Statistics show high rates of participation. Forinstance, in natural sciences and physics in 2022, we have 85 female students versus 700 male students.For ITC, we have 1,293 female students versus 703 male students. So the ratios and the percentages aredifferent from one sector to another. Regarding the participation of women in elections, of course, there is a psychological factor. Regarding the educational programmes, we have some courses onparticipation in local elections and political life and we constantly encourage women and girls to engage in elections and in the public life. I think this is an issue that should be pursued beyond education atschools. We also work on promoting the positive dimension of women's participation. We are alsoorganizing our efforts and we have lists of data on the students in both public and private schools and the measures taken in order to counter violence in schools. We also have a code of conduct in publicand private schools and the aim is to protect students from abuse and violence. We constantly also reachout through experts to the children, to the students and to their parents. Regarding violence against children, all cases of violence against children are reported to the relevant authorities. Regarding gapsin terms of university students between males and females, in 2022/2023, we have 71,800 femaleuniversity students versus 50,481 male students. You can see that female students exceed in their numbersthe number of their male counterparts. The number of male and female trainees in vocational trainingis also exceeding, so we have 1,388 female vocational trainees versus 1,000 male trainees.We have innovation centers and scientific centers collaborating with the Ministry of Education. It was a successful partnership and it aims at encouraging women and girls to participate in all sectors oflife without any exception. Mr. Montaser, the floor is yours. Sorry, Mrs. Montaser. I would like to addto what Dr. Badria said in terms of violence in education. The Sultanate of Oman has placed the right of the children on the top of its priorities. We ratified the CRC in 1996 and passed the law onthe children in 2014. Regarding children protection, we have 11 committees in the field of child protection and the various governorates and they comprise many government entities such as Ministry of Education,health, police, public prosecution and others. This committee receives complaints through a protection line. They receive complaints from individuals, NGOs, various entities and the relevant measures aretaken. We have also a main committee to protect children headed by the Secretary of the Ministryof Social Development. Intervention is done through the social workers in charge of child protection inthe various governorates. Regarding empowerment of women with disabilities, my country is continuingits efforts in order to accelerate the integration of persons with disabilities, namely women with disabilities based on the tenets of the basic law which is equality between citizens regardless of allother considerations including disability. Many activities are undertaken as part of the national strategy and we have a pillar pertaining to the rights of the persons with disabilities and cooperationwith our various strategic partners. We have also implemented many training outreach events about the rights of the persons with disabilities. We also raising awareness about the rights according to theterms of the CRPD. We also organized a forum entitled or we can. This is a forum where we exchange views and ideas about the persons with disabilities, how they can take part in the implementation of the Oman Vision2040 and how they can also take part in what we have established, namely a lab for ideas and for initiativesfor persons with disabilities. We had many previous steps before this program and we were able to gathera good number of initiatives that aim at targeting persons with disabilities and to encourage them totake part in public life and family activities and the labor sector and the work sector. We also worked onestablishing many policies in this field. The Ministry of Social Development has launched an initiativeentitled be by our side for their own sake. This initiative aims at empowering 500 disabled personsby 2027 so that they can join the labor force. Another version of forum or we can was established in December2022 according to the strategic vision of the ministry. Interpreters note we kindly ask the speakersto slow down. Thank you. In addition to what Jamila said, this initiative targeted last year 86 beneficiaries.They received direct training and so far and following this vocational training 68 of them were ableto receive jobs. One of them, for instance, was a Sorbonne graduate in English and she was appointedin the central bank of Oman and she was able to get to secure a decent salary. This initiative showedthat many companies that were reluctant to employ persons with disabilities after recruiting persons with disabilities, they were convinced that they can accommodate a greater number and now we are organizinga 2nd round of empowering of these people and three other governorates we want to enable them toaccess the labor force, the labor market along with people who do not have disabilities. Regarding sustainable development and smart cities, Sultan Hayes smart city is an innovative project in terms ofsustainable smart cities. It was built and organized following consultations with various stakeholders, private sector, entrepreneurs, public sectors in order to know and determine the needs of the variouscomponents of society. This has continued for two years and the city was finally opened and on the planning of this city we have a lot of women of whom we are very proud. There is an entire teamthat is led with this woman leader. The purpose of these cities, smart cities is to be friendly towardswomen, children, the elderly and the family and to accommodate the needs of all segments of society and to cater for all relevant needs and their planning and the network of transport and the amenitiesprovided in these cities. Also in the design of these cities and the transport network in these cities,the needs of persons with disabilities were considered and accessibility was an important aspect of theplanning. Also in this city, Sultan Haytham City, there was a center for the services of children andwomen was established to provide them with all relevant services. Also in the city there are plans for an entire compound for the needs of persons with disabilities that provides all the help neededto all persons with disabilities including autistic children. Also in the compound, the training will be provided to entire families so that families can be able to deal with their children with disabilitiesso that they can be fully integrated in the public schools and private schools based on the assessment that will be done by experts that will decide whether a child can be integrated in the environment of apublic school or a special or private school. As per the decision of the assessment committee, a childwould be integrated within the appropriate school. Also we have a number of initiatives in the field of economic empowerment of women that taps into technology and all the state of the art developmentsand communication and communication. We have mentioned before the MAKIN program that was launched by the ministry of communication in cooperation with the private sector and other relevant ministriesto train the national young people of Oman and also the authority of small and medium size enterprisesalso trains a large number of young men and women and enables them to use the state of the art technology and to integrate the digital economy within Oman and to start projects based on that.Also if there are any other comments from the members of the Delegation, please go ahead. Thank you,honorable minister. Regarding the question, my name is Hamid Ashkari from the ministry of agricultural wealth and fisheries and water resources and I'm also a member in CEDAW. Regarding the question on theintegration of rural women in the technologies that support agricultural as well as AI and digital technologies, I remind you that the government of Oman represented by the ministry of agriculturalresources fisheries and water resources has launched three initiatives to support and empower rural women when it comes to digital technologies and the technologies that support agriculture. The 1stinitiative was the launch of programs that would integrate technologies within agriculture. We haverolled out nearly 1,896 technical program for women that enabled these programs enabled womento improve the work on the production lines that are led and operated by women. Productivity was increased.Waste and effort was reduced. Also flexibility and also for climate change was also increased. Alsowe have also supported projects of food products for more than 700 women. The 3rd program was aimed atintegrating AI into the projects of rural women. 130 women benefited from these programs and also womenwere also trained on the use of AI in the preparation of the marketing of their products. Women were alsoenabled to use technical technology in the best benefit of their agricultural projects. More than732 women benefited from these programs. 122,000 Omanis were allocated which is almost 28,000 U.S.dollars. 320,000 dollars, I mean. Also regarding the empowerment of women and the role in the family,there are a lot of research done either by men or women on the empowerment of women and we can providethe titles of these studies and their results. Also I would like to mention that currentlyePlatforms are being used to empower the largest possible number of women when it comes to agricultural production and also the manufacturing and the food products as well and, of course, economic empowerment.Thank you. Regarding the question on how we can reduce any biases in the giving of loans to SMEs,there is no discrimination in the granting of loans. We have six programs for lending. Each program has its own conditions for vocational projects. For instance, 80% of the beneficiaries are women and there areother programs that benefit men. There is also a program called preparation that enables young entrepreneurs, no discrimination whatsoever in this program also. There is also a program to improvethe SMEs led by women mainly. Thank you. Regarding the questions on the labor law and its effective date,the decree in its 5th article stipulated that the effective date is the 3rd date after its publication. So the effective date is the 3rd date after the issuance of the decree. Regarding the disparitybetween the parental leave and the maternity leave, yes, for fathers it is eight days and for mothersit is 98 days. The purpose of this disparity is to cater for the proportional needs for men and women andalso the sick leaves. Regarding the sick leaves, we have also provided the appropriate number within the social protection system. The purpose of providing more leaves and more allowances is to supportthe representation and to augment the representation of women within the labor market and to encouragewomen to take major roles in private sector and in different economic activities. Regarding the manylegal loopholes in the new law when it comes to the sponsorship system, there is no discriminationwhatsoever and we hope to protect the rights of workers. Article 24 of the law has also abolished the certificate of no objection and also the ministry of labor has modified its electronic services inorder to enable employees to move from one employer to another without the permission of the previous employer. Regarding the discrimination based on color, sex or otherwise, this is fully prohibited byarticles 12 and 32 of the labor law. Regarding also accession to the convention on domestic workers,the ministry of labor has formed a committee that is examining the draft executive regulationsof the laws and aligning them with the ILO and also with the Arab labor organization. Once these executiveregulations are fully examined, there will be full alignment with all conventions. Thank you very much. There are at least two follow-up questions. So quickly listen to the follow-up question. But afterthat, let us proceed to the Article 12 so that we can get the answer together. Ms. Manalo and then Ms.De Silva-Alvis. Thank you. Thank you, Madam, for giving me the chair. I have been wondering where Articlewe were because we seem to be running from 7 to 15 to 14 and 13 and so forth. There is no sequence. Mine has to do with something with 7 and 8. My question is this: Are there any women who have become ministersof defense? And if there have been, how many have had been ministers of defense? Do you in the armed forces of your country accept women to be generals, coronels and make a career in the defense area?I would like that answered. Now, on the other side, for peace purposes, have you had ministers of foreign affairs, women who have become lady ambassadors, they have climbed just like the male ambassadors in theladder to become career ambassadors and serve in your foreign office and serve in posts abroad? I would like to know that. The other one is this. Do you have lady judges? Has any lady become a chief justiceof your Supreme Court? If so, how many are there? How do they climb up? Are they welcomed? Do they do a good job as lady judges? I haven't heard anything about that as yet. And then, of course, politicalparties. Are there ladies who have found political parties? If they have found political parties, are these parties prospering? Do they receive the support of the gentlemen politicians? In Parliament, havethe ladies, if you have a lower house and an upper house, have they become chiefs of the upper house and the lower house in Parliament? Do they argue for laws? I haven't heard anything about this. Sothose are the questions I have for the moment. I may be coming back in other articles later on. But for the moment, for 7:00 and 8:00. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms. Manalo. Ms. Da Silva, very quickly,please. Thank you to the Minister of Agriculture for her response to my questions on the role ofwomen in the rural sector in artificial intelligence and other frontier technologies and the ways in which those technologies impact women in the rural areas in agricultural work. Some of my questions remainunanswered, especially those relating to sexual harassment in the workplace. And a follow-up question to that is would you consider including sexual harassment in the workplace in the new labor code since it is yet to be promulgated and perhaps include harassment, which is where a particularjob privilege is granted in return for sexual favors. And this then coincides with another question on what are the access to justice mechanisms for domestic workers who have faced sexual violence and other forms of abuse. As you know, this is the epicenter of the power differences and power andcontrol is at the center of sexual violence. And then finally, I think I may need some clarification on something that is still ambiguous to me, that is how will you harmonize the new labor code with itsstronger anti-discrimination provisions with the regulations on domestic workers? My reading of the current labor code is that protections for domestic workers continues to be missing in thisnew labor code. So thank you. Thank you, Your Excellencies. Thank you very much. I request the Delegation to take note on these questions. So let us move on to the Article 12 on Health of the Part3 of the Convention. Now I invite Ms. Marianne Mikko for 4 min . Thank you. Thank you very much,Chair. I welcome the high level Delegation of the State Party here in Geneva. The State Party implemented various measures to address women's reproductive health ensuring their access to comprehensive healthcare services including sexual and reproductive health services. The basic law of the state emphasizesgender equality performing women's rights to access health services without requiring approval from aguardian or surgical or medical intervention. While Royal Decree No. 75/19 acknowledges women's right to health services it mandates consent for reproductive judges. The 10th five-year plan for health developmentaims to improve the health of girls and women focusing on reproductive and post-reproductive age.Initiatives include continuous health coverage during pregnancy, child birth and post delivery. Increased use of birth spacing and enhanced services. The Child Act emphasizes preventive and thetreatment measures for mothers before and after child birth providing free reproductive health services for Omani and non-Omani women. Health services including reproductive health are integrated into primary care facilities across all the countries. In the field of reproductive health, the maternalmortality rate decreased to 15.7 in 2022 where the rate in 2021 was 42.5. And the percentage ofbirths under specialized medical supervision increased to 100% in 2022. This is really a step forward.Article 36 of the Act regulating the medical profession allows abortion under specific circumstancessuch as a threat to the mother's life or severe medical hardship. The state party provides opportunities for women to access safe abortion and post-abortion care services irrespective of the legal status of the abortion. Family planning services including modern contraceptives are available free of charge.Efforts are ongoing to make primary health care services more adolescent friendly expanding pre-marital medical exam services. Specialized clinics address mental health issues with statistics provided formental health patients and clinic visits. But still, there are questions which need to be answered.Firstly, what initiatives are in place to monitor and evaluate the impact of family planning services including the use of modern contraceptives and ensure their continued availability without shortages?How does Oman balance the right to health services with the requirement for spousal consent for certain reproductive surgeries as outlined in Royal Decree No. 75/2019? How does Oman ensure the effectiveimplementation of reproductive health services particularly in remote areas to guarantee accessibilityfor all women? Secondly, could the Delegation provide more information on the awareness campaigns conducted to educate women about the importance of early detection of breast cancer and cervical cancer?How has the public responded to these initiatives? Thirdly, can the Delegation elaborate on the steps taken to enhance adult friendly services in primary healthcare institutions? How are these servicestailored to address the specific health needs of girls? Fourthly, how does Oman address challenges related to mental health particularly in the context of harmful practices affecting women and what specialized clinics or services are available? Different sources claim that there is a constant threat to mentalhealth among domestic workers who practically work 24/7. Please provide data of domestic workers' health conditions. And 5th , given the decrease in registered abortion rates, could the Delegationshare the factors contributing to this decline and elaborate on the effectiveness of health counseling and post abortion care services? Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms. Mikko. Now I give the floor to the Delegation. You may wish to respond to the previous follow-up question, too. Thank you very much.With regard to the questions asked about sexual harassment in the workplace,this was a legal question, I believe. And so by way of response, to make it clearthat Article 41, Paragraph 3 of the Labor Code addresses this issue directly. Whenever there is abuseof a worker in the workplace, said worker can ask for the contract to be terminated early. Our criminalcode means that it includes all different crimes and their related sanctions. Article 42 of the LaborCode provides that any crime perpetrated in the workplace is to be dealt with according to the provisions of the criminal code. It is to be treated as a crime, in other words. The criminal code waspromulgated in 2018 and said criminal code revision ramped up the sanctions and punishments for sexual harassment and any verbal or physical abuse or harassment. We increased the sanction or punishmentfor crimes of this nature and we further augment the sanction or punishment when the victim is a womanof said crimes, particularly any crimes that violate a woman's moral or ethical sense of self. Thank youvery much. That's our response for now. I would like to thank the expert who asked questions under Article12. I will begin by taking her 1st question. To wit, what initiatives have been put in placeto assess the extent of use of contraceptives? No, I beg your pardon. I need to go a step back. I believe the 1st question was about family planning services. We began to offer family planning services as of1994. The Ministry of Health has assessed the impact of this family planning services on a regular basis on society and we measure or analyze the impact of these services by annual indicators. Webelieve that family planning services are responsible for a drop in the birth rate in Oman. It now standsat an average of 3.2 births per woman aged between 15 and 49. That was the figure as of 2022.In 2020, the fertility or birth rate per woman in the ages of 15 to 49 stood at 3.5. It has already dropped in intervening two years. The average age at which a woman gives birth to her 1st child hasrisen by two years. Again, another fact which leads us to believe that our family planning services havebeen effective. And there is and the average gap between children now stands at three years betweenchildren. This was the case in 45% of families as of 2022. We are seeking to see what additional changesneed to be introduced in case to address morbidity. We are looking at instances of morbidity and the impact that this has on maternal mortality rates. Family planning services are made available freeof charge. There are no preconditions that need to be met, including there is no requirement for the husband to give his authorization. The Ministry for Health is responsible for providing these services.A royal decree exists providing for a law on healthcare and healthcare provision. There arevarious tools, means and programs that are available, particularly for women and women's healthcare,including, as I say, family planning services, including helping space out the birth of their children. Again, access to these services does not require the consent of the husband. With regardto cervical breast and uterine cancer, we have rolled out a raft of strategies guided by the WHO model strategies. The most recent strategy that we rolled out was the cervical cancer strategy, againborrowed from the WHO model. The head of Delegation has interrupted to request the speakers to speak somewhat more slowly to facilitate the interpretation in order to ensure that we don't lose any of the statistics. If I could ask my fellow members of the Delegation to speak a little slower. The speakercontinues. With regard to the 2nd point flagged, awareness raising campaigns, particularly for cervical and breast cancer, I would have the following response. The Sultanate of Oman, via itsMinistry of Health, has rolled out various strategies, as I say, borrowed from the WHO model strategies, particularly to promote early detection of said cancers. With regard to breast cancer specifically,we have a national early screening and detection programme that's been in place since 2008. We have awareness raising campaigns in all governorates of the country, in particular in the month of October,which is breast cancer awareness month. This programme raises awareness about available services, promotes access to said services and also provides tips on how women may self screen or self checkfor breast lumps or breast cancer. We also have specialized clinics which provide their services. These clinics are available in primary healthcare facilities across the country and they are specialized units for early diagnosis of cancer and for provision of mammograms.In 2022, the number of women benefiting from this early breast cancer screening and detectionstood at more than 13,000 women who made use of these services from different regions and governments across the country. The percentage of women who were able to detect breast cancer earlyhas also risen, i.e., at the 1st stage of breast cancer. So we have seen a 45% increase in early detection at stages 1 or 2 of the cancer. With regard to cervical cancer, there are several activitiesunder our five-year cervical cancer action plan. We have put together a study covering all the governorates of the Sultanate of Oman. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the rate of cervicalcancer in the country and how much this was due to papillovirus. Many women availed themselves of thetests of the screening and early detection and that has led to successful treatment. Turning now to the questions asked about adolescent friendly services and services generally made available toadolescent girls, our five-year plan has improved our healthcare for adolescents. We have established specialized healthcare units and clinics both for teenage boys and teenage girls, again within primaryhealthcare units in each governorate. These specialized clinics or units are for teenagers, either teenage boys or teenage girls. These specialized units or clinics have been available as of 2020. Theywere established following a report into this issue of adolescent healthcare and facilitating greater access for adolescents to healthcare services, particularly at the local level. With regard torural healthcare, here again we provide full primary healthcare services. This primary healthcare and all other healthcare services are made available by the primary healthcare clinics which there are in allthe governorates of the there are altogether 191 such centers. On the questions asked about mental health, mental health services are made available again in the primary healthcare centers wherespecialized doctors have been trained in mental healthcare support. If they identify a case which needs to be referred to a specialized mental health clinic, a separate clinic, then that is done.With regard to reducing abortion rates and identifying the causes of abortion, I would respond by the following: This is all part of the health in addressing abortion and in trying to lower abortionrates. We think this is due to our family planning services to our increased delivery of sexual and reproductive health services for women which means we can provide them with the knowledge they need beforethey fall pregnant. We also provide a full range of services to pregnant women to reassure them, to provide them the services that they need and to help them to identify risks for pregnant women and toassist them with steps that they need to take in order to avoid miscarriages. With regard to domestic workers, particularly they also have access to healthcare services. An employee of a domestic workerhas to provide healthcare for them as part of their package. They have to ensure that they are covered by medical insurance. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you, says the head of Delegation. I believethat questions were also asked about whether we have ever had female ministers of defence or ministers of foreign affairs. Not yet is the reply. But we have had several female ministers in other ministriesand there is nothing that would prevent a woman from becoming the head, from becoming the minister for defence or the minister for foreign affairs if they have the appropriate background, the appropriate training. If an individual has the appropriate background and training, man or woman, we make no distinction. They may apply for and be appointed to these posts. With regard to the diplomatic sector,there are several women who work in our diplomatic service including in the different embassies ofthe Sultanate of Oman abroad. These opportunities are freely open and available to women and they can also enjoy all promotion opportunities as well. To date we have eight female ambassadors serving the Sultanateof Oman and demonstration of the fact that there is no obstacle standing in the way of the promotion or appointment to women to the highest possible post in the diplomatic service. With regard to political parties and civil society, we have civil society organizations and professional charity organizations.All of these associations deal with a raft of issues relating to women's rights including political representation and political parties and ensuring that everybody is treated on an equal footing. We have a law on associations and clubs in the Sultanate of Oman ensuring that they must provide their services on a nondiscriminatory equal basis. They must provide their services equally to bothmen and women alike in line with the law and legislation. This irrespective of whether the president of a given association or club is a man or woman, there is a single set of rules governing associations and clubs in the Sultanate of Oman irrespective of the gender of the chair or presidentof the given association. Organizations and associations can carry out their activities in line with their own rules of procedure, the plans for the activities that they themselves adopt independentlywhich cover the different sectors that they are interested in including professional or labor sectors. To compliment the answer about sexual harassment in the workplace, the Sultanate of Oman via the Ministry of Labor has established a system to evaluate and assess the performanceof all workers. We have an electronic system in place and this system is one in which you can reportanything of note as an employee but it is also a system which assesses the performance of workers, men and women alike. I think an indication of the fact that we enjoy full transparency in the Sultanateof Oman when it comes to performance evaluation. There is no bias, no partiality. There is in a nutshell no discrimination because all of this process, this system is transparent and so women can have accessto see this system, to see how their performance has been assessed, to challenge it where necessary.This means that there is a transparent assessment and evaluation process. Sticking to the workplace, if women are sexually harassed in the workplace, they can directly report it. They can lodge or file a complaint and they can do that via this assessment and evaluation system. They can lodge a complaintagainst an employer, not just the person directly harassing them before the labor tribunals as wellall of this information is available via this electronic online system. Wahad, you have the floor.Many thanks indeed. With regard to women's presence, the number of women in unions and employees, federations in the Sultanate of Oman, just to share with you that four individual women have been electedin 2024 to key post in the workers' federation. Women are member of the national human rights commissionthey are 21.4% of the staff in the national human rights commission. Higher, private and public higher education institutions have beefed up the role of women in their governing bodies and in students'associations where women play a very meaningful and significant role. Thank you very much. Thank you,sir. I will seek to respond to the question asked about the presidency of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was established in 1999. Previously we had a legal or judicial system that was entirelydifferent. Since the Supreme Court was opened in 1999, it has had three different presidents. All three presidents have been men. To date in the lifetime of that Supreme Court, the last 25 years,we have never had a female president of the body. There are judges, female judges including some who are here in the Delegation with us. The law in no way prohibits the promotion of women. Women can bepromoted to the most senior posts in the judiciary and that can be done directly including in the future should the occasion arrive at the Supreme Court. Thank you very much. I will try and respond very briefly, says the head of Delegation. I will try and keep it succinct because there are more questions yet to come. If I could hand things over to my next colleague in Delegation. Thank you. You asked aquestion about the number of female lawyers. In 2022, there were 24 female lawyers. I beg your pardon. In2024, there were 665 female lawyers. I beg your pardon. That number is expected to go in 2024. In 2023, we also appointed a further four female ambassadors. With regard to the private sector andfemale representation and the number of women in senior posts, that figure stands at 37%. That's the figure from 2022. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on the issue of abortions, says the next memberof the Delegation, and to say that 79% of women make use of maternity services in the 1st 12 weeks ofpregnancy which has allowed us to reduce the number of miscarriages and abortions. Just quickly listento Ms. Mikko's follow-up question and then let us move to the 30, 40, yes. Thank you very much, Chair. Iapologize that I had so many questions about health, but that is very important subject. I sincerely thank you, representative of Health Ministry, that you answered almost all my questions except a few. Iremained I remind one was about how Oman addresses challenges related to mental health and particularly in the context of harmful practices affecting women and what specialized clinics and services are available.If you don't have data about domestic workers' health conditions, you could easily make that within next 24 hours and give us in written form. Thank you. Thank you very much. So let us move on.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to thank the members of the Oman government for their participation in this discussion. We would like to highlight the Development Plan for 2021-2025 and its goal is to provide more comprehensivesocial protection in order to be able to rely on self-determination in the domestic economy. What are the procedures required for women to participate in the design, planning, implementation and monitoring andevaluation of this Development Plan? What are the achievements that can be measured and achieved by women through their social empowerment such as direct work, training and starting their own projects? We would like to highlightthe following: First, the grant system for loans in the Oman Development Bank guarantees women and men equal rights on loans. We would like to highlight the following: The draft No. 107/2020 which provides financial, administrative and legal consultations for small and medium-sized companies and provides funding for women andmen from business leaders. You have just given us information about the standards and the conditions for obtaining loans by the Oman Development Bank for women and small and medium-sized companies and also by the DevelopmentProgramme for small and medium-sized companies. During the pandemic, there was a statement from the Social Protection Initiative for the guarantee of sustainability. The Ministry of Social Development guaranteesand enables families in the field of social protection, specifically those families with limited income according to the Ministerial General Summary 2/2019. How does the Federal Government ensure thatthe programs provide economic empowerment, specifically for families with limited income? The Delegation provides more details on the emergency financing programme launched during the COVID-19 pandemic for small and medium enterprises,including its impact and the number of women entrepreneurs who benefited from it. What measures are in place to monitor and evaluate the success and sustainability of enterprises supported by Social Security pensions accordingto Ministerial Circular No. 2 of 2018? The Rafter Fund adopted a financing strategy to give equal shares to women and men with special programmes like the rural women's programme inaugurated in 2017. Efforts extended toprovide ongoing assistance in consulting, training, marketing, media services, business contracts and procurement. How does this fund strategy ensure that women have equal access to funding and support compared to their male counterparts in various entrepreneurial endeavours? To improve financial literacy, particularly among school students, the State Party implemented aproject to support the funding of women and their male counterparts in various entrepreneurial endeavours. TheTo improve financial literacy, particularly among school students, the State Party implemented a project focusing on enhancing financial culture. This project includes curriculum integration of financial concepts, principles and entrepreneurship subjects for 10th gradestudents. Does this financial literacy have a particular emphasis on girls' financial literacy? And finally, we note that the Central Bank issued acircular in 2021 addressing banking services, access to micro credit and loans for women with disabilities. It also emphasizes the importance ofimplementing digital solutions to facilitate access for individuals with hearing disabilities while safeguarding their privacy, independence and consumer rights. What has been the success of this initiative for women with disabilities? Can you elaborate on the number of women withdisabilities disaggregated by different disabilities who have benefited from this initiative? Furthermore, there was another circular issued by thecapital market authority in regard to insurance companies and women with disabilities. What are the insurance benefits specifically tailored for women withdisabilities? Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Bessel. And then I apologize. There was some technical problems with the earphone. Now let me invite Ms. BrendaAkia to talk about Article 14 for 5 min . Ms. Brenda, please. Thank you very much, Chair. Your Excellencies, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming you to thisconstructive dialogue. I would also like to congratulate the state party for all the efforts you have taken to advance the rights of women, especially the disadvantaged women like the rural women, women from low income families, women with disabilities, including through the program that you did speak about earlier and also establishing a grant system for rural women by the project by the Ministry of Agriculture and also all the different initiatives we have taken to address the impacts of climate changeon women and girls. Your Excellencies, particularly we also acknowledge the joint analytical study that you mentioned you had undertaken with the Food and Agriculture Organization that is focused on the progress of Goal 5 on the Sustainable Developed Goals. Your Excellencies, some of my questions will center around this. I apologize there may be very many but we would be grateful for your responses. How does the REFI program support rural women's projects and what is theincentives and access to soft loans does it provide? In what ways has the Department of Rural Development established in 2018 actively promoted economic and social empowerment for rural women and girls in agriculture and rural communities? How do the marketing platforms, Your Excellencies, for rural women produce, operate and what impact do they have on the promotion and development of women's products? My 2nd question,how has the state party ensured the inclusion of women in leadership and supervisory positions as well as in international committees related to climate change such as the World Commission on Protected Areas? Could the Delegation please provide examples of specific measures implemented to protect rural women from harsh climate conditions, especially with the adoption of modern assistive technology? In what ways has Oman encouraged theparticipation of Omani women in the development of climate change actions and what role have Omani women played in supervising data collection on greenhouse gas emissions? Your Excellencies, we also acknowledge the laws and initiatives that you did strongly articulate in regards to aspects in relation to migrant women and issues of migrant domestic workers that you responded to very articulately in Article 6. However, Your Excellencies, becausemigrant women also fall under disadvantaged groups of women that addressed in Article 14, we would like to inquire because alternative reports do indicate that migrant women workers continue to face protection challenges to their rights including exploitation and abuse and unequal access to medical care and health insurance. Your Excellencies, we look to you to please confirm if this is true and if it is, what efforts is the state partytaking to strongly enforce the laws to effectively protect the rights of women migrants including the migrant domestic workers including their right to be free from different forms of abuse and exploitation? My last question, Your Excellencies, what specific rehabilitation services are provided for girls with disabilities and how do these services contribute to their integration into schools? Could the Delegation pleaseelaborate on the measures taken to increase quotas for persons with disabilities? And how are the effectiveness of these measures assessed? What are the key components of the Ministry of Health's efforts to ensure non-discriminatory access to health care for women with disabilities? And just like my colleague has asked, in what ways has the Ministry of Social Development facilitated social and financial support for persons with disabilitiesincluding special parking, fee exemptions and housing assistance? Your Excellency, we look forward to your responses. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Akia. I now give the floor to the Delegation. Could you respond to the questions including Ms. Mikkel's follow-up question? Thank you very much. Regarding the impact of harmfulpractices, we resort to health care services, be it primary health or secondary health centers. These centers provide solutions based on the type of harm. We have training sessions to doctors and physicians on how to deal with cases of abuse and violence against children or women. We have thehave a guide on mental health in primary care comprises a chapter on these cases and how the referral is to be done and what is the consultation and how to define harmful practices. Regarding mental health, services for mental health are now part of the services provided by the primary healthcenters. We had found out earlier that some people facing mental health problems had a problem in resorting to primary health centers. That's why both types of services were integrated into one. Some individuals do not recognize or acknowledge that they are facing some mental health and do not seek treatment. This treatment is now provided in allprimary health centers. The main challenge now is to overcome the so-called stigma whenever people resort to assistance in case of mental health. We also face another challenge in having enough doctors and physicians who are specialized in mental health. We work also on providing trainingto all doctors and physicians in the primary health care centers so that they can diagnose so that they can provide diagnosis and treatment for the patients. Thank you. Regarding the questions about the situation of rural women, thank you, Your Excellency. First, regarding the refee program, this program waselaborated in cooperation with Oman Development Bank and it aims at promoting women's participation in the agricultural sector and to encourage women entrepreneurs in the rural areas. The portfolio is $31.2 million and the budget is increasing on an yearly basis. The beneficiaries from these loans among rural women, theirbeneficiaries are 195 women. They not only got the loans and grants but also they were able to benefit from training programs to encourage them in their entrepreneurial activities. Their projects are also sponsored and receive support from our ministry from the day they are established until they go on the market. Regarding theempowering programs for refee fund members, we have organized more than 22 marketing campaigns for refee products and 11 campaigns and training sessions about the right of women in terms of social benefits. We have organized more than 168technical training programs custom made according to the needs of the refee beneficiaries. In the field of management of projects and in the field of financial resources, we have trained 696 women entrepreneurs, rural women and the trainer of trainers. We haveorganized 238 awareness campaigns for the refee members, refee program members. We have also integrated an ePlatform to market the products of rural women or for marketing purposes for products of rural women. More than 313 women joined this ePlatform. It is a platform that provides marketingopportunities inside Oman, outside Oman, in Qatar, in Riyadh and in other neighboring markets. We have 84 platforms for refee products. Women members of the refee program receive 100% of funding for their programs from the Ministry of Agriculture. As to raising the value of their products, promoting theirproducts, submitting their products to examination by some laboratories, all this is also organized by our ministry. There was a question about the role of women in climate change. Rural women and members and heads of the various NGOs working for the sake of women empowerment, female students, all of them took partin training sessions, roundtables to draft our strategy for 2030 in terms of environment and climate change. So women from various sectors took part in drafting the strategy and took part also in designing the strategic plan as well as the monitoring efforts. Women are benefitingfrom such strategies. We have also adopted many strategies for women empowerment in the field of climate change. First initiative, women were empowered to deal with climate change and to become future leaders in their communities and among their peers. We have established a risk management departmentin the Ministry of Agriculture. This department drafts plans in early warning, prevention and other climate-related challenges. Most of the environmental challenges Omani women face is the increased temperature and the heat in somethe heat in summer, the limited amount of underground water, drought. That's why our ministry has endorsed many new technologies that enable us to be more flexible in facing and countering harsh climate conditions. It also helped women entrepreneurs in their production lines. Some crops wereproduced for one season every year now, they are produced in multiple seasons within the same year. We have supported 1,896 modern technology projects. There was a question about product development. Do we provide any support for product development? We support that, thesupport in this field. We are keen on finding on testing these products so that they are compliant with the various international norms and standards. The ministry is also helpingin building the marketing identity of these products. Are there any other questions? Ithink that I have covered all the questions. Regarding women's participation in differentCommittees, we stress that women have a strategic role in some protected areas in natural reservesin Oman. There is a Vice President of the Carbon Neutrality Program in Oman who is a woman. They are participating in blue carbon and green hydrogen projects. They have also did a lot of scientificresearches and they have attained high international status in these competitions and they have alsoled some youth initiatives including the different environmental initiatives. Thank you. I wouldlike to add something about the women leaders and climate change. Twenty-two female rural leaderswere empowered and enabled to raise the awareness of other women when it comes to entrepreneurshipand combating climate change. There was a question about discrimination in the access to healthcareto persons with disabilities. We stress that there is no discrimination in access to healthcarewhatsoever, especially not against persons with disabilities. There is also a ministerial decision, 5/223,that provides for eight items including giving persons with disabilities priority in access to surgeries andrehabilitation services and they are ahead of the waiting lines. Thank you. Regarding the programs ofrehabilitation and support of persons with disabilities in the 2nd half of 2022, the social protection actwas issued by law 52/223. Article 14 of the law clarified that the role of the Ministry of Social Developmentis to support other agencies to provide rehabilitation services and to coordinate the empowerment programs and other support programs decided by the government as well as the programs for socioeconomic integration and the programs for the rights of children,women, persons with disabilities and other groups. The executive regulations of the social protection act was issued underdecree 7/223 and Article 38 was explicit in its 1st chapter when it stipulated that persons with disabilities shall have all access andpersons with mental disabilities or persons who are autistic or have down syndrome or are visually or auditorily impaired shallhave all the services in the law and the rehabilitation services are also afforded to persons with disabilities including speechtherapy, physiotherapy and other types of therapy that would enable persons with disabilities to have the full spectrum of their rights. Regardingthe question on the financial literacy for 10th graders, especially the female students, the curricula in schools are uniform and they are do not discriminate betweengenders and they are being taught in all schools on equal footing. Regarding the question on the services given to girls with disabilitiesto enable them to be reintegrated within schools, the ministry of education has provided education to all segments of society and it seeks to achieve comprehensiveeducation by integrating persons with disabilities through the program that started in 2022 in partnership with all state agencies and in cooperation with the UNSF and the Oman Autism Association.This partnership caters for persons with all types of disabilities and they also provide vocational training for persons with disabilities in different fields. This partnership also aims to improve access to early education, high quality early education for persons with disabilities and to improvethe scientific achievement and the school participation and enrollment for persons with disabilities. Thank you. Regarding the exploitation of domestic workers, I think this has to do with the recruitment offices that make promises of very high salaries to domestic workers but when they come to theSultanate, they realize that the reality is different than they were led to believe. Also, the labor law was issued to regulate all of these issues and to align them with international standards. Regarding the participation of women in the 10th five-year plan, women participate or participatedin all of the stages of the plan including the preparation, design and monitoring of the implementation and as we have mentioned before, the criteria upon which women participate in this plan is merit and competencies and skills that women have and the ones that they have acquired and through their participation in previous development plans, the status quois analyzed and the programs are designed to address the different challenges. The indicators are also put in place, ones that are gender sensitive. Regarding the role of the SME Development Authority, the authority helps theSMEs and crafts and the economy in Iran. The authority provides financing packages and also training packages and some other services. Also, the authority also provides marketing and promotion services to the different SMEs. Also, the authority has also rolled out the program for the preparation of entrepreneurs of both genders. This program aims to raise thecapacities and the skills of the entrepreneurs as well as their knowledge of the legislative aspects and also how to manage crises, how to also utilize the frontier technologies. The authority has also provided an ePlatform to provide training for entrepreneurs and owners of SMEs and other craftsmen of both genders and to enable them to have the basic skills to manage and operationalize their businesses. Theauthority has also rolled out an initiative in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Affairs to extend the social security and to provide sustainable sources of income and to also have provide training programs and other tools and needs to enable workers to continue to develop their skills across their careers. In addition to that, theDevelopment Bank is exerting great efforts to fund small and medium size and micro enterprises as well in order to help individuals and to make them contribute to their societies as well as to provide opportunities to young people in the society. There are a number of priorities which are the small producers as well as the sectors that are considered priorities in thesociety. They are also considered for the needs of peddlers or street vendors as well as the persons who have micro enterprises of different sectors. The Development Bank has also helped the SMEs that were affected by the Shaheen Cyclone recently. It has provided loans up to 10 million Omani Rials and they are without any discrimination based on gender. And we kindly ask the speakers to speak at the moderate pace, please.In addition, there are a number of female crafts or actually crafts women who have been engaged and have received 90% of loans for their projects and also there is a virtual portfolio that through which loans are given 24K p events. In the latest, the largest package amongst those investor is Yesear in include. Azerbaijan has already given importance to the safeguarding project. In the basement of Swiss, a small technical company was partnering with government depository to render their defaults. Sweden.loans are given, 24% are given to women through this virtual portfolio. Also, there was a question about women entrepreneurs and SMEs led by women. The percentage of women owners of SMEswere 39.5%. Also, women who have the entrepreneur cards are account for 34% of all the holdersof the entrepreneur card. Excuse me, since we have lack of time, could you wait, I mean, couldyou answer to the questions if you cannot answer to the old question? Then before that, why don't we just listen to the follow-up question? And then we will go to the Article 15/16. And if you don't have enough time to answer all the questions, please send us your reply in writing.Ms. Manalo, please. Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson, for giving me the floor once more. And thank you for the patience that the Oman Delegation has with me raising another questionagain. It simply says that, in fact, you are going to educate me on the subject of the relationship of agriculture under the woman's hand and artificial intelligence. Do you have such a project andapproach to the production of food by the use of artificial intelligence? I ask that question because honestly, I'm ignorant about artificial intelligence. And I want to know if you have knowledge about that, how does it help the woman of Oman in the agricultural sector? Numbertwo, I have also heard that artificial intelligence for the immediate time is good. But on the long run, it does more harm than good. If you have knowledge of this, kindly share it with ushere, particularly me because I want to know what this is all about. And I will owe you a big favor if you do that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ms. Akia, very quickly, please.Thank you, Delegation. I'm really impressed with all the data that you have provided. Mine is also just to be educated because I would like your clarification. What do you say to different organizations that provide the rest of the general public with information that may be the disadvantaged women like the migrant workers are having challenges like abuses to their rights but with all vis-a-vis the comprehensive legislation that you provided for us earlier?We are doing the dialogue. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Bessel, please. Madam Chair, I, too, would like to thank the Delegation for the extensive responses that they have given to Article 13 and socioeconomic empowerment of women. And I wanted to ask again about the women with disabilities, even though you have given a lot of attention and effort to this area. I read where the banks and also insurance companies have laid out or rolled outcertain kinds of benefits for women with disabilities. And I wanted to know what categories of disabilities were benefiting from the bank services that they have put in place and also what kinds of insurance benefits do the insurance companies give to women with disabilities? Thank you. Thank you very much. Now let's move on to the Part 4 of the Convention, Article 15 on equality before the law and 16th Family and Marriage Act.relation. And I give the floor to Ms. Nahla Haida for 6 min , please. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would like at the outset to welcome the high level Delegationof Oman and to note the positive developments in the law, especially in the basic law on 2021, especially the Article 21 of this basic law. We congratulate the Sultanate of liftingthe reservation of Article 15 and for letting us know the mechanism, the three-pronged mechanism to lift the reservations on international organizations in order to align the national legislation.In spite of these provisions, we are still concerned with the personal status law. Marriage in thelaw is based on reciprocal or complimentary not equal rights between the spouses. The underlying principle is that in return for maintenance and protection from the husband, the wife isexpected to obey him. Of course, we do not discourage obedience, but we would like to say that women participate in the income of the family, if not are the main breed winners. So the factof having the husband provide protection and maintenance in return for obedience is questionable. So in the law, also a woman is responsible for doing the chores and taking care of the familyand everything, but Article 54 mentions that the wife risks losing her financial maintenance if she prevents her husband from approaching her, refuses to move the marital home withoutthe reason or refrains from traveling with her husband. If this is for the purpose of maintaining theunity of the family, we would have understood that, but in 2022, some media outlets reported that Omani women are challenging these traditions and demanding equal partnership as divorce raterose to 12% compared to the previous year with 67% of divorce initiated by women. I know that there are different reasons in different countries, but there seems to be a crisis whenit comes to the role of women and her participation. So I do not single out Oman here, but in the replies to the list of issues and also in the opening statements, we have heard that theSultanate is fully aware of the important developments or the importance of introducing developments in this aspect in line with Oman vision 24 and the importance of issuing new pieces oflegislation and laws, including ones about the rights of women. I would like to know the pieces of legislation that the state aims to change or modify in line with Oman vision 2040 andin line with the principle of equality stipulated in the basic law of 2021. Does that include the amendment of the personal status law and especially on polygamy and guardianship andinheritance? Does the state party intend to do the following? Amend the personal statuslaw to guarantee equality between men and women in marriage and also repeal the provisionsthat give the wife the duty to care for children and the house only and also ensure that all women have equal right to enter into marriage on their accord by abolishing the requirement of the permission of a male guardian and without having to resort to court proceedings. Thishappened in many countries like Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Iraq. So these are all Islamic and Arab countries that have done so. Also number 4, introduce a marital property regime wherebywomen receive equal rights to property acquired by the spouses during marriage upon the dissolution of marriage taking into account contribution to the marital household through unpaid domestic work.5, to grant women equal rights with men with regard to divorce and inheritance. Also to consider prohibiting polygamous marriages or to introduce the requirement of the consent of the 1st wifeto polygamous marriages and to give the wife a specific option of divorce in case her husband marries a 2nd wife just like other countries like Turkey, Morocco, Algeria. 7, to grant equalrights to mothers and fathers of guardianship and custody of their children. In conclusion, Madam Chair, I would like to refer to what the head of Delegation said including the challengesthat are based on culture and religion. I would like to say that in the OHCHR there is an initiativetitled Faith for Rights in which we hold dialogues with clerics in order to initiate a bottom-up communalchange in addition to the top-down change so that the two dynamics can mesh together so that we can achieve the change that we are hoping for in the society. Thank you, Ms. Heider. I now give thefloor to the Delegation. Could you kindly wrap up your answer within 10 minutes and then remaininganswers please give us the answer in writing. Thank you very much.We only have 10 minutes. The head of Delegation reminds the Delegation so I would ask you all to be very concise and succinct in your answers and answers the question directly. Please don't repeat things that your colleagues may have said when taking the floor. Thank you. So as the next memberof the Delegation we listen very carefully to the comments and questions on the law on civil status.That law was promulgated in 1997 and it is due to be reviewed. It should be reviewed to bring it into line with changes in society whilst, of course, simultaneously respecting Islamic Sharia whichis the source of our basic law in Oman. As you know, this law is societal in nature. It is society and changes in society which push for the modifications that need to be made to said law. It responds tosocietal changes as it were when it evolves. And if the Committee has any direct proposals, suggestions to make, then we can feed these back to the Advisory Council and the Council of State will regard any proposals with regard to amending our law on civil status that the Committee may wish to put. Now,you made a comment about the law and you said that said law on civil status provides that women's role is housework. But just to make it clear that the law on civil you also made the point that the law oncivil status makes women solely responsible for taking care of children. I would like to point out that this is not true. Article 36, e.g. , provides for equal responsibilities between husband and wife when it comes to childcare, et cetera. All of that is inspired by Sharia law, Islamic Sharia lawwhich insists that marriage is based on mutual understanding and mutual rights and mutual respect.So there is no such provision which dictates that such a task is only the responsibility of a woman. There is equality between the spouses that's provided for in the law and in Sharia law. You referred to goodsand assets acquired by a couple during their marriage. The laws of the Sultan of Oman provide that both spouses enjoy financial independence. So both husband and wife remains the owner of theirassets of their goods. Thus a woman during a marriage can acquire assets and property goods in her own name through her own activities and endeavors and the husband has no right of distribution or use overthose assets or goods. The same holds true for the husband. Whenever there is a separation or divorce each one walks away with their own goods and assets during the marriage. You see that in legislation. That's what the legislation provides for in practice. This might vary in practice. We seethat when there is a separation or divorce on the basis of good faith between the two parties, things might be divided up differently and if that's not the case, then, of course, the law exists to help divide up assets, property goods, et cetera. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to reaffirmthat the Sultanate of Oman is currently carrying out a review of all legislation and we are amending the labor code and the law in schools, e.g. . We are currently in the midst of such legislative reforms. We are currently reviewing all the old pieces of legislation. That's an ongoing processin the Sultanate. The head of Delegation, with regard to the increase in divorce rates in Oman,I think that stems from changes in society. We have foreign cultures that impact young people. They see how things are done differently in different cultures and young people want to do things differently.They don't want to get married and set up a family, certainly not to do so young. Of course, this renders families and the family structure vulnerable, something we need to look at. But it also means this impact of different outside views, different cultures that people are more willingto seek and understand that divorce is available to them. As I said, a question was asked about an increase in divorce rates. I think we see more divorces in more recent marriages rather than in more longstanding marriages. This is an issue that is dealt with by my ministry. We have a marriagepreparation course which helps to prepare the couple for their married life together and what roles they will need to undertake and what will need to be in place to set up a family, e.g. ,to have a family. Both the man and the woman need to participate in household tasks and the care of children, et cetera, that men need to play their full part. That's part of that marriage prep coursesthat we provide. Often we have an increasing number of working women working in shift work, e.g. , in hospitals, et cetera. So increasingly it is the husband who takes care of the children if, e.g. , women work early in the morning or at night. If the husband is also working, they need to lookfor alternative childcare arrangements and that's increasingly accepted in society and allows for a better division of roles between men and women. We are really seeing that shift in Oman towardsthat more equal sharing of the burden, particularly when it comes to childcare and according to our legislation at all times when decisions are taken with regard to childcare, it's the best interest ofthe child that prevail and also makes it clear that both father and mother have a role to play. It isn't the responsibility of one or the other to take full the full burden of childcare. That decisions must be taken when deciding how to deal with childcare, prioritizing the best interest of thechild. That's also part of our marriage prep course. With regard to pension, husbands cannot withholda wife's pension rights if she hasn't got her own separate pension. A wife must continue to pay, e.g. , a pension where appropriate. He must also continue to provide alimony, child support, et cetera, in case of divorce or separation. That is part of our social protection law and childprotection law. My own ministry is very active in all of these matters and we believe that both men and women have the right to freedom of choice once they are divorced. When it comes to protection fordivorced women or those who are seeking divorce who don't want to continue a marriage, then those protection measures in place, women are free to seek a divorce and to be protected from retaliatory measures. With regard to family life and the right to family life, any woman who wishes to marry withoutthe authorization of their guardian, then there is a recourse open to them to pursue the marriage anyway without that assent of their guardian. They can go before the court and a judge will rule in favor of an adult woman being able to choose freely her husband and thus for the marriage to go ahead.Thank you very much. I give the floor to my colleagues as the head of delegation. I would like to address the question asked about bank transactions for persons with disabilities. We have a circularfrom the central bank and this circular deals with transactions and banking operations for persons with disabilities. It was published in October of 2021. The purpose of that circular is to ensurethat all citizens in the Sultanate including persons with disabilities can without any discrimination whatsoever enjoy full access to banking services, to banking transactions, et cetera. Certain banks havereduced the interest rates on credit loans to 0.25% for persons with disabilities. Certain banks have made greater strides than others ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities and have done theirutmost to ensure that banking services are available to persons with disabilities, e.g. , via telebanking or via other means, a broader range of means than just in the branch or online. Thank you very much. Thank you to the next speaker. There are around 20 studies that have been carried out withregard to women's empowerment and how this can be increased and improved and how it can also go hand in hand with boosting citizenship values and the structure of the countries to reassure there havebeen studies into that. Thank you. With regard to the circular on enhanced credit facilities for persons with disabilities, this includes enhanced or better credit facilities with better interest rates forthose seeking to buy specially modified vehicles, e.g. , and also reduction on healthcare insurance costs, on travel insurance costs, et cetera, for persons with disabilities. This covers also audiovisualdisabilities as well as autism and other types of disabilities. Now turning to artificial intelligenceor AI and the role that AI has to play in the field of agriculture, AI helps farmers when it comes tothe predictability of their activities to forecasting their activities. I think AI has a vital role to play and it helps women farmers in particular. AI is very user friendly. It helps, e.g. , withscheduling the use of insecticides and it ensures that such equipment can be automated and nobody, including female farmers, needs to go out into the fields to operate them themselves. We also have herbicidesand here again there is equipment that is AI driven which means that they can be used on an automated basis. CHATGPT is used for the commercialization of products of interest to farmers and to rural womenand women who work in the field of agriculture can have access to information, can provide information via CHATGPT. They can reach a wider market. So AI has a very positive role to play in the field ofagriculture, including for female farmers. It includes the use of drones, particularly in date plantations, date palm plantations. Again, you can use AI to automate the process of using pesticides to spray date palms. It takes less than an hour to do a whole standard plantation and it, as I say,means it's an entirely automated process. It saves some of the labor of farmers, including female farmers. I'm not talking about robots that will replace farmers including female farmers and makethem entirely redundant. These are tools to assist them in their tasks. It will automate those tasks to give them more time to carry out more important tasks that they can fix their attention on. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your all the answers. This concludes the consideration offalse periodic report of Oman. I would like to thank the expert for questioning and the comment, their question and comment and the representative of the state party for the responses and explanationsprovided. Does the head of the Delegation wish to make some concluding observations, remarks, please?Thank you very much, indeed, Chair. I would like 1st and foremost to thank the expert members of the CEDAW Committee for the questions put to my Delegation. Perhaps we weren't able to respond to all of them. If that is the case and there are some questions outstanding to which you have not receivedreplies, please let us know and send us those questions so that we can respond to them in writing in the 24 hour time frame because there are so many questions that some can fall through the cracks.With regard to the review of our legislation and the amending of it in order to prioritize women's rights,the National Commission on Family Matters is studying the possibility of having a law on the family andif that does go ahead, there will be a chapter in that law on child protection, protection of rights of persons with disabilities and protection of women as well as older persons. We are currently seekingto commission a study as a precursor to that new law and we hope that in the future we will be able to steer it to safe harbor world, put together that law in close cooperation, collaboration and dialogue with key stakeholders, of course. By way of conclusion, I would like most sincerely to thank youall and here I speak on behalf of all the members of the Omani Delegation. I thank the Chair of this meeting and I thank, as I said, all of the experts for the questions, for the comments, for the follow-up questions, for the points of clarification. This has been a very enriching and helpful debate for usas the representatives of Oman and all of this will contribute to spurring us to doing better as we review these questions, as we review the issues that you have flagged. They will spur us to adopt the necessary mechanisms and put in place the necessary tools to boost the level of women's empowermentand ensure that they can take their full place in society, particularly in those areas where there is still more that needs to be done to ensure that women play their full role where they are currently underrepresented. I would like in particular to thank the permanent representativeof the Sultan of Oman to the United Nations office and other international organizations here in Geneva for his unstinting efforts to assist my Delegation in preparing for this dialogue and to abide by the recommendations for Treaty bodies when it comes to State Party reviews including CEDAW. I would alsolike to thank my fellow members of the Delegation who represent various different governmental institutions. They have all referred to the different efforts underway in the Sultanate of Oman in order to ensure that all the provisions of your Convention, the CEDAW Convention, can be fully implemented inour country. The Sultanate of Oman wishes to empower women. We wish to tap the potential of their skills, their ability because we are firmly persuaded that women have a vital role to play and that women, with women as a key partner, will be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.With women and with women's full unfettered input we can see a more prosperous Omani society and it is this potential that we as the authorities of Oman wish to tap. We want to promote and bolster the role of women because we are fully aware that development can never enjoy full fruition without the full buy-inand contribution of women. Women, I hope, are proud of the empowerment efforts that we are pursuing. They have equal opportunities with men and where that is not the case, we will seek to make that place so that they contribute to society and ensure a prosperous Oman in the future. We will not let upin our efforts in order to ensure greater and full empowerment for all groups in society, including women, so that they can play their full role in our society so that they can all enjoy a favorablesetting, a favorable environment, including as women, to play their part in building and forging a brighter future for our society and for our country. We wish all the very best to all women around the world. May the peace of God be with you all. Thank you very much for your kind attention. Thank you verymuch. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the Delegation for the constructive dialogue with the Committee, which has provided further insight into the situation of women in your country. The Committee commendsthe State Party for its effort and would encourage it to take all necessary measures to address the various recommendations of the Committee, which will be formally communicated to you through the permanent mission for purposes of a more comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Conventionthroughout the territory of the State Party for the benefit of all women and girls in the country. The Committee also reminds the State Party that it selects a number of recommendations for immediatefollow-up. These are mentioned at the end of the concluding observations. It invites the State Party to pay particular attention to those selected recommendations and to submit information ontheir implementation within the deadline defined in the same paragraph. Thank you, Excellency, and we look forward to receiving your next periodic report. The Committee will now convene closing meeting. Themeeting is adjourned. Excuse me. We reconvene the meeting after 5:00. In 5 minutes for the closed meeting."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good morning, everyone. I call to order the 1700th Plenary meeting of the Conference onDisarmament. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for participatingin the meeting today. I would like to propose that we carry out an exchange of views ora discussion on the nonpaper circulated electronically yesterday by the Secretariat on behalf of theChair. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, at this point I invite Delegations to raisetheir name plates in case they wish to take the floor. I see that His Excellency, the Ambassadorof Brazil has sought the floor. You have the floor, Your Excellency. Thank you, Mr. President. We are about to enter to the final stages of your period at the helm of the CD and our attentionis now focused on the ever challenging issue of the Program of Work, POW. This question can be addressed by three different angles, why, what and how. The simplest answer to the 1stquestion is that we need a Program of Work to honor the Conference negotiating mandate. I would add another cogent reason, agreement on POW is even more necessary because a signal to the world that we continue to engage and reach out to each other on matters of peaceand security during these trying times is more required than ever. Finally, last week events exposed crudely that we do want to exclude some known members of the CD from our deliberations.It's now up to us to demonstrate that the members of the Conference are still capable of maintaining open the lines of communication among them. Some might claim that this is a futile symbolicgesture. I do not share this perception. At this juncture we cannot afford to lose any opportunities to reverse narratives. Goodwill is a scarce commodity nowadays. As to the 2nd question regarding the format of this work program, we have the time tested solution regarding thecreation of subsidiary bodies to address the key issues before the Conference. Like Mexico, we were somewhat underwhelmed by the outcome of the recent deliberations of those bodies.They have not advanced negotiations. They do not heed to the repeated calls from the General Assembly resolutions regarding the negotiations of instruments. It's my impression that such problems do not stand from any intrinsic flaw in the design of the subsidiary bodies or fromtheir mandates. Rather, the difficulties derive from the difficult balancing act of having and I quote, a comprehensive and balanced program of work when Delegations have fairly differentpriorities. Consequently, strategic and surmountable obstacles and technical hindrances conspire to the progress on ranking negotiating priorities leading to an impasse. Mr. President, finallyas to the how, yesterday your text was circulated with your best judgment as to where a possible consensus lies. It's based on a time-tested formulation. Since it was last adopted, notmuch water has passed under the bridge. You marginally improved the text with some small amendments. I suggest that we take this text as the basis for any engagement and that you should perseverein trying to find formulations that are acceptable by all. Should we confront difficulties, we ought to revert back to your original formulation. It's preferable to initiate engagement with a less than perfect text than to fail in the search of a holy grail that is very unlikelyto bridge the divergences of opinion in this room. To be clear, we are after a 2nd or 3rd best and not a foolproof solution. In brief, Mr. President, the why clearly trumpsthe what and you know how to do it. Thank you. I thank His Excellency, the Ambassador of Brazilfor his remarks. I now see the Delegation of the United Kingdom has sought the floor. Your Excellency, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. I can be brief because I can only agree with what the Distinguished Ambassador of Brazil has just said and I can't put it anybetter than he did. None of us in this room I suspect has any great enthusiasm for the way that subsidiary bodies proceeded in 2022 but in the circumstances it seems that the alternativeis to have no substantive deliberations this year and that would not be in the interests of this conference and it would not be in the interests of international peace and security. So despite the temptation to improve and tinker further, I think we should proceed as you havesuggested. Your text is based very heavily on the model which commanded consensus in 2022. The improvements that you have made and I think they are improvements derive from a model thatalso commanded consensus in 2018 and led to a fruitful round of discussions in that year. So I think rather than spending more time trying to improve something which is already sufficientfor the job that we have before us, my suggestion would be to proceed on the basis that you have suggested and to move as soon as possible into the substantive discussions that we are allhere for. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency, for your remarks. His Excellency, the ambassadorof China has sought the floor. You have the floor, Your Excellency. Thank you, Mr. President. Since the end of last year, you as the 1st rotating president of CDIP this year have made effortsto promote extensive consultations among all parties to reach a POW. China appreciates this. China has also noted that yesterday the Secretariat distributed your nonpaper and we are studyingthem carefully. Since the opening of the CDIP this year, the majority of states have spoken in recognition of the delicate balance reflected in the 2022 decision on the work of the CDIPand the support making this year's programme of work on this basis as soon as possible. Looking back at the process of reaching the 2022 decision, China has two notable experiences. Firstly,we must remain ambitious and promote the establishment of subsidiary bodies as soon as possible to carry out substantive work on various issues in a comprehensive and balanced manner. If SBs cannotbe established and simply hold thematic plenaries on the topics of the CDIP, it will be difficult to accumulate energy and create a good momentum for pragmatic and professional debates. Thehistorical experience of the CDIP in treaty negotiations and its work practice since 2018 have fully proved that SBs can better encourage all parties to conduct in-depth debates, gradually bridgedifferences, keep solidifying consensus and promote the work of the CDIP in the direction of treaty negotiations in light of the development of the situation. Secondly, we need to face thereality. We should respect the differences and the red lines of all parties, follow the previous consensus in the CDIP and the spirit of relevant GA resolutions and discuss and reach a POW in acomprehensive and balanced manner. The parties have long held different views on the priorities,the modalities of work and the ultimate goals of the CDIP should achieve. The root cause is that the security environment, security concerns and demands of all parties are different and the ways ofthinking about solving their own security issues are also fundamentally different. Frankly speaking, the CDIP is not capable and should not discuss and resolve all its differences through its POW. Basedon this understanding in the process of drafting the 2022 decision, China and the Member States usedthe constructive and the substantive work which is constructive and ambiguous term and at the same time strictly implemented the principle of comprehensive balance so as to treat all items equallyin terms of wording of the topics and the meeting arrangements and finally reached this valuable decision, Mr. President. Consensus is hard to come by and the trust is precious. The decision in 2022did not fully satisfy any Member States but it did not cross the red line of any country. The priority of the CDIP is to maintain the basic common understanding of all parties on the POWs since 2022and gradually restore and form a mutual trust by launching discussions in SBs. In this process, we should pay special attention to avoid making perfect the enemy of good and keep the clear andconcise feature to avoid introducing any complicated factors and interfering with the discussion process. China has carefully listened to the views expressed by colleagues on specifictexts and would like to give some preliminary feedback on the President's nonpaper. On the mandates of SBs, China has noted that Member States have different views on the objectives and mandates. This was alsothe reason why China adopted the constructive and ambiguous approach in the 2022 decision. China believes that we should avoid making too clear interpretations and break the tacit understandingof substantive work. At the same time, keep the wording of advanced substantive work on all general items in a comprehensive and balanced manner to avoid cutting off the linkage of the general itemswith in a comprehensive and balanced manner. As for the timetable of the SBs in the nonpaper, considering that the President and some Member States have put forward different wordings, all parties may considerdefining the names of the subsidiary bodies in strict accordance with the agenda adopted by consensus to avoid unnecessary differences. Mr. President, the CD is in session for nearly three weeks this year.China expects and believes that all parties can adhere to the existing consensus, simplify the complex issues, seek common ground while resolving differences and reach a POW acceptable to allparties as soon as possible so that the CD can early start substantive work. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency, for your remarks. I give the floor to Her Excellency, the Ambassador of Japan. You have thefloor, Your Excellency. Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor and also for circulatingthe nonpaper on the draft decision on the work in 2024. We greatly appreciate your leadership in guiding us through the consultations on this decision. I would like to mention a few comments on the nonpaperthat was circulated. The 1st point is on the subsidiary bodies. I have listened carefully to the previous speakers' comments on this point. Japan strongly supports establishing the subsidiary bodiesto have in-depth discussions on the agenda items of the CD. To this end, Japan hopes that the conference will adopt a program of work or a decision on the work as early as possible so that the CD will be ableto advance substantive work at the Single Multilateral Disarmament Negotiating Forum. Also, without prejudice to any future decisions, we also hope that such a decision will allow the subsidiary bodiesto continue to work in subsequent years so that their substantive work can be effectively followed up going forward. The 2nd point is that we believe that it is important to build upon the previous workof the CD in considering the program of work. We need to prioritize its substantive work accordingto the degree of maturity of each subject. From this perspective, Japan stresses the importance of the immediate commencement of negotiations on the Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclearweapons or other nuclear explosive devices. We hope that this priority will be reflected in the decisionon the work. In this context, we welcome the reference to the FMCT in the timetable for subsidiary body2. We strongly hope that this reference will be retained. Japan will also remain committed to constructively engaging in substantive discussions on other issues within the subsidiary bodies, includingradiological weapons, considering the adoption of the resolution titled radiological weapons at the UN General Assembly in December last year. Lastly, I also hope that we can arrive at the consensus decisionand start our substantive work as soon as possible and we are ready to be engaged for that purpose. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Your Excellency. I now give the floor to His Excellency,the Ambassador of Germany. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, let me recommend you for all your efforts to find consensus on the important decisions we had and we still haveto take at the beginning of our work this year. We all know that this is not an easy task. The fact that we did not find consensus on the 1st decision, the decision on observers does certainly not contributeto the transparency, constructiveness and open mindedness we urgently need to make progress on a program of work as well. This year we have seen the largest number of UN Member States financing ourconference, the work of our conference being denied to participate in the conference as observers. The Russian Delegation alone waited 14 UN Member States to participate for purely political reasons, amongstthem our closest EU partners, but we will certainly not allow the European Union to be silenced just as we will not allow an independent state to be erased from the map in Europe. Mr. President, I have recalledour failure to reach consensus on observers because we still have another important decision before us, the decision on a program of work, a decision which again needs consensus and here again we urgently needan atmosphere of conducive dialogue to come to cooperative solutions. My Delegation will continue to support you in this and we will continue to show our greatest flexibility. Mr. President, on all ofthe topics under the authority of the conference, progress is urgently needed. In our view, the draft program of work contained in the discussion paper you have put before us provides a comprehensive basis for commencing our discussions in all the various strands in the respective subsidiary bodies. Thisapproach has been proven to be a constructive way forward in 2022 and we support this approach wholeheartedly for this year as well. Not being a guarantee for success, the establishment of subsidiary bodiescould again allow for in depth discussions. The minor changes you have introduced to the consensus text from 2022 do not change the position of my Delegation. However, I understand that that might not be the casefor all the Delegations in this room. So the way to consensus on these changes could take time, time we may not have. This would certainly not be the case with regard to the changes in the title of subsidiarybody 2. Coming back to the consensus language from 2018, it is even a clear improvement. It is the view of my Delegation that the negotiation of an FMCT is most ripe and the next logical step to take. Andwith the document CD/12/99 we have a mandate which is flexible enough and is not judging any specific outcome. Mr. President, the proposal set out in your discussion paper finds the full support of myDelegation. We should be careful not to burden the draft with additional changes, changes which are not yet consensus proven as it is the case for your text. It is our understanding that all the relevant issuesimportant to my Delegation or any other Delegation in the room like negative security assurances,the prevention of arms race in outer space, nuclear risk reduction can be addressed and brought forward in the framework of this proposal. For my Delegation it is also important that the proposal allows us to startwork on the issue of the treaty banning radiological weapons, an issue which in our view is more thanpromising to find consensus on. It could allow our conference to start with concrete negotiations and thus allowing to fulfill its mandate after a long period of still stand. Thank you very much, Mr.President. Thank you, Your Excellency. The Delegation of Belgium has sought the floor. You have the floor,sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. First of all, let me thank you for convening us today. We appreciate all your workand efforts to find consensus on a program of work which would advance the work of this conference.The EU and its Member States remain deeply concerned that the conference on disarmament as a single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community has been deadlocked for solong. Despite the known challenges, we must advance technical substantive work and broaden areas of agreement so that we are better prepared to start negotiations. The EU underscores the urgency andsignificance of advancing the material cutoff treaty through the actions agreed within the framework of the UNGA Resolution 78/28 supported by the 155 states. We stand ready to support the immediatecommencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the CED of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with document CED/1299and the mundane contained therein. We urge all CED members to adopt a program of work in 2024 whichwould include the commencement of negotiations on the FMCT. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Belgium for his remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof Mexico. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, President. And we would like to once againcommend you for your efforts as the President and we commend your team as well. First of all, I would like to highlight something which I shared during the informal session of the regional consultationsincluding through bilateral consultations and this is Mexico's skepticism about this exercise ofestablishing subsidiary bodies and trying to see them as a substitute for the program of work, a substitute for the substantive program of work that would engender specific negotiations. Mexico's position is basedon previous experience. The subsidiary bodies of 2018 and 2020 as well as other similar mechanisms that were established on multiple occasions in previous years did not deliver on the mandate ofdeepening technical debates on the various topics. This was largely due to the fact that statements who were participating just reiterated their national state positions rather than delving into the detailsof the contents. It gave rise to parallel sessions in which discussions sometimes bordered on the academic rather than the diplomatic and these exercises did not really contribute to reaching a consensus onadopting a program of work and beginning negotiations which would be how the CD could deliver on its mandate. Discussions ended up duplicating the work of the UN's disarmament commission. For Mexico,the function of the subsidiary bodies is one of a mechanism foreseen by the rules of the conference for tackling specific topics that are of concern or which require an in-depth analysis for negotiations.In that sense, they are mechanisms which make technical scientific discussions possible or discussions on particular aspects of policy and politics. We are concerned that a practice that began in 2018 asan endeavor to try and find a way out of the gridlock is becoming a generalized practice. We are concernedby the idea that form is becoming substance and the work of the CD is being based on decisions that arepurely procedural in nature. This notwithstanding, my Delegation would like to participate in a constructive way in the work of this conference and, therefore, we would like to take stock of the work done byprevious subsidiary bodies in order to see how such work could be improved upon with a view to fulfilling our negotiations mandate. We have looked at your proposal with great interest. We feel that thechanges that have been made are minor and as regards some aspects could be further tweaked but, in general, we feel they are going in the right direction and they are in the right spirit. To try and make themandate more explicit of the Conference on Disarmament, I think that you have struck the right note in that respect. We have to acknowledge that our mandate is to agree on specific measures in the field ofdisarmament. Of course, we know the position of the G21 and of many Delegations whereby on many of the agenda items there should be legally binding instruments and I believe that you have tried to reflectthat. Regarding subsidiary body 2, we understand that this is a reflection of the 2018 decision which wasaccepted by the Conference. My Delegation understands that we would be addressing this topic in accordance with the mandate that we were given and with the appropriate scope and we would not necessarily belimiting ourselves to the single topic of production but that there would be scope to consider stockpilesas well. In a constructive spirit, Mr. President, and as I said on Tuesday, I believe that one thing we canreflect on is how can we overcome the constant thematic discussions in a procedural document asthis one is. I think that this is an issue that has contributed to the paralysis of the Conference for decades. We have to be comprehensive and fair, equitable. We need to reflect specific topics inthe agenda. I think that my Delegation can see how within last year's discussions we saw a need forthe CD to have a closer interaction with other bodies of the disarmament machinery and, of course, the First Committee and the General Assembly resolutions are one of those mechanisms throughwhich the international community decides upon priorities in the field of disarmament. Year after year we have received from the Secretary General a list of resolutions which contain specific mandatesfor the CD and those are specific to the CD. There are other resolutions which contain other topics that are relevant to our agenda. My Delegation considers that it would be useful for the CDto ensure that the issue of subsidiary bodies would take into account the specific mandates received from the Secretary General on the understanding that they don't necessarily reflect consensus among MemberStates of the Conference but that would enable us to in addition to the discussions in the proceduraldocument we could look at all the issues in a technical forum and we could substantiate ourreflections through these and the contents that would be coming from these proposals and listen to the justifications of those who have doubts about a given proposal or listen to what the problems theyface for entering into negotiations at this stage. I think that such an exercise would make the session that lies ahead of us a much more focused undertaking. There would be a much more technical discussion andfar less politicized because unfortunately in recent years it has been very politicized. We would be able to focus on thematic and substantive matters in an organized fashion and potentially we couldfind some topics upon which there is consensus and from there move on to specific negotiations. We know that mandates are very varied in terms of their sponsorship, in terms of their support and also interms of the position they generate. But I think this would be a more constructive way of entering into the work of this conference rather than simply continuing with the paralysis that we have seenover many years. So these are my thoughts which I wanted to share with the room. Thank you. I thankthe Distinguished Delegate of Mexico for his remarks. I now give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United States of America. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Chair. I wantto thank you for all of your efforts to bring us to a consensus on this particular document. I would like to echo many of the remarks of most of the previous speakers. I'm thinking here of Mexico,Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and Brazil. We believe that the draft that you have put forward is a very good one and that that should be the basis for coming to a decision for this year.From our perspective, it's important for the CD to go beyond what was agreed in 2022. As others have said, it shows that we are making some progress, however incremental it may be. And I would note aswell that the language that you have added to this text is drawn from language which has been previously agreed. So it should not be controversial. From our perspective, too, I think in addition to thinkingabout the substantive small substantive improvements to the 2022 decision that have been made and that are in your text, we would be open for our part to a few other revisions that have more to do with the processof our work. I would note the intervention made by our Mexican colleague about having language and these are things that we could put in the preamble, for instance, without getting into how we do our work,but it would send a signal. But we could add language along the lines of taking into account the recommendations contained in UNGA resolutions, for instance. They are not binding on the CD, but there is no reason whywe can't take them into account. We have also noted the calls by some, I'm thinking here of Egypt and Japan and others to add continuity to our work and more flexibility to our work as we go forward. Andwe have had some thoughts on that and drawing from the paper that we circulated in May, we have a couple of proposals which I would be happy to circulate after this meeting. They are not designed to causesubstantive difficulties, but let me read them out. One would be to add something to the preamble, which would simply say desiring to bring to the advancement of the conference's work greater continuity andflexibility. And then dropping down to OP5 in your text, we would propose to add after the words, thereports on the progress achieved and agreed on by consensus and subsidiary bodies, comma, including recommendations for continuing the work in the following session, comma, would be submitted as follows. Sothis would at least give the Committees the possibility to make some recommendations to the conference on how we might be able to carry our work forward in the following year. And similarly, in the name of someadditional flexibility for Paragraph 8, when you put in connection with the timetable for the meetings of the subsidiary bodies, we would simply have a sentence that would say the subsidiary bodies should meet at a minimum accordingto the schedule laid out in the timetable. So this would give them the option if they so choose. It is not a requirement. It just leaves open the possibility of some flexibility in how meetings are scheduled accordingto needs that might arise if a particular discussion requires a little bit more attention. Thank you verymuch. Thank you, Your Excellency. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Indonesia. You have thefloor, sir. Very much, Mr. President. First of all, allow me to extend our heartfelt appreciation to your commitment for your work in crafting this nonpaper. Your commitment in advancing this objective for this Disarmament Conference is very commendable. It is imperative that we as members of CDI reach a consensus on the program of work. Our collective agreement on this matter is crucial for the advancement of ourcircle in Disarmament. Indonesia fully underscores the necessity of establishing legally binding agreement in the PO program of work. This agreement serves as the foundation for meaningful progress in Disarmament effort providing the necessary framework for effective implementation. We stand ready to demonstrate flexibility and engage in constructive discussion to achieve the consensus. In this regard, we also urge other field members to exhibit similar flexibility and willreadiness to engage in the dialogue. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Indonesia who is the next president of the CD representing the next presidency of the CD. I now give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador of the Netherlands. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, President. Let me thank you also again for all your tireless efforts to bring consensusin the room on the program of work. I would like to make three remarks. First on the establishing of subsidy bodies, 2nd on the mandate and three more in general on the CD. First on the establishing of subsidy bodies. A bit like the colleague from Mexico not all our memories of subsidy bodies are pleasant. But we have to be honest. There areIf that was the best we could do in 2018, I have my doubts whether we can do better now. And that's indeed also with regard to the mandate. It was already said by the UK colleague, we have to compromise. Your proposal is not perfect. It might indeed be 2nd , 3rd choice, but it might also be the best we can do. And indeed, theyou improved it with some tested text from the past. It's a 2022/2018 mixture. We stand readyto support that. But last but not least, I would say a few words on the CD itself. We have tomove into a negotiating mode, but we did also some very good discussions in Montreux and I think also the UK of the U.S. Ambassador referred to that. We have to look into continuity andflexibility to also preserve some of the work that is valuable in the subsidy bodies for the future and not to start all over again next year from zero from scratch as if nothing hashappened in this year. And for that reason, we would really like to continue the discussion on revitalizing the CD and in particular with regard to the topics of ensuring more continuityand flexibility. Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Excellency. I now give the floor tothe Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, President. First and foremost, allow me to thank you for all of the work that you have conducted withyour team to organize this meeting and come to us with a concrete proposal on a decision to organize the work of the conference this year. We carefully listened to the speakerswho have already taken the floor and we consider that a whole series of very interesting and useful and promising proposals and ideas have been aired. And we are prepared to work on theseand some of them we agree to. We completely agree with the hypothesis that the conference should as soon as possible start its substantive work and we are in solidarity with all of theother Delegations who have said that we need to deploy the maximum amount of effort to achieve a consensus on the decision on the work of the conference this year. Moreover, we completelysupport the idea in this decision to base ourselves on the 2022 document which as was quite rightlystated by the majority of those who have spoken represents a good basis for us to be able to make progress in our work. Moreover, we are in complete solidarity with those statementsmade which spoke of the need for us to move forward and to move towards negotiations. Ofcourse, our priority and that is the priority of the Russian Delegation is exactly this. So we completely agree with what was said there. Then to turn to the structure of our work andmoving our work into subsidiary bodies, well, here our position is well known. We completelysupport this idea although we would like to express our solidarity with the statement madeby the Distinguished Colleague from Mexico that we need to have constructive results achievedand in 2018 and 2022 we did not really receive the results that we had hoped for. They didn't meet the expectations of our Delegation and that was what we had expected when we took thedecision to set up the subsidiary bodies and their work in 2018/2022. All the same as was quite rightly stated by our colleague from the Netherlands, the Distinguished Ambassador,in the current context, the work of subsidiary bodies would be the optimum solution for usto be able to start substantive work on specific issues on our agenda. Having said that, wewould like to say that we consider the document as it is adopted if there is political willfor this, not as a technical document but as a document that really does answer the different questions which were recalled by Ambassador Domico. Why are we working and how are we goingto do it? I believe that answering the questions is something that we can do given the lack ofstability and attention in the world and the threats to international security and how fragilethis is. We need to deploy efforts to come up with legally binding documents to develop legallybinding instruments in the disarmament sphere which could then bolster one of the pillars of internationalsecurity and would help us to keep international peace and international and regional security as a whole. We do not consider as was recalled by the Distinguished Ambassador of the UnitedKingdom, Ambassador Lidl, that the proposed amendments from Delegations would just improvethe text. We believe that any amendment put forward by Delegations require careful study,careful discussion and if there are any objections, it should not be included in the text. So it is not just improvingthe wording. So we will work along those lines to try to find the answers to the questions which were raised by theDistinguished Ambassador of Brazil, why, what and how. We carefully listened to the previous statements and we seethat there is a common position that the Conference needs to engage in negotiations and a series of Delegations made specific proposals to start negotiations on a specific Treaty. We supportthis idea. We are prepared to be involved in this work but these Delegations are speaking in favor of the Conference developing a legally binding instrument and starting negotiations on this. We believe that this should be reflected in our decision and this is why we have based our approach on this understanding and yesterday disseminated our proposalsin to your nonpaper. These proposals are substantive in nature but they aim not to improve the text as an ideal text we believe is not one we would be able to agree on. They are submitted for your consideration to have one agreed understanding ofwhat we would be doing and how we would be doing it. So I will read out to you our proposals so that they are officially on the record and I hope that all Delegations have their proposals in front of them because we did ask the Secretariat to disseminate them yesterday and we are grateful to the Secretariat for having reacted in operational terms to this. So we are proposing thatwe make amendments to Parambola Paragraph 4 to delete from it the negative part, negative wording where we note the long standing impasse on the commencement of negotiations on any agenda item in the Conference. We believe that it is clear to all that the Conference is stagnating, that we are in an impasse and it does substantive workand negotiating work has been at an impasse and we know what we need to do to take decisive measures to move forward together to find a way out of this unfortunate position. But our stance is that in rewording this so that however you word it you can't change the bitter truthinto a nice statement. So I think that we don't need to repeat these uncomfortable truths and to say that we have had a long standing many years impasse and we have not been able to start negotiations is not going to be constructive, it is not going to help us to move the Conference forward and to help us to find a way out from the situation. So we would suggest that we take away the negative connotations here, that we deletethis from paragraph 4 of the preamble and we start it with words that will guide us towards seeking a way out of this situation and help the Conference to come up with a positive outcome to help us emerge from this stagnation. So that would be in our wording of preamble paragraph 4, we would sayI shall read in English. And I would like the interpreters to be more specific and precise in my interpretation please so I will speak slowly. Again in our wording of preamble paragraph 4 we would have the following and I'm reading in Englishnow. Recognizing the urgent need to advance the substantive work of the Conference with a prospect to resume negotiation process on any agenda item. It is our view that this formulation, this wording could achieve consensus approvedapproval and over the end of it as proposed by us what we intend to add, what we propose to add with a prospect to resume negotiation process on any agenda item. So we believe that these words meet the concerns raised in this room today and in particular the desire for us to move as soon as possible to direct negotiations on the FMCT.And then our 2nd proposal relates to the operational part of the document or the decision and again we consider that this should be fully acceptable to all Delegations as our premise is that the Conference should not only hold negotiations under our mandate but also focus as a priorityto the greater extent on the development of legally binding documents. But this should not impede in any way the consideration of other effective measures which might facilitate decisions being found to those tasks we have under our mandate that we might encounter in the context of our discussions on specific agendaitems and so we are proposing that we reword operational paragraph 1 and after the words on all agenda items and consider we add in the following wording. I shall read the whole of this paragraph completely so that it is clearly understandable. To establish in accordance with rule 23of its rules of procedure for subsidiary bodies on agenda items 1, 2, 4 and a 5th subsidiary body on agenda items 5, 6 and 7 in order to advance the substantive work on all agenda items and consider legally binding instruments for negotiations and other effective measures in acomprehensive and balanced manner taking into account its mandate in accordance with the final document of SSOD 1. And I would just like to give you some further explanation to our proposal on this operational paragraph on legally binding documents and other effective measures. I have already provided our justificationbut we would also like to strengthen the language of this paragraph and the conference's commitment to its mandate, the mandate agreed upon and enshrined in the final document of SSOD 1 of 1978. We believe that bearing in mind doesn't fullyreflect our commitment to this mandate. Of course, we are not native English speakers but we believe that taking into account is much stronger and more binding stating clearly that we need to work pursuant to the mandate as agreed in 1978. Then our next proposal is on the timetable forthe work of the subsidiary bodies which should reflect the mandate of the subsidiary bodies. We are prepared to agree with the proposal made by you, President, as to the mandate of the subsidiary body 2, though our position is that the issue of the prevention of nuclear war including all related matters is much broaderand should not be restricted purely to official materials production prohibition. We do understand those colleagues have referred to the relevant resolution of the General Assembly and we have understanding for the fact that it is indeed important to settle some of to establish moreor closer contact between the different disarmament bodies which make up the disarmament mechanisms and bodies of the United Nations General Assembly and we do not object to the idea of expressing the mandate of the subsidiary body 2 as you have done so in your nonpaper andas supported by a whole series of Delegations but again, I would like to say that as we are making this exception, if you like, on this topic of the ban on the production of materials and allowing focus on this to focus on starting negotiations on this particular issue, well, thenlet's not be discriminatory and have the same approach to all of the other agenda items and include references to them to other matters as contained in the United Nations General Assembly resolution, e.g. , there is a UNGA resolution which is an annual one submitted by Sri Lanka on preventing the arms race in outer space andin this resolution it is stated that there is a need to develop corresponding legally binding instruments in this sphere and this resolution has existed now for I think more than 40 years and so ignoring it is just not possible here. So we would suggest here that we include in the mandate of the3rd subsidiary body a reference to those matters that in our opinion and in the opinion of many states once again based on the votes on the UN General Assembly resolution are of concern and are really important and sensitive issues for international security and stability. So we are proposing the following wording for subsidiary body 3and I shall read it again in English: 3, prevention of an arms race in outer space with general focus on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, the threat or use of force against other space objects. Moreover, we propose as well that we amend the mandate of subsidiary body 5and make reference in it to an important issue for international security and for regional and national security of all states without exception and that is to the topic of countering acts of chemical and biological terrorism. We understand that for political motivesthis matter has been posed by our political opponents here in the conference. In 2016 the Russian Federation submitted this initiative but all the same we do feel it to be promising. We believe it should not be confrontational and we believe that it could assist us in starting negotiation work in the conference and would help us toclose a loophole and we think it would allow us to make progress and help us to emerge from the stagnation in the conference. We understand that there may be objections to the Russian Federation putting forward its priorities and so on and so forth but I would like to note that our proposal is based on the general position of the international community and theMember States of the United Nations as reflected in resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. In particular, the resolutions on the Conference on Disarmament where mentionis made of a need for the Conference to emerge from the situation it finds itself in and the resolution on preventing the arms race in outer space. I have already mentioned thatand moreover, today we have heard a whole series of statements where mention is made of the need to move forward and to start negotiations and so we propose this that this work be startednot on just one but straight away on several of the items on our agenda. Moreover, our proposal for the parambular part and for the operational part and for the timetable for the bodies, soall of our proposals are based on the fact that for pretty much every agenda item we have awhole series of proposals from states and ideas as to the start of negotiation work on legallybinding instruments. I would recall to you, Distinguished Colleagues, that under agenda item 1, cessationof the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament, a whole series of states over many years have raised the issue of the need to develop a comprehensive convention on the provision of nuclear weapons.This is a clear signal that the conference should start the negotiation process on this matter and Ibelieve that many states would support our idea that we should start to we should agree to introduceminimal amendments to the parambular part and the operational part as we have submitted. Soto indent 2 of 5, we have as we have for body 2 on the FMCT, we have disagreements on scope of such a treaty but we do have agreement that this could be included and you have suggestedyourself that this be included in the mandate of body 2. We have a proposal to develop a treaty on prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, the threat or use of force againstouter space objects and I don't think we need to talk about the fact that this has been forconsideration under the convention for years. Russia and China submitted a new draft in 2014and it had not lost its importance, not lost its value. It is ever more topical today. And we are not against also considering a proposal from the American side that part of such a treaty might be their initiative on the prohibition of tests of some anti-satellite systems. The Russian Federation does understandthe gravity of the threat of assets and so we are prepared to discuss these issues as well. But we are prepared to discuss them only in the context of our proposal on the mandate of subsidiary body 3. So then, turning to subsidiary body 4, we know the group of 21 developing countries have workedto develop a comprehensive convention on NSAs, on negative security assurances for non-nuclear weapon states to ensure their security and they again are seeking a legally binding document. They would be delighted if we could start discussions on this. As I have understood it from discussions in the sessions of the conference over the last five years, notone single state, nuclear weapon state or non-nuclear weapon state has spoken against the started negotiations on this topic. On subsidiary body 5, we have two proposals on developing legally binding instruments. I have already recalled the Russian initiative on developing an international convention to combat acts of chemical and biological terrorism. This year we have a proposal from the American side which also aims to develop a legally binding document. Again, this confirms the fact that the conference should work 1st and foremost on legally binding documents. That should be the priority and to strive towards negotiation processes being started on them. In that way, our conference has a whole series of proposalson developing legally binding documents which would suggest the start of negotiations on these. We do understand the difficulties in achieving a consensus on the start of negotiations on all of these items of our agenda. So we have made a proposal only to the mandates of the subsidiary bodies to include thoseideas, those topics which might lead to a consensus from Delegations. As I conclude, I would like to mention two more points. We are grateful to the Delegation of the United States and its Ambassador for the proposals which were made. Of course, the question of flexibility and continuity within the work of the conference deserves very careful considerationand attention and it could potentially be reflected in the decision which we will reach. In that connection, we would ask our Distinguished Colleagues from the United States to submit in writing their proposals through the Secretariat as we did, as did the Russian Federation. And finally, I would like to agree with the Distinguished Ambassador of Germanya decision on observers clearly did introduce a certain amount of negative impacts within our conference. However, the atmosphere of one-upism which the Distinguished Ambassador of Germany is trying to create within the conference because of the decisiontaken on observers is, of course, poisoning the atmosphere, poisoning the work of the conference and is a genuine obstacle to the adoption of any decision. So I do call not only on my colleague from Germany but also other colleagues who are not satisfied with the decisions that were reached by the conference on the matter of observers to avoid thisvengeful tone and to focus on the and just not pin everything on the back of the Russian Federation because this will do nothing to achieving consensus nor to help us start substantive work nor to ensure cooperation within the Conference of Disarmament between Delegations. Thank you for your attention. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation and may I request all Delegations who have language proposals or may have languageproposals to forward them in writing to either the Presidency or to the Secretariat for onward transmission to all Delegates, to all Delegations. I now give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador of Pakistan. You have the floor, Your Excellency. Mr. President, thank you for convening today's Plenary meeting. Members may recall the views expressed by my Delegation on what would constitute a program of work duringthe Plenary meeting held on 6 February. We had underlined three considerations in this context. First, to fully take into account the contemporary realities of international security landscape in all its dimensions. Second, to pursue genuine multilateralism, that is the notion of security should be responsive to the interests of all states by practicing the principle of undiminished and equal security for all.Third, the continued importance of a balanced and comprehensive program of work as a means and a basis to commence our work and fulfill this body's mandate. Mr. President, we note that the nonpaper proposal before us is not responsive to all of these considerations. When our consultations on program of work began this year, we were informed that there was broadsupport for the 2022 decision in this conference. We were asked to consider, and I quote, \"minimal changes,\" unquote, to the 2022 decision. We cautioned against going down that road as we have been highlighting the delicate balance of compromise unlocked in the 2022 decision. When we look at the circulated draft nonpaper, we cannot help but feel perplexed by the approach taken by the President. This nonpaper is neithercomprehensive nor balanced. It certainly is not the 2022 model for which we have been hearing nothing but broad support in this room in the course of past two weeks. Mr. President, while highlighting time and again that you were not seeking amendments in the timetable of the subsidiary bodies of the 2022 decision, now we have seen that significant language amendments have been introduced in the timetable on a deeply polarizing and controversial issue. Even before the debate on prioritiesof program of work could be concluded in our plenary and while ignoring the priorities of a large majority of the membership of this body. Mr. President, the somber task assigned to the President of the conference as laid out in the rules of procedure involves serving as a Presiding Officer and to draw program of work based on the collective aspirations of this body and to make a determination and facilitate where consensus was likely to be achieved. It is neither an opportunity to propagate national priorities nor anavenue to advance concerns of one group of states. Arms control like diplomacy is the art of the possible. This means recognizing the realities as they are. And it also requires striving towards what can be agreed by all members of the conference as common priorities. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the misguided obsession and the messianic zeal with the FMCT. It is an evidence of how this body is deliberately hamstrung by someunless it only pursues cost-free approaches meant to perpetuate absolute dominance of the few. Make no mistake, the assertion that national priorities are or should constitute CDIP's priorities has not worked in the past. Nor will it in the future. These self-serving assertions have indeed been the principle cause of reinforcing the deadlock in this conference for more than two decades. The top priority of the conference remains crystal clear, that is nuclear disarmament. Bynow, we are well familiar with the ritual attempts by a handful of states to try and portray the so-called FMCT as a magic wand or to fix the contemporary international security challenges. In the most benign form, these attempts are designed to deflect and deliberately undermine prospects of progress at this conference. As my Delegation has underlined clearly, the time for an FMCT that seeks to freeze existing asymmetry in nuclear arsenals andmaterial stocks held by some nuclear weapon states has long passed. The proposition to only ban physical material production while insisting to remain to retain thousands of tons of those stockpiles neither serves the goal of enhancing international or regional security nor does it promote strategic stability at any level. Focusing solely on what has not been produced yet and ignoring thousands of tons of what is already there is simply unrealistic. Let me reiterate, any potential nuclearwar is highly unlikely to be fought with what is going to be produced in the future, but most likely with what is already possessed, stockpiled and deployed in huge numbers. The sophistry that a magical FMCT will cap the number of nuclear weapons globally has also been laid bare by real world developments. Nuclear arsenals of states ostensibly committed to the so-called moratoria on physical material production continue to increase. On ourpart, Mr. President, not only have we elaborated in painstaking detail time and again the implications of the so-called FMCT on our core national security interests, we have also presented a viable formal proposal to pursue work in this area. The reality is that some wish to hide behind ritualistic calls on FMCT to avoid pursuing nuclear disarmament. The five decades old track record of unfulfilled nuclear disarmament obligations speaks for itself. More importantly, we have alsonot heard from these very states how commencing negotiations on nuclear disarmament impacts their fundamental security interests, or for that matter, how formalizing NSAs into a legally binding instrument undermines the core national security interests of these states. To us, then, this deflection in the garb of rightness of an outdated proposal is clearly aimed at keeping this body paralyzed. Mr. President, we fully respect the right of each member to have their preferences and to present them for consideration by theconference. The G21 states have presented their preference, that is, nuclear disarmament and negative security assurances. In addition, we have also highlighted the need to make urgent progress on military applications of artificial intelligence. Then there is the urgent need for commencing negotiations on a legally binding instrument on prevention of placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects on which a handful of states continue to block progress fora number of years. It is perplexing to see how all these issues have been brushed aside while assigning priority to one controversial topic. We have been expecting the NSAs to clearly outline their rationale and any fundamental security concerns tied to opposing pursuit of the priorities of vast majority of the membership of this body. Let us be clear, mere reiteration of unrealistic proposals as a response to genuine queries will simply not cut anymoreIt is disingenuous to say the least to urge others to negotiate their core national security interests while continuing to rehash cost-free measures to ensure absolute security for themselves. Mr. President, we have seen the proposals introduced by the Russian Federation today. We will give them due consideration as many correspond with some of the priorities that we have voiced earlier. Recognizing the differences in priorities, we had highlighted the need to adopt the least commondenominator, that is the 2022 decision which has worked in the recent past. However, the draft nonpaper represents an insurmountable chasm, a bridge too far to cross. The larger point must always remain forefront and it is that proposals designed solely to protect the interests of and dominance by a few at the cost of others are doomed to fail from their inception. The only option is to take on board the genuine concernsof all states and move beyond known dead ends. Some degree of consistency, transparency, genuine multilateralism and demonstration of adherence to the fundamental principle of undiminished security for all by some of these bodies' members may go a long way. We will continue to hope that this indeed happens under your presidency. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Your Excellency, for your remarks. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate fromAustralia. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, President. Thank you very much, President. Let me begin by joining others in thanking you and your team for all your work on the nonpaper which I know has been underpinned by intensive consultations and you certainly have our full support as we collectively try to find a way forward this year on a program of work. I can be brief. Our goal for the CD this year is verysimple, just to make progress where we can. We would like to see subsidiary bodies established at that end and we would like to see that done as expeditiously as possible. Our view is very clear that we should focus on those areas that are most mature and which offer the prospects for making progress. I think this discussion this morning has very clearly highlighted where differences are. Those differences are very well known and highlight the need for us to get into subsidiary bodies and to start working through those in a consideredmethodical way including on the very important issue of an FMCT. We are bringing a very pragmatic approach to looking at a program of work this year and I can certainly echo the colleagues of the Distinguished Ambassador from Brazil for his comments. We are certainly not looking for perfection and on that basis we think the proposal that you have made is a very good one, drawing as it does on previous consensus language andwe would certainly be very happy to proceed on that basis. In the spirit of being interactive, I think we have heard some other good suggestions today, suggestions I don't think go to the very careful balance that is captured in your draft but which nonetheless would add value to the program of work and send some important signals on how we see our work here connecting with the broader architecture and our ambitions for that work. I am referring here to suggestions around language that would includereferences to decisions where they are relevant to our work here and also language that would support the continuity of our work here. So we are very flexible on what they look like and we are very happy to look at proposed drafting but just wanted to signal our in principle support for those inclusions. But, President, we are, of course in your very capable hands in steering us this year to a program of work that might be able to garn a consensus. Thank you. Thank you, madam. Thank youI now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Cuba. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you very much, President. We would like to thank you once again for your hard work and your efforts to make progress during this session. We do hope that as regards the program of work, we will reach a consensus on the basis of a balance between the priorities of Member States. President, thewe would like to reiterate that it is not up to the CD to deliberate. For that, there is the Commission on Disarmament. The CD is meant to negotiate binding instruments in line withthe mandate from SSOD 1. Subsidiary bodies without a clear mandate can become forum for deliberations.However, we have shown the required flexibility in previous years so as to ensure that these bodies could be up and running. In 2022, we joined consensus surrounding the proposal developed by the Delegationof China. We consider that this proposal struck the right balance and represented a minimal basis for consensus. We are pleased that you have drawn inspiration from this and also from the decision219 of the CD. For us, any language should preserve the mention of legally binding instruments as the main task of the CD. Therefore, we do not view with a favorable eye proposals for amendments whichconsider the development of legally binding instruments as an option instead of a priority and which givequalificative and which qualify the work to be done in that respect. Our Delegation is looking at the proposals that have been submitted but we do feel in favor of the amendment proposed by the RussianFederation regarding operational paragraph 1. We believe that this is the path to follow as it givespriority to the main mandate of this body. President, allow us to reaffirm in this context that for Cubaand all of the G21 members, nuclear disarmament is the priority not just for this body but indeed for theentire sphere of disarmament. Therefore, we ask that this collective interest be reflected in thetimetable for the subsidiary bodies, in particular for subsidy body 1. The same should apply for item 4on negative security assurances. This should include a general focus on the urgent need to reach a universal,unconditional and irrevocable legally binding agreement on this as soon as possible. President,Cuba has been consistent in its support for the CD negotiating an instrument on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and this should include both production and stockpiles. As we havesaid in this room and also before the First Committee, this last element that I mentioned is of vital significance. A treaty that would not include stockpiles would be completely insufficient. Wewould only have a selective nonproliferation instrument instead of the disarmament treaty to which we aspire and which we need. That is why we abstained within the First Committee. President, to wrap up,allow me to wish you every success and we once again assure you of our readiness to work with you and with the other members of the conference to agree on a text that garners the necessary consensus. Wehope that you will bear these considerations in mind. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba for her remarks and give the floor to His Excellency, the Ambassador of Italy. You have thefloor, Your Excellency. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like once again to thank you for the consultations that you have conducted and the nonpaper that you brought to the attention of this conference. I wouldlike to echo the comments made by some of the previous speakers, in particular Mexico and the Netherlands. We do not think that subsidiary bodies represent the magic formula that will breakthe CD's deadlock or that will put us back on a negotiating track. We need more than these bodiesfor that. In fact, we should focus more on the many proposals that we discussed already a year ago inMontreal to revitalize the CD. Like others, we were underwhelmed by the outcome of the subsidiary bodiesin 2022. In fact, these bodies took up a lot of time and energy without making much substantive progress.However, we will not stand in the way of establishing those five bodies if this is the will of this conference. In this respect, we are ready to accept your paper as it is. As I understand, it containsconsensual language from 2022 and 2018. We are also ready to go back simply to the 2022 language. I seesome Delegations have introduced some proposals to change your text. However, we do not think thatembarking now on a drafting exercise to try to achieve minimum improvements is worth ourtime and efforts or that it would bring any concrete significant improvements to the actual work of thesefive subsidiary bodies. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Your Excellency, for your remarks. I nowgive the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Canada. You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much,Mr. President. We thank you for your efforts in moving us forward. We recognize the great challenges that you and the CD membership as a whole face, including the difficult international securityenvironment such as the wars going on in Ukraine and the Middle East. We deplore that so many observer Delegations were rejected, particularly states that contribute to paying the bills for the CDthrough the UN budget. That is unfortunately not an issue we can ignore. Like others, we believe that the draft you provided is a good basis for moving forward. The small changes introduced by you havebeen previously agreed and we see them as positive small steps. We believe that our Mexican colleague has raised many valid issues in his intervention and we welcome the proposals made by the United Stateswhich take up also the idea expressed by Mexico about taking into account UN General Assembly decisionsand also addresses continuity and flexibility. The proposed U.S. amendments sound very reasonable to us and we would welcome seeing them in writing for further consideration. Regarding comments aboutneeding to be comprehensive and regarding proposals to add all kinds of additional topics, we understandthe sentiment. But we agree with the Delegation of Pakistan that diplomacy is the art of the possible.We doubt that we will be able to negotiate Treaties and other instruments on every topicthat may fall under each CD agenda item at the same time. Not the least because this was overstretched small Delegations but there is also too little time to do that effectively. Hanging everything on theChristmas tree will likely not bring us to success. Subsidiary bodies will likely need to prioritize some topics but it must be done in a manner that reflects the interests of Member States in a balancedmanner. In our view, instruments on physical materials, negative security assurances or on radiological weapons should be prioritized. But we remain open to discuss this further and to reach aconsensus when this comes up in the subsidiary bodies if they are established. Regarding a Treaty on physical materials, it is Canada's position that the issue of whether to include existing stocks or not shouldbe sorted out at the negotiating table and should not continue to be used as a precondition or obstacle to start negotiations. The best chance to have good faith national interests regarding physical materialsaddressed is through negotiations. We do not believe that Diplomats negotiating a Treaty on physical materials in the basement of the Palais de Nation will undermine anyone's national security. There is ampleroom for States to secure their national interests in the negotiation process and when considering betterto sign or ratify an eventual Treaty. Regarding proposals that we heard from the Russian Federation, weare still considering those. Perhaps as preliminary comments we note, Mr. President, that we support your text in PP4 which recognizes the reality of the impasse in the CD. We do not see a need to put a positivespin on that. But, of course, we will not insist on this issue and remain flexible in the spirit of compromise. As I mentioned, we are still looking at the other proposals put forward by the RussianFederation but as another comment, we would perhaps flag their proposed amendment to include for subsidiary body 3 on Paris. The international community has already decided to put emphasis on Paristhrough the establishment of a GGE and upcoming open ended working groups on this issue. So we should perhaps await the outcome of that work before we start Treaty negotiations or any other negotiationson any other instrument on this issue and perhaps focus the limited resources of the CD on other items at this current time. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Canada for his remarksand give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Iraq. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, President.I would like to start by thanking you for your efforts and for the nonpaper that we are examiningtoday. The programme of work is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end, a means for us to be ableto accomplish our collective work to conduct our multilateral work which should build trust andconfidence between Member States and should also take account of their security interests. We are infavour of any proposal which would bolster the principles of inclusiveness and balance in the workof the CD. We are prepared to take account of UNGA resolutions in particular on the creation ofsubsidiary bodies. We have the priority of having a legally binding instrument to have effective disarmament. It is very important to focus as well on negative security assurances and the issue ofParis. As a Member State, it is our responsibility to seek consensus and I call upon my colleaguesto demonstrate a cooperative spirit to maintain the trust and confidence between us so we can move forward. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela.You have the floor, Madam. Thank you very much, President. On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic ofVenezuela, allow me to express to you our appreciation of all your efforts that you and your team have made in order to organise our work and move forwards. As my Delegation has already said, my Delegation setsgreat store by the work of the Conference as the only multilateral negotiations body on disarmament matters and as a vital part of the disarmament machinery. This body should not just be preservedbut indeed strengthened for the sake of disarmament and nonproliferation. We would like to issue a call for overcoming the state of stagnation. The Conference needs to resume its mandate contained inSSOD 1 by adopting a broad balanced and comprehensive programme of work on the basis of its agenda, taking into account the interests of the security interests of all states and priorities linked todisarmament in accordance with the Conference's rules of procedure. In 2022, under China's presidency,we joined the consensus on the understanding that although it was not a document that satisfied our aspirations, in fact, it was a far cry from satisfying my country's aspirations and concerns, we agreedthat it was an innovative proposal and aimed to be a pragmatic solution. Therefore, we welcome the efforts of the President to continue our work and as regards the nonpaper presented by the presidencyand which was circulated yesterday by the Secretariat which contains a draft decision on the work of the Conference, we have taken due note of it. We are currently studying the text itself and we believethat there is still room for improvement. We, in fact, would like to make the following preliminarycomments. We welcome your proposal and we are aware of the difficult task that the 1st presidency of the Conference is faced with. In this sense, Member States need to be pragmatic without this beinginterpreted or understood as states renouncing their positions of principle. Rather, it is an effort tokick start substantive work. Our country's preference is for the immediate presumption of negotiations on legally binding documents on the substantive topics contained on the Conference's agenda.The Conference has a mandate for negotiations and in light of it, we believe it is importantto adopt a decision that safeguards that negotiations mandate. Otherwise, we couldwould worsen the current gridlock. Therefore, my Delegation supports the amendments proposed by the Distinguished Delegation of the Russian Federation for PP4 and OP1. As regards OP1, we also believethat it is not up to the Conference to suggest measures that are of a nature that is not legally binding. We reiterate that the Conference must negotiate legally binding instruments in accordancewith the mandate that it was endowed with through SSOD1. Moreover, my Delegation has on multiple opportunities said that nuclear disarmament is our utmost priority and the G21 has reiterated that. Wewould like to highlight our firm commitment to nuclear disarmament and we underscore the urgent need to begin negotiations on a gradual program for the full destruction of nuclear weapons including a programthat would include the production, purchasing, transfer and use of and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. We share the concerns expressed by Mexico and Cuba. They have pointed out that the Conference'swork should be done not through extensive deliberations in the subsidiary bodies as there are already other deliberative bodies, especially given that the subsidiary bodies did not yield any concrete results.However, given the current state of polarization within the Conference and the current international security backdrop, we believe that the establishment of subsidiary bodies which match the agenda itemscould contribute to our goal of making steady progress towards finding a way out of the standstill on the understanding that they will enable the Conference to start work. We are convinced, Presidents, thatthere are conditions available for reaching a consensual result that would take into account the concerns expressed today by Member States. Your presidency has the support of all Delegations,not just because of the excellent quality of your diplomacy but also because of your clear will to move forward and come up with a consensus solution. We are certain that this will contributeto our efforts. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela for her remarks and in particular her kind words addressed to the Chair and to other Delegations before that who have done the same. I now give the floor to Her Excellency, the Ambassador of France. You have the floor, YourExcellency. Thank you, President. I recognize all of your efforts to have a program of work which allowsthe CD to make progress in its work which is very important indeed for all of us. I shall not repeatwhat I said on Tuesday. I just wish to take the floor to support your text which is a combination of the2018 and 2022 documents adopted by consensus. So just taking up agreed language. So we support yourproposal as it is. It is the only proposal we see to be viable with the inclusion of mention of the FMCT which is the only topic I would recall which has a mandate adopted by consensus. It is truethat we would like there to be explicit reference to this mandate and that is to decision 1299 and the mandate contained within it as was previously the case with agreed consensual language. However, in aconstructive mindset we do accept the compromise from the 2018 and 2022 texts which represents the onlyviable acceptable proposal in the current situation. We are open to the proposed additions formulated this morning to the preliminary part by the United States of America which allow us to underscore ourcommon commitment to revitalizing the work of the Conference on Disarmament and ensuring it iscontinued with. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegateof the Syrian Arab Republic. You have the floor, sir. Mr. President, we wish to thank you for holdingthis meeting to discuss the program of work for 2024. We equally support the efforts that you have andconducted very early in order to reach a consensus on this program of work. We wish also to thank youfor circulating the nonpaper yesterday which is a good basis for working to develop a decision onthe CD's program of work for 2024. The position of Syria with regards to the CD program of workis based on the negotiating mandate conferred to the Conference by the General Assembly in its outcomedocument of its 1st special session which was dedicated to disarmament in 1978 which considersthe CD as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum on disarmament instruments.For this reason, we consider that a program of work of the CD should include a clear-cut negotiating mandateon a legally binding instrument with regards to the topics included on the agenda of the Conferencewhich has been agreed upon at the beginning of this year. We underscore equally that the priority for usis negotiating rather legally binding instruments on nuclear disarmament and NSAs as well as on preventingchemical and biological acts of terrorism and preventing arms race in outer space. Mr. President,we are fully aware the difficulties that impede the reaching of a program of work that has a clear-cutmandate. However, we are keen to participate along with other Member States in the efforts which aim to revitalize the substantive work of the Conference as was the case back in 2022. For that reason, ourDelegation supports your approach to work on the basis of text decision, CD22/29, on the CD workin 2022 which was agreed upon during the Chinese Presidency of the Conference. It was this that established subsidiary bodies that discussed the CD's agenda items in a balanced, comprehensive manner.After we have evaluated the outcome work of the subsidiary bodies in 2022, we consider that ifthe Conference decides to establish subsidiary bodies to upgrade the substantive work of the CD,we consider that the mandate of these subsidiary bodies should be strengthened in line with the CD's negotiating mandate on legally binding instruments, the aim being to achieve a tangibleprogress and not just be satisfied with a repeat of discussion that were conducted by subsidiary bodies in 2022 without an agreement as to legally binding instruments or commencing negotiation that wouldreach that end. In this light, my Delegation in principle considers that the substantive proposalstabled by the Russian Federation with regards to the President's nonpaper aims exactly to achieve this goal. Therefore, it has to be taken into account in the development of a draft decision on the workof the CD in 2024. Mr. President, we wish that in the remaining time of your Presidency, we wish that Delegations of Member States show the political will necessary to reach a consensus and kick startsubstantive work in the Conference as soon as possible. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of the Syrian Arab Republic for his remarks and give the floor to the Distinguished Delegateof Nigeria. You have the floor, sir. Thank you for giving Nigeria the floor. Once again, my Delegationcommends you on your skillful stewardship of the CD. I will try to be very brief since my Delegation already delivered a statement at the last Plenary reflecting its views on your proposed way forwardregarding the program of work. Mr. President, my Delegation has taken note of the several comments from Member States including the proposals from the Russian Delegation as well as the comments made bythe Distinguished Delegate from Mexico. We would wish to reiterate that in an ideal scenario, we would have preferred a situation where the CD would not apply the same strategy adopted in 2022 and hopeto achieve different results. However, in the spirit of constructive dialogue, we are flexible and willingto compromise in the spirit of true multilateralism and we urge Member States to consider doing the same.In this same spirit, my Delegation supports your proposal but is fully open to strengthening the language and structure of the document. Cognizant that my Delegation has always been favorably disposed to the inclusion and strengthening of a legally binding mandate within the framework of the CD inline with its mandate. My Delegation supports the proposal made by the Russian Delegation for the inclusion of the additional language in OP1 as well as the language proposed for inclusion on subsidiarybodies 3 and 5 which introduces a somewhat clearer path for discussions in those subsidiary bodies.We also fully support Cuba's proposal for the improvement of the language on subsidiary body 4to reflect the inclusion of a legally binding mandate on NSAs. We share the perspective of addressing the loopholes that may exist in the current language with a view to promoting accountability on the pathof Member States. However, we would prefer to retain the original language in PP1 as it truly reflects the realities of the CD. I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Nigeria for his remarksand give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Iran. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor. Let me join my Distinguished Colleagues and thank you on behalf of the IranianDelegation for circulating the nonpaper and the program of work. In our way forward to adopt the program of work, we believe there is a need to base our work on the SSOD1 as a funding document of theCD and taking into account the priorities specified in the mentioned document. Doing so may bring us closer to the possible consensus. Mr. President, it is a fact that the more we get far from the prioritiesstipulated in the SSOD1, the harder we will be able to achieve the consensus to proceed our work in this August body. We think 2022 adopted program of work as a consensual program and outcome of acollective strive has a merit to be considered this year as 2024 draft program of work. It is clear that any new proposed changes and modifications on 2022 program of work will open new issues and requiresmore discussions. CD's agenda items are quite clear and the reason behind adoption of the program of work and establishing subsidiary bodies is to fulfill the mandate embodied in the agenda items. Therefore, wethink any draft program of work needs to follow the CD's mandate reflected in the agenda of the conference.In any case, my Delegation will remain open to engage in constructive consultations on the draft programof work by you, Mr. President and also proposals made by other members. Thank you. Thank you, sir.I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Belarus. You have the floor, sir.Mr. President, 1st of all, my Delegation would like to thank you very sincerely, President, for thehuge amount of work you have done in preparing this meeting and our discussions on the topic of the program of work. We are genuinely grateful. Today several Delegations have spoken about how effectiveour methods of work are with the help of the subsidiary bodies. Subsidiary bodies reflect our conference.As a person who chaired the 5th subsidiary body, I can testify to that. Subsidiary bodies can be as effective as we collectively will let them be. A subsidiary body will do the work and achieve theresults that we collectively will agree to. Our Delegation is convinced that rekindling the work of the CED is directly linked to the realization of its negotiations mandate. If we are intending toestablish five subsidiary bodies, then we need to acknowledge that each subsidiary body has the right or in fact probably the obligation to make a contribution to the negotiations mandate. Todaywe heard a whole range of ideas which make sense and which agree that there is a need to beginnegotiations in order to agree on legally binding instruments. Some topics are more interesting for my Delegation like the negative security assurances, the prevention of an arms race in outer space,combating biological terrorism. There are other topics which are also interesting but of less interest to us and we are not opposed to them. Is it realistic to expect the subsidiary bodies to deliver ontheir negotiations obligations at an equal pace? No, of course not. But nothing prevents them from starting at the same time and nothing prevents the Conference from giving them an impetus so as tohelp them and the Conference continue to fulfill its mandate and achieve the necessary results to the greatest extent possible. That is how we view the situation. Thank you. I thank the DistinguishedDelegate of Belarus and now give the floor to my Distinguished Friend from Egypt. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. It is very clear now the situation, what itis. I am compelled to put on record the position of my country, Egypt, with regard to the proposednonpaper. I would like to start to say let's not make the perfect enemy of the good and let's follow arealistic approach. We all are very understanding or we are very aware of the plethora of factors that guide the discussion or reflect on our discussion dynamics at the moment. I am quite sure that we allcan assess correctly the length of the stretch we can go without breaking the compromise. That's whythe voice of wisdom and practicality and pragmatism and multilateralism all implies that we revert to what can work. This should be the guiding spirit towards our work at this stage and to search for where wecan agree. We all clearly from the record know our positions and all the issues that has been mentioned.But what we care as Egypt at this moment is to get a program of work, two things, to get program of work that should enable our substantive work to proceed and start and to take it forward for the next years asmentioned by the Delegation of the United States, Japan and many several Delegations today that continuity is essential. It is essential to be able to efficiently deliver our mandate, to be ableto accumulatively successfully build on our minimal incremental success. This is the main message I would like to have at this moment. Having said that, Mr. Chair, I will refer now to the statement I wantedat 1st to deliver. As we proceed through the 3rd week of your successful presidency, the Delegation of Egypt believes that our goal is to safeguard the necessary consensus to an early program of work inorder to advance our long-awaited substantive work. While an attempt to take the 2022 program of work a step further is important to retain the Delegate's balance among its structure that availed its adoption.This balance responds efficiently to the need to have a comprehensive and balanced program in full reflection of the SSOD 1 document. This document reflected clearly that the ultimate priority in disarmament is always nuclear disarmament. In this regard, Egypt's priorities are very clearly nucleardisarmament, negative security assurances and prevention of arms race in outer space. Your choice,Mr. President, to base your approach on the 2022 program of work that were adopted by consensus is very wise and indeed is an approach that Egypt fully supports from a realistic perspective. Yetit is essential to remind that the Delegate balance among its elements is very useful. With regardto the nonpaper that were distributed yesterday, I will just share a few remarks on it just to highlight our position. With regard to structure proposed, we still support the subsidiary body approach. We seeit is very useful, very practical at this moment. It allows efficient context to advance our work.The element of balance and comprehensiveness implies an equal balance among the way we treat the different subsidiary bodies when it comes to giving attention to one over the other. I thinkthe part of the success of the 2022 was this constructive ambiguous approach that equally treated each of the subsidiary body on equal footing in attempt to harness the differences that could prevent this consensus from being reached. Having said that, Mr. Chair, the CDE by mandate isa negotiating body. This shouldn't be an element of controversy under all means. We are all herein good faith to negotiate at some point. Well, the point of time maturity when these negotiations can be ready, this is up to us and the political will and how the discussion would evolve. It definitelytakes some time to lay the ground to reach the critical point where the collective interest of the CDE reaches the point of necessary maturity to start on discussions. It takes years of preparation,but we are in good faith and clear view that negotiation is the goal. That's what we are here for. That's why the element of incremental progress is very essential, ensuring a unidirection, forwarddirection that builds on the cumulative work of the CDE is a reflection of its credibility. If we respect the negotiation mandate of the CDE, then we have to find a mechanism that can take stock of the progress and move forward towards the point of negotiation. Otherwise, we will be repeating the exercise of theUnited Nations Disarmament Commission. It will be just deliberative body. I don't think anybody has any interest of that. With regard to the proposed focus regarding the subsidiary body 2, Delegation ofEgypt, while it is not of the view we should give a highlighted particular focus, we understand fully that the focus could be of interest to some Delegations, but having it clearly revealed that way, it couldminimize our possibility to reach consensus. At this stage, I care about more the approach, the consensus to get the program of work done. Our position as Egypt regarding FMCT is very clear. We are not againstthe tool, but our perception may not converge with everyone or some of the voices that has raised. We perceive the FMCT as a tool for both the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. Having said that, weare of the view to include stocks. How to address the question of stocks, the CDE has succeeded beforein two events through the Shannon Report and the mandate that were there within and through the CD1299 and CD1864, we reached that modus operandi that could hardness our differences and give us anopportunity for consideration. We are not against the idea, but we are for a mandate that avails the discussion and takes into consideration the different views. Shannon mandate is very perfectly crafted in this regard. That's why we would have wished if this reference has been made to an FMCT, it alwaysto be coupled by clear linkages to the CD1299 as basis for discussion. This is the minimum rational and fairness we can have. However, we still of the view that the formula of 2022 is the best that we can donow and is the one we support very clearly. On other note, with regard to the proposed amendments by the Russian Delegation, we see rationale in the subsidiary body 3, e.g. . In the General Assembly,Sri Lanka and Egypt alternatively and annually proposes in the draft resolution regarding the prevention of arms release in outer space. It is very clear within it is adopted by consensus in the 1st place and there is a clear reference in the language in the operative part for the role to beplayed by the conference on disarmament in this regard. We see that the proposals for having consideration for the prevention of placement in weapons in outer space, also the ideas being presented inthe prohibition for anti-satellite weapons as been drafted in the draft resolution by the United States are good basis for starting a legal discussion or negotiation mandate in this regard in subsidiarybody 3. These are two elements that could offer a good basis for a way forward in this regard. So if there is to be focus on this, we don't see a problem in supporting the ideas in this regard as presentedby the Russian Delegation. The ideas by my dear sister and friend from Cuba with regard to negative security assurance and having a focus on it in the subsidiary body name is very relevant. We fullysupport that. It is very consistent with the position of Egypt. This is something we definitely called for and we previously have proposed in our 1st draft that we circulated during our presidency lastyear. However, having said that, every single proposal of these will trigger and instigate differentreactions. And I'm considered here by what is possible. We all know the positions and at this stage,we are very keen to move forward substantively. We see the consensus is possible. It is reflected in the sense of all the interventions we have listened carefully during today and our last meeting. Havingsaid that, Mr. Chair, we call on the wise of wisdom if we can be more realistic than idealistic at this stage. Search for the spirit of consensus. Send a very needed signal at this tense moment that CD is stillcapable to work and act to discharge successfully its mandate through a very simple adoption of program of work. I think we need this most at this stage and the only possible way we see to proceed forwardis having the spirit of 2022 in there. Having said that, I apologize for being that long, but I wantedto be honest and alert to the moment. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank my Distinguished Friend from Egyptfor his wise words. I now give the floor to the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. My Delegation would like to commend your effortsand devotion to preparing nonpaper to reach a consensus. This nonpaper is based on 2022 program of work which enjoyed consensus but with new additions. My Delegation in its general statement supported earlyadoption of the program of work which is balanced and comprehensive and underlined that it should be acceptable to all members because we value consensus. While my Delegation acknowledges that the currentpaper is a good basis for consideration, it disagrees the idea of prioritizing specific agenda item overothers and adding new wordings in favor of that as we see in operative paragraph. This would create controversyand prolong our discussion because I can already feel sense of discontent by some Delegations.So if we cannot find solution or compromise on the proposals set forth by several Delegations, we can adopt simplified text of 2022 program of work and get down to business in order to avoid repetition of lastyear's exercise which ended up with failure. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Democratic People's Republic of Korea and give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Kazakhstan.You have the floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your nonpaper containing the draftdecision with possible elements. We consider it very useful and readyto support and as well we have listened carefully all the ideas proposed today orally and on paper as theRussian Federation distributed it yesterday. And we consider them mutually acceptable and therefore we are ready to work with this as well. And since we are here in discussion mode of this nonpaper, we alsohave some ideas to consider commonly together. The 1st , we propose if the proposal of the Delegation of Mexico goes to make a reference to resolutions, we propose to make a reference as well to the reportof the disarmed commission last year. We consider all elements of disarmed machinery that must workinterconnectedly. And the 2nd , to make more focusing and specification of the work of thesubsidiary bodies and we support the ideas of the subsidiary body 2, 3, 4, and the 5, the proposedelements to focus on. And with this, we have an idea to propose to make focusing on the biosecurity andthe strengthening of the BWC with the subsidiary body 5 and we consider the transparency in armament asa good place to discuss these issues as well given the fact that the BWC was developed here within thisfocused body. So it is also the place to discuss, to deliberate the issues of strengthening this convention.I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Kazakhstan for his remarks and give the floor toHis Excellency, the Ambassador of Switzerland. Thank you, President. First and foremost, we wish tothank you for your ongoing efforts to have the CDI adopted decision on the organization of its work this year and for the draft that you circulated to us for our consideration. In our statement duringthe 25th of January plenary session of the conference, we stated that if the conditions could not be found to adopt a program of work, we would be open to the conference placing itself on the previous decisionsof the conference to establish subsidiary bodies to examine all agenda items. So we can support your approach to follow previous decisions even if this is not the optimum solution for us. As the Ambassadorof Italy and the Delegate of Mexico have said, we have not been fully satisfied with the work of thesubsidiary bodies previously. It did not lead to very fruitful results. So we believe that we need to keep to your proposal given the situation we are facing and we need to be realistic. We do not believethat an alternative to your proposal could be envisaged. Otherwise, we would have to hold systematic sessions in plenary for another year and that would not help us move towards negotiations.We have some sympathy for many proposals formulated this morning to amend the draft decision that you circulated, in particular the suggestions made by Mexico to have a link between the work to be undertakenby the subsidiary bodies and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. This would hold several advantages. We would be able to take account of all of the requests of the international communityin defining the work to be done by subsidiary bodies and this would fully be in line with Paragraph 27 of the CD's Rules of Procedure. On the different proposals made this morning, given their contradictorynature, we believe that we need to follow the approach that you decided upon, President, which is to stay as close as possible to the wording of the 2022 decision. Any other approach would be fraughtwith risks and it might complicate the process of adopting a decision in good time. Thank you.Thank you, Your Excellency. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of the Russian Federation.You have the floor, sir. Thank you very much, President. I do apologize for taking the floor a 2ndtime. But I would like to share some thoughts and comments and even make a proposal following thestatements that have been aired today. First of all, regarding the work of the subsidiary bodies, once again I would like to reiterate that we are in favor of creating these structures under the conferencebut at the same time, we do share the doubts and fears and concerns that were expressed by our distinguished colleagues, primarily the colleague from Mexico. At the same time, we stand in fullsolidarity with the statements which referred to the prospects of the work of the subsidiary bodies which were made by our colleague from Belarus. It is simply impossible to put our position onthis topic better than he did. However, I would like to note that the subsidiary bodies are not some structures which act autonomously as of their own accord, free from the influence or impact ofdelegations that are party to the conference on disarmament. That is not the case. Substitute bodies are structures which we create, we, the delegations of the Member States of the conference, and wedetermine the functional capabilities of these bodies to work on results and primarily on the implementation of the conference's mandate. Therefore, the work of these subsidiary bodiesfully depends on our own approaches and our political will on our ability to reach compromises andseek potential solutions for complex issues that lie ahead. The 2nd point I would like to makeis that we are having an idea about the settlement of disagreements and difficulties imposed upon us,difficulties which are well known and which were highlighted during previous discussions on a range of agenda items during the negotiations. We fully support this idea, especially the idea of settlingall issues through negotiations and to not launch a new series of discussions on these issues. That, infact, was an idea from the Russian Federation which we voiced 1st time in 2014 during the discussions that took place at following the introduction by Russia and China of the updated draft Treaty on theprevention of an arms race in outer space and nonuse of force against space objects. However, we believethat this principle is universal in nature and cannot apply only to one of the priorities which is supported by a certain group of states. If the principle is to be applied, then it has to be applied to allpotential legally binding documents that will and to all agenda items that are up for consideration by the conference. So this refers to a potential Treaty on the prohibition of the production of FISR materialsas well as on a Treaty on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and on potential convention onnegative security assurances for nonnuclear states and on the initiative for developing a conventionon combating acts of chemical and biological terrorism and, indeed, it applies to the proposal made by theU.S. on developing an agreement on the prohibition of radiological weapons. So, again, the principle ofsettling problems that we identified during discussions through negotiations is something that we fullysupport. We are slightly concerned by an approach that was mentioned by our colleague from Canadawhereby we should not waste efforts and time on considering the questions of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and the nonfirst placement of weapons in outer space and to not waste and thethreat or use of force against outer space objects. Given that there was a decision by the General Assembly, a series of formats that focus on these topics have been established but we would like torecall that there is the GGE on developing elements of a possible agreement on preventing an arms race inouter space and this is limited in nature. Also, the participation of experts in this group is such that the experts are not representing states' parties. They are acting independently and makingindependent recommendations on this topic. So, the functioning of that format in no way limits norimpedes our work on this same topic within the conference. Furthermore, the agenda we have agreed upon compels us to look at these issues and once again, I would also underscore that thedecisions reached by the General Assembly, namely the resolutions on the group of governmental expertsand on the open ended Working Group with a similar mandate and which will start working after the GGEhas finished its work, these decisions clearly indicate that the work of these bodies will ceaseas soon as negotiations within the CD begin on this topic and this in turn means that we must, we are obliged to work urgently on developing a legally binding instrument on preventing an arms race inouter space through negotiations. So, this imposes upon us additional obligations to carry out that work. Let me be clear on that. If we are to follow the approach that Canada put forward, well, thenwithin the conference, we would have to stop any kind of discussions on the prevention of an arms race in outer space as, again, the General Assembly resolution established the open ended Working Groupon developing rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior in outer space and on preventing an arms race in outer space more generally. We see a clear contradiction in the position stated byCanada. Another point I would like to raise, we are surprised and concerned by the position of thosestates who today during this meeting openly declared that for them any amendments to the document that the President submitted unacceptable. This position is surprising and 1st of all, your document is anonpaper and it is merely a basis for the work which we have begun here today. Moreover, that position ofthose states sends a very dangerous signal and in essence is a veto on any proposal to the text that you have provided. This means that today we have to simply agree to the fact that we are not going todo any work. We are not going to work on the wording. We are not going to try to reflect in this documentthe position that we agreed upon on those three key issues which Ambassador D'Amica set forth. We areopposed to such an approach and see in it an earlier agreed upon position from these states which reflectsthe clear political subtext here and again, these states are through their attitude sabotaging anyattempt within the conference to achieve any kind of compromise on any proposal that could help usnormalize the work of the conference. And the final point I wish to make, in our view,today's consultations despite the disagreement in positions that we have heard, our work today is a step in the right direction. It is clear now that there are a set of proposals that we can examineand which could following discussions and following a search for appropriate wording could be adopted andincluded in the unofficial document that you provided, President. In order to build on this step in theright direction, our Delegation suggests and asks you to prepare for the next meeting a document in which the proposals that states have made would be reflected. This could be done in the form ofalternative paragraphs to those in your document. So far we have not heard that many proposals but all these proposals in our view should be discussed and should be assessed by Delegations. So far as we seeit on the table for discussion, we only have the proposals by the Russian Federation and the proposal from the United States. We are prepared to work on these as we are prepared to work on proposals from other states. To conclude, I would like to say that the Russian Federation is prepared to closely cooperatewith you, President, during the remaining time of your presidency and indeed with all other Delegations in a quest for a compromise solution and in order to achieve consensus on the draft decision on the workof the Conference on Disarmament for this year. Thank you very much. I thank the Delegation of theRussian Federation and my Distinguished Friend for his remarks and for the concrete suggestions on the way forward. I will reflect on them. I now give the floor to the United States of America. You have thefloor, Your Excellency. Thank you, Chair. I will try to be brief. We are in your hands, of course, in terms of how you take this process forward. I am not sure that a detailed drafting exercise is thebest way to try to achieve consensus, but I will defer to your judgment on that. I wanted to say, of course, provide assurances that we would be happy to share our textual suggestions with everyone inthis room. It won't surprise anyone that I disagree with much of what was just said in terms of where different issues stand, in particular when it comes to Paros. There is a reason that there is one GGEand two separate OEWGs and that is because there are two very different visions on how to take this forward and somehow the idea that we are going to agree now on a way forward in the CD and collapsethose two OEWGs strikes me as simply fantastical and not realistic at all if we are going to talk about realism. The one thing I would like to say is there have been a lot of calls today by a number of statesfor work on negative security assurances. Similarly, there have been a lot of calls for work on FMCTunder the kinds of conditions that were outlined by our Egyptian colleague and which allow a great deal of latitude in how the issue is discussed. So these two issues and these two subsidiary bodies seemto be key to a lot of Delegations here and I simply want to assure you that from the perspective of the United States we are we are willing to engage on an issue which is clearly of great importance to anumber of countries here but we would also ask them to be willing to engage on an issue which is of great importance to the United States. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. Does any other Delegationwish to take the floor? Indonesia has sought the floor before we conclude the session today on a matter related to its presidency. Before I give the floor to Indonesia does any other Delegation wishto take the floor? I see none. Let me share with you where I see the situation currently. I will tryto use a metaphor which the English is not my native language but we were taught cricket by our formercolonial masters and one of the sayings when it comes to a player's career is you retire while still atthe top of your averages and so on. After hearing the considerable praise of my meager efforts I feelthat might be the best option for me, retire while everyone is still happy and give up. That is anoption. However, I'm an Indian. I'm condemned to try according to my understanding of how destiny plays out according to my philosophy and I will keep trying until the last day of my presidency.The red lines are clearly evident. That's point number 1. I have about 6 points. Point number 2 is anoverwhelming number of Delegations have indicated flexibility. Point number 3 is that the time forwhether you like, whether individual Delegations like or dislike a text is past. Point number 4 isthat there is a very narrow landing zone which I had sort of demarcated during my consultation process. I think we are on that landing zone. There is an even narrower exit ramp and the question is whether wecan maneuver between the red lines to find that common ground. I thank every Delegation for theirremarks. I will come up with a formulation on the basis of what I have heard today. I will circulatethat formulation. After that, I would like to hear from you whether you would like to take forwardthat formulation or not or whether it is a no-flyer. We will then find out whetherthat sentence or sentence is a sentence too far. Thank you. I thank you for sharing your views. Thank you for your participation in this conference. At this moment, I propose to have another plenary meetingbased on my understanding of what was articulated today by the Delegations on next Tuesday, after whichI essentially hand over the presidency to my very capable colleagues from Indonesia. The Secretariatwill inform you about the next when I propose to have the next meeting, but I remain at your disposaland at your service for any views, for any consultations that you might choose to have. Indonesia, you havethe floor, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. First and foremost, I extend my sincere gratitude to you, Mr. President, for granting my Delegation the opportunity to deliver a short introduction on the concept ofhigh-level panel discussion which Indonesia will oversee during its presidency. It is only for transparency and information purposes. The level discussion will comprise of two sessions with the proposedindicative thematic. First is overcoming stagnation, ensuring the improved and effective functioning of the Conference on Disarmament, and the 2nd is addressing contemporary challenges, the promotion of measures to reduce distrust and build confidence. We propose that each panel will compose of four dignitaries representingmembers of the Conference and the final for each session be nominated from within each of the group in the Conference on Disarmament. I inform that the Secretariat already circulated the concept note. Memberswill have the opportunity to examine and discuss the concept of the high-level discussion during the forthcoming meeting between Indonesia with the regional group. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the DistinguishedDelegate of Indonesia for his remarks. I see no other requests for the floor. Meeting is adjourned.Thank you, Mr. Chairman."}
{"title": "", "text": "the 45th meeting of the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Committee will proceed with Agenda Item 4, Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 18 of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.Today the Committee will consider the combined 4th and 5th periodic reports of Djibouti. I take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to all those who will be online observers onthe webcast during this dialogue, in particular civil society representatives. I would now like to welcome the high level Delegation which is headed by Her Excellency Mrs. Muna Osman-Aden,Minister of Women and the Family of Djibouti who will introduce the report. I also would like to extend a warm welcome to Her Excellency Mrs. Kadra Ahmed Hassan, Ambassador and permanent representative of Djibouti to the United Nations Office and other international organizationsin Geneva. I would like to remind the Delegation that the introductory statement should not exceed 30 minutes. The Delegation is further reminded that in order to allow for full and accurate interpretation of their statements, participants are requested to speak at a reasonable pace.Your Excellency, you have the floor.

And at the back ofthe room, Mr. Osman, from the Ministry of Women's Affairs, legal and technical advisers, Mr. Fusman Awi, within also the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the family. Mr. Gabbar representing thepermanent mission here in Geneva. Madam Chair, this is my team which is still not all here. Other members will arrive. If I could take the floor. Yes, please go ahead, Madam Chair. TheChair. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning once again to you all. Madam Chair, members of the Committee, it's a major honor for me to take the floor this morning to speak on behalf ofmy country, namely the Republic of Djibouti, to present to you the significant achievements in Djibouti in the area of the promotion and protection of rights of women and this pursuant to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the CEDAW.If I may, I would 1st of all like to thank the Committee for its ongoing commitment to promote women's rights worldwide. We pay tribute to the essential role played by the Committeein monitoring the implementation of CEVAW and what it does for the advancement of internationalgender equality standards. I take the floor today to underscore our heartfelt commitment towards the principles enshrined in CEDAW and provide data on progress made, on challenges encountered and measures taken by my country to promote the rights of women. We are awareof the fact that we lag behind in our reporting obligations since 2018. We nevertheless took the initiative of meeting our treaty body reporting obligations, that is for our regional and internationaltreaty obligations. As you know, we have ratified almost all of the promotion protection, human rights promotion protection instruments. We have reported to the following Committees, theConvention on the Rights of the Child ratified in 1990. We have submitted our 4th and 5th combined report to the CRC. We have also in May, we did so in May 2022, the National Covenanton Civil and Political Rights in 2002, we ratified. We have submitted our 1st and 2nd combined reports, the Covenant on Economic, International and Cultural Rights, the CESC. We have submitted our 1st and 7th combined reports, the Convention against Torture in 2011, the Conventionon the, to combat all forms of racial discrimination, the Surgeon 2019, the Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2021. In parallel, Djibouti for the 4th time in November 2023 was involved in the 4th cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council.As far as regional instruments are concerned, the Republic of Djibouti has also reported to almost all of the treaty monitoring bodies, the latest being for the African Charter onthe Rights of the Child in April 2023. I'm delighted to share with you the significant progress made by Djibouti over the period under review, but I'm at the same time very much grievingfor Palestinian women who are seeing their rights or their achievements vanish. They are not allowed to share with the international community the values of freedom and human rights. Today thereare, have been 26,000 deaths and a significant number of injured persons in the region. Palestinian women are living in an open prison and experiencing the throws of wanted colonialism. They are deniedthe right to life or to give life. They are targeted by the machine of death and their children are as well. They think of no other human rights but the right to survival and the hope that they can have a better future. As we speak this morning, focusing on the essential rightsto health education and dignity, our sisters are suffering from lack of water, malnutrition and disastrous health conditions and their basic needs are not met. Peace as a value should sadly will have to wait in this situation, this ludicrous situation. We can only hope that a healthyreaction of the international community can finally enable Palestinian women to recover their freedom and human dignity. This situation has caused our country no longer to celebrate UN world days but to commemorate them in solidarity with this kindred people. Madam Chair, ladiesand gentlemen, members of the Committee, Djibouti is located as you know in the heart of Africa. In addition to the effects of climate change which have never spared Djibouti since it gainedits independence in '77, have taken the form of endemic droughts, irregular and ever closer floods. This country has undergone significant social changes over the last few years despitethe fact that challenges remain. The geographical situation of Djibouti, its sociopolitical stability, its social and cultural proximity in countries are factors which cause Djibouti to be a countryof transit for migrants and refugees. We experience the consequences of regional conflicts and tensions in neighboring countries as such we work closely with international organizations to face thesechallenges whilst respecting the rights of migrants and refugees who burden by their demographic weight and volume of vital needs the development of a population which totals barely a millionpeople. Djibouti hosted in 2023 over 31,000 asylum seekers and refugees which represents around 2.8% of the population of the country. These people, half of whom are women and children come chiefly from neighboring countries, in particular Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and more recentlyYemen. Djibouti also is host to 150,000 undocumented residents in our towns. These challenges as well as others have not prevented my country from making progress towards inclusive and egalitariandevelopment. As far as early childhood development is concerned, my country has laid the basis for an effective system by focusing on three key areas to improve the enabling environment for children, a regulatory framework defining early childhood as being age for children aged0 to 6, the institutionalization of nurseries and kindergartens, a preschool year was including in the our basic education offer within the 2000 Education Act. Now children aged between18 months and 4 years are under the authority of the Ministry of Family and Women and those who are over 4, Ministry of National Education and National Council for Childhood presided by the Prime Minister was created in 2012 to follow and coordinate the development of activitiesfor children's affairs. Djibouti has developed a national platform for childhood thanks to which staff working with children can combine their efforts to protect children against allforms of violence which they might have to face. In terms of education now, Djibouti has made progress in this particular area. Efforts have been made to extend access to primary educationand investments have been made to build schools and to train teachers. School enrollment rates at all levels has increased in Djibouti over the last two decades. There is now parity in particular in primary education and the 1st half of secondary education despite the factthat the number of years children spend in school is low. The school enrollment rates gap betweenboys and girls get worse as you go up in the levels of education. Targeting girls who are dropping out of schools and illiterate women, a national program of literacy for social andprofessional integration for young girls and women was implemented. In addition to learning to read and to write this literacy program which is functional in nature has specific modules devoted to family planning, reproductive health, human rights and the empowerment of women. Ourassessment has shown us that significant progress has been made in Djibouti as a result of which Djibouti is one of the rare countries to have improved learning during the COVID-19 period. These developments attest to the reforms underway designed to improve the education system andconsolidate our efforts to bring literacy to the country which is led chiefly by the nationalunion for Djibouti women. As far as health is concerned, the sector has been improved over the last 20 years. Healthcare services in the area of reproductive health, maternal health,neonatal and childhood health and adolescent nutrition have significantly increased over the last few years in certain regions because healthcare service providers and services providemedicines have become more available and we are more operational. In 2019 our score was 56% on the universal health coverage index because of the aforementioned despite the fact thatimprovements are lagging behind because of the COVID-19 pandemic and also because of climate change, our situation was difficult before those things happened. Adolescent girls aremore likely to die in childbirth or to experience complications. Therefore we felt it was necessary to empower women to improve access to training and provide them basic skills for daily life and to provide reproductive health education in order to delay marriage and pregnancy. Thevaccination programs and programs to combat communicable diseases were implemented. How the vaccination programs and to combat communicable diseases have been implemented as I was sayingbefore despite the fact that we have created in 2017 universal health coverage as well as developing the national social service called the lack of access to basic healthcare servicescan be a challenge in certain areas because of the openness of the areas and the fact that women who go to the services come from social and economic backgrounds which are poor. Wehave developed a mutual community funds structure. These mutual community funds are charities and they work on the basis of solidarity with its members thanks to them the local communitiescan get organized and to lead their own activities in order to reach vulnerable persons and communities and also to bring about economic empowerment social programs. Each mutual fund has a healthfund, a micro credit fund to create income generating activities. Djibouti currently has 82 funds in that is of these mutual funds in the five capitals of the regions as well as 52 independentmicro credit mutual funds and 82 healthcare funds. In terms of poverty reduction Djibouti has implemented the national strategies for social protection and an employment policy which has gone handin hand with operational programs designed to reduce poverty. However, exogenous factors disturbing exogenous factors linked to climate change and migration and neighboring country detention has limited the scope of the measures taken. With regards to employment and its relationshipwith our economy, the government of Djibouti has developed economic development programs in particular in the areas of transport, logistics and port infrastructure. These initiatives havehad a positive impact on employment and economic growth despite the fact that additional efforts are needed to create lasting jobs. There is a close relationship between training and theempowerment of good women and girls. Therefore, we have carried out an assessment of the vocational and entrepreneurial training needs in tune with the workplace thanks to which we have created three kinds of training. Number 1, on the job paid vocational training. Number 2, trainingin entrepreneurship. Number 3, a program to train entrepreneurship trainers under the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the social action center for the empowerment of women under the authorityof my department attests to the empowerment we plan to bring about. 30% of the workforce is female but only 56% of women are employed. In the public sector, more women are employed.In fact, women's share has increased 4.6 times whereas men's representation has increased 3.7 times. Between 2009 and 2013, the proportion of women recruited whilst it has increased,being raised from 25% to 33%. The formal sector represents 33.6% of women especially in trade in domestic work. Fewer than 50% of companies have female senior executives. In the informalsector, women occupy 74.3% of jobs and earn 24% more than men. Women who are vulnerable areemployed in the informal sector. 50.8% of widowers work there, 33.8% of divorced women and 64% of women over 65 work in the informal sector. For the informal sector, women are in chargeof four production units out of five. E-commerce, tourism and artisanal businesses are promising sectors. We encourage women to become entrepreneurs and this is because we believe that they areable to independently manage very small businesses and at the same time, it is an alternative public or private formal employment in which they remain at a disadvantage to bring about the empowerment of women and girls through access to economic resources, to land, to financialservices, to natural resources, to structuring measures have been adopted, the chief of which are the following: Access to modern technologies, helping women to shift from informal work to formal work, the enactment of laws protecting women against discrimination in recruitmentand protecting them against sexual harassment in the workplace and the amendment of maternity leave provisions in the public and private sectors, Madam Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Committee, despite all the achievements I have just listed, Djibouti still faces todayongoing challenges such as vulnerability to climatic shocks, climate to weather shocks, weather events, democratic pressure, efforts has continued in the areas of education, health employment and protection of poverty, are keen to guarantee sustainable social developmentand equitable development in the country. The cross-cutting objective of in order to bring about progress in all of society, we need to bring about gender equality everywhere. Firstof all, our policy and institutional responses, the Djibouti has a long-term development vision called Vision 2030/35, made up of the plans, the 2nd of which covers the period 2020/2024,the plans are the baseline for public policies developed according to a systemic approach.We create mechanisms to respond to common priorities and to build skills in order to mobilize multi-partnership on a local international level to bring about positive behavioral change in the country, to bring about gender equality in the country. In the light of what we have achieved in termsof sustainable development of Djibouti is firmly determined to combat gender equality, inequality and to combat all forms of violence perpetrated against women and girls. The new gender policy2030/23 has strategic guidelines developed to qualitatively transform gender relationships in society, guarantee empowerment of women, combat vulnerability and strength and resilienceby promoting women's skills, promote the voice of women, combat gender-based violence by setting up in public Governments gender equality integration mechanisms. The provisions of legal and political frameworks are consistent with our ongoing commitment to international human rights treaties ratifiedby Djibouti including in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and as far as GBV is concerned, the CEDAW by ratifying CEDAW in 98, Djibouti committed itself to fully respectthe to respect, promote and protect and realize the rights of women nationwide and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against them in particular by providing protection for them against all forms of violence including FGM. Consistency with international instruments canbe found in our legal and policy frameworks which are consistent with the changes in society and the need to respond to the new challenges arising from globalization and the impact ofdigital technologies on children and adolescents but at the same time consistency with international instruments can be found in our constitution which whilst it recognizes Islam as the original state it provides in its 1st article that and I quote the state of Djibouti guarantees to all equality before law without distinction on the basis of language, origin, race, sexor religion. Our constitution respects all beliefs end of quote. The constitution guarantees furthermore equal protection without any distinction between men and women who are women who are have thesame rights to bring their cases to court. These efforts thanks to these achievements women increasingly have access to political and administrative jobs in 2021. We have achieved the we note thatwe have the following in the government: Six ministers out of 24 are women. In 2013 we had seven MPs. In 2018 there were 17. We have seven ministry secretary generals, two in the constitutionalcouncil there are two women out of six members. There are five of the nine members of the national council for communication are women. In the Supreme Court of the seven of the ten members there are seven women. There are 14 women in the appeals court. The programs of action proposedin the context of the consolidation of gender equality and the strengthening of leadership are based on a coalition between institutional and civil society partners based on a close cooperation with the ministry of women's affairs and other women's ministries and civil societyorganizations with whom we have signed performance agreements. These programs use the proposals made from the public and the vision 25 stakeholders. We also find these in what we do to achievethe SDGs. Furthermore, a decree was adopted in August 2021 to organize the gender equalityobservatory as monitoring body, monitoring the principles of gender equality and equity, supporting the national gender policy and also contributing to the enforcement of our regulatory legal text and ensuring that what we do is consistent with our international legal obligations, Madam Chairperson,ladies and gentlemen members of the committee. The 2nd response we provide is to combat gender-based violence. Response to GBV including to combat FGM is effective within the institutions concerned such as the ministry of women's affairs, ministry of health, ministry of social affairs, the ministryof justice together with judicial authorities and the ministry for Islamic affairs as well as the national union for LGBT women to ensure our care services are available. Consider reference were made with the government and civil society with the technical financial support of thewomen agencies. GBV has adopted a legal machinery to respond to violence against women including combating FGMs to make it possible for us to better implement our government policy to facilitate efforts made by civil society and international partners to bring greater equality and equitybetween men and women in the country. We have seen political determination and commitment at the highest levels of the state to ensure that FGM is abandoned as a practice. This washighlighted early on as being part of Djibouti's policy through the regional conference on FGM, female genital mutilation that we organized and hosted in February 2005. The event was sponsoredby the 1st lady of Djibouti. It recognized the key role played by the national union of women of Djibouti to tackle and eradicate this phenomenon. The aforementioned regional conferencereached a common consensus between all religious leaders in the region on the fact that there is a lack of religious basis to these harmful traditional practices. But there continues tobe deeply rooted cultural and religious resistance to change which means that such change to eradicate FGM is taking a long time to bear fruit. 1.8% of women aged between 20 and 24 were marriedor in a relationship before the age of 15. 5.4% were married before the age of 18. 70% of women and girls aged between 15 and 49 have suffered FGM. 7.2% of married women have suffered anact of physical violence from their husband or partner. The causes of this violence that we see which particularly afflicts young women are particularly due to the phenomena of early marriage, arranged marriage, verbal or physical aggression, rejection of the request for polygamyon the part of the husband, failure to respect marital rights, the precarious nature of the relationship and of living standards, illiteracy, nonpayment of alimony, lack of communication and understanding within the couple, lack of financial independence, et cetera. At the nationallevel the response to gender based violence takes the guise of a framework for action highlighting the level of political determination. This framework is also the setting for our service delivery, care delivery and is also the tool we use for grassroots or community mobilization as a wholeto tackle GBV. After the political action strongly backed by the executive and the operationalization of our measures to tackle gender based violence including FGM, steps are taken to mainstream the response to gender based violence in all technical institutions such as the Ministryfor Women and Family, Ministry of Health, Ministry for Justice and all legal officials such as the judicial police, the gendarmerie, lawyers, judges, the Supreme Court, et cetera. The National Union of Beauty and Women provides helpline services. In February 2020 a law providing for protection,prevention and care of women and children and the victims of violence was promulgated. This is a major step forward at the legal level and we very much eagerly await the full impact of that measure to be seen. Cross-cutting institutional achievement and making sure that we mainstreamed our approach in tackling gender based violence including FGM allowed us to be one of the rarecountries to have available a gender based violence information management system, a set of software created to be able to align the collection and mining of data on gender based violence. This use of the GBVIM or gender based violence information management system has allowed us to bettermanage data and to make sure that we have more viable data in place. The GBVIMS platform goes hand in hand with the establishment of a helpline run by the union of women of Djibouti. We wouldalso point to the single window for response to gender based violence including FGM which has been set up in a hospital in the suburb which means that people have less distance to travel to have access to support services. I would like to turn to the issue of creatingmodern and tailored justice system in Djibouti. We have carried out a meaningful project to support and transition our judicial system financed by the European Union. It is intended to strengthen the rule of law and access to human rights in Djibouti. Whilst it was being designed, itwas part of a broader national strategy by the government of Djibouti, the vision Djibouti 2035, one of which recommendation was to modernize and overhaul the judicial system. One of thegoals of the transition of the judicial system is to strengthen justice and human rights. We pin a great deal of hope on the positive outcome of this project. It focuses on analyzing legalreforms that are necessary to ensure alignment with our legislation and international standards and seeks to improve access to justice for all through, e.g. , the organization of circuit or mobile justice sessions so that justice can be delivered in rural areas where thereare no courts. It also supports efforts to ensure that the people of Djibouti have more information about their rights and how they should be upheld and protected. There have been several pieces of legislation also promulgated in the field of justice and improving justice delivery, particularly related generally over the last few years, e.g. , the law on the civil code and thecreation of the leadership and entrepreneurship center in 2018. We have also partially modified the labor code, particularly its articles relating to regulation of the work of women and children as well as the law on social economy, on maternity leave and on protection and care of women and children and victims of violence. We have amended the law on the national strategy for personswith disabilities which seeks to strengthen the opportunities available to women with disabilities and to support opportunities for them to enter the market or pursue entrepreneurial activities. This is all part of an approach that is based on consensus, input, dialogue, et cetera. Weare also intending to in a near future promulgate additional text arising from the recommendations from the national gender policy and the national GBV response strategy. We are pursuing awareness raising activities. We are doing so unceasingly. We are developing communication strategies with direct contact at the grassroots level or via the media. That's been particularly true overthe last decade where we have made more use of digital means to raise awareness about rights and how they can be protected. We use international days of commemoration for gender and for women to raise awareness amongst the population about recent challenges when it comes to gender equality. We determine to overcome the challenges that still remain and we actively cooperate with otherstates and international organizations to share and learn from best practices to base our capacity and to work together to achieve the goals of the CEDAW. Chair, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Committee, with this new opportunity to discuss the country report of Djibouti I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to continuously improve the statusand plight of women in my country under determination to identify new goals to make sure that we align ourselves with future evolutions in terms of gender equality. I would like to reaffirm our determination to work in close cooperation with the CEDAW Committee to promote gender equality to eliminate discrimination against women and to forge a future where all individuals irrespectiveof their journey can realize their full potential. Thank you very much for your kind attention. We stand ready to respond to your questions and to cooperate and work closely together with the CEDAW Committee so that jointly we can see progress in our joint cause of gender equality.Thank you very much. I thank the head of Delegation for her introductory statement. As you are aware, the procedure for the Committee for the consideration of periodic reports is for questions to be posedby a number of experts following which the Delegation will be given an opportunity to respond to those questions. Following that, another group of experts will be given an opportunity to pose questions and the Delegation is again given the floor to respond. The experts' questionswill be asked largely following the order of the Articles of the Convention. This procedure is followed throughout the two meetings of today. I would like to remind the Delegation that the Committee will aim to complete its consideration of the implementation of the Conventionby GBT by 5:00 p.m. today. The dialogue will be webcast live on UN Web TV. I wish to draw the Delegation's attention to the need for careful time management and I encourage the Delegationto provide precise, short and direct responses to experts' questions as well as to indicate when a response cannot be provided. In that case, your Delegation should take note of the questions that cannot be answered immediately and you may request to submit the pending informationin writing within 24 hours, one working day from the end of the constructive dialogue, that is by Friday, 9 February at 5:00 p.m. Geneva time. In order to enable an interactive dialogue,the submission of additional information in writing should be the exception rather than the rule.If the Delegation submits additional information in writing within 24 hours, such information should not exceed 1500 words and should be timely, concise and answer the concrete questions posedby experts. Please also note that such information will also be published on the CEDAW website for the 87th session as it forms part of the public dialogue. Lack of or inadequate repliesto questions raised by the Committee may result in follow-up questions and eventually may be reflected in the concluding observations of the Committee. I should also like to indicate that if necessary, the Delegation may be asked to limit its responses should this become necessarydue to the time considerations. I will now call upon the experts who wish to pose questionsunder the various articles of the Convention. Experts are also reminded to respect the time limits for questions. Where questions are not sufficiently answered, experts will be given an opportunity to ask follow-up questions for 2 min . We will start now with questionsrelating to Articles 1 and 2 of Part 1 of the Convention. I would 1st like to give the floor to Mrs. Estere Gobamyem, the country reporter for Djibouti, for an introduction of3 min and after her, to Mrs. Hiroko Akizuki for 5 min on Articles 1 and 2.Please, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. My sincere welcome to Her Excellency, Madam Usmana Usman-Aden and the High Level Delegation of Djibouti for being here. The Committeecommends the numerous efforts which you have listed to address gaps and barriers to fulfilling its obligations evident in achievements that have been made since our last meeting as you highlighted. The political gains and extensive legislative and judicial reforms are applaudable.However, implementation and alignment with CEDAW principles and standards remain unclear and fullguarantees of rights protection for women in Djibouti and for the girls remain weak. The Family Code, Land Compensation Act, labor laws, migration and asylum policies are examples of weak frameworks.Diverse women groups, especially the poor, vulnerable, displaced and those with disabilities, vulnerable, displaced and those with disabilities often lack social protection and enforcement mechanisms to guarantee access to protection and restitution seems unavailable. Alternate sources claim thatthe existence of military bases are directly linked to socioeconomic challenges and rights violations faced by women and girls. Was any environmental and social impact assessment commissioned on the potential impact of hosting military bases or the testing of armed drones and remotewarfare equipment? What were the key findings of the ESIA and how regularly are they reviewed? Was any resettlement or livelihood restoration action plan developed in consultation with stakeholders and are women groups engaged around military rent renewal? What percentage of military-basedrevenue is allocated to management of rights violation, alternate livelihoods and skills training in AI, robotics and other tech capabilities to equip women and girls for the new digital economy and future jobs? Furthermore, military operations have reportedly turned the stateparty into a violence against women hub and hotspot for trafficking, migration, exploitation, forced marriage and this calls for urgent and sustained action. The state party's failure to unleashwomen's potential compromises legal reforms and government ideals of achieving inclusive growth through the national shared prosperity strategy, ICI 2020 to 2024. Nonetheless, we look forward to a fruitful exchange on progress achieved and innovative measures for improving accessto justice and socioeconomic opportunities for women in all spheres of life in order to acceleratetransformative change in Djibouti. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Chair. I too warmlywelcome the high level Delegation from Djibouti. I now address the Article 1 and 2. First regarding the definition of discrimination, the Committee congratulates the state party has achieved significantprogress toward the effective enjoyment and exercise of women's human rights by adopting laws and policies. The Committee also notes that the constitution of the state party stipulate that the state party shall ensure the equality of all students before the law without discriminationas to origin, race, sex or religion. However, the Committee is concerned that it is not quite clear whether the definition of discrimination in law encompassed both direct and indirectdiscrimination against women. So my questions are what are the plans to encompass not only direct but also indirect discrimination against women in the definition of discrimination inlaw? What measures has been taken to strengthen domestic mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing the convention and thus ensure the state party's accountability to female rights holders? Whatmeasures has been taken to eliminate discrimination against women by private persons, enterprises and other non-state actors? Secondly, regarding discriminatory laws and practices, the Committeeis concerned about the persistence of discriminatory provisions in the family code and other national laws and about the conflict between statutory law and customary law which is mainly anchoredon Sharia that is largely discriminatory against women. So what measures has been taken to harmonize discriminatory provisions that seem tantamount to having reservation to Article 15 and 16 instatutory, customary and religious laws and norms to CEDO Convention? There are gaps in the legal framework and its implementation. How does the state party strengthen implementationof the legislation? Thirdly, regarding visibility and domestication of the CEDO Convention, the Committee is concerned the lack of information on the visibility and practical application ofCEDO principles within the state party's legal and policy framework. The Committee is also concerned the limited information regarding incorporation of CEDO provisions in judicial rulings or exemplarycases where the court have enforced these provisions. Even if domestic law prohibits discrimination, if domestic law does not encompass indirect discrimination, applying domestic law alone will not protectwomen from indirect discrimination. This is why the need to apply a Convention in domestic court arises. So my questions are please provide information on how many cases has CEDO Convention been addressed in thedomestic litigation? What kind of awareness raising training has been conducted to judges, prosecutors, lawyers and law enforcement offices on the CEDO Convention and its jurisprudence? Fourthly, regarding accessto justice, the Committee is concerned that the extent to which women are empowered to report cases of discrimination to relevant authorities is unspecified and whether reported cases are duly acknowledged andactioned. So questions are what kind of programs has been conducted to raise awareness on women's rights and the human rights mechanisms? What measures are in place to address physical and economic barriers to accessjustice for women? What endeavor has been taken to translate the Convention in AFA and Somali and makeit accessible to a wider audience? How is the State Party currently monitoring the situation of women's rights and what mechanisms are in place to hold perpetrators of violence and discrimination against women accountable? Lastly, but not least, arethere any discussion ongoing regarding the ratification of the optional protocol to the CEDO Convention establishing a complaint and inquirymechanisms? I thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. I will now give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the questions. Members of the Delegation should introducethemselves as they respond to the questions. Microphone, please, for the head of Delegation. Chair, I will provide a few introductory remarks and then allow my colleagues to flesh out what I have to say.First, I would like to thank both members of the Committee for their questions. I will provide a more holistic overall report. As we indicated in our report, we tried to detail some of the changes, modifications and new pieces of legislation that we have implemented in duty as well as to share with you details about some of the programmes that have been rolled out at the institutional level, including those developed by the Ministry for Women and Families as well as other ministries and institutions that we work in close cooperation with who have their own specific gender equality programmes.And policies. As I said in my opening statement, we are fully aware of the fact that there are many challenges that still need to be met and overcome, particularly when it comes to access to justice, when it comes to the broader question of women's protection. Legally speaking, all the necessary provisions are there in place in the legislation but, of course, there is a gap between the theory and the practice and that's what we need to plug through the Herculean efforts we need to pursue. As far as efforts go, we are aware that these are efforts that need to be pursued firstly at the domestic level,i.e., fine-tuning or introducing new provisions and making sure that they are backed by the necessary budget allocations to support our programmes. We are also aware that we need to pursue awareness raising activities to change attitudes, stereotypes, et cetera. Once programmes have been drawn up and adopted, grassroots awareness raising campaigns are indeed launched and carried out in order to raise awareness and to try and change attitudes and stereotypes. The family code which I referred to was adopted in 2002. In 2024, a review of the family code should beadopted with changes to certain articles of the previous family code, particularly those articles related to protection against domestic violence and ensuring equality in marriage or relationship in order to ensure that women have access and full equal ownership with assets such that they have tools to report instances of violence as well. Changes in society mean that we need to change the family code so that it is closer aligned with social needs as they are expressed today. You asked a question about the military basisand the impact that these military bases have. These military bases are a key plank of support for Djibouti in all our endeavors for peace and security and women are at the heart of these peace and security initiatives and activities in Djibouti for which these military bases are an important of which these military bases are an important element. This is in strict compliance with Security Council Resolution 13/25. The military bases irrespective of whether it be American or French work very closely with the Djiboutigovernment for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 13/25 on women, peace and security. They also finance the implementation of the women, peace and security agenda in Djibouti. So we see the military bases as wholly positive. They act as key partners and we enjoy close collaboration and cooperation with them in endeavors such as women, peace and security. You talked about an environmental and social impact assessment of the presence of the aforementioned military bases. The bases have been in Djibouti for a long time now. They are part of oursecurity and economic and development doctrine. We see them as a partner. It's a support for our own national policy, particularly when it comes to defense. We work very closely with the military bases for our security needs but we also work very closely with them on social issues as well because we see that they have a role to play in supporting Djibouti and social development in all of our training and support activities whether that be in terms of women's rights or working closely with young people, e.g. . The bases as key partners work with us in the development and rollout of our national strategies addressingthe different sectors of the population. They make a major contribution to livelihood, to people being able to gain a living which feeds they also make a major contribution to medical insurance, to social protection measures, et cetera. We are aware this is the responsibility of the state but this international support, this international financing supports local government domestic financing as well and our endeavors when it comes to protection, health, social protection and the healthcare system at large. Now on this separate issue there are support programs in placewhether these be financial in nature or the provision of training, practical, pragmatic, in kind support, et cetera. All of this is provided through the systems which have been set up by the Djiboutian government. This includes micro credit and micro finance tools made available for women entrepreneurs and also for small and medium enterprises, SMEs although we do also make financing and credit available to larger enterprises, larger businesses as well including guarantee funds and support fundsparticularly for those businesses which may be larger in nature but where women are a key part of the leadership. So there are financial provisions that have been implemented by the government of Djibouti principally financed by us ourselves. We are not overly reliant on international finance or finance from the basis. Principally the funds are drawn from our own means. I will ask my colleagues to explain the difference between the statutory and customary law, religious and civil codes but justto say that the law in Djibouti allows each individual to choose freely for him or herself how they wish a case to be heard. We are an Islamic country, that is indeed true but the constitution provides for full freedom. There is no discrimination when it comes to belief, religion, sex or gender, et cetera. Sharia and civil code are both texts and legal systems that are available and as I say the population may choose freely underwhich system they wish a case to be heard. They both dovetail alongside each other. I will stop there. Perhaps we give the floor to Mr. Abdul-Kar 1st and then perhaps if I may to Ms. Fada to flesh out what I just said if you will indulge me, Chair. Thank you very much. My name is Maki Omar Abdul-Kar. By background I am a lawyer and I am the secretary general of the ministry for justice. I work very closely with the interministerial committee onreporting to the treaty bodies. I have familiarity with this process. Very quickly in response to the questions asked just to provide one point of clarification, I heard a reference to customary and Sharia law as if they were two different things, a reference made to customary and Sharia law when it came to their jurisdiction over personal status issues. To make it clear since 2002 there has been no Sharia law in Djibouti. Rather we have a modernizedupdated text which mirrors the Tunisian personal status code, e.g. . We drew that on that partially as our inspiration. That brings together a cluster of provisions which at their origin may have been inspired by Sharia law but it is a modern updated text, not Sharia law. One piece of information that I do want to share with you building on what the minister already had to say is that currently work is underway to review the personal statuscode and there is some in-depth work ongoing in to those provisions of the personal status code which in today's world appear discriminatory against women. We need to call a spade a spade. They are discriminatory against women. The work has been ongoing for several months now and it is our hope that at the end of the 1st half of this year a draft revised text on the personal status code will be available and submitted to the government for further review and discussion. A question was askedabout a mechanism, the reporting or complaints mechanism in Djibouti so that the relevant authorities can be advised of cases in which the victims are women. Yes. In addition to the institutions and structures, the provisions, the fact that reporting can be pursued through the channels such as police law enforcement offices, et cetera, and there are police stations in all cities and towns in Djibouti alongside those traditional complaint reporting structures we also have the prosecutor general or attorney general's officeand he has several subunits or suboffices in all large and medium sized cities. In each of these large and medium sized cities there is a local prosecutor, local attorney general with eight deputies and they are also a reporting and complaint channel. They also have oversight over the judicial police units across the country in particular in the city of Djibouti where the majority of the Djiboutian population live. They are in the capital. So we have a beefed up presence in the capital.And so they are in the front line for receiving complaints and reports either directly to these attorney generals or the subattorney generals' offices or via the police. We have that traditional reporting and complaint structure in place alongside that structure, the police law enforcement offices, attorney generals' offices or suboffices, et cetera. We have two additional tools, e.g. , a 2009 law on female genital mutilation, the FGM and that law provides a possibility onoption for associations not just to denounce or report female genital mutilation but also to constitute civil party to civil proceedings of FGM cases or cases of violence against women but principally female genital mutilation which is a form of violence against women. We also set up a platform for the protection of childhood affairs, a platform for protection of rights of women which are structures whichhave that authority to refer abuse. We believe that we must constantly give greater power to authorities to receive referrals on the number of cases you asked us, Madam, namely when CEDAW was invoked in national courts. The constitution makes international conventions prevail over nationaltexts which means that anyone can invoke directly international conventions in national courts. They do not do so, however, why? Well, that needsto be established. We do not know yet. This being said, lawyers, lawyers do invoke the provisions of international conventions in national courts but it is for significantcases, commercial cases, other cases, but big cases. So perhaps training of judicialofficials would be advisable. The national school for the training of magistrates in all likelihood will contribute to improving the practice of legal practitioners so thatone day they do invoke the international conventions and those who are in charge of handing down decisions will accept them. So on the existence of persistent discriminatory practices, I'veaddressed that briefly, but if I could add to what the ministers just said, as well as my colleague, or perhaps I could turn to Ms. Schaud with your permission, head of Delegation andChair, I would like to thank the Committee for giving us this opportunity to report toyou, Ms. Schaud Hussain is my name and I am the legal adviser to the Office of the Presidency and I'm the Vice Chair of the Interministerial Committee for the drafting of reports. I havebeen since 2008 and I was involved in the drafting of this report. So once again, thank you forthe diligence with which you have approached this procedure and how carefully you have read our report and our responses. We are available in your hands to candidly answer your questionsand also especially to diligently answer and comprehensively answer your questions. Turningto questions, the right to property, the question was can Djibouti women have access to propertyor ownership? Article 1 of the Constitution provides that there is equality before the lawwithout any distinction on the basis of language origin, race, gender or religion. Article 1 respects gender equality. So in Djibouti there are legal texts developed on the basis of theConstitution which means that every time a legislative text is developed or a regular text is enacted, it is done so on the basis of that key provision of the Constitution which spells out clearlythat no sector of society can be sidelined, be they people with disabilities, women, people of a different faith or minority faith. The public in Djibouti must be entitled to property orownership, be it real estate or any other form of property or ownership. There is no discrimination against Djibouti women. No study is being carried out to date to analyze the situation but weknow perfectly well and we are convinced that when they have the means, Djibouti women do purchase property. There are a significant number of social programs that have been developedwith women to enable them to purchase real estate, e.g. . We have a corporation calledCF, the CF which is a real estate company, the largest in Djibouti, created in 1977 atthe head of whom today there is a woman and they build social housing. So there are no obstacles put in the way of women acquiring property or real estate. Perhaps a woman might be preventedfrom purchasing real estate because of means but definitely not, she will not be prevented from doing so by Djibouti laws. Moving on now to the potential of women which might be hamperedby the private sector. Today we have launched a survey to understand the impact that maternity leave might have. It was increased from three months to six months, this maternity leave.We have had some kind of feedback from women who believe that potentially they had been discriminatedagainst because they were they promotion for them had been blocked because maternity leave had been increased from three to six months. Now the Ministry of Women's Affairs is lookingat this. We are intending to involve the private sector to understand the situation. Now the law clearly says that there must be a minimum quota of women in corporations, be they publicor private in Djibouti. Nevertheless, the government has always encouraged the recruitment of women and women have always been real partners in the economic development of our country. Nowthe minister responded to the issue on a military basis. I myself as the main legal adviser working on the reporting to treaty reporting on the treaty bodies signed between our country andforeign powers on military basis, the concern of the government is always to respect the environment. The public in Djibouti is spread as follows. There are 100,000 people in Djibouti, the capitaland then there are nomads scattered throughout the rest of the territory who travel from one place to another depending on the weather conditions. So we in each and every one of the treatieswe have ratified with military basis provisions to respect the environment, provisions to respectthis shifting of populations from one area to the other. So efforts are made for us to supportthese groups, nomadic groups every time we negotiate an agreement with military basis. Military basis and personnel station there on have to respect agreed military texts designed to protect theenvironment and the well-being of our nomadic populations. So I can reassure the committee member who asked that question that the government is vigilant and always influential in thoseagreements. If I may, I would like to venture another answer at this stage on the transpositionof CEDAW into domestic law. Perhaps the minister will give you the main parts of the family codethat is going to be reviewed but we have a national committee that has been working on this for two years. The government is keen to ensure current provisions that are not in tune withinternational treaties are domesticated or are harmonized with our international obligations. So I won't say anything more about that. The minister will add to that information throughappropriate answers. Thank you very much for your attention at this stage. Thank you verymuch for the answers of the Delegation. I would like to ask now the experts if they have follow-upquestions. Yes, Mr. Greg Obamian for 2 min , please. I really want to appreciate the Delegation for the extensive remarks that they have given and the assurance on the vigilance of the StateParty, particularly with regards to military bases. I appreciate that certain groups are taking care of. I don't know what population of those nomads are women. But I think the questionthat I asked was the percentage of the revenue that was allocated for managing rights violation. I know you have talked about taking care of their movements but what services are protected? Healthcare, livelihood, alternate training, digital training. Is that incorporated in the agreementso that we are assured that the consequences of the operations of those military bases and the testing of those equipments, the impact that they have on the livelihoods of women and on the risks that they are exposed to including social risks that all of those are properlymanaged. I also want to commend you for the efforts that you mentioned about your new gender policy. We will talk about that very shortly. But I believe that the training and the servicesthat are provided, I would really want to have more specific response on that including the involvement of women in the negotiation or review of the rent agreement because you mentioned that impact assessment was taken. It is dated. It is old. Is there a new one? How regularlyis it updated? And when the rent is due for renewal, are women consulted? Thank you very much. Ms. Akizuki, 2 min for follow-up. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I don't havereally questions but several comments. First, I appreciate your detailed answers. And 2nd , I apologize that my misunderstanding with regard to that. I'm very sorry for that. And thirdly,I understand that your legal setting is very good. But I would like to remind you that the purpose of the convention, the convention is not to protect, to obtain the legal equalitybut more we would like to, you know, focus on the de facto substantive equality between men and women. So even if the legal setting is good, implementation matters and also the tacklingwith the awareness building or challenging stereotypes, by the way, stereotypes we will discuss later under Article 5. So you don't need, I don't need any answers but as you rightly said, the awarenessraising or training for the people is most important. That's my comment. Thank you very much for your answers. Thank you very much. I would like now to give the floor to the Delegation for concrete and conciseanswers to the questions. Yes, please. You have the floor. Thank you very much. Much appreciated.The Commissioner said that she didn't necessarily expect answers immediately. Nevertheless, 1st of all, I would like to thank you for what you have just raised and the clarifications you have just made. It is important also for you to know that the government and its representatives would just say, listen, we have set up the ideal provisions in place and then it is up to everyone else to find out about them and use them. That's notenough under the CEDAW which is why we work closely with, 1st of all, civil society generally speaking. We involve civil society in this work, this work to prepare, draft reports for treaty bodies. It is also the chance for them to understand the government's responsibility so that civil society can then claim their rights and demandto be further involved. This is what underpins our endeavors in Djibouti. We have organized workshops to raise awareness for all stakeholders in society, so to speak, raise their awareness of recommendations and then you have the UPR, the latest of which was November. We are not yet– we haven't yet accepted the recommendations or noted the recommendations stemming from the UPR but we will be looking to our partners to identify those recommendations we can accept, those recommendations we can merely note. We need the grassroots to tell us which is why our intention is to involve as best we can the general public and civil society which is what we tend to call the– don't we? Civil society. So involve them in what we do for implementation and what we do to ensure that we as a country respect our international commitments and the provisions of CEDAW more specifically. Thank you. Yes, concerning – thank you very much. Concerning the 1st question about the percentage of Mississauga, about the percentage from the military basis, we will give answer now, initial answer. Thank you. Thank you.On this issue of military basis, we would like to avail ourselves of that option you told us about, namely, to send you an answer within 24 hours, if we could. Thank you. So you will provide the answer in writing according to the rules. If I don't see additional questions, so we will now move to questions relating to Articles 3 and 4, Part 1 of the Convention,I would like to give the floor initially for 4 min for Article 3 to Miss O'Gobamian and also for Article 4 for 4 min to Madame Ameline. Please you have the floor. Thank you very much again, Madame Chair. Paragraph 23 of the State Party Report indicates the availability of a framework to guide implementation of the national gender policy. Also, gender focal points have been placed withand ministries in each sector to integrate gender into the process of policy formulation, programs and projects delivery. It is uncertain whether the national women's machinery has the oversight responsibility authority and adequate resourcing and budget allocationto ensure accountability and provision of gender friendly services in public and private sector. Kindly elaborate on the national gender machinery capacity to deliver gender results indicating staffing levels, percentage budget allocation within the national budget and thereach of programs both national and at grassroots levels indicating if there are criteria and professional guidelines for the placement of gender focal points within ministries. Second, the relationship between the national women's machinery, the directorate for women and thefamily in the office of the president and the national human rights commission and, of course, the ministry of economy and finance clarifying whether gender targets are embedded in the Djibouti macroeconomic framework and national strategic priorities. The 3rd is number ofCEDAW linked cases that have been handled by the gender observatory and besides the national gender policy additional policy measures, governance tools and architecture that is available toassist the machinery and all its entities to deliver their oversight functions and to develop standard operating procedures, establish accountability and monetary systems for effective mainstreamingof gender. Also please provide information on whether an impact assessment has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of results and if there are any records on thesubstantive impact of the national gender policy, the one that just ended in 2021 and how the new policy will consolidate on the gains. The availability of disaggregated data and performancemeasures for tracking progress on sectoral gender mainstreaming. Finally, are there any statistics on the number of gender based violence cases handled by the machinery and protocols thatare guiding gender based management, GBV management, indicating if the GBV multisectoral teams are sufficiently trained to deliver effective mainstreaming and ensure compliance with legal and policyprovisions to better fulfill CEDAW obligations. Thank you. Much appreciated, Madam Chair. MadamMinister, it is a real pleasure to host you here in Geneva. I am very much pleased that we are having this dialogue occurring at a time where your country is changing very much and you have posted positiveachievements. So we congratulate you for them. This being said, following up from what has been said about Article 3, I have one word in my mind which is acceleration or speeding up. What you do should be tailored to achieving that which is very much in tune with our general recommendation which is to speedup the implementation of legislative measures and more generally speaking to speed up the implementation of the provisions of the CEDAW. We had when we last saw you here and joined you to focus everything youdid on implementation of sorry, enforcement of the provisions of CEDAW. Despite your efforts which are notable, nevertheless, the rights of women are not sufficiently consolidated in Djibouti, sufficientlysolid to resist the crises, climate crises, migration crises or the digital transformation crisis which is affecting you very much as we are aware. Perhaps to refer to a number of areas wherein you need tospeed up once again, perhaps 1st of all with the updating of the Women, Peace and Security Programme. What you are doing in the world is remarkable, what you are doing on peace, that is. And the plan adoptedin 2017, I believe, could be updated, wisely updated to ensure that your structuring welcoming of naval basesis such that you give a role to women, give peace to women, security to women. That's the purpose of that plan after all. But also given that you have a number of regions of conflicts in your regions,giving rise to displaced female IDPs, this should be reflected in your plan. Of course, we have UNGA Resolution 13/25 which says that women must be the protagonists in peace negotiations and when youstarted this meeting, you referred to regional conflicts. We are looking to you to ensure that women have their protagonistic role in peace negotiations. The 2nd major area is this.Would you not consider in partnership with global agencies to create a special mechanism to enforce the concluding observations that we see or will be drafting in order so that you can once again focus everything you do on what is most important and to ensure that in just a few years you cover all thepriorities which have been identified for you to remedy? Third area, you should be acted in. You are very active as far as SDGs are concerned. It would be very good for you and advisable for you to crossmatch systems to ensure that the rights of women and their economic empowerment is dovetailed withyour SDGs' endeavors. I would advise you to come up with a digital grid or table to bring the twotogether. And to conclude, I'm concluding. I just have a few seconds left looking at the clock. Turning to the challenges you pointed to, digital education challenges, general education challenges, challengesin your political system, once again, you are not using women enough. And you absolutely must be an example. Quota worldwide have shown that they were effective. You need including in your rural areasto guarantee female political representation. Once again, special temporary measures enable that representation to be sped up. This is our recommendation. These are often measures that aretotally justified despite the fact that they temporary changed the law to help you to bridge, to make up for your lagging behind in the digital economy and all these other areas. So I would advise you develop a comprehensive mechanism and adopt strong measures which we will support you with.Thank you very much. I would like now to give the floor to the Delegation for providing answers tothe questions. First of all, I would like to thank the two speakers who have just put these questions onArticles 3 and 4. First of all, I'm really proud to come to report to you on what Djibouti has done froma legal point of view but in terms of development programmes are concerned. May I just recall here that gender is multi-sectorial. So what needs to be done by us is to secure commitment at the same paceand across our government on gender. Our policy is that every strategic plan developed by every sectormust have a gender marker. That's a legal obligation which means that all structural and structuring programmes that must be enforced in areas such as health or education but also in other areas whichare more holistic in nature must absolutely embody gender markers and the Ministry of Women's Affairs monitor that, monitors what's going on there but the rationale is to support the various sectorsas they seek to mainstream gender in everything they do. The setting up of the gender observatory within the Ministry of Women's Affairs was a 1st step in accountability in our assessing of our indicatorsestablished in the various ministries and sectors to ensure that what the offer we provide is suitable for women not only to provide protection to them but also to ensure that they have access to their owndevelopment. You had a question on this mechanism. Is it effective? Well, the setting up of gender focal points, we ensure that they don't they are not changed too often. We demand that these gender focalpoints are people who are already fairly high up in the hierarchy and can report in a timely fashion.The indication mechanisms of the monitoring and follow-up ministry which has been digitized within the Ministry of Women's Affairs is something we are currently finalizing and we will be gathering datain real time thanks to which we will be able to more easily get our information from our focal points nationally but also internationally. Looking now to our political measures taken, not only the legal textthat set up the quota or that enact the laws on the 25% representation, et cetera, but especially we need to ensure that we can prove even if in Djibouti we are very proud to say that the place women occupyfrom a political point of view is significant, nevertheless much remains to be done and the obstacles in our way are not as the SG was saying are not legal obstacles. They are morecultural in nature and behavioral in nature. We are on the right path and we welcome your recommendations on these topics and it is our duty to take your recommendations on board and to ensure that they giverise to programs of action and policies which we are currently working on. You asked a question about whether data is disaggregated. I'm happy to confirm that it is disaggregated by sector, by age, by geographicalregion or zone. We will complete our 2023 census shortly and as part of that census we have made akey point that we have access to disaggregated data on women so that we can feed into improving women's access to our different social service provisions. The number of instances or cases of violence that have been resolved. I will allow my colleague from the gender observatory directorate perhapsto respond to that question. I will preface any remarks that she may wish to make by stating that the more headway we make in implementing and drafting our legal texts, that we, the more headwaywe make in rolling out the accompanying policies, plans and strategies, the greater the acceptance on the buy-in of the people, the greater the understanding of where complaints should be lodged, what provisions are in place to protect their rights, who is responsible for supporting a woman who has suffered a violation of her rights, violence, et cetera, who she should go to, who is responsible for ensuringthat her case is properly handled, et cetera. We are talking, of course, about human rights. Human rights are enjoyed to be all people in Djibouti and to protect those rights, provisions exist in Djiboutiincluding specific provisions for women, particularly in the rural area, although more needs to be done for rural women, particularly in order to ensure that there is service delivery at the local level and that we provide greater training for service providers in rural and remote areas. We are awarethat that's a challenge that still has to be overcome in our new gender policy. In fact, we prioritized improving service availability and delivery in rural areas, making sure that we provide protection services, provide training for people who work in those protection services and also provide empowermentactivities for women, whether that's in terms of training, education, involving them in development programs and income generating activities, et cetera, giving them those opportunities. We really take the point about the need to accelerate, speed things up, your word acceleration. We know that we really need to ramp things up, particularly the revision of our legal policies and text and theirimplementation or enforcement, the grassroots or practical tangible actions that need to be taken to support women. We need, e.g. , to focus on resilience for women, climate resilience, et cetera, and these things are increasingly spoken of, particularly in today's world. We are aware of thethreats to climate that are posed by climate change and the need to prepare for climate change resilienceand so we are working on the development of programs and plans for certain sectors where women are key, if not our best partners, particularly when we are talking about grassroots programs. We do try a tailored approach in making the point about a grassroots approach. We have different programs forclimate resilience for rural dwellers, rural women and urban women because their needs, their responses will need to be different. The community needs are different. Their exposure to climate shock is different and what that will look like is different. So we are working hard. We think, we believe we are making headway. We are making progress. We know there are still some shortcomings but the politicaldetermination, the political will is there to continue moving forward and to continue doing better, perhaps to reassure the expert on that point. Decisions taken at the political level are not taken in the absence of women and women's voices in Djibouti. Even if we are talking about a singlewoman in a commission, in a committee, et cetera, there needs to be that minimum level of representation. You need to have a minimum representation of women, at least one woman, otherwise it voids the decisions taken by a given body, et cetera. So women are very much involved in the decision making process when it comes to drafting policies, et cetera. There is a mainstreaming of that approach. As I said,there are many challenges. We are fully and acutely aware of that. These include the need for greaterand improved coordination when we develop and roll out social programmes. We need to make sure they are twinned and aligned with, e.g. , activities to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. Things can't happen in silos. We need to make sure we have a coordinated approach to make sure we have a broadapproach responding not just to individual needs such as climate change resilience but also contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals as well and make sure that the different technical and financial tools are in place to support that broad, holistic joined-up approach we work with, e.g. , UNprogrammes, UN agencies to help ensure that coordination and to help to ensure alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals and the steps we are taking towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the other social development goals we are pursuing. We need, e.g. , to improve our coordination when itcomes to the reception of aid and making sure that aid is channeled where needed to people, to the population not just left in limbo, particularly that we can fine-tune the system for channeling aid and support to women who stand in greater need often. There was a question that was asked about thetranslation of the CEDO Convention in local languages, if I could just touch on that for a moment.There are media tools available to us in Djibouti, the media, the mass communication media which is broadcast in the four local languages. So you have television and radio stations in the four locallanguages. So awareness raising programmes, awareness raising sessions are also provided in all local languages as well. So there is access to these languages, the media, the training, the educationallevel and key decisions, e.g. , the outcomes of this meeting with CEDO are communicated to ourpeople in the four different languages via the media channels available, et cetera. If you'll indulge me, Chair, I'll give the floor to the Director of the Gender Observatory who will be able to answer some of the questions, particularly those related to figures and statistics. Thank you very much, Your Excellencyand thank you also, Chair. I am the Director of the Gender Observatory within the Ministry for Women and the Family. My name is Ms. Shukri Hussein Diba. As I was saying, I'm the Director of the Gender Observatoryin the Ministry of Women and the Family in Djibouti. I want to compliment what has been said by Her Excellency the Minister in particular on the national, what she had to say on the national gender policy which was drafted in 2011 and which initially covered the period 2011-2021. Its impact was analyzed in December2022 in an attempt to learn lessons, to draw the lessons from that national gender policy, see what had worked when it came to ensuring gender equality and to see how it could be fine-tuned going forwardto adapt our gender equality strategies to changing social needs and morals in the country. The lessons learned from the analysis of the previous national gender policy had been fed into the new national gender policy which began in 2023 and which is aligned to the SDGs with the 2030 Development Goals,in particular SDG 5 which is about gender equality and we are a full enthusiastic backer of SDG 5 and that's also taken up in the new national gender policy. Now, the Gender Observatory was set up in 2018 as part of this national gender policy. It serves as a monitoring and oversight body and hassub-monitoring oversight bodies in other ministries. It is there in order to ensure that gender equality and gender equity is upheld as a policy as part of the delivery of our national gender policy. It also monitors the full implementation, respect for and upholding of the relevant legislative texts andprovisions of the international conventions. The Gender Observatory also works hard to bring around social and cultural change to promote equity and equality between the genders, supporting the broader national policy drive along those lines. The Gender Observatory is also involved in research,research and studies as a support for its actions to promote gender equality and gender equity across the board to be able to point to research. We also have a responsibility for gender sensitive data collection which we publish in a twice monthly gender statistics publication. There is also acaucus of female parliamentarians within the National Assembly that has been up and running as of 2018 and has gone a long way to increasing the number of women in parliament. 26% of parliamentary seats arecurrently held by women, e.g. , in order to promote equality at the political level to ensurethat there are equal numbers of women and men. We will continue to pursue a gender approach in all fields and that includes making sure that there is gender mainstreaming in the revision and development oflegal texts, legislation, et cetera. With regard to the quotas established in 2002, 2003, these have been revised upwards to a minimum threshold of 25% as compared to the previous 10%. The number of electedmembers in parliament have increased. We now have 26% of parliamentarians are women. We have 17 women in parliament as compared in 2013 with 9. The vice president of the National Assembly is a woman. Thesame holds true for regional assemblies, regional community assemblies, regional government instruments where women's representation stands at 29%. We have record proportion of women serving in elected andkey decision making posts in the country. They have we have outstripped all of the goals and targets that we set for ourselves. We set a target of 20% in these key elected posts at the national or the regional level and we are standing currently if you add all things together to almost 29% and we intendto go higher for 40%. On the issue of violence, as has been reminded by the minister, the ministry forwomen and their family has set up a strategy to eradicate FGM. It is a strategy that covered 2018 to 2022. We also commissioned a national survey into rates of FGM and rates of violence against women.That study was commissioned in 2019. With the support of a UN partner, we have been able to roll out a gender based violence monitoring system, GBVIMS, a global software created to harmonize and align thecollection and mining of gender based violence data and statistics. That violence brings together various different stakeholders to with the ministry of women and the family and the ministry of justice, the ministry of the interior, the gendarmerie, the judicial police and working together we are ableto map the evolution of this issue of gender based violence and violence against women and do so inreal time. Thank you very much. Thank you. The experts on Article 3, questions relating to Articles5 and 6 of Part 1 of the Convention, I would like to give the floor to Ms. Marion Betel for Article 5 for 5 min and then I will have the honor to take the floor on Article 6 for 5 min , Madam,after Madam Betel. Madam Chair, I welcome the high level Delegation of Djibouti to the constructive dialogue. I thank the head of Delegation for highlighting in her opening statement some of therecent actions taken by GBV through the new gender policy of 2023, the gender based violence framework for action and the gender based violence information management system. Kindly elaborate on the gainsthat you have measured thus far based on the introduction of these actions and systems. In regard to gender stereotyping and patriarchal norms have persistent and deep roots in Djibouti and create the environment for several harmful cultural norms, practices and traditions and extreme discriminationagainst women and girls resulting in the most severe forms of GBV. What comprehensive strategy and measures has the state party adopted targeting women and men, girls and boys, including religious leaders to raise awareness about and eliminate gender stereotypes and harmful practices against women andgirls including child marriage and polygamy in particular in rural and remote areas? What measures are in place to provide redress to girls who have experienced FGM and child and/or forced marriage such as rehabilitation and social and psychological support services? What mechanisms are in place totrack cases of child and/or forced marriage with a view to making the necessary support interventions?There is also a stigmatization of women with albinism. What measures are in place to address this harmful practice? I now turn to female genital mutilation. The findings from the national survey on violence against women focusing on FGM conducted in 2019 indicated decline in the prevalence amongyounger demographics. However, the data still shows that a substantial number of young girls remain affected by this harmful practice. Further, the predominance of the severe type 3 FGM particularly among young girls aged 5 to 9 and the involvement of medical personnel in approximately 20% of the cases raisessignificant ethical and health concerns. Can you provide current data on the prevalence of FGM in the state party in particular in rural and remote areas? In regard to the national strategy of 2017to 2021 to combat FGM, what has been the assessment regarding the measures taken? What challenges have been identified and what are the corresponding remedies to those challenges? Further, what exactly is the role of the Ministry of Health's national safe motherhood program in implementing the prohibitionof FGM? FGM is criminalized by the penal code with a sentence of five years imprisonment and a fine. The law also provides for up to one year imprisonment and a fine for anyone who fails to report a completedor planned FGM to the authorities. What measures are in place to ensure the effective implementation of Article 333 of the criminal code on offenses related to FGM? What data do you have at hand on the number of prosecutions and convictions and the penalties imposed on the perpetrators of FGM?I will now refer to domestic violence. The penal code of 1995 criminalizes acts of violence. However, the state party appears not to have a separate law that specifically criminalizes domestic violence.Please clarify this matter. What is the legal process for a woman to obtain a protection order from a court? We are concerned about the extra judicial resolution of domestic violence cases in the state party, predominantly managed within families or communities and under the supervision of maletraditional or religious leaders which encourages the culture of impunity and a violation of women's human rights. What measures are in place to prohibit mediation of domestic violence cases outside of acourt and to assist a woman with access to the court? In regard to rape and sexual assault, rape is defined by the penal code as an act of sexual penetration committed on another person with the use of violence, constraint or threat. Would the state party consider amending the definition of rape to bebased on the lack of consent rather than on the use of force or threats by the perpetrator? This amendment would be in compliance with CEDAW and human rights standards. What challenges does the state party face in the legal process including reporting, investigation and conviction of sexual assault andrape? Further, reports indicate that the courts may consider marital rape as constituting an act of violence punishable under criminal law. However, marital rape remains a taboo subject and, therefore, israrely prosecuted. Would the state party consider enacting a specific offense of marital rape and carrying out the kind of public education and awareness raising that would be required in this area so that thetaboo is lifted? And finally, Madam Chair, if I just have one more minute, further we note that the establishment of a national protocol referral for gender based violence, this protocol has been instrumental in coordinating actions and providing the comprehensive care to victims with the engagementof legal and medical professionals. How is the process, how is the progress and effectiveness of this protocol being measured and evaluated? Are women and girls able to access shelters or are equipped to address their psychosocial needs? And finally, what is the level of human financial and technicalresources allocated to ensuring the sustainability of this protocol? Thank you. Thank you, Madam. I will address issues related to Article 6, the Convention. We recognize achievements made by the government, namelythe development of legislation of Republic of Djibouti addressing trafficking in women and girls, criminal code and other anti-trafficking legislation. The stringent penalties provided, the national action plan from 2014 involving coordinated efforts by a high level working group within the Ministry of Justice. Thegovernment commitment to international anti-trafficking standards and international cooperation. Despite these efforts, challenges persist due also to Djibouti's strategic location, socioeconomic challenges and the persistence of foreign military bases. Over 10 military bases are located on the crucial territory of yourcountry. Their status vary and some of them are there through agreements with states and others are through contract with private organizations. According to the Convention, the State Party has the responsibility to eliminate any act of discrimination of women and girls when perpetrated by any person, organization and enterprise. In spite of some instances of convictions, prosecution of trafficking syndicates and their international accomplices is still rare, especially after 2017. Traffickers exploitdomestic and migrant victims in Djibouti and to a lesser extent they exploit victims from Djibouti abroad. These realities are exacerbated by high levels of poverty and unemployment which make that women and girls remain vulnerable to trafficking, sexual exploitation and forced prosecution. The intersection with the mentioned substantial foreign military personnel and presence, migrant influence and significant refugee numbers, additionally contributes to the market for sexual exploitation of women,girls, boys and most vulnerable groups of women including migrant refugees, LBTI women. In light of the Convention and its general recommendation 38 on trafficking in women in the context of migration of the CEDAW Committee I have the following question. Please mention thespecific collaborative measures implemented with Governments of countries maintaining military bases in Djibouti to prevent trafficking and sexual exploitation. Namely how does the State Party ensure that military personnel from foreign bases and military contractors receivecomprehensive training on the legal ramifications of engaging in sexual relations with traffic individuals and minors and what mechanisms are in place in the State Party to guarantee objective investigations and accountability in cases of alleged abuses involving private military security companies or foreigntroops in Djibouti. Second what measures are in place for improving the capability and sensitivity of frontline officials including law enforcement, immigration officers and social workers to accurately identify including early identification and support trafficking survivors. How do youensure that survivors of trafficking receive effective, accessible, comprehensive and gender sensitive access to justice including reparation? And please provide updated data disaggregated by age, sex and geographical location on the number of reported cases of trafficking, prosecution and convictionsas well as the sentences imposed on perpetrators since 2017. Please mention the main achievements and tangible outcomes of your national action plan 2014 and what are the main objectives of a new national action plan when it will be adopted? Namely how do you intend to improve the collaborationwith civil society organizations and support their work with victims and women at risk? And concerning prevention and rehabilitation what are the measures undertaken to provide access to income generating activities such as micro credits and self-employment opportunities especially for refugee and migrantwomen to reduce their vulnerability to trafficking? What are concrete programs and how will you ensure their sustainability? Now the Delegation has the floor for answers to the questions.Thank you, Chair. My thanks to the members of the Committee for the questions asked. First I would like to respond to the question asked about measures that have been enacted and the existing provisionsto try and bring about a change in attitude and behavior, particularly steps that have been taken to tackle violence against women including FGM but also forced and early marriage, et cetera.Earlier on I said that the different assessments and studies go back to 2019 where we saw a significant reduction between the number of younger women who had suffered FGM as compared with previous cohorts.A further such study should be concluded this year to again measure the level of prevalence of FGM in the country. But with regard to the different awareness raising measures intended to help support our efforts to eradicate FGM, all of these are automatically integrated in the various programsof the Ministry. There is a specific standalone strategy on female genital mutilation. That strategy is about to come to an end and we have decided to expand that strategy into a strategyof tackling violence against women of which female genital mutilation will be a component because we see that FGM is a form of violence against women. And that new strategy will be under the auspices not just of the Ministry of Women and the Family but other ministries as well. It will be a cross-cuttingstrategy and program. A particularly key partner will be the Ministry of Health who will be a key partner in both preventing FGM but also supporting victims of FGM where that still occurs. There is alot of resistance in the most remote regions, particularly where access to services is much reduced. That's something we will have to work against. FGM is a problem. We do recognize that. It is still there. It still needs to be dealt with. But we would say it is less widespread andless of an issue than it was in previous years. We are seeing a downward trend but we are aware that there is more that needs to be done. As you have said, the legal texts are well drafted. They are well implemented. There are channels for remedy, et cetera. We have engaged hard in awareness raisingefforts. People are aware that FGM is not as a harmful practice, that they need to be attentive to it as a practice if they see it happening. If I address the issue of early or forced marriage, turning to another tag, to make the point that the family code provides for the protection of minors,that's a priority. When talking about protection of minors, that includes preventing early and/or forced marriage, there have been supplementary provisions added to the family code, includingthe requirement for consent to a marriage, including minors when you are talking about emancipated minor, their consent is required. Health concerns also have to be addressed when it is a questionof an emancipated minor marrying early. There has to be a health certificate, a certificate of good health. All of those requirements are now integrated in the new updated family code as tools to help us to fight further against early and forced marriage and to eradicate this as practices and to ensurethat, in fact, people marry later. On accessibility, as I said earlier, education and awareness raising programmes are integrated in the different funds and programmes and policies that have been implemented and rolled out by the Ministry for Women and Family. Whenever there is a legal provision on accessibility,et cetera, it goes hand in hand with an automatic awareness raising campaign so that people are made aware of the new provisions, what it means for them, et cetera. Financial support for the implementation of these projects is again provided for at the government level domestically. We have a new policyas of 2021 which in its 1st section addresses the protection of children generally speaking including young girls, protecting them from the scourge of violence including FGM and other forms of violence of which those children, in particular girls, may be the victim. So we have this new strategy on theprotection of children. I was asked whether there are specific girls' homes, girls' refuges such as refuges or centres do not currently exist. There are support and training centres for young girlswhich inter alia are intended to give them the tools to escape violence, to avoid violence. We are aware that we need to ramp up our programmes that are provided in these centres and to address issuessuch as school dropout rates, e.g. , and to take steps to ensure that girls remain in theeducational system or in the vocational education system when we are talking about older girls.In the training that we make available to the girls and the young, the teenagers in the aforementioned centres, this includes awareness raising about their rights and the different legal provisions that exist to protect and uphold their rights including to protect them from violence against women and young girls or to provide recourse if they are victims of the same. I will perhapsturn things over now to the rest of my team to address in particular some of the different aspects raised by the two colleagues who asked questions, but before I do that, one or two more minor points.Firstly, civil society as a partner, they play a critical role. The national guidance, a helpline on FGM is run and administered by the largest NGO in the country, the national union ofcontribution women. They run and administer that helpline. They also have a lawyer who supports that helpline to support victims who call it and are seeking guidance and they support them throughout the lodging of the initial complaint and throughout the legal process including themedical examination, et cetera, the involvement of the police and they support them through the court process as well and until there has been a ruling, they make available their support, the support of lawyers and legal assistants. We are setting up similar helplines across the country in the interiorregions of the country in particular so that in the interior of the country they have access to the same resources, the same provisions as they do in Djibouti and on the coast. We are working closely with the Ministry of Justice who are currently pursuing a decentralization initiative targeting particularly the regions in the interior of the country in order to ensure that services, judicialand justice services are made available on an equal footing throughout the country. Perhaps at this juncture I can turn things over to my colleague for those aspects I have not yet had an opportunity to touch upon including I will give the floor to my colleagues in the Ministry of Family. PerhapsI will begin by giving the floor to the right colleague from the Ministry of Justice. It is always useful to revisit early or forced marriage. Work has been done on the amendment of the year,code on the personal status. I speak under the control of the Minister. We want to outlaw formally these marriages. On FGM now Article 33 as you know what we are doing is insufficient under 33 becauseyou say this because there are not enough cases before courts. We had wondered why in fact over 10, 15 years ago we acted on this which is why in 2009 we enacted a law. In fact we gave certaincivil society associations the right to become civil parties in proceedings before courts toincrease their ability to combat this scourge. But going back to our thought process, our reflective process, the fact is we find that prosecutions are still not enough to counter the phenomenon of FGMand in particular culture weighs heavily on what happens. Culture means that parents who are theones who in the interest of their child will be in their interest to refer the cases. Those parents are the ones themselves who do the organization of the actual act which is a crime. But it is difficultfor that crime to be known about by the authorities and to be prosecuted because these FGMs occur withinthe family circle. Some experts here and also at home have said that perhaps the criminal sanction providedfor under Article 3.33 which is problematic, parents believe that FGM is too severely punished. Hencethey will not report it. Now our group of experts has proposed that this criminal sanction under Article3.33 to review it, to lower it, to make it less harsh which possibly might encourage people to reportthe FGMs. The decision still hasn't been taken but this is something we are considering. On domestic violence, conjugal violence, you notice that the 1995 criminal code provides generally speaking forpenalties for conjugal violence. It also provides for the suppression of violence with aggravatingfactors, violence on minors, domestic violence, violence against vulnerable persons or violence in the home. All of these forms of violence are more severely suppressed or repressedthan violence against a woman taking place outside of the realm of the family. On thetrafficking of persons Mr. Ahmed will tell you more but I will say that two months ago Djiboutiwhich had been identified as a country of transit, many Ethiopians would leave their country on the way to the Gulf, transiting through Djibouti. Admittedly because migrants are vulnerable, they are moreeasily prone to become victims of trafficking in persons. So two months ago, three months ago in fact, as the speaker corrected himself, we organized a joint investigation with Ethiopiabringing together police authorities of Djibouti, the police enforcement authorities of Ethiopia tostrengthen our cooperation framework to combat illegal migration and also to combat trafficking in persons which migrants on the move can fall prey to. Turning to Mr. Ahmed as promisedearlier on to tell you more about this. Good morning. Ahmed Usman is my name. I am Director of a departmentwithin the Ministry of Justice. My Secretary General who has just spoken has concluded withthings that we have done recently, namely three months ago. He described to you the missing linkin the whole business of people trafficking. This process began a long time ago, close to 20 yearsago with the ratification by Djibouti in 2005 of the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crimeand the Palermo Convention and two of its optional protocols, I believe there might be four, but wehave ratified two, the relevant one here being the one on the trafficking in persons and the 2nd oneon trafficking in migrants. Members of the Committee have asked many questions on thesetopic because trafficking in persons is one of the worst crimes affecting us currently. Let me give youa general answer describing the things that have been done over the last 20 years, but I will flag the most salient ones. Now, in order to implement the Convention we ratified, the UNODC convention,on transnational organized crime, we adopted a whole range of measures. At the time, they weren't described as being part of the national strategy. This being said, in 2007 we enacted an initial law designedto prevent and suppress trafficking in persons and trafficking in migrants, which this act, whichat the time was challenged by civil society because it felt it wasn't strong enough to protect peoplewho were vulnerable. It was revised in 2016 for it to be in-tuned with the provisions of the PalermoConvention. It transposes the definition of trafficking embodied in the protocol. It alsoalso increases the penalties for authors of trafficking. Another point which at the time had beenchallenged by Djiboutian society which felt that these crimes were not sufficiently cracked down upon.Now penalties range from five to ten years imprisonment and there are also aggravating circumstances as my colleague was saying earlier on such as, e.g. , if the trafficking has givenrise to a disability or a targeted vulnerable persons, then that penalty is increased going allthe way to a life prison sentence if the victim of the trafficking dies in the process. That is from a legislative point of view. There is another aspect to this phenomenon, namely the training component.This crime is one that is not new but the awareness is new subsequent to our adoption of the Palermoprotocol. We launched from 2007 an initial batch of training described in the report. After that,other training modules were dispensed, especially for the criminal investigation officers, the CIOs,OPJ in French, be it in the police force or the gendarmerie or the customs guards who have their own CIOs. We have also given training to the medical staff in contact with victims, especiallyto provide care and treatment because victims of trafficking need all the treatment and care theycan get. Also we have given training to judicial officials. Just to list the latest in 2021/2022,over 40 border guards were trained on how to detect cases of trafficking. As you know,that's one of the hardest things to do because it is concealed. It is very difficult to identify peoplebeing trafficked and provide protection for them. And to support that training, manuals were produced.We have a manual on the training of trainers still on detection because that is the starting point once a person has been identified as a victim of trafficking, then that person can be helped. Sothe training programmes were on detection and on how to provide support for migrants. In 2020/22 also,we in cooperation with our international partners put together another manual, given we are talking about manuals, manual on standard operating procedures, SOPs, to implement, to harmonize the differentinvestigations carried out by the different law enforcement agencies working for state authorities.So that's what we do as far as training of professionals is concerned. But generally speaking,we have raised the awareness of the public at large, focusing in particular on those areas wheremigrants are known to transit. For example, entry points and exit points. That's where migrants aremost at risk. So the local populations, the people living there need to be more vigilant. Sometimes they are involved by housing or even transporting some of these migrants who are at risk of beingtrafficked and therefore we have targeted those people to raise their awareness. We have also created a significant institutional framework in 2020, 2023 sorry, in 2023, a national committee wascreated whose job it is to combat people trafficking. This committee has as its head the Minister ofJustice who presides over the committee. It is supported by an Executive Secretariat and it is thestanding body in charge of the implementation of the Executive Secretariat. This body will provideadvice and assistance to the government on matters pertaining to the trafficking of persons. This Executive Secretariat of this body will also be in charge of gathering data and sharing data with therelevant departments and that is data on trafficking in persons. It will also be in charge of carrying out advocacy on combating trafficking in persons. They will thus organize trainings and developedcommunication strategies to raise the awareness of the public at large, civil society also on these matters and they will work on the implementation of the programs to provide protection and assistanceto victims with various ministries. They are also in charge of developing or strengthening international cooperation with our existing partnerships with international organizations who work in thisparticular field. Thank you very much for your kind attention. Thank you, Head of Delegation. Minister,I would like to compliment what has been said to answer the questions put by members of the committeein the 2019 law. We set up, through that law, we set up centers to care for women and girls victims of violence. These centers still have not been built as the Minister has just said but we are planning tobuild them. Therein we will have a legal service, a service to provide psychological support. We will have lodgings, we will have dormitories for children, for girls, for women, but these will betemporary emergency shelters to which women and girls with victims of violence can be housedto extract them from their situation of violence. We were also asked about whether we had a cleardefinition of discrimination. In the 2019 law, we included a clear definition of discrimination. This law defines what discrimination is and it says that discrimination against women is any discrimination,exclusion or restriction whose effect is and purpose is to frustrate the recognition of women of rightsand freedoms on the basis of in the area of civil, political, social and cultural rights and to jeopardize these, the enjoyment or the exercise of these rights by women regardless of their color, their race, their religion, their thought, their age, their nationality and the economic and socialconditions they live in, their civil status, their health, state of health or their ability or disability. This definition is almost lifted from CEDAW. Our aim was to embody in law a clear andprecise definition of discrimination against women. There is also conjugal violence. Do you have texts criminalizing conjugal violence? We have in the criminal code a chapter on violence against personsand violence against persons are punished under that part of the criminal code. If anyone appears with amedical certificate proving that they are victims of violence, then they can take that to court. But we don't have, we have not criminalized conjugal violence per se. We have created a protocol toprovide care for victims which issues a free certificate to victims who can then, doctors can give a free certificate thanks to which they can press charges and even take the case to court. With regardsto awareness raising on CEDAW, we always carry out awareness raising activities on the rights of women and CEDAW is one of the main instruments we use to raise awareness. In fact, at the next commemorationof the International Week for Women due to take place in Djibouti, we will carry out awareness raising on CEDAW in cooperation with the National Human Rights Commission. These were the points I wantedto add to what had already been said on these matters. Thank you. Just to conclude on these answers,every year we organize in November six days of activism to combat violence against women and againstgirls. During these 16 days, we carry out awareness raising activities for not only national actors butregional actors because the scourges we are combating are ones we are all exposed to. It would have been great not to be exposed to these scourges but these are scourges we endure together with our neighbors,Ethiopia and Eritrea. During these 16 days, activities are organized on several fronts. First of all, for civil society to raise their awareness about applicable rules but also about hazards,the risks, that is the health risks of FGMs and other forms of violence but also there is trainingfor the public officials. The Ministry for Women's Affairs, e.g. , had asked us within the Ministry of Justice to provide training for criminal investigation officers on how to provide care forvictims, young victims but also how to provide to support them in the context of investigations and in the context of questioning of victims. But they also asked us to provide seminars bringing togetherreligious leaders from the various neighboring countries and Djibouti. These are the awareness raising activities we organized and which we wanted to tell you about. Thank you, Chair. Thank you,Madam. Thank you very much. I would like to ask Madam Battelle if she has a follow-up question.Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the Delegation for its responses to issues on gender-based violence. I think time is of the essence at this moment. But I would like to go back to the whole issue of gender stereotypes and harmful cultural practices where I began my intervention to askdirectly how does the State Party address the root causes of the harmful practices of child marriage and FGM? I mean, there are social and cultural factors that are driving and sustaining these practices. AndI think it is incumbent upon the State Party to really look at the root causes that create the kind of environment where this can flourish. And so I'm asking, you know, you talk about the awarenessraising campaigns that have been going on in the 16 days of activism, but what is really being done by the State Party to address the root causes of this and to see women's bodies not just largely to be usedfor reproductive, sexual and domestic work, but to see the value of women and the personal integrityof our bodies and the autonomy and right to our bodies outside of this, outside of these cultural practices? So I'm asking how is the education done? I mean, you have talked about National Committeepublic education programs. What is the composition of the bodies that actually do this public awareness raising? And how are they, how do they interface with the religious leaders and the community leadersto really help people to understand the health and life harms that is done to young women and girls in regard to FGM and child marriage? So it's not clear to me that the State Party has the political willand the dedication and commitment to engage with the public in a way that they understand and canappreciate the extreme harm that is done to FGM and child marriage and how this can be addressed in waysthat are transformative and productive. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madame Battelle. I just havealso very brief questions, follow-up questions concerning Article 6. Thank you very much forthe extensive information and also this overview of the development of your legislation and policies. I would like to ask you if you could provide some updated data disaggregated by age, sex and geographicallocation concerning the trafficking cases, trafficking prosecution convictions after 2017. I mean, the period that you have data about because you mentioned that this Committee now also compilesthe statistics, maybe there are statistics available already. And also the question about concerning the prevention and rehabilitation programs, what are the measures undertaken to protect women and girlsat risk? Microcredit self-employment programs, to mention what are the concrete measures undertakenand about their sustainability. The Delegation has the floor now for concrete answers.Thank you, Madame Chairperson. We are grateful to the Committee member for her question, namely what are the political and innovative initiatives to combat FGMs. As you said, these are due to culturalstereotypes, these practices and these cultural stereotypes are ones that need to be combated by raising the awareness of the general public. But we must also involve the fathers because normallymothers and grandmothers organize the FGMs. Now, having carried out our various assessments, we concluded that the father needs to be involved. He is, as I was saying, he is the head of the householdtraditionally but he is normally not consulted when FGMs were performed. So in our awareness raising work, we stress involvement of the parents but especially involvement of the father. Still workingon combating cultural and religious stereotypes. We found that we need to involve religious leaders, not only in Djibouti but from the neighboring countries also. Djibouti has adopted a declarationon zero tolerance for FGM. It's made it a regional, a national but also a regional commitment. As I was saying before, all of the religious leaders were brought on board for us to be better equipped tocombat FGMs. Now, in our decentralized regions, that is the five regions, we have organized a consultationframework involving the political leaders, community leaders, religious leaders for them to gathertogether to combat FGM and for it no longer to be just women or young women to combat it. So we have organized this consultation framework bringing together, as I was saying before, political andcommunity leaders to work together on combating FGM because that is also a strong component ofa combating FGM. You don't only raise awareness. You put together structured and concise actionsinvolving political and cultural leaders to combat FGMs. The various guides and supports in place are developed, a whole range of services, but these range of services are translated into local languages so that local people can understand them and enforce them. Awareness raising once again is something whichis very difficult to achieve because it is culturally bound. This being said, in everything we do, we do our best to innovate and from year to year we see who we can add to our endeavor so that we caneffectively combat FGMs in parallel to everything we do as my team was reminding me of, we organize a lot of training for midwives, for nurses to help them be more competent in detecting and classifying andreferring cases of FGM which come to their attention so that they can refer them expeditiously and to ensure that all of these stakeholders can make this a national priority and not just a culturalphenomenon. So we work at family level to involve the father. Since we have done that, FGMs have actuallygone down because men, fathers, are suddenly saying that this is no longer acceptable. So it has takentime for figures to fall. We are glad to see that there has been a fall of cases. FGMs remain where the state is not present. But everything we do now from a policy point of view and every other point of viewis to do just that. On the questions about data statistics on trafficking asked by the Chair,I think we will have to do a little bit of research if you indulge us and try and find the number of cases that have been dealt with and get your specific figure. But to make the point that migration is akey and weighty issue in Djibouti and it acts as something of a drag on our economy and on otherservice delivery, in order to protect migrants you need to have a framework in place to protect them that requires greater levels of regional cooperation which we have pursued through formal channels with our different neighbors to address existing migration flows in order to ensure that they move throughfixed well administered, well monitored migration channels, migration routes supported by protection measures, healthcare measures including physical structure, including uniformed border and police forces, et cetera, to monitor their well-being, et cetera. There is a cost for all of that. There isa cost for the host community. Migration policy in other words is a cross-cutting policy, a cross-cutting issue bringing together various different ministries. It is led by the Ministry of the Interior but the Ministry of Justice and my own ministry, the Ministry of Women and Family are keenly engaged. At thecapital we have established a reception center for children, for young children, for street children who are often migrants or the children of migrants themselves. These are transit centers for children,those and young people, particularly those pursuing voluntary return. That center is running in cooperation with the IOM and the IOM also supports us in the voluntary return process and if they seek voluntary return then it is a fully accompanied and supported process taking them through all of the steps beforethey return home. So it meets all international standards for the protection and voluntary return of these children and young people. Migration therefore is a key issue, one that we have to grapple with, one that does have quite an impact on our country. It requires a great deal of coordination and cooperation. It requires training for the staff who will be working on migrationissues including training to ensure that we can identify instances of trafficking and smuggling, prevent people, prevent migrants from becoming victims of trafficking and smuggling. This is something that exists in all countries wherever there is immigration, where there is migrationthen unfortunately these phenomena arise. But just to reassure you that politically speaking we are committed to addressing these issues and to supporting regular and safe migration processes. Thank you.Thank you for your answers. I see Madame has 2 min . I would like to say that concerning thedata on the trafficking in women, whatever you have as data as we require, we will receive in writingand in due time, right? In 24 hours? Chair, we will prepare the statistics that you asked for, but I can'tshare with you a single number. Three people in 2023 were hosted in the center which the head of Delegation spoke about. Now, it is a mixed or joint center which includes children and young peopleseeking voluntary return. So the center serves as a transit center, but three of the people who made use of those facilities were identified as being victims of trafficking. And one person continues to be in that center which is intended for children, young people, migrants and those seeking voluntaryreturn. They are still in the center, the one individual I referred to because there was no other center, no other place to send them. They are a foreign national from another country. I did want to row back a little bit to the issue of trafficking writ large. We will share the figures with you. Wewill do that within the 24-hour deadline. Figures and numbers related to the number of persons who have been identified as being the victim of violence, rape, and human trafficking. There is adistinction that needs to be made as far as we are concerned between migrants, people who are moving from one country to another via perhaps the 3rd country who are the victims and victims of trafficking. And, of course, migrants can be victims of trafficking but, of course, other people canbe victims of trafficking as well. It is a multi-form problem or multifaceted problem in our country. And you simply need to carry out a simple Google search and it becomes abundantly clear thattrafficking often involves a national network, trafficking or smuggling. Of course, it happens across borders but as origin you are talking about a local trafficker who recruits or traffics localpersons to afterwards move them across borders. So that is one thing that we have to apprehend and grapple with. And so it is a question to you, Madam Chair, the figures that you are seeking on trafficking, the number of victims that have been identified in the Republic of Djibouti, are you wanting the figuresfor migrants who have been trafficked or do you want general figures for all victims of trafficking,including perhaps Djiboutian victims of trafficking and then we will be able to provide you with a more specific response to your question. Sir, for your answer, I think that the Committee would like to receive data concerning trafficking cases, reported cases of trafficking, prosecutions and convictionsas well as sentences imposed on perpetrators. So whatever you have as data and you present it in the required period of 24 hours would be considered as your written answer if you cannot provide now. Thankyou for making this distinction and also we understand the difficulty of the distinction sometimes.And now I see that Mr. Gobamiam still has a question, follow-up question for 2 min , please.Chair, and as I present this question, I think it can be incorporated in the next round of answers. I just wanted clarification on a submission that had been made by the State Party about consent of minorsrequired under the code that the kids, the children, minors are protected from early and forced marriage but that consent can be given by the minors and I really wanted clarification on that if minors havethe capacity to give consent because I do not think legally they have the capacity to give consent. Sounder what arrangements would then a minor be able to consent to forced marriage and the other issue that I wanted to flag on was your campaign and the approach that you have adopted towards eliminationof stereotypes and just to note that the issue you raised, I think viewing women as a human capital asset of the country is something that needs to probably be integrated into the campaign thatyou run. They are part of your national resource base and therefore they do not need to be cut off from the national asset and that's the message at local and at national level. They are a human capitalbase of your country. Thank you. Thank you for your question. You have now the Delegation has nowthe floor for the answer. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. My thanks also to the expert member of theCommittee for the follow-up question. You requested some clarification, some precision. Just to clarifywhen I was talking about the family code and the provisions it has on early marriage, early marriage broadly speaking is prohibited. That's what we are working towards. Many minors have a guardianin part of the social structure and as the Secretary General was saying on an interfamily basis, the parents, the guardian decide for their children and the parents set up a marriage, arrange a marriage and so we need to raise awareness amongst and educate parents on this issue of ensuring that they getthe consent of their children. When we are talking about minors, we are talking about those under the age of 18. That's the legal definition of a minor. Certainly it is in our legislation. So if we are talking about a minor person from 15 to 16 or above, they are an emancipated minor. They can give theirown opinion. They have the mental faculties to give their own opinion and give their own consent to a marriage or not. But they need to be heard. We need to hear from them directly, not via their parents or their guardian, to hear from them alone and see whether they consent to the marriage, otherwiseit is a forced marriage because when the child is that age of being an emancipated minor, 16, 17, etc., given the social structure, given the stereotypes, the cultural stereotypes in a country, marriage can still occur. Marriage can still be arranged, set up between. So what we need to do is a greater workof education and also ensure that in the family code, in our legal provisions, we cover all the risks that may arise when a minor, when a young person marries and also make it abundantly clear that weare prohibiting marriage for young people, for 10, 11, 12-year-olds and also explain why we are doing that, the medical, mental, psychological reasons that we are prohibiting marriages at such young agesto make it abundantly clear that such marriages are prohibited and that parents cannot consent to them, certainly not on behalf of such a young child. But an older teenager who is still a minor in the eyes of the law under the age of 18, but as I say 16 or 17, there it is a different kettle of fish, we callthat an emancipated minor and what's important is that we have their view, that we have their consent directly expressed by them, not on their behalf. A 2nd question was asked about human capital and viewing women as an important source of human capital, a resource for the country. You seemto be firmly persuaded of that. We are glad to have persuaded of you. It is certainly what we believe, but of course there are still practices that need to be eradicated, barriers that need to be broken down that are deeply rooted in our society. So it is a long-term work of awareness raising, education andas part of our ongoing awareness raising activities and they are ongoing, I wish to stress that, we includethe fact that women are an important resource for the country. They are 50% of the country. They are half the country's population. They are a vital resource, a potential that we need to harness, that we need to tap. We want to ensure that they are educated and there, e.g. , we focus on the parents, onfathers and underscoring the importance of girls' education to expand our human capital and beauty so that it is fed by both sexes and that ensuring that we break down stereotypes as they are based around gender will allow us to boost that human capital, boost women's participation and we needto raise awareness about seeing our people as human capital, that they can contribute to the development of our country and that we are losing out because girls, young women suffer from harmful practices which are still present in our society and so we can't make use of their full potential. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam. We will now move to Article 7 to 9 of Part 2 of the Conventionand I would like to give the floor to Ms. Maya Morsi on Article 7 and 8 for 4 min and on Article 9to Madam Egobamiam for 2 min . Thank you very much. I would like to welcome the high-level Delegation.The 2018 law setting a minimum quota of 25% for women in elected legislative positions. Consequently, women represent 26% of the seats in the Parliament in 2012-2019 in comparison to 15% in 2006-2011with three in the government, a women's city mayor and two women leading political parties. A gender equality working group monitors legislative reforms and provides a collaborative platform for femaleparliamentarians. The proportion of women elected in regional and communal election has increased, reaching 29% in 2012 and remaining stable at 29% still in 2017. Despite the steady progress, the participationof women in decision making in public administration and private sector remains below parity, only the improvement achieved around 26.6%. As mentioned in the intervention of Madam Amelin, quota is anaccelerator. Still strategic interventions need to be done and required to drive institutional and systematic reforms for addressing deep rooted stereotypes and negative sociocultural practices such as violence against women, unpaid care and domestic work, women's access and ownership of assets andgender pay gaps, et cetera. How does the government plan to ensure sustained progress beyond setting quotas as accelerator and affirmative action strategies to better address underlying systematic barriers that hinder women's participation in public and political life? What is the percentage of women inleadership positions in political parties, trade unions and other associations given that I mentionedthere are three women leading political parties? Other concerns revolve around funding of election campaigns to encourage women participation and inclusion of women with disabilities. Further clarification is required on the allocation of adequate funds for women candidates with no discrimination in the publicfunding of election campaigns and for women led offices, initiatives in comparison to their male counterparts. Do women with disabilities have adequate opportunities to participate and have a vote in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development policies and communityprojects? Any data on inclusion of women with disabilities or the representation of women in rural and urban areas in political decision making bodies and processes? What incentives or sanctionsexist to encourage and catalyze women's participation and representation in political leadership in the public and private sectors including on corporate boards? Is there any comprehensive framework totake representation of women beyond appointments to move more inclusive participation that will guarantee qualitative and quantitative engagement of women given its potential to trigger social transformation andinstitutional changes? The representation of women in diplomatic missions abroad progressed since 2013. In 2016 the 1st woman ambassador to Kenya was appointed serving until 2018. The distribution of senior managerial staff of the central administration of the ministry of foreign affairs is approaching parity.Around 25% of the senior ministry of foreign affairs staff are women. While the distribution of senior managerial staff of the central administration of the ministry of foreign affairs is approaching parity still there is need to explanation of this contradiction, why they are in the management positions but they arenot reaching up to the ambassadorship level. Women's participation in diplomatic positions reportedly remains a little bit challenging. What factors contribute to this limited representation of womenand how they can be addressed or accelerated? The report highlights only the two women in ambassadors role, have ambassador role. Are those, these related in or in isolated cases? So is there a strategic movementin increasing the percentage? What other international opportunities of a broader scope exist for Djibouti women? Are there systematic efforts to provide ongoing and equal opportunities for women to representthe government at the international level? Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. Madam Marcy.Once again, thank you to the Delegation. Despite extensive legal reforms which we have heard since morning, reports from other sources indicate that transfer of nationality from mother to child is notguaranteed in all instances and discriminatory bottlenecks exist in the birth registration process.Perceived contradictions in the Djibouti constitution and provisions in the family code of 2002 are that directly or indirectly affect citizenship status, nationality identity and entitlements are differentfor men and for women. The high level of statelessness reported exists among vulnerable groups of women who are often also victims of exploitation and trafficking that we have been talking aboutpreviously, especially as they fall outside the social protection system. Could you kindly provide information on findings from the birth registration study of 2017 and the impact of covert and systematicdiscriminatory practices that often affect women differently in the context of birth registration?Legal and administrative guidelines that are applicable to instances when the father of a child is known but is non-Djiboutian. Can a mother still transfer her nationality to her child regardless of the nationality of the father? What negative cultural practices and stigma is experienced by mothers andchildren from mixed parental nationalities and how is this being addressed? What efforts are ongoing or planned to remove direct and indirect discrimination including economic deprivationtowards migrants, asylum seekers and victims of sexual exploitation, especially women and girls? Finally, what opportunities are available for women forced labor migrants, victims of trafficking and sexualexploitation to secure identity papers, education, employment and other social services within the state party? Thank you. Thank you very much. I now give the floor to the Delegation to respond.Many thanks, Chair. By way of response to those questions that have just been asked, the 1st of which I think pertain to the quota law and any progress or headway that has been made, particularlythanks to this new minimum quota of 25%. At the government level, the number of women in government has risen from three to six. So in a few years we have been able to double the number of women in the government. The text of the law says at least 25%. That's the minimum quota. So we can go, of course,well beyond that. You can have more than 25%. The specific wording is at least 25%. Below 25% is unacceptable. The legislative at the community level access by women or other opportunities for womento stand for elected office is something that's entirely open to them. There are no restrictions placed whatsoever. So women are free to seek office. That is, of course, the letter of the law and the letter of our strategies and policies. Of course, then how many come forward is a different kettle offish. So in theory there is nothing preventing them from standing for elected office but it is a question of how many actually stand for elected office and how we can increase and encourage greater numbers of women to come forward. That will be a key goal of our programmes, how can we promote and foster women'sleadership and improve and tap the leadership, encourage women to tap their own leadership potential to have the confidence to come forward, to stand for elected office, to stand for politics, to enter into the political sphere. One of our agendas in the ministry of women and the family is to work onwomen's leadership, to increase women's leadership in the national assembly, in civil society organisations,amongst the different branches of government, executive, legislative, judicial, community,local, et cetera. We seek to boost these women's leadership programmes and make them more readily available. They go hand in hand with other women's programmes including literacy, access to development funds, micro credits, finances, et cetera. All of these I think are the important foundationsfor ensuring that women have that sense of confidence, empowerment, that she believes in her own capabilities, that she is financially independent, she has the financial resources that she needs so that she is willing, she feels able to pursue a political career to stand for election, et cetera.Currently we have a single woman head of a political party, one of the opposition political parties. We hope to see more female-led political parties but I do want to make the point that there is no formal legal written obstacle to women occupying political posts including these senior political posts. It's aquestion of greater initiatives, greater programmes in order to encourage women to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them. That's one of the points that we made. We want to put in together incitements, encouragements to push for greater women's involvement and make sure that wecan use their capacity to tap their potential reach and go beyond our minimum quota and have more women in decision-making posts and circles. The rule of thumb is equal opportunity. When a man and a woman stand for the same post, then they will have the same right to apply for that post. Whichever one of themis selected, they will have the same salary. There is no wage discrimination. There is also often womenare not at an advantage because we can see just how seriously women take the application for decision making posts, particularly in the civil service. We do have promotion and recruitment exercises that do prioritize women, that do have an element of affirmative action. Of course, sometimes you needto go upstream to have more women apply, to have more women put themselves forward, et cetera. You need to work on training, education, lower down the line. We have, e.g. , only two female ambassadors in Djibouti. We need to work on training, equipping women, perhaps already in our civil service or womenin school and universities so they have the relevant training, education, expertise, that they have the skills that they need to be able to stand for diplomatic posts. There are no obstacles, no obstacles in law, but we do need to encourage women. We do need incitement measures. We need to get togirls in school, e.g. , because often girls want to take a quicker route to the labor market. They don't want to sign up for long university studies, which would set them up, e.g. , for being able to apply for diplomatic posts, et cetera. We see more men, more boys interested in going touniversity posts. Women want to get in the labor market, contribute money, et cetera. We need tohave a grassroots holistic comprehensive approach to improve things across the board in all areas inorder to make sure that we have more women in male-dominated sectors going forward. And we are doing that. We are strengthening young girls, providing them with education, training, encouragingthem to break into male-dominated sectors such as logistics, perhaps more physical sectors in which men dominate, et cetera, but we are providing, e.g. , short-term training courses for young women and for girls to encourage them to perhaps consider seeking jobs and employment in thesesectors which previously for these reasons they might have felt were closed to them, logistics, transport, et cetera. And we, the Ministry for Women and Family, do provide training sessions tailored to getting more women into these male-dominated sectors. I was speaking about logistics, transport, but also IT, online, the digital sphere, et cetera. We want to see more women in thesesectors and so we are developing training programs for young women, for girls in digital tools, IT tools, equipping them with that skill set as well. This is a task that we have before us. We have begun.We will continue in order to ensure that our young women, our girls have the skill set that they need, that we nurture female leadership so that there is nothing that prevents women from coming forward for applying to posts including decision-making posts, et cetera, and to have more women involved,which is what we want. Now, on the question about nationality, I think I will turn things over to my colleague to answer in more depth. In Djibouti, it is my understanding that either parent can transmit nationality. The question that was asked was, I think, about instances of having a foreign fatherand in such instances can the mother, the Djiboutian mother, transmit her nationality? Legally speaking, that is not prohibited at all. She can in law. It is authorized. There is no ban on it. But you underscored the point that you are receiving reports that it doesn't happen as often as it should. Perhapspeople are unaware of that right. So there is work to be done when it comes to ensuring access to nationality. On our healthcare system, our healthcare structure, 75% of births take place in hospitals,medical facilities with an obligatory birth registration. There is a birth certificate which is attributed to each child. And there is a month to have that birth registered or recorded. There is amonth period from the birth of the child for that registration. Again, the law is there. But, again, there is work that needs to be done in order to ensure that the law is enacted. It is a technical question. How do we make sure that births are actually registered, recorded, that people have access to their identity documents, et cetera? I'll hand things over here to my colleague to answer. Thankyou very much, Your Excellency. This question about nationality, if I can circle back to that 1st , I hear it crop up time and again. It is something that people are very interested in. Just to make it clear, there has been changes in Djibouti's nationality code. I want to make you aware ofthat. As of 1977, all nationals of Djibouti could enjoy Djiboutian nationality irrespective of sex,irrespective of gender. In 1981, an initial text was promulgated reviewing and revising the 1977 textwhich recognized or conferred citizenship upon all nationals of French overseas territorieswho could have access to Djiboutian nationality without distinction. Again, including no gender distinction. So our nationality law enjoys full equality. It is nondiscriminatory. The nationalitycode was reviewed in 2004 to specify therein that a Djiboutian mother could transmit her nationality to her children even if the child was born to a father unknown. In the 2004 revision of the nationalitycode, the mother even as a single mother can register her child and confer nationality upon him being able to put known mother and unknown father. Even in such circumstances where you can only put an X in the column of father's name, the mother can convey her nationality or transmit same to her children.On the basis of gender equality which is to be enjoyed by children in Articles 4 and 5 of the codeof the nationality code, it is worth bearing in mind that the Republic of Duty guarantees equal rights and responsibilities when it comes to transmission of nationality to obtention of nationality and ofmaintenance of nationality including transmission of nationality to children. So there is no ambiguityin the 2004 nationality code. It is there in black and white, a mother even if the father of her child or children is unknown can transmit or convey her nationality to her children. We are one of the few countries that is working actively against statelessness. A child born in Djibouti to foreignparents has a birth certificate that allows them to have access to schooling which is obligatory until the age of 16 in Djibouti. Such a child born to foreign parents enjoys the same rights as Djiboutianchildren and can request nationality upon obtaining their age of majority and can easily obtain that nationality having been born in Djibouti upon submission of that request. We are also tacklingstatelessness in order to ensure that children born to Djiboutian mother do not also get caught up or endup stateless. Thank you very much. I think we are at the end of this morning meeting. We will continue with the answers and follow-up questions on these articles and this afternoon we will continue withthe agenda item 4 as a whole and we will promptly reconvene at 3:00 p.m. So the meeting is adjourned.Thank you. For the NGO site event on Central African Republic you received the online link from Jamila and this briefing will be online only because there will be interpretation from French to English availableonly online and I will also connect online to this meeting. You can still use the NGO briefing room but I will not be there. Thank you. And it is from 1:45 to 2:45."}
{"title": "", "text": "Excellencies, Distinguished Colleagues, I would like to warmly welcome you to the 1st intersessional meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementationof the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. I'm very pleased to see you numerous in this room today. I hope that you are starting, you have started this year full of enthusiasm andreadiness to work. Your work for the promotion and the protection of the rights of victims of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia is more important than ever. Allow me to startby reminding that the Human Rights Council Resolution A/HRC/RES/52/37 which renewed the mandate of the WorkingGroup last year decided that the Chair of the Working Group may call for intersessional consultations if needed to further enhance the elaboration of the draft United Nations declaration on thepromotion and full respect for the human rights of people of African descent. During the 2nd part of our last session which took place from 20th to 24th November last year, we made substantiveadvancements in our 1st reading of the document entitled Chairperson's Document Compiling Existing Human Rights Language on Issues Pertaining to the Draft United Nations Declaration on the Respect, Protection and Fulfillment of the Human Rights of People of African Descent. Duringthis week, during that week we affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights must be treated ina fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis. We also expressed our determination to promote multilateralism. We called for solidarity and closer collaborationwithin and between states in the fight against all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance including against people of African descent. We expressed our appreciationto the agenda towards transformative change for racial justice of High Commissioner for Human Rights which encourages states to ensure that the voices of Africans, of people of Africandescent and of those who stand up against racism are heard and to acknowledge and confront legacies of the past. We also emphasized that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusionand economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practiceswhich in turn generate more poverty among others. Colleagues, despite these important advancements, we still have an important way to go to finalize our 1st reading of the document. Also GeneralAssembly draft resolution A/C/3/78L/60/REV1 adopted last November requested our intergovernmentalworking group to present a status report on the elaboration of the draft declaration to be considered by the General Assembly at its 79th session which will take place in Novemberthis year. In order to fulfill this request, I have taken the decision to call for this intercessional meeting. I would like to inform you that we have received many expressions of interest fromdifferent stakeholders, particularly from people of African descent who would like to contribute with the draft declaration. I think it is extremely important for the legitimacy of this processto listen to the concerns of people of African descent themselves. Unfortunately, many of them do not have the resources to come to Geneva even today. In order to allow a broad participationin this process, I would like to suggest that we send a call for input to civil society and other stakeholders as UN bodies and agencies. The inputs received could be posted on the OCHRwebpage for your consideration. While the participation of the civil society is essential, allow meto recall also to recall as I did during last session that this is an intergovernmental process and contributions received should have the backing of at least one Member States in order to be includedin the text. We have been doing it systematically in our last session. This brings me to the closingof my remarks. I would like now to give you the floor and get your feedback on the proposalthat I have just presented to you. I thank you very much. Thank you. I see Pastor Morillo requestingfor the floor for maybe new members it would be good also to introduce yourself. We may havesome new representative of the Member States. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen. First of all, I would like on behalf of the permanentforum on people of African descent I want to express my thanks to the intergovernmental group and to yourself, Madam Chair, for your leadership as we move towards this declaration. I wouldlike to stress that great efforts have been put in. We have come a long way thus far. The interestand the keenness of states to move forward towards a declaration, international declaration on the protection and full respect to the human rights of people of African descent is undoubtedly couldundoubtedly be a very important milestone towards recognizing justice and development of people of African descent. I would like to take this opportunity just to echo what you said regardingthe importance of having contributions from people of African descent themselves in this process. The permanent forum already has or is the embodiment of broad consultations thathave taken place. States have a fabric of alliances between states have been established. And we have made progress with other partners in at the end of last year in Dayton there was a meetingbetween the member of the permanent forum and a coalition. Declarations were consultations were held with regards to the possibility of declaration and their contribution have been made to the possibility there was also the Inter-American Commission and permanent forumhave held consultations twice, two consultations, one in person, that was in Santiago de Chile that was last year and another that recently ended that was held virtually that was focusedon the countries and the CARICOM community specifically that took place just a week ago. Now in March Harvard University law faculty in association with the permanent forum on people of Africandescent and other stakeholders will be holding in Harvard consultations specifically referring to the draft declaration. So we are on our way, we are moving forward, we are trying to expandthe whole process of consultations. We are trying to generate ever more interest. That's what our goal is. We have certain thoughts ad hoc and substantial that they will be makingthroughout this process. The forum has also taken very much note that the contributions to the, that were echoed within this group and starting and which can be found on the web pageshould be, will hopefully be supported by states so that we will be making all the necessary coordination and that's all I have for now. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you.I see a representative of NGO requesting for the floor in the room. You have the floor. Thank you very much. I represent the International Youth and Student Movement for the United Nationsand the World Against Racism Network and I would like to recollect that in the previous sessionsat least a year and so on ago it was so that proposals from civil society and experts, theywere actually noted down on the screen like any other proposal and they were discussed in case there would be a state which is ready to consider it for inclusion but the importancewas that, of course, it cannot be considered by any state if it is not put up in writing like it was normally in this Intergovernmental Working Group before. I thank you. That wouldbe very helpful I think for all. Thank you. I see the representative of Brazil requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Good morning to everybody. Good morning, Madam Chair. I haven't prepared a full statement for this occasion. I just want to take the floor to 1st of allthank you and to thank and also congratulate for all the work that you have been leading. I think we appreciate your leadership and all the support from the Secretariat to promote andto organize this meeting. We know that this is an extra effort that we are doing these days this week. So thank you very much for that. I think we will have a great opportunity toadvance our text and considering the proposal of having the text or the information or inputsmade by civil society I think it is quite important. I just would maybe suggest that rather than being published immediately in our website that could circulate to mostly circulate toall Delegations because if you are retaining the nature of this intergovernmental Working Group I think it is important that the Delegations take the possibility to know in previous whatis going to be said or published because otherwise we are going to have a confusion what would be from the Delegations, what would be from the states, what would be real proposals or just comments on that. We are just in this exercise of negotiation. So all the inputs I believeit is important are essential and welcome. But in order to preserve the intergovernmental nature of this group I believe the Secretariat could circulate every information with full informationso if any Delegation, state want to go deeper in this consultation with the NGOs, civil society representatives or even the permanent forum which definitely welcome would be important forus to have the full references and contact and play together in parallel. That would be mysuggestion to this proposal. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. I would like to thank all the participantswho intervened and gave feedback on the proposal that I just presented and two things we can agree that we will circulate all the inputs that will be provided by the civil society organizationsand yes and we will do only that instead of putting the inputs on the website so that it is receivedby the Member States and considered for the discussions that will be held during the intergovernmental Working Group meeting. Second on I think it is rather a practical suggestion that was donethat inputs from civil society organization be put on the screen. I think there is when the input is presented in the room I think Member States representative are listening to the proposal.We all the time give enough time to make sure that the contribution is well understood and we take enough time to ask to Member States representative if they support or not. We can even give the opportunityto the representative of the NGO or civil society organization to repeat the contribution so that we make sure that it is well understood and taken into consideration and could be taken into considerationby the Member States. You have seen that the work of putting down on the screen is also an additionaltask. I'm just helping the Secretariat to just put something that would be agreed upon and contributed by Member States. But please NGO representative don't feel that we are not taking into considerationyour inputs. We will give it enough time. We will give you enough time to repeat your suggestion and make sure that it is supported by Member States in the room. If you feel that we are not given this opportunityplease get back to me. I will correct and review the methodology. If you allow as I'm not seeing any other requests for the floor, I would like to ask the Secretariat to put on the screen, I think we wereon Article number 4, page number 14 if I'm not mistaken. This is where, this is the point we hadreached last November. We give the time to have the text on the screen and to the participants to lookat it and I will be waiting for your feedback. Thank you. Yes. If you recall the methodology and when Ilook to the paragraph number 1 of Article number 4 it seems we had already discussed it and you canhave it get on the screen the inputs that we received from different Member States. I think we had also moved to paragraph number 2. Maybe we had only touched the introductory sentence but if you allowI will read the paragraph number 2 as a whole and then request for your feedback. Yes, I see an NGO requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Thank you very much. In the original background paper, the paperthat was discussed at the 1st session on the declaration back in October 2022, we had the word,the term \"afrophobia\" appeared 18 times in that preparatory document that was included also what was in the footnotes but it was in a substantial number of paragraphs and now it disappeared altogetherrather than to be bracketed as one group of states objected while the majority supported and then itwas raised again at the October negotiation sorry, the November negotiation session last year and thenit was put back in the paragraphs which were considered there. Of course bracketed because there was one group of states who did not agree while the majority was in agreement with putting it backbut it was also I believe agreed it was suggested by several states that in the document to be negotiated it would be reintroduced as it was originally there so that it should appear in the document that we arenegotiating exactly as it was in the document that was taken note of at the 2022 session and which isbasically what we have in front of us. It is the 2022 document with what was amended and agreed inthe 1st part of it, that's the preamble and a few paragraphs. So if that is agreed as the procedure that it is put back for discussion and consideration as was discussed and agreed at the November session.Thank you. I see the Distinguished Representative of Brazil requesting for the floor. You have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. Just previously actually in the 1st paragraph I think there was a suggestion madeby Venezuela and Costa Rica both online and offline. I just want to add our voice to this considerationif it is not the case to simply add in there related to forms of intolerance both online and offline. I would prefer to add our voice there unless Costa Rica and Venezuela already have some text to be mentionedthere. Thank you. Yes, I think the Secretariat would put Brazil as an additional Member State thatis supporting in addition to Costa Rica and Venezuela. I would like to give the floor to the representative of United States. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'll addmy thanks to that of Brazil for your work and for the work of the Secretariat to advance this important declaration. On this paragraph as you mentioned sort of the 2nd part of it, number 2, for B overalllooks fine. We would request to strike the word prevent at the beginning because the focus is on combating and eliminating racism where it exists. Prevent gets into areas of freedom of expression that can be very problematic. We would request to strike just that one word there and then under Ca bit of a rewording since there is not a right to protection from violence but there is certainly more effective ways of wording this paragraph. We would propose the following: To make efforts asopposed to ensure and then for the 2nd part and for the 2nd part would be to replace what's currentlythe that women and girls enjoy the full protection and guarantees against that would be replaced with to protect women and girls from all forms of violence and discrimination. So it's about state effortsto protect women as opposed to guaranteeing any sort of freedom from violence which is not a conceptthat we cannot really commit to. So it would be striking through the word against. Just the wordfrom just to clarify, there is no need to add of African descent. It's just women and girls. Well,was African descent in there originally? The version I'm looking at does not have African descent. Maybeit's an older version. Either way it's fine. Of African descent can stay. Apologies. And ending on the wordfrom. Thank you. Is it reflected? It is all reflected? Your inputs are all reflected on the screen? Soinstead of the word that it would be from. Protecting them from all forms of violence and discrimination.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United Kingdom.Thank you, Madam Chair and good morning, everybody. In 2A, I don't think this is going to be a surprise to anybody in this forum and unfortunately as we have expressed this position previously in the HumanRights Council and other forums we can't agree with the assertion made in this paragraph specifically to correct and regress even if the language is somehow caveated. For us it is too broad and itdoesn't really determine who would be responsible for making any sort of relevant assessment of causal legacy and impact. We are happy to look at other formulations of language but it is a strong steerthat I have received from our ministers that we would seek deletion of 2A in the 1st instance. Thanks.Thank you. For clarity purposes, can we agree to delete adopted by IGWG because this is coming fromI think the previous version of the document that we have shared so that we don't get confused? Yes?Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela.Thank you, Madam. Given this is the 1st time we have taken the floor, we would like to congratulate your new leadership of this intercessional group. We hope we will be able to make progress on the textat least conclude the 1st reading. I wanted to make a clarification because I was just seeing that as we say in my country, we are going one step forward, two steps back. We had some text that wasadopted already and we wouldn't be able to support the amendments or the deletion of A there. Nor can we support the proposal in B which deletes prevention. We are talking about prevention of racism and thatis absolutely fundamental, adopting measures to raise awareness among the population, same under C as well. It talks very vaguely about taking efforts, making efforts to reaffirm states' commitmentsthrough national measures of implementation. It doesn't matter how strong or weak those efforts are, but it needs to talk about this also needs to be legislative measures referred to here so thatthere is legal protection space for victims of racial discrimination. So legislative measures as well. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to request the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela that we gosystematically and make sure that we are reflecting his inputs to the screen. I think your point is welltaken for 2A. For 2B, Venezuela Delegation would like to keep to prevent as it is being reflected. Didwe get any inputs, a 3rd input? Distinguished Representative of Venezuela, did we get? Yes.On subparagraph C, there has been new drafting proposed and we just wanted to clarify that this C that we have here was already adopted a few moments ago by the Working Group. I'm confused as to whywe are making further changes because what was in brackets was already adopted by the Working Group.So we would prefer the 1st drafting that we had of C. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to clarifythat we are still doing the 1st reading of this paragraph. I would like to apologize. Maybe there was some confusion with what we have between the brackets saying that the IGWG adopted it, but whatis already adopted is highlighted in green in the document that we received. If we still have it not highlighted in green, this is not yet adopted. I would like to clarify this and really request thatwe review this paragraph as a paragraph that was not yet adopted during last session. We give some time to the Secretariat to reflect the inputs and then we will move to the Distinguished Representativeof Brazil. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the floor. One 2nd . I think the Secretariat is stillreflecting the inputs from the Delegation of Venezuela. Thank you. Brazil, you have the floor.Thank you. First of all, Brazil does not support the deletion of the 2A. We think it is absolutelyimportant to keep this, to retain this language there. I think it is no vague or too generic at all. It is actually something that will be built upon during the text. So this is absolutely necessary to keepthis text there. For the 2B, I appreciate the United States' proposal. Nonetheless, I think we are exactlyin this effort to be proactive and to being creative and not creative in a nonsense way but really being proactive to this effort on the fulfillment of the human rights of African descendants. So preventionis something quite important. So we would prefer to keep that. Considering the last part, nonetheless,we are flexible to the proposal. I'm going to say something, but I know I can be really, I mean,overruled. But I would even consider striking out the number C and if we decide that, the letter C,I would just make the possibility if it gets complicated for us to reach an agreement for this letter, I would prefer to delete that. And my position goes in line what it is stated in Article 15of this draft. We have two, we have three paragraphs that tackles this important issue. It is already there and it is really well written. I can read that to you. It is the 15/5. So we have a good languagethere. It says state, so it is 15.5. States shall adopt all necessary measures to address specifically to policies and programs racism and racially motivated violence against women and girls of African descentand to increase cooperation, policy response and effective implementation of national legislation of their obligations and the relevant international instruments and other protective and preventive measures aimed at the elimination of all forms of racially motivated discrimination and violence againstwomen and girls that would be for that reason if it gets complicated. We are tackling the issue on violenceon 2B and that could be an alternative. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to therepresentative of the state of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. In the beginning we echo Venezuela inkeeping paragraph 2A and the state of Palestine does not support deleting it and we are in favor to referto colonialism in the text. The 2nd point in paragraph 2, we are with keeping shall not should.Slowly, slowly. I think we are done with point 2A. Then we move to point 2B. Speak slowly so that we can reflect your inputs on the screen. Madam Chair, but before moving to 2B, 2 itself, we are keeping shallbecause it is the rules to prevent discrimination. So shall legally is more powerful than should and takenecessary also not only appropriate, necessary not only the appropriate because there is not discretionary power to make what appropriate and not appropriate to prevent discrimination. We echo Venezuela and Brazilin paragraph B that to keep prevent because prevention is better than the cure and it is quite importantto prevent racism. And on paragraph C. Please come back to your input to paragraph B. Okay. To keep it preventto prevent. Okay. And I explained why and Madam Chair, in paragraph C, to keep, to ensure not to make effortsto ensure. We echo Venezuela on that. And I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of Colombia. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam. Let me take this opportunity to commend you and thank you for all of the work you have done heading this Working Group, this Intergovernmental Working Group.I would like to echo what has been said by Distinguished Colleagues from Venezuela, Brazil, Palestine and we believe it is particularly relevantto keep 2A. We support keeping 2A. We also support the proposal from the Delegation of State of Palestineto keep shall instead of should. That's in 2A and then A. Then B, as has already been said in the room, prevention is vital. We believethat's absolutely crucial. So we support keeping prevent. Then in C, we also support keeping to ensure. Thank you, Madam. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Egypt. You have the floor. Thank you so much, Madam Chair and thank you for your outstanding workchairing this Intergovernmental Working Group. I echo suggestions made by my colleagues who spoke before me on Article 2A. We think for this declaration it is quite importantto be discussing measures to correct and redress impacts of colonialism. In Article 2B, I also echo the proposals made by my colleagues to keep prevent. Thechapeau of this Article is already speaking of states taking appropriate measures. So taking appropriate measures towards prevention is vital for combatingracism, including what my colleague from Venezuela spoke of legal preventive measures as well. And for Article 2C, I also echo keeping ensuring the protection of women andgirls. Thank you. Thank you, Egypt. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would join my voice to those of colleagues who have congratulated you and acknowledged the excellent work that you have done as Chair of the IGWG in terms of moving forward with adoption of this document. I should also like to join my voice to the proposals made by various colleaguesin 2, we support the proposal from the State of Palestine to keep shall. We also support the amendment to appropriate, so all necessary. We prefer all necessary. 2A, we propose keeping the paragraph as was originally drafted and alsobearing in mind the comment made by our colleague from the UK in the preambular paragraphs in various paragraphs, it is clearly established regarding the negotiations from last year what the consequences were. So we don't need somebody to create a committee or create a mechanism to say what the impacts are and what the consequences of colonialism and enslavement are because in thepreambular part it is very clear what the consequences are not only for people of African descent but also for very many Developing Countries who were victims of these horrible practices. On B, we also support the proposal of keeping to prevent because we agree with the criteria included here about the importance not only of thecombating and eliminating the problem but also preventing and avoiding its resurgence. Then on C, we also support the proposal made by Venezuela to keep to ensure and generally speaking, and this is something that we voiced throughout the negotiations on this text, any proposal we don't think it is relevant to see proposals endeavor toweaken the character of the document or attempt to weaken states' responsibility to ensuring the fight against any forms of discrimination or racism. Thank you. Thank you, Cuba. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to add my voice to many of my colleagues in the discussions on theasking for keeping Paragraph 2A. It's very important Paragraph. It should stay. And it's just this Paragraph represents the justice that we are looking for in the whole ideathat we are working on. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the representative of Iran. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning, colleagues. I would liketo start by thanking you, Madam Chair, for all your valuable efforts. With regard to the Paragraph 2A, we believe that this Paragraph is very important for racial justice and the elements which existedin this Paragraph are so important if we would like to forward, to work racial, real racial justice. With regard to the Paragraph B, we think that we keep to prevent and I add my voiceto my other colleagues to keep it. For Paragraph C, we are against the diluting this Paragraphwith adding language proposed by some Delegations to make so we support the text as it was drafted. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative ofSouth Africa. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Since I'm speaking for the 1st time, I would like to congratulate you on assuming your role as the Chair of this process. I wouldlike to support on behalf of my Delegation the retention in support of other Delegations that spoke before me, the retention of Paragraph 2A in its original form and then on 2B, we wouldlike to retain the formulation that includes prevent and then on 2C, I would join other Delegations that support the language that talks about ensuring instead of making effort. That's our take. Thankyou, Chair. Thank you, South Africa. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the European Union. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Since this is alsothe 1st time I'm taking the floor, I just wanted to say that we look forward to continue the work in this Working Group under your able leadership and to assure you that you will be able to continueto count on our constructive engagement as it was the case in October 22 and November 23. With regard to Article 4, Paragraph 2, the European Union has two proposals that I would like toshare. In 2A, we were thinking of replacing the term correct with the verb confront. Inour view, confronting is more holistic, is wider. It's not correct. It's more limited to like the criminal field in a sense. Confronting allows for more actions on the same topic. And in 2B,we would like to suggest after the words with the view to promoting racial equality and justice. Yes. I will wait. I'm not sure if your input is well reflected in 2A. We need to confrontthe replacing correct. Maybe it would be good to put it near. Thank you. You can move to the2nd input on Paragraph B. Thank you. Thank you, Madame Chair. In point 2B, we would liketo add after the words with the view to promoting racial equality and justice, the words for all. That's all, Madame Chair. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of Algeria. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madame Chair. Good morning,everybody. At the outset, I should like to thank you, Madame Chair, for your efforts to steerhome the work of this group. Like other colleagues, I also believe we need to keep 2A as originally drafted. This 2A is extremely important to establish justice, the justice that we are seeking. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of China. You have the floor. Thankyou, Madame Chair. This is the 1st time I have taken the floor here. Thank you, Madame, foryour efforts, the efforts that you are making. Regarding 2A, colonialism is not only a historiccrime but also represents relevant there is also relevant consequences in our lives today. It is very significantand has vestiges of it today. We agree with the position of Venezuela and Brazil to keepto A. As regards to B, we agree with the position put forward by Brazil, Venezuela and others, namelyto keep, to prevent. Prevention is far more important than the measures that are subsequently adopted.Thank you, Madame Chair. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representativeof Nigeria. You have the floor. Thank you, Madame Chair, for giving me the floor. Since this is also my 1st time I have taken the floor, I would just like to say thank you for the job done so far. Wejust want to join our voices with Venezuela and our colleagues on Article 3, Paragraph 2A, to retain Paragraph 2A. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative ofParaguay. Thank you. As it is the 1st time I have taken the floor, I want to thank you, congratulateyou for all your work here. For 1, Para 4.1, I want to support Costa Rica and Venezuela on having areference to online and offline discrimination. In 2, we would prefer keeping shall. 2A, prefer keepingthe paragraph as is. And in 2B, we would prefer to keep prevent. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Mexico. Thank you very much, Madame Chair. Goodmorning to everybody. Just express some preferences regarding text. So in 4, Article 4.1, we supportadding online and offline in the chapeau of Article 2. We prefer keeping shall since in those terms, alsofor the reference, that's the terminology used in the UN declaration on Indigenous Peoples. So justfor the that shall is used in all its articles. It doesn't use should. But also for the sake of knowledgeand reference to the declarations that exist about other groups of individuals, you also have the rights of ethnic, linguistic declarations there. They use both formulations actually, shall and should. It'sjust that certain differences between certain articles seems that should is used more when it's referring to actions of cooperation. But shall is used more when establishing in a strict sense all measuresthat need to be taken to protect rights of persons. So therefore, I think in this case, the shall wouldbe more appropriate. Then 2B, we prefer prevent. I think it's necessary to refer in these sectionsto prevent problems emerging. And in C, for us, it's important to maintain strong language when it comesto preventing discrimination against women and girls. But we also agree with the position of Brazil to try and sort of streamline the text a bit. And we agree, therefore, with the clarification that aspects ofthis paragraph are already reflected in current Article 15. So perhaps we should explore the possibility of keeping a strong para 15 for prevention of violence eliminating discrimination against women and girlsand consider again streamlining the text as a whole. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Representative of Ecuador. Good morning. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for givingme the floor and for all your hard work in this process. I, too, would like to express our preferencesregarding Article 4 starting with 1. It's important, we think, to have a reference to online and offline.So we would like to see that. Ecuador would like to be part of that list. Then in 2, we prefer shall as Mexicosaid, his explanation, other declarations on indigenous people has that wording of shall. If I would like to express our support for the proposal, I can't remember exactly who it was, but to change appropriatewith all necessary measures. Then in 2, in then 2A, there again, we kindly ask you to keep the keep it asis. B, then in little B, there again, we prefer keeping prevent. In C, like others, it's very importantthe language on women and girls. Nevertheless, we do agree with what was said by Brazil. I think that'sa good solution that they offer in any case because that language is in Article 15.5 and perhaps we couldeven take certain elements that we consider are still missing from the other Article. So that would be all for now. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like to I will come back to the proposal by Brazilto consider replacing Paragraph C by what is in Article number 15, but let's 1st give the floorto the Delegates that would like to give input to this paragraph. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Panama. Thank you, Madam Chair. Like previous speakers, I want totake the opportunity to thank you for summoning this round of consultations today to keep moving forwardour discussions on crafting this important instrument on the Article. For Paragraph 1, we support a vastnumber of Delegations who prefer keeping online and offline. Then in 2, we support keeping shall notjust based on what was said by our colleagues with respect to other declarations, but also becauseit's legally correct. Now, although the documents we are discussing is more a document of soft law,we can't forget the fact that many of the provisions included here are legally binding obligations at the same time. So when we refer to combating discrimination, that is a legally bindingobligation. So that's why we would prefer keeping shall. Then we agree with those states who proposedreplacing appropriate with all. So we would refer to all necessary measures. Then in A, we agree withthe importance of keeping the reference to legacy and impact of colonialism and enslavement. We see in many reports, many experts have said that this is a crucial theme and that part of structuraldiscrimination, institutional discrimination and systemic racism suffered by people of African descentspecifically stems from the legacy of colonialism and enslavement and it's part of what we have been fighting against over the last decade regarding the importance of recognizing and ensuring justice. Butif we can't recognize the root causes, it's going to be very difficult for those persons to be able to achieve any kind of racial justice. On Para B, we prefer keep prevent because we shouldn't just bereactive. We must act upstream tackling the root causes both of discriminations and other forms ofrated intolerance. And on Para C, we prefer if we are going to keep that Para, then in this article,then we should keep ensure although we are flexible as per what was said by Brazil. So if there is some way of helping to streamline the text, indeed strengthen it in other provisions, then we coulddo that also. So we are flexible. But if the room, if we want to keep the paragraph, if we are going to keep the paragraph, then we would prefer the word ensure. Thank you. Thank you, Panama. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the State of Palestine.Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted also to mention that we echo Costa Rica and Venezuela in keepingonline and offline and other states as well in Paragraph 1. And in Paragraph 2A, State of Palestine is with keeping the word correct, not confront because correct is more powerful. Correct meansaddressing the issue and accepting making reparations and correct historical mistakes of colonialism. So it is not for only current colonialism, also the mistakes of the history of colonialism. So it shouldstay correct above Paragraph, excuse me, Madam Chair, Article 2, Paragraph A, to keep correct, notconfront or at least correct and confront. But correct should stay as the beginning. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to lend my support to Brazil's proposal of deleting Subsection C.I think wherever we find language that is overlapping in the Articles, we should be going for language that is already coming from sort of consensual sources to the degree possible and because this is already referred to quite fulsomely under 15.5, I actually propose to put something at the end ofthis paragraph that says sort of delete and then list the countries that or delete in favor of Article 15.5 and then list the countries that have lent their support including USA, Brazil and I think about three others. So there is a record of that support for deletion in favor of another existing Article. Thankyou. Thank you. Do you allow that let's then address 1st this one. Can we what do we have Member Statesthat are in agreement that we in addition to Brazil and the Member States that have expressed this, do wehave Member States that are against that we would replace Paragraph C by the content of what we havein Paragraph considering the content in the Paragraph in the Article number 15? Yes. I see and let's just focus on this one and then we will go to finalize the other paragraphs after. I see the DistinguishedRepresentative of Brazil requesting for the floor. Indeed actually I appreciate very much for the clarification already expressed by the Distinguished Delegate from the United States. My proposal wasreally to delete the C. I would be flexible. I would prefer the original text but rather I would deletethe number C because we are retaining the Article 15.5 and I'm not taking that paragraph up to 4. That'smy proposal and I understand Mexico and Ecuador called me on this matter as much as the United States just to make that clear. Thank you. Yes. Now that the Distinguished Representative of Brazil has clarifiedthe proposal, do we have any other Member States that would have a different point of view or we move withdeleting Paragraph C and consider its content later when we will be analyzing the Article number 15?Yes. I would like to ask the Secretariat as I do not see any other Delegation requesting for the floorthat we delete the Paragraph number C and request the Distinguished Representative to take note that we will make sure that the intention of this paragraph will be addressed in Article number 15.And then let's continue if there are other Delegations that would like to give inputs to theremaining paragraphs. I see the Distinguished Representative of Bolivia, you have the floor.Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just to join others in thanking you and congratulating you for your efforts during this important process very quickly, Bolivia would like to make some comments and proposalsregarding Article 4, 4.2. We would support the proposal to keep shall instead of should and allnecessary. We would prefer that. In A to A, keep the original, keeping to correct. And in B, we supportkeeping prevent. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to Pastor Maria from the permanentforum. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I want to extend to you my gratitude to all Delegations whohave stressed the special importance of paragraph 2, especially 2A of the version under discussion. Ijust want to say that, yes, we are tackling a declaration, international declaration on people of African descent. Therefore, it is not a binding instrument. Therefore, I would like to echo whatwas said by the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, when he said in one of his reportsthat the big challenge when it comes to reparations is the lack of political will and moral ethics by certain states in terms of taking the next step forward. Therefore, since this is a declaration andnot a legally binding instrument, then I want to stress that this text before us is the manifestation of the political will and of the moral courage of those who consider it. So that those countries whobelieve that no damage has been inflicted as a result of the colonialism or enslavement or who don't have the moral courage or the political will to take the next step forward, they can be rest assured thatthis text can evolve without pointing the finger at them and that the permanent forum or people of Africandescent have that feeling in this issue. Secondly, Madame Chair, we would like to stress that in the declaration before us there are at least two big dimensions that must be remembered as we developit. First of all, as said by the Distinguished Delegation of Panama, it is the element related tothe prolongation of the consequences of the transatlantic trade and enslavement, everything that's reflected within the idea of systemic racism that affects people of African descent. That's onequestion. The 2nd element is to do with perhaps this is an element that should be considered by Delegations, maybe it's not been sufficiently distilled in this conversation but it's to do withthe right of people of African descent to be free, to protect, preserve values with rights that areintrinsic to people of African descent for them to have a space to exercise that right. In other words, their ethnicity, their values and practice that do with other dimensions that this group has addressedbut where there's not been an understanding. I do put it for your consideration because otherwiseit won't otherwise be sufficiently clear on those matters. If we're not sufficiently clear, then maybe we won't be able to make progress. So there are issues that track back to racism and racial discrimination against people of African descent, systemic racism and there's another dimensionto do with the values, the practice of persons of African people, the culture, the singularity of people of African descent and here that declaration concludes the possibility of tackling those kindsof questions and I stress, Madam Chair, that we need to bear in mind the fact that there are two dimensions here, therefore, as we deliberate. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Representative of Panama. Thank you, Madam Chair. Apologies fortaking the floor again in this group of paragraphs but I was reviewing having a look through and in paragraph 2, our comment wasn't duly reflected since the whole argument that we put forward were infavor of keeping the word \"shall\" and I was one of the countries and we've been put in the wrong group, so we want \"shall.\" So I just wanted to make sure that what we said earlier was properly reflected.Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the representative of NGO in the room. Microphonefor the speaker, please. Hello? Hello? Is it on? Okay. Yes. I would like to recollect the agreement fromthe October session once again where the term \"afrophobia\" which was in the original negotiationdocument from the Chair was restored in three, four or five paragraphs that were agreed, well, with bracketingof course from various states and then it was agreed to restore it in the negotiation document for this coming session so that it would appear as it appeared in the original Chair's document from the 2022session. So one such example is this paragraph 4 and the 1st part of it where \"afrophobia\" should berestored there in the 1st part of it where there is an enumeration of racism, xenophobia, afrophobia,et cetera. So \"afrophobia\" should be put back there whether it is agreed or not. It will probably be the same as it was in the October 2023 negotiation session that the different views will be reflectedbut it should be there as this is what was basically agreed that it would be restored everywhere where it was in the original paragraphs, in the original Chair's document while it was taken out withoutthe agreement in what was then reported to the Council. So I would like to ask for that. Secondly,what I think is very important is this paragraph that is the A1 there. It is so tremendously important.It is even a centrality of this declaration to correct the legacies and impacts of colonialism andenslavement. I do believe that if there would have been a larger number of civil society representatives here from those who are in favor of the full and effective implementation of the DDPA, there wouldhave been anonymous support for the proposals made by the state of Palestine here and for the issue of correction of the legacies to be given high priority. Maybe even corrected and confronted but surelycorrected and that this be even with high priority. It could even be strengthened, this paragraph. I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Mexico.Thank you, once again, for giving me the floor. I would like to point out that we listened with great interest to the comments made by the representative, the member of the permanent forum. Those commentsseemed very timely. We would just like to suggest similar to what Brazil said earlier, that it wouldbe very useful for Delegations to have proposals, textual proposals from the forum, civil society specifically, ahead of time, ahead of the meeting in which we discuss the negotiating text. That way,our Delegations can have more time to properly digest those proposals and come to the room andbetter prepared on what we are going to in terms of what every respective Delegation can support. Thank you. Thank you. We would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the European Union.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would just like to come back to the issue of the term \"Afrophobia\" because I agree that we have extensively discussed this in this group, both in October 2022 and inNovember 2023. We went quite far altogether in our research. The reason that the term \"Afrophobia\" popped up 18 times in the initial draft is because in the initial draft there was a choice to maketo open the agreed language of the DDPA that has as an expression racism, racial intolerance,racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance which is the term of the DDPA that we have been using over the past 20 years very consistently. The question was indeed should wereopen that, revisit this and add the word \"Afrophobia.\" And after October 2022, there was a decision taken that at this point the term \"Afrophobia\" is not yet recognized in international law. And forthat reason, the 2nd draft did not have the term anymore. So I am bringing this to the table becauseI would kindly like to disagree with the statement that there was agreement on having that term in the text. There is at this point the decision was taken not to have it. And that is why there is such a bigchange between the 1st and the 2nd document. And I remember that we discussed here, not in this room, in the other room, that at this point you can't find it in the charter, in the UDHR, in the VDPA,in the ICERT, in the DDPA. We looked up the resolutions on the international decade on the agenda towards transformative change for racial justice and equality. We looked up the mandate of the Working Group onPeople of African Descent, Resolution 9/14. And so this was the outcome. So I would kindly requestthat at this point we leave the text as it is and maybe move forward. Yes, I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba. Thank you. First, a technical question. If it's possible to make the screen, the text on the screen a bit bigger because asked further back, it's hardto work and read. And as the screen is a bit on the dark side, it makes, yeah, thank you. That's good.Secondly, generally speaking, we have been following the debates on the term \"Afrophobia,\" and while weare aware that there is no consensus on the term, we do know that it is a request from groups of persons of African descent who have participated in previous fora that have been held. Therefore, I would liketo say without wanting to reopen a debate, I think it would be fair to reflect in the document in brackets that there is a proposal regarding continuing debates on the inclusion of that term,just as there have been proposals in brackets elsewhere in the preamble and in the 1st few paragraphs of the declaration. Therefore, I would like it if we could reflect on the screen inparallel 1, the proposal made by civil society to take the term \"Afrophobia\" and put it in brackets, because as I said, we are clear that obviously there is no consensus on that term, but we dothink that it is reasonable to not eliminate it, not just not forget it, but rather to include it in such a way that we can identify the fact that there is still a debate ongoing and that it needs to becontinued, the debate on that issue, because even though it is not in the Durban Declaration, I alsorecall that in November in our negotiations, whether that document would be a copy of Durban or is itgoing to be a step further than what was approved in Durban 20 years ago? I think there was a spirit in the room, the feeling was that, yes, we need to take everything we could find from international law andpreviously adopted documents and the idea is to try and make progress, try and evolve further, try and take things the next step. So thank you. Thank you, Cuba. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of South Africa. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, I'm new in this process, I'm participating in this kind of a forum for the 1st time, but I have gone through the text and I knowthat with regards to the language related to Afrophobia, South Africa previously supported the inclusion of this phrase, but as one participant mentioned that it no longer appears in the currenttext. We have listened to all the views expressed here, but the feeling or the position of my Delegation is that maybe we should reintroduce the language and allow, as mentioned by Mexico, the NGOsand other participants to introduce specific language related to this with a view to strengthen the language and see how it can add value to the entire paragraph. We do note that it may not necessarilybe a great language, but I like the remarks made by the last speaker, that we need to evolve. There arenew developments in life, there are new phenomena, so we can't be bound by the agreed language and not open up to new tendencies. So my Delegation's view is that for now maybe we should consider retainingthis while we explore best ways to strengthen the language so that we can convince other Delegations in the room to support and mobilize and rally behind us. Thank you, Chair. I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. And having participated in many of these discussions already, I think it is important to recall that there was adiscussion of this and the results of that discussion was to remove this particular term. If it is that this term is not being endorsed by Member States, then I think we need to discuss it or at least sort of have our views on it known and I think we would have to put a reservation on this term for the samereasons that the EU expressed which are it is a novel term that has not been defined and it would be introduced here sort of as a term in a established and well-established formulation. So we would haveto add a reservation to this term. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of the State of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. We echo South Africa and Cuba for keeping Afrophobia because the voice of African descent should be heard in the informal consultationsbecause they experienced the effects of racial discrimination and they know better what concepts may serve in the future to prevent racial discrimination and I thank you. Thank you. I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States. Yes, as I do not see any otherDelegation requesting for the floor, I would like to ask the Secretariat to show the paragraphs, the paragraph number 4, subparagraph by subparagraph so that Member States check if all their inputs arereflected. We have 4.1 here. We move to 4.2A, 4.2B. Let's then move to next Article and I think it willbe Article number 5, delete adopted by IGWG. Article number 5 states has these titles. I think we have beendeleting the titles. Maybe we will listen to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil before we move.Thank you, Madam Chair. Just one of my concerns before we go further, I think we heard and I'm still seeingthat the text in the previous Article is not in green but we heard the floor and I tend to believe thatthough one Delegation expressed its proposal, the proposal didn't fly. So in case of 2A, for instance, or2B, we could go for green, right? Consensus is not unanimity. So the proposals made by the UK didn'tfly. And we heard the room and many of us agreed that we should keep not deleting. So that could be in green. And also in case of the B, I also understand the proposal made by the Distinguished Delegate fromthe United States didn't fly. People expressed they would prefer. I mean, there is a consensus that we should keep as it is. So I would propose that to be reflected in green. Thank you. Thankyou to the Distinguished Representative of Brazil. I think we can only put it in green after listening to the Distinguished Representative of the UK and of the USA on these two paragraphs and see if they areagreeable on retaining the paragraphs as they were before they provided their inputs. Yes, I see the Distinguished Representative of the United States. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I wouldhave no concern with putting in green starting with the word combat through the rest of the paragraphs since it was not raised for discussion. I do have instructions from Washington and I think part of this process will be we lay out what our views are and then in the next iteration of reviewing thesetexts we will go back and we will decide what sort of things we can agree on and which things we will need to sort of maintain the same position on. So I think for now we can put in green the rest of the paragraph but we will need to just keep the 1st part there as it is to reflect the conversation that washad in the room today. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Do we have can we get the Distinguished Representativeof the UK on Paragraph 2A? Thanks. I understand the desire to move quickly on this but I think it depends on sort of what process we are going with here. Like where is this being adopted? Surelythere is going to be some sort of is it going to the GA? Like when are we adopting this? I don't really understand why we would be adding an extra layer of it just seems like an extra layer of confusion to me. If you put it in green I'm still going to have to put my reservation against it. So it doesn'tmake sense for me to put it in green now. My understanding was we read through the text, we put our views forward, then we revisit after we have done that, we have done the 1st reading. So I'm justnot sure what it really adds to put it in green now. Thanks. Okay. Let me clarify again because I think it is not the 1st time that we are putting text in green. Okay. We agreed to put a text in greenwhen everybody agrees on the content of the text of the paragraph where there is no agreement. We werereflecting all the inputs and we didn't put the paragraphs that were not agreed upon in green.And I think this is the understanding that the methodology that we have been using and the way Iget the input is that for paragraph number 2A, yes, the 2A, the UK is not able to agreeto keep the paragraph as it was. Then I would suggest that we don't put it in green and we move to paragraph number 2B. The paragraph 2B, the USA is agreeable that we can keep the text as it is and notuse prevent. But at least for the 1st reading, we agree that today on 8th of February, participantswho were in the room were agreeable with the content of this text. And I think this is the methodology.And if everybody now that we are good with the inputs from the USA, I would like also to see if there is no participant who is opposing the inputs from the European Union and then we will have theparagraph 2B in green and then we keep the 2A as it is with inputs and from the UK. This is the methodology that we have been using unless I'm mistaken and I would welcome your inputs to thisone. As I do not see any country representative asking for the floor, I would like to requestthe Secretariat to highlight the paragraph 2B in green and then we don't need to show that the countriesthat have been supporting to prevent or opposing it. We will keep the text as it was. The Secretariathas just reminded me that there is a report that will be done and that the different positions that were expressed will be reflected in this report, but the text of the declaration will be keptas it is reflected on the screen. We thank the Distinguished Representative of Brazil that allowedus at least to have the paragraph highlighted in green. Then if you allow, we would move to Article5. Yes? I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Brazil. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Sorry for taking the floor so many times and thank youfor your clarification and all. I'm just revising the text and together with some of the colleagues then. I think we did that in the preambler part. If the UK still wants to keep its position and notretreat from that, I absolutely agree. That can be reflected at the text. But from my perspective,we just see that their proposal to deletion was not accepted. That's my point. Everybody else saidthat if you want to highlight that there is their concern for deletion, I absolutely agree and it's fair. But from this perspective, from what I'm seeing here, we do have a green 2A. That's my point. Andwe did that in the preambler part. Let me take just one quick 2nd . We expressed1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Maybe around the preambler part, preambler part 9 or 10 or something goingfurther, noting with appreciation the agenda towards transformative change and all this paragraph in there. And then we have there support deletion UK. You have that. But we are still in green. That's mypoint. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the European Union and then we have the United States. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And as I'm following the discussions,I have to admit that I'm a little bit concerned about the latest comment made by the colleagueof Brazil. This is the very 1st reading of a text that we want to become the new golden standard for the coming years. We have never discussed these articles before. We actually never managed to getbeyond the PPs. The PPs have been already read twice. It is good practice in multilateral negotiations during a 1st reading that you allow all colleagues in the room to put forward their instructions andthat you take stock of what are all the proposals put on the table and that you then if you feel in the room immediately that there is agreement on the paragraph, then you move indeed to putting it ingreen which is what we did in October 22 and in November 23 when all the brackets that we could take them out were done and everyone could lift his or her reservations sometimes from one day to thenext overnight, then we put it in green. We are not in a dynamic here, majority against minority. This is a 1st reading and I would really like to call upon colleagues to allow for that safe space wherewe can all report back to capital and see if we can get our capitals to move instead of being isolated immediately now in the room. This is going to be a long process. That's just how it is. ButI think the way you have shared these meetings for the past for the previous sessions has been very constructive and I would suggest that we continue along that route. Thank you, Madam Chair. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I echo what the EU colleagues said and I looked at my computer and I looked up and I saw that all of B was put in green with the original language and I need to reiterate the need to keep track ofthe diverging views in the room so that we can, as the EU colleagues said, go back to capital and discuss further. Now, I'll clarify, the only word here at issue is the word prevent and so I think for all can stay in green. Everything starting with the word combat and on can remain in green but we would needto revert to is the tracking of what views were regarding the word prevents. That's the word at issue and so that word would remain in white with the original markings of which countries supported which option. That way we can go back and reflect further and come back and discuss as opposed tonot necessarily making those decisions in the room. Thank you. Thank you. From the discussions, I wouldlike to ask the Secretariat to reflect the inputs from the USA and only highlight this, have this note ingreen and the rest of the paragraph will be in green. Yes. Yes. Then you have the EU inputs adopted.Yes. I do not see any other Delegation requesting for the floor. I would like to ask the Secretariat to move to the Article No. 5. Then it was agreed that we don't yes. I have the request for the floor. Youhave the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't want to hold up the work in any way. I just wanted topoint out three things essentially. On the debate around the expression \"Afrophobia\" which is underconsideration, the 1st thing I would do is to flag that the argument in the sense that Afrophobia isnot recognized, it is not a recognized term in international law, that doesn't seem to hinder ourpurposes because this draft declaration is seeking to lay the foundations and the basis for recognition of the rights of rights holders who historically have been marginalized. So it is really importantfor us to bear that in mind, that here we are laying foundations and there will be a series of concepts and considerations and ideas that are perhaps new. We are generating recognition of rights with thisdocument. Additionally, we will need to include some other provisions that are perhaps more modern. This declaration has already timidly brought up matters related to algorithms and so on and that doesn'tthis is a new algorithmic bias and so on. That's a new concept and it is not in international law. So we are trying to innovate as well, you know, that argument then wouldn't hold water. The 2ndthing I want to say is that the permanent forum on indigenous peoples in its 1st initial contributions to this process supported the use of this concept, echoing the requirement that the people of Africandescent from the region of Europe, this was a concept that was rather strange to the Americas. The concept of African wasn't used in the Americas and so there were views voiced to the to this extent but with aview to recognizing geographic diversity of different situations that was supported by the forum.And I'll conclude with this last comment, Madam Chair, because in any case, reflecting it in the texton the screen as some delegations have supported, this is a positive step. It promotes the idea that we will be able to focus on the issue that it will be a subject for discussion and that this will need to be done not only within states but in social movements of people of African descent because asI say, it is quite a new matter. That's everything. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you very much. I would like to ask you to take a break of 5 min . I have something urgent to handle and we'll come backwith the discussions. Thank you. If you allow, we'll continue with the text and move to article number5 of our text and maybe if the Secretariat would help us having the next article on the screen. Yes.Do we have article number 5 at the top? Yes. Then paragraph number 1 of article 5 reads: States shall fully and effectively implement the international convention on the elimination of all formsof racial discrimination and the declaration and program of action as the main international instruments and guidance for the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerancefaced by people of African descent as well as implement the program of activities for the international decade for people of African descent and consider implementing the agenda towards transformativechange for racial justice and equality presented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Input comments to this paragraph? Yes. I see the Distinguished Representative of the State of Palestine. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. The State of Palestine would suggest addingafter the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination another important international instrument that is directly related and it is the international convention on the suppressionand prevention of the crime of apartheid of 1973. It is the UN international convention that was the 1st binding international treaty which declared the crime of apartheid and racial segregation underinternational law and it is one of the key three elements, three international treaties to combat racial discrimination worldwide and for the African descent in particular and the experience in apartheidlike what happened in South Africa. So to show condolence for what happened in South Africa and history, we should keep this international treaty in the text. It is in line with the purpose of thedeclaration and I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. This is an article in which the issue of shall and shouldcomes to the fore and what we are seeing here is a mixing of various instruments that are either binding to those who have signed it or that are sort of endorsed documents or that are documents proposed bythe High Commissioner with some distinction made between some of them but not really sufficient distinction made. For example, the ICERT is a binding treaty. The DDPA international decade are notbinding and then I think appropriately sort of addresses the High Commissioner's agenda as considerimplementing. So to reflect that, we would request that the wording be adjusted to states shallfully and effectively implement and we would be adding their respective obligations under. So the textwould be bolded. Then DDPA would be moved after as well as implement the DDPA and the program of activitiesfor the national decade and in part of all of this you can also eliminate the as the main international instruments and guidance for the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and relatedintolerance. I think that section is not necessary and confuses the issue. Where do we move the DDPA to?As well as implement the declaration of program of action with the word and and then that clarifiesthat countries that have signed on to the ICERT have respective obligations to implement and thatby their nature, DDPA and the program of activities are considered separately. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Japan. Thank you, Chair. Good morning, everyone. This is my 1st time taking the floor. I thank the Chairperson for your effort to bring it to conveythis discussion and I simply agree with U.S. suggestion on this paragraph and alternatively wejust suggest change how to shoot based on the reason given by the U.S. Delegate. Thank you. Thank you.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the State of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, State of Palestine with keeping the word \"shall\" not \"should\" becausethese instruments reflect international customary law rules and it is well known in international law that it is shall legal binding instruments. And the 2nd point is the declaration of program of actionis one of the main instruments for protecting the people of African descent. So it should stay as itwas previously. And I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. It might be helpful for me to restate that part of the proposal is also to eliminate as the main international instruments and guidance foras a phrase that's all the way through faced by people of African descent as a phrase that's not necessary in this context and also as the representative just mentioned would confuse the issue. So I think byhaving this new formulation we are able to recognize that ISERT is a binding treaty with obligations for those who sign it and then there is a separate sort of standard applied to the other instruments andthen a separate standard applied for the agenda. By limiting that I think we are able to very clearly lay that out in a succinct and clear straightforward manner. Thank you. Are you proposing to deletethe whole text which is highlighted here? Precisely. So it would say state shall implement their obligationsand implement the DDPA and the program of action. So it would be eliminating this section here. Yes. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the NGO in the room. Yes. Thank you so much. I would like to refer the meeting to the program of activities of the international decade for people of African descentthat was negotiated and agreed at the intergovernmental working group adopted for transfer to the GeneralAssembly carefully negotiated in the GA and then adopted by the GA in November 2014 without a vote. Andthat states that the DDPA and the international convention for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination as the principle international instruments for the elimination of racial discriminationand xenophobia, et cetera. So the program of activities of the decade that in its 2nd paragraphhas this very clear determination that both those, the DDPA and ICED are the principle internationalinstruments for the elimination of racism, et cetera. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela. Thank you. We see the proposals made which seekto give a list of treaties and conventions on racial discrimination and it's important for this working group to take into account also that there are processes in the context of the Human Rights Councilnegotiations on complementary norms on racism as well that could be a protocol. So if it's going to be a closed list, then I think we could the other process that are also going on that are importantwhen it comes to combating racism and racial discrimination. So I would just put that to your consideration. And the same with the elimination when it comes to the main instruments, deletingmain or guidance for the elimination of racial discrimination, we don't support deleting thatbecause the main international instruments also can refer to other norms which are also important such as the decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council and other UN documents that could also serve as aguide. So by deleting this, that would rule them out. Thank you. Thank you. Can the Secretariat mentionVenezuela supporting to maintain as the main instruments? And if you allow, I didn't get wellthe suggestion of the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela on the 1st on the listing of the instruments. Is he bringing in an additional instrument or is he proposing a way of mentioningthat there are other instruments that are not reflected in this paragraph? Thank you. Yes,thank you. Besides the list of the various conventions, it's important that the Working Group consider processesunderway, negotiations on complementary norms and racism that could become a protocol. So whenthis declaration is ready, I want to gain the status of a legally binding document. And so if we're goingto have a closed list, I think we need to find some wording that would allow us to reflect, refer to other international instruments of relevance to eliminating racism. Thank you. Thank you. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Iran. Thank you, Madam Chair. Taking into account the linkages between apartheid and racial discrimination, we support the proposal made bythe State of Palestine, firstly. And secondly, with regard to the proposal of Venezuela, I supportthe voice of my colleague on working on the language. Personally, I propose that we canadd a word as one of the main international instruments and guidance. If we add the word one,I think that we are it's acceptable for us. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Representative of Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. At this point, I should say Brazilwould prefer having the text as drafted at this point. Thank you. Thank you, Brazil. We givethe floor to the Distinguished Representative of South Africa. Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving usthe floor. And Madam Chair, for us, we would like to weigh in on proposal to delete the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. And while we respect that there are some reservations when it comes toreferences to the Durban Declaration, we need to recall that this is the most comprehensiveinternational document aimed at countering racism, racial discrimination, and in all its contemporaryforms. And for us, therefore, it would seem that we would try to deny that there is this scourgeof the contemporary forms of racism without making reference to this document that also is the one that predicated the establishment of this Working Group and all activities and subsequent activities,including this negotiation process of declaration for people of African descent. Therefore, we support maintaining it. Thank you. Thank you, South Africa. We would like to give the floor to theDistinguished Representative of the State of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. We echo Venezuela in keeping the lines as one of the main international instruments and guidance for elimination ofof yeah. And Madam Chair, I guess, yeah. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of Cuba. Thank you, Madam Chair. On these paragraphs, in the 1st part of the paragraph,we would prefer to support the proposal made by the State of Palestine to keep shall and we cannot support the proposal put forward by the U.S. and Japan to include their respective obligations under.Essentially, the reason behind this is that while states are able to sign or ratify different international instruments, there are some of these international instruments like the case of the Convention on theEradication of All Forms of Racism and Racial Discrimination that because of their importance and because of the high number of ratifications, they become customary norms and they become a binding andand even for states that haven't proceeded to their ratification, another clear example isif a state hasn't ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that doesn't mean that that convention isn't binding for all. And as I say, the importance of recognizing that and of being boundby the provisions in it. So we prefer not to support this proposal and in the 1st part, implement,we would rather also have after effectively fulfill, so to refer not only to implementation but alsocompliance or fulfillment with the provisions, to fully and effectively fulfill and I think the bestword would be fulfill and implement. Thank you. On the 2nd part of the paragraph, we do not supportthe proposal to delete the Dublin Declaration and Programme of Action as being one of the main internationalinstruments. We would prefer to keep it as was proposed in the original paragraph. And on the lastpart of the paragraph, we understand the reference that these are the main instruments and thatcould be a little bit restrictive and it might leave out other documents that the Delegations are relevant. I do think it's important to highlight that both the Convention and the Dublin Programme of Action have higher relevancecompared to other instruments such as, e.g. , other Programmes of Action and they are referred to inthe Human Rights Council resolutions. So we are open to seeing proposals from Delegations here. It's not like they are the only international instruments but we need to make it clear that they are particularly relevant and they are more relevant than perhaps other international instruments. Yes, perhaps it's part of the proposal of Iran and the state of Palestine because I understand that that refers just to the Convention but we mightinclude the proposal of the state of Palestine in terms of the document that refers to apartheid and the group declaration. Yes, I would like to ask the Distinguished Representative of Cuba if her input is reflected on the screen. Microphone, please. Can you use the mic? On the 1st part of the proposal, I think it is reflected. What I wanted to do was to think more abouthow we could have the 2nd part of the proposal reflected because as I say, the proposal from Iran and Palestine of as one of, I don't think that lines up with the idea that I'm trying to get across but perhaps I can think about it a bit more and come back with a proposal on that. I'm not sure as one of fully meets my concerns. On the last part of the paragraph, I think it would be good tokeep the reference to Durban but it may not be necessary. We need to keep it in the 1st part but we might not need to keep it in the 2nd part. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the U.K. Thank you, Chair. It is getting a bit confusing now. We would support the suggestions made by the U.S. We think that's a good way to navigate the issue we havewith some of these documents having obligations attached to them whereas some are nonbinding declarations. I mean, we thought the paragraph was a bit redundant, to be honest, given that we have already referenced the ICERT in the PPs. So I mean, either states have either acceded or ratified these instruments or they haven't done and we don't think it should really be away of introducing sort of back way, back doorway of introducing new parties to those documents. It doesn't really add anything for those who are or are not parties but the U.S. proposal is quite neat, we thought. Also the proposal to move the DDPA down the paragraph we think is a good solution when we do I mean, we do have to take note that some states including my own have concerns aroundthe DDPA and the Durbin processes but I think it should be possible to reference those documents if we do it in a neutral way and we think the way that the U.S. has come up with that solution is a good one for us. So we would support their suggestions. Thanks. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Costa Rica. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. For us, the proposal, the original proposal was to have theoriginal proposal seems to reflect the most important elements of this paragraph. We believe that the way in which it was presented and the proposal that we currently have varied quite a lot from that. So we want to add our support together with Brazil to keeping the original paragraph. We also support comments from various colleagues on the importance of keeping theDDPA in this paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the State of Palestine. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to echo Cuba's input to delete their respective obligations as mentioned before in international law, the international law and just go against and omnis natureof the instruments that are mentioned here. I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the representative of IHRC and NGO. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would like to go back to your question to the representative of Venezuela when you asked him if there is another resolution from the Human Rights Council. Yes. I thinkhe was applying and echoing on the advancing implementation of the agenda towards transformative changes for racial justice and equality which is the Human Rights Council Resolution 47/21 that is related also to the implementations and as a key to ensuring the decision making that is informed by theexperiences and expertise on this matter. Thank you very much. I hope that the United States will undertake this Resolution also from the Human Rights Council. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the State of Palestine. Okay, yes, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the United States. ThankThank you very much, Madam Chair. I will need to add a reservation on the addition of theconvention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid. Thank you. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Colombia. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to join my voice to what was expressed by the Delegationsof Brazil and Costa Rica. We would also prefer to keep the original drafting of this paragraph given that the different understandings and changes to the paragraph, we prefer to keepit as was originally drafted. Thank you. Yes. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of Brazil. Thank you. Actually, I keep my position in having the original textas was drafted initially. Just for an editorial thing, we should check that with its editorial.These terms used, they are presented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. I don't know if it is the practice that we use here in the language in texts here in the Council.Normally, we don't take who wrote what. That's my point. But it is for editorial. Just as a reminderfor the Secretariat and for addition. Thank you. Yes. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedRepresentative of Mexico. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. As we read the paragraph and as we havelistened to Delegations' concerns and comments, we would also theoretically, well, we joined the proposal of Colombia, Costa Rica and Brazil to simply keep the paragraph as was originallydrafted. But as we listened to the proposal from the United Kingdom to keep the references to those instruments in the preambular part, I had a quick look at how that section was drafted.I just compared a little bit like I have done previously with other existing declarations from certain groups. For example, on the 1st point, we need to bear in mind that indeed in the preambularpart, we have a paragraph that states that we are convinced of the importance of universal accession to all ratification and full implementation of states' obligations arising under the InternationalConvention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. That paragraphis already in green, actually, going back to that debate on the parts in green. So that paragraph is already there. It is in the preambular part and it is in green. So I think we need to stick to we needto be coherent and consistent in terms of what we have got in the different sections in the people who think this is the main instrument. Then we don't necessarily need to define it any differently inthe operative part. So that on the one hand. Then also drawing a parallel with the declarations on indigenous peoples and on the rights of people belonging to minorities, I think it is worthwhilebearing in mind that in those declarations in the operative part, there is no referenceto other conventions or other legally binding instruments or non-legally binding instruments that exist on those issues in those areas. So I think that really if we want to simplify the text and ifessentially the substantive part of the text talks about the rights of people of African descent,then it might be worthwhile thinking about simplifying it again. We might not need to repeat the different instruments in the operative part because they have been referred to in the preambularpart. But once again, the declarations on indigenous peoples and the rights of minorities, they don'treally refer to other conventions and so on. They keep it to a minimum really. Thanks. Yes,I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Panama. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I will be very brief. We have been following the different exchanges on this paragraph,paragraph 1, and we do see that there is worth in what Mexico has just said. My Delegation is flexible as to whether we keep a reference in the operative part or whether we just leave it in the preambularpart. We don't mind. Either of those is fine. Any and all efforts to simplify the text and make sure it is succinct but also focused on relevant points is, of course, the option that we would always gofor. Now, if the feeling in the room is that we should keep this paragraph under this Article, wethen would like to put on record that we agree with Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia and Mexico. Our preference would be to keep the paragraph as originally presented by itself. Thank you, Madam.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba.Thank you, Madam Chair. Just listening to comments made by our colleague from Mexico, I looked through at the preambular part again of the text and I think that in none of the paragraphs, at leastin the document I have, I don't think there is any kind of compilation in one particular paragraph of the main documents. They are referred to separately. They are scattered through when they are relevantor issues that arise under them. In the paragraph, e.g. , on the convention in green,there is just a reference to access, accession to or ratification of because given that it is a convention, it is the only thing that needs to be signed or ratified. In the case of the GDPA, there is no needfor those mechanisms, accession or ratification. I think that the sense is a little bit differentto the idea we are trying to get across in this OP. The preambular parts of different instruments have the purpose of recalling, referring to different documents, reaffirming. I don't agree with theidea that we are talking about states' obligations to comply with these instruments only in the preambular part. It doesn't have the same strength. It doesn't have the same force, the preambular part. It doesn'thave the same binding force that the operative part has by way of introduction. If we are saying that states have to comply, they have to implement, effectively implement the provisions of theseinstruments, then we would prefer to keep this in the operative part. The preambular part isn't strong enough for that. Having said that, given the very many comments that there are on this paragraph, we canalso support the proposal made by various Delegations to just keep it as originally drafted and as originallypresented by the drafters. Thank you. Thank you. As I do not see any other Delegation requesting for thefloor, we have a number of Delegations that have suggested to keep the paragraph as it was before.And we also have the paragraph now, paragraph 1 of Article No. 5 with different inputs received fromdifferent Delegations. I would like to give the chance to you, Excellencies, colleagues, to see if we can reachan agreement of having simplified and agreed upon text for this paragraph 1. If not, we will keepthe two proposals as they appear on the screen. Okay. I think the Distinguished Delegationsthat have provided their inputs to the paragraph still think that we have to keep them. We also take note that there are other Delegations that have suggested to have the original paragraph. Ithink we are going to keep those two proposals as they are and then move to next paragraph or nextparagraph of this Article. Paragraph No. 2 of Article No. 5 reads: States shall take concrete actions toguarantee the enjoyment of all human rights of people of African descent in full equality,such as the following: A, remove all obstacles that prevent the equal enjoyment of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to development and the right to a clean,healthy and sustainable environment by people of African descent. B, consider withdrawing as a matterof urgency the reservations on Article No. 4 of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and other reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose ofthe convention. Maybe we will go subparagraph by subparagraph, but let me go through how manypoints do we have? Okay. Then we go subparagraph by subparagraph, but I would like to request theSecretariat to delete adopted by IGWG, which was and Delegates would have read the whole text if youthink your comments relate to another paragraph, do not hesitate to mention it and we will go to this paragraph, even if I was not able to read through the whole subparagraph of this No. 2 paragraph. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Brazil. You have thefloor. Thank you, Madame Chair. In 2A, I would like to propose after cultural rights, keeping thecomma and mentioning both online and offline comma and that goes on and again for editorial purposes,since at the chapeau we do already have all rights, all human rights of people of African descent, maybethat end by people of African descent might not be necessary, but this is mostly for language. If it'sgood language, then it's good language. If it's not, just delete it. Thank you. Yes, we go is there anyother Delegation that would have any inputs to this subparagraph, 2A? Yes, I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Representative of United States. Thank you, Madame Chair. For A, we would propose that the paragraph read, remove all obstacles that prevent the equal enjoyment of all humanrights. So it would be all human rights without a long listing, again, for the purposes of keeping thisdeclaration simple and straightforward. And then the by people of African descent can stay or it can goequal enjoyment by people of African descent of all human rights, but that all human rights wouldreplace the word civil through environment. May I make two more suggestions once those are reflected?Great. For the 1st part, No. 2, we would request that shall be replaced with should and this wouldessentially replicate throughout the entire declaration. And then to replace in full equalityde facto with the word equal in front of enjoyment. That's the standard formulation used in the ICERT, e.g. , equal enjoyment of all human rights. Sorry. So it would be deleting in full equalityde facto and placing the word equal in front of enjoyment on the 2nd line. Thank you. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba. Thank you, Madame Chair.In this paragraph, perhaps experts here in the room could explain the thinking behind the inclusionof de jure and de facto. I'm not an expert on this issue and I'm a little bit confused as to the inclusion of this because it's not included in other parts of the text. So I would like to know what theintention and the thinking behind that is and what that means from a legal point of view, the legal justification as to why it's included so that we can voice our views as to whether we want to keep it or not on the 1st part of the paragraph. We would also like to take concrete necessary and effectiveactions, necessary and effective actions, then after there needs to be a comma after concrete, concrete,comma, necessary and effective actions. Then in A, we agree with the proposal, instead of listing allthe rights, you could have all human rights. We wouldn't oppose that proposal. However, as long as this as long as you include the 2nd part of the paragraph on the right to development, so you candelete all the lists but you need to keep the right to development. Most colleagues will know that when we talk about all human rights from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we also talk about the two covenants that currently exist. These documents, however, do not include the right to developmentbecause at that time, collective rights of 3rd generations didn't include they hadn't sufficiently developed the concept of the right to development in international law. If you want to keep all humanrights, very often that doesn't include the right to development. That's why in very many human rights councils resolutions and in many other international documents, they list civil, political, economic,social, cultural rights and there is the point about the right to development. If we could agree with the 1st paragraph, if we keep the reference to the right to development and the right to a clean, healthyand sustainable environment, we have no issue with those inclusions. Thank you. Thank you very much, Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. I would like to inform you that we are already 1:00 p.m. Let's comeback at 3:00 p.m. this afternoon. I would like to thank you for your active participation. Thank the interpreters for their support. See you this afternoon and have a good lunch."}
{"title": "", "text": "46 meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee will continue with agenda item 4. The floor is once again open to members of the Committeeto pose questions to the representatives of Djibouti and for the representatives of the State Party to reply to these questions. I would like to remind the State Party thatif you have answers to the questions posed on Article 7 to 9, if you have additional answers,please provide them now to the experts. 7 to 9. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Just to addto Article 7 to 9 and the answers we gave in connection with political parties, we hada question on whether the state grants subsidies to political parties. Well, there is a budgetline in the budget for political parties and these are awarded without discrimination. So a party whether it is headed up by a man or a woman is entitled to state subsidies and itdoesn't matter if this party is in power or in the opposition, they are also entitled. Perhaps the Secretary General wanted to add anything under those two aforementioned Articles. Thankyou, Chair and Head of Delegation. I have three things to add. First of all, on specific activitiesdeveloped to discourage harmful practices, well, under Article 333 of the Criminal Code, as you know, that embodies a mechanism but that isn't good enough. And as we were saying, withregards to cultural practices that are in place, often they are enforced under religious guises and they shouldn't be. And as one of the Committee members said this morning, the crucial matterhere is education and exchange of views between us and religious leaders and cultural leaders regionally also helps. It helps us to understand also we can't change things overnight. So itis through dialogue, through education that mindsets will shift. On the issue of age formarriage, minimum age for marriage, this morning we perhaps weren't clear or comprehensive enough. So let's state clearly 18 is the age for majority and the minimum age for marriage. That's a principle.But there is something we cannot ignore, namely that the situation that prevails in our country is this. It is an exception. But a person under 18 can marry. But here what's at stake is notconsent. Of course, sometimes we get our words wrong because French is not our mother tongue.We speak of an expression of a wish. So under certain conditions, miners can go towards the Madun Shale which is the civil registry officer to say that he or she wants to marry. And the judgecan grant that wish if the person or the miner making the request is known to be a mature, soto speak, a miner or an emancipated miner, that can happen. Now, this matter has arisen in the countrybecause the rule is defined by its exceptions, isn't it not? So our reaction was how are we supposed to deal with this? Do we completely outlaw marriage before 18 or not? And these issues are beingdiscussed, are being thought about as we seek to revise the code for the personal status. Thirdly,on nationality, there are no exceptions. Twenty years ago, things were different. Exactly, in fact, 20 years ago because the last laws were passed in 2004. Nationality of a child, the nationality ofthe child is of one of the two parents. If one of the parents has Djibouti nationality, then the child will have Djibouti nationality. Now, the country rapporteur said that you had heard from sourcesthat nationality, the nationality of children was not necessarily passed on if only the mother wasof Djibouti nationality. That is not at all the case. If either the parent has nationality, the child does. Now, admittedly, the application periods are much longer. Many more people are submitting applicationsfor nationality and our services are small. So if you ask for a nationality certificate today, in alllikelihood, it will take from five to six months for that to be awarded. But the fact is, the law says what it says. It is very clear. A child will have Djibouti nationalities if either of his or her parents is of Djibouti nationality. That's what I wanted to add. Thank you. Thank you very much,sir. I would like to thank the Delegation for the concrete answers. Now, if there are not follow-up questions on 7:00 to 9:00 by the experts, then in this case, we will now move to questions relatingto Article 10 of Part III of the Convention. I would like to give the floor to Mrs. Hilary Bedema for4 min . Very much, Madam Chair. I warmly welcome, re-welcome the Delegation from Djibouti.I want to commend you, 1st of all, for your policies and actions, policies and action plans. Your master plan, action plan on education, the early childhood education that you spoke about, Madam Headof Delegation today, I commend you highly because early childhood education does not only have advantages for the child but for the mother, her ability to earn an income and to participate in civic action. Thenational literacy program which has been extended in rural and urban areas and funds mobilized to enhance its efficiency. I would like to commend you for the inclusion of family planning, human rightsand women's rights in this program. And the national policy on professional training to improve integration into the workforce. Thank you very much for the link between education and work. And I would like to ask whether in this program you educate the young women about the difficulties and the challengesthat they face when they enter the world of work. For the school enrollment program, Madam, you have spoken extensively about it in your opening statement. And we have seen an increase. I would like to ask how muchof this increase is attributable to girls increased participation. There is work to be done on rural and urban disparities. And you have spoken about retention rates for women which are not the best. Weknow that the reasons usually include period poverty, menstrual hygiene, violence which we did not hear too much about, early marriage we have spoken about, the lack of comprehensive sexuality education,infrastructural challenges related to health, water and sanitation, poverty, unemployment and limited career paths for girls in the formal sector. My questions will be in your opening statement, Madam,you spoke about the increase in educational infrastructure. You are building schools. I would like to ask how many sanitary facilities you have included with constant water supply and femalesanitary products to encourage girls to stay in school and manage menstrual hygiene. I would also like to know in this infrastructural investment about boarding houses, transport and other measures toaddress insecurity and the heightened risk of trafficking, forced migration and exploitation of girls. I have read on my own that the impact of school canteens has contributed to retention. What isyour plan for increasing this school canteens? Then the next issue I have is compulsory duration of education. I have heard in the discussions, though not in the documents you sent, that this is in place.If this is so, why are the girls leaving for early marriage? Because if you are forced to stay in school for the full duration, you will be almost 18 when you leave school. So look at the enforcementof compulsory education as one of the answers to child marriage. And the issue also came up about how are we going to manage this? And we talked about education. Please, continue to educate. Thateducating girls to the secondary education is what leads to a drop in fertility, improved health, reducing child mortality, protection against early marriages, opportunity for furthering development.In short, it is a developmental dividend. And we should be talking in those terms. We look at comprehensive sexuality education. It is a complicated thing. But that is the way also to ensure that girls do not fall victim to child marriage and protect themselves with the issue of sexual relations.Reentry policies, they should be robust. I know there is always stigma about pregnant girls or dropout girls going back. That should be addressed. And use your COVID-19 strategies that you talked about to make sure the girls are educated even if they are not in the classroom. Now, I will end with thecurriculum. Please address vertical and horizontal segregation. STEM education. Let's be innovative.You have talked about climate change. Climatology, meteorology should be things girls should study in school. Entrepreneurship and robust vocational training so that when even they leave school a little early, they can go into this training and be self-sufficient. And please, plans for addressingviolence within the school system, gender training for teachers with monitoring and assessment. Please give us your feedback on what you have done and what you intend to do. And finally, mentorship programs. Sometimes we are limited by our limited vision. And if they can see us, ladies like you in theirclassrooms, they may be tempted or encouraged to stay in the classroom. I thank you very much. And thank you, Head of Delegation. I would like to thank the expert for her questions and now give the floorto the Delegation to provide answers to the questions. Much appreciated, Madam Chairperson. I'm also gratefulto the member for the question. It gives me the opportunity to tell you more about our programs for early childhood education. As you said, we need to scale up what we do for early childhood anddevelop programs or syllabuses with the Ministry of Education in order to strengthen help for them. The literacy program also helps us to catch up or rather to get girls who are likely to drop out of schoolto stay in school. We are getting ready to prepare a human capital plan where in the role of the Ministry of Women's Affairs will be to come up with activities for early childhood. That's our main mandate,together with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Foreign Education. So what have we done? We have strengthened the offer for nurseries and kindergartens in order to develop human capital for early childhoodbut also to enable moms, mothers, to work and themselves to flourish professionally and personally.This plan is going to receive much more nationwide investment for us to scale up those approaches I have just described. In addition, we together with the National Education Ministry, we have createdan innovative program called National Integrated Schools Program, the rationale of which is to build schools in rural areas, very remote areas where it is difficult to provide education and create a wholelife around the school, namely develop access to water, to health, to develop agriculture, and thus allow the people living around that school to have, e.g. , their kitchen garden, their fields,their cattle raising activities and focus their life around the school. It will be an opportunity for us as Lead Agency for Women's Affairs to tap into these integrated school programs, schools' programsso that we together with the National Education Ministry can combat dropout rates for girls to provide services, be they health services, dormitories, so that girls don't have to travel every day to andfrom school, to also provide whole packages for packages for families so that once again the school remains at the heart of where people live and what people do. So we have started to work on this withthe National Education Ministry and we hope that we will reduce this dropout rate for girls in so doing.Also, the issue of poverty is crucial and gets worse as you go inland. In connection with poverty, because of poverty and because of people's mindsets, typically families will take girls out of school and leaveboys in school. Once again, it goes back to education. Girls must be almost forced to stay in schoolsthanks to our programs. Alongside the normal education programs, we are expeditiously developing parallelprograms focusing on training of girls, getting them to stay in school by providing fast track coaching to get their levels back up, combining also education and vocational training for them so that once againthey can get back into school whilst at the same time reducing school dropout rates for girls. So please rest assured we have been thinking carefully about all of these things and we started to do so followingthe various findings, the various thrown up by the various surveys we carried out in which we tried to find out what was going on. Now, we together with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity havedeveloped programs, social network programs to strengthen resilience in grassroots areas. We haveset up the monetary transfer funds program which has also triggered the microfinance programs for women living in remote and isolated areas, especially because these women are poor, affected by poverty. Sowe put them in touch with the community mutual funds and credit funds because at the end of the day it is always women who lead and manage these groups. So we have done all of this to help these women to workin the areas where they live. So in the region, through decentralization which we are organizing, our aim is to invest in regions to strengthen resilience. All the programs we develop to bringschool dropout rates down are linked to this. And the role of my ministry is to ensure that all of this is done in a coordinated fashion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for the Delegationfor the answers. Are there follow-up questions? I see Madam Bedema and also Madam Redock for 2 min each. Chair, I will take 1 min . Madam Head of Delegation, thank you so much and thank you to theDelegation. There are only two more issues I would like to touch on. Number one, as you do all this, data gathering is very important because there was a lack of data. And data about what is going on andabout the transition rates from each stage disaggregated by gender, disability and all the indicators. And finally, as we work in the rural area, let us not be part of the stereotyping of rural communities. Letus make sure that we are brought abreast on ICT, artificial intelligence, robotics and so on, buildingon what you did during COVID. Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Redock. Really excited by the school's proposaland 1st of all, I was wondering whether that is also proposed for rural areas and also if there is a time frame for the implementation of this proposal. Thank you, Delegation, for the answersto the question. Much appreciated, Madam Chairperson. To give you more specific figures as requested,let me take, e.g. , education and literacy. The rates of in 2009, the progress wasfrom 75 to 80%. That's school enrollment rates. That's until 2017. So primary school, 46% to 82% in 2009. That's for the general secondary. The school enrollment rate, raw, has been improved on anaverage in Djibouti and that has a significant impact on the investment we make in school infrastructure. Significant effort has been made in technical vocational training. We have set up nationalpolicies to provide training to bring about better vocational integration. In fact, we have gone from15 to 25% in terms of attendance. Primary education, parity, we have parity. It used to be 0.8. Insecondary, the percentage for girls increased from 0.70 to 0.80. In terms of literacy now, the numberof women receiving literacy training in the capital or in the inland was raised from 39% to 62%. Sothis is the sector which has received most investment and, therefore, the sector which is yielding the best results. To answer the question you put to us on these school structures, a question was where willthey be? These integrated programs will be specifically in rural areas and remote areas in those areas which currently have no educational infrastructure because our survey has told us that it is in thoseareas that school dropout rates are highest. There are more schools in the capital and, therefore, dropout is lower. What is the timetabling for all of this? Well, we are currently finalizing it, the scheduling andthe budget. So from 2024, we intend to start the work. We need to start building the schools and to prepare the communities which we intend to build around. So we need that. That needs to happen and that will taketime. Thank you. Let me add on providing more schools, number of schools has increased. In fact, they haveperhaps overshadowed something else which you mentioned, the school dinners program which we benefited from when we used to go to primary school. Today we have fewer school canteens because schoolcanteens were relevant when they were in capitals of regions so that children who traveled from outsidecould have lunch at school and didn't have to go to and from school four times a day. Our policy todayand has been to, as we build new schools, to give each village a school depending on the populationliving in there. You asked us an interesting question. Why do girls get married despite the fact that they have to go to school up until a certain age? The fact is when that happens, and it doesn'thappen everywhere, it is usually outside of the capitals, the remote and rural areas. Once again,it is an exception. It is not a rule. When that happens, it is usually a forced or early marriage.As far as we know, girls never, no girl has ever wanted to stop going to school to get married,et cetera. Following the national consultation process on education in the year 2000 in Djibouti,laws were enacted to force children to go to school up until 16. We have carried out, we have launched serious surveys which have shown that this decision to force children to stay in school until 16has been a flagship measure which has had great consequences on forced marriage. They then have to go to school on a daily basis and we can see what state they are in, so to speak, and we cansay that it has done them good. When I speak of compulsory education, that's for everyone. My colleague is asking me to make that clear. We have opened schools and places and schools for children of migrants who temporarily settle in the country. They haven't applied or received refugee status.Nevertheless, they are entitled to go to school and health also says the speaker, the colleague of the speaker of Mike. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the Delegation for the concreteanswers to the questions. We will now move to questions relating to Article 11of Part 3 of the Convention and I would like to give the floor to Madame Haidar for 5 min .I would like to begin by bidding a very good afternoon to the high level Delegation of Djiboutiand express my gratitude to them for their interactions as of this morning. In asking questionson Article 11, I would like to preface my remarks by congratulating the state party for all the efforts undertaken to improve women's access to the labor market and the related programs that they have established and you have referred to some of these in your opening statement, Madame Head of Delegation.We also see as very positive Djibouti's very robust legal framework preventing discrimination in the workplace as well as the recent extension of maternity leave from 14 to 26 weeks. Nonetheless, it seems that professional and job segregation persists in practice and that there are, e.g. ,a high number of women working in the informal rather than formal sector, something you yourself acknowledged as being the case. I would like to ask whether you as Djibouti gather and regularly gather and publish statistics. I have heard a lot of statistics and references to statistics and this is very welcome.I would like to ask if amongst those statistics that data you include disaggregated data on women's participation amongst the working population including data on levels of unemployment, the employment of women broken down by different sectors including informal sectors and the number of women occupyingmanagerial and directorial posts. Here I think that you made the point that things are better in the private and public sector when it comes to women's leadership, something that you are clearly alive to. May I also ask what measures the state party has taken to specifically remedy the high concentration of women in the informal sector because I think that's the crux of the matter in improving thelabor situation for women. May I ask what steps the state party intends to take to improve access for women to the formal labor market in particular for women living in rural and isolated areas. I think this harks back to a point that you made about the importance of educating girls because whengirls are properly educated they are more motivated to go out and seek jobs, e.g. , in the formal sector. But it is not just a question of that. There are also legal and other restrictions on women's access to the labor market including legal ones. According to Article 111 of the labor code, theministry of labor and the ministry of health can determine types of work that are prohibited for women. Women are not authorized to pursue jobs in sectors considered to be beyond their strength. And so I would like to ask whether the state party intends to repeal this discriminatory article and to remove all restrictions to the right of women to freely choose their profession. You alreadytalked a little bit about migration and we have heard about how the country is trying to manage the migration phenomenon. But I would like to share with you reports we have heard of the difficulties faced by migrant workers, female migrant workers particularly when it comes to access to the labor market. Migrants including female migrants do not enjoy the same protections as Djiboutian citizens working inthe informal sector. Migrants are particularly vulnerable to forced labor and this is particularly true of migrant children. The types of informal work and labor carried out by migrants often takes place in dangerous circumstances, in dangerous or risky jobs. They lack the necessary security andsafety information and training. May I ask how the state party intends to improve the working conditions of female migrant workers including domestic workers in particular by guaranteeing them complete legalprotection, access to work protection measures, et cetera. I would also ask you to indicate whetherthe legislative amendment concerning sexual harassment in the workplace since 2018 has borne fruit. How does the state party monitor and ensure the effective implementation of its prohibition on sexual harassment in the workplace? Do employers have to how does the state party ensure that women are informedof necessary relevant laws and their labor rights? May I also ask for information on measures taken to ensure that child labor is ended and are there regular inspections of workplaces to ensure that there are no child workers? Are sanctions implemented where there is child labor detected? May I ask what the state party intends to do to ensure that these labor inspections take place in all regions of thecountry and that they are carried out regularly and that they also include the informal sector. Thankyou very much. I will now give the floor to the Delegation. Before turning things back over to myteam for a fuller set of answers, some general information. With regard to the data and statistics, thank you for recognizing that we do have some data and statistics but we are also conscious as you alluded to that there are more data and statistics needed that we owe you some data and statistics.We will get that to you in writing. The ministry has the gender observatory which collects statistics on annual basis, publishes that data, those statistics. That's part of its monitoring and oversight role intended to map evolution in terms of women's access to credit, to the labor market. It also maps dataand statistics in terms of education, employment, et cetera. I think the most recent set of statistics we have is dates back three years. But the statistical information is updated and published regularly.May I respond to your specific question about providing for more jobs for women in the formal sector? 60% of jobs in the informal sector are taken up by women. So decisions need to be taken in partnership with the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Commerce and Trade in order to ensurethey have initiatives in place to encourage women to seek employment in the formal sector and to render more informal sectors formal. Doing all of that takes several different guises. There are several steps that need to be followed. First, the nomenclature of the job itself is that nomenclature, that specificcategory of job recognized in the Labor Code. That's an exercise that we are pursuing with the Ministry of Labor. That's a way of formalizing the work done by women by recognizing it as a formal recognized legitimate job. So we are seeking ways to we are seeking means of incitement to formalize and torecognize and to provide a formal structure for certain employment sectors including women who are running small scale entrepreneurial activities, et cetera. So we seek to render that render their jobs more formal in joint partnership with the Ministry of Labor as well as the Ministry of Health.And by formalization, I mean steps such as ensuring that there is a formal employment structure for your female entrepreneur, that there is a formal structure for hiring and contracting workers who work for you, et cetera. So we encourage women to take the steps to have their job recognized and enjoy the protections,the guarantees, et cetera, that a properly recognized formal job can enjoy including financially, e.g. , and this can take the guise of, e.g. , providing free insurance cover for one's employeesfor a year, e.g. , the time that it takes to render your entrepreneurial activity, the business that you have set up to make sure it meets all formal standards, regulations, et cetera. The Ministry of Women and the family is currently working with the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Trade andCommerce to put in place a strategic plan to render more of the informal sector formal.And several measures along those lines are being pursued. Now if I may say a few words and then I'll turn things over to my colleagues about the migrant worker phenomenon and the questions you asked under that heading. Firstly, the labor sectors are organized by the Labor Code that provides the framework andthere are labor inspectorates within the Ministry of Labor who monitor in particular those businesses, those enterprises who have had attendance in the past or who are likely to illegally or informallyemploy staff. When the labor inspectorate goes to a given business company enterprise and finds that there is an illegal employment of individuals, that they are not following the necessary legal framework for employment, then an immediate end is put to those activities. Migrant workers we findparticularly in day labor, particularly in the construction industry. So the labor inspectorate works on a daily basis inspecting, e.g. , construction sites. They regularly provide dataand statistics and they have also prosecuted certain businesses, certain enterprises for their illegal practices and employment including employment of migrants. Now I have a few things I'd like to add but before I do that perhaps I'll turn things over to the members of my team and then I'll circle backand add anything that needs to be added. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. Thank you to the members of the Committee for these very interesting and helpful questions. They help guide the Republicof Djibouti as to those areas in which we should be concentrating, where we should be focusing our policy efforts and where we need to further implement policy in the labor sector and the workplace sector. To recall that Article 3 of the labor code is very clear, very definitive and categorical as regardsdiscrimination against women. Article 3 makes it clear that no employer can discriminate on the base of sex, age, race, skin color, background, membership or non-membership of a union, union activities,religious belief, et cetera, in offering employment when it comes in particular to contracting individualsor when dividing up tasks and different activities in the workplace. Her Excellency has since this morningbeen speaking regularly about the different pieces of legislative provision and regulatory provisions inthe country that are in place to allow us to tackle discrimination when it occurs de facto. We have in particular a law on access to policy making spheres which establishes a minimum quota in each politicalparty and in each politically representative body and if that minimum quota is not met, then affirmativeaction measures can be taken in order to ensure that more women are on a given list. The enforcing legislation has been revised to bring that quota up from 10% to 25% as the minimum which means that inthe National Assembly today as has been said, 60 of the 65 MPs in our National Assembly, 17 are women,so 26% of MPs in our National Assembly are women, an indication of how this quota law is working. We also are not content to rest on our laurels. We want to boost further the level of women's representation that's in the public sector in the Parliament. With regard to the private sector, we are currentlyspearheading or commissioning a study in order to try and assess to what extent the law, the legislation,particularly the new law extending maternity leave to six months has had any adverse impact on employers'willingness to employ women. That's a study we commissioned ourselves. The initial response from the public sector was positive to this new measure extending maternity leave to six months but therewas something of a backlash from the private sector. They saw it rather negatively. So we wanted todiagnose, assess the impact of this new provision to commission that study to measure its impact.It will be a five-year study maximum and then that will help see whether we need to tweak or adjust our policy. I think the ministry has been charged with submitting to the head of government a draftpiece of legislation should that study give rise to some concerning results, concerning that is when it comes to women's employment prospects, should it demonstrate that women are being discriminated against in jobs in the private sector. So we would like to fully reassure you that we wanted to ensurethat our maternity leave policy did not have any adverse impact. Hence, this study, if it is having an adverse impact, will take the necessary steps to correct course and ensure that the private sectorcannot discriminate. Another question was asked about sexual harassment. I believe that the criminal codein its various provisions is again categorical on this point. It makes it abundantly clear that sexual harassment is prohibited in any social setting. It is a crime. Sexual harassment is a crime.It can equate or rise to the level of a crime rather than a civil offense. I don't think we have any statistics for the time being that we would be able to share with you here and now to give you a snapshotof the number of cases that the various courts have dealt with. But we do know, and this is a helpful element to bear in mind, that when such issues do arise and are being heard,then there is a lawyer's office that works with the helpline run by the NGO, the Djiboutian Women's National Union. So that lawyer's unit, that unit of lawyers is there every time such a case of sexualharassment in the workplace is reported to assist the woman making the report or who wishes to lodge a formal complaint about sexual harassment in the workplace. There is also legal aid in place for those women who do not have the financial resources themselves to support them throughout the processthrough the courts in pursuing such a claim of sexual harassment. Once the complaint has been filed, support continues through the NGO that I referred to, the National Union of Djiboutian Women. Theyprovide support. They accompany the individual woman throughout. And should there be a ruling,then they are also there to ensure that the sentence is, in fact, the ruling is, in fact, implemented. There is also a Women's Parliamentary Committee that supports this whole structure that I referred to which is run by the Djiboutian National Union of Djiboutian Women. And they arealso there to support efforts to ensure that women are supported throughout the court process and that sentences are implemented. We didn't want to leave any questions hanging if we could help it. We aretrying to provide as much information by way of response as we can. A question was asked about facilitating women's access to jobs to the labor market. And you cited a provision in our labor codewhich seemed to indicate that certain jobs are restricted to men, not open to women as a result of decisions taken by the Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Health. It was judged that women were perhaps not strong enough for these very physically intense jobs. We recognize that today. This is discriminatorylegislation because it is clear that women wish to work in any field that they choose freely for themselves in which they feel capable and able to work. It is not up to us to choose on their behalf. So we arereflecting on amending the labor code including the aforementioned Article 111 just to make it clear that that provision was adopted at a time when the intention was not to prohibit women from seekingemployment in certain sectors but it was intended to prevent employers from lumbering women with tasks that they wouldn't be able to carry out usually for physical reasons as a way of discriminating againstthem and thus claiming that they weren't able to do their job, et cetera. But I think today we properly understand that few things are impossible for women and that there is no longer any justification for that Article, for that provision and so we are reviewing the possibility of deleting it. With regardto the status and condition of female migrant workers it is true as you referred to that they have to work in very difficult indeed dreadful circumstances and they seek redress but they are vulnerable as migrants.Many migrant workers particularly female migrant workers who work in the domestic sector come from Ethiopia, a neighboring country and that was particularly true during the war in Ethiopia. Nowthe government has sought to improve the plight of domestic workers particularly female migrant workersseeking to formalize the domestic work sector. I point also to Yemen which has been locked in a civil war for at least ten years which has led to a steady flow of Yemeni migrants to Djibouti. Inorder to formalize their labor status the Djibouti government has allowed Yemeni migrants, Yemeni refugees to formally seek employment. Many migrant workers were not covered by this formal systemthat granted them the right to legally work and to seek formal employment in Djibouti and that's how they got caught up in this trap which was often in the informal sector being abused, et cetera. In formalizing the right of migrants to work and in formalizing the domestic sector we hope that will reduce the rates of abuse, et cetera. Those are the points of clarification I wanted to bring to bear.Delegation for the question. I think there is a follow-up question. Ms. Haidar for 2 min .Many thanks for the information received. I would like to reiterate that we very much admirethe text of the labor code and the definition of discrimination that it contains. I think it indicates that a huge effort has been made in order to revise and overhaul the legislation to make sure that the legislative framework is in place. We are all fully aware from our own experience that revisinga legislative framework and laws is a difficult exercise and sometimes things slip through the cracks and that's why I wanted to circle back to sexual harassment in the workplace or sexual harassment writ large because there was this significant modification to the labor code in2018 on sexual harassment. However, I would highlight the fact that we don't have enough information on its effect. I welcome the points that you have made about the role of the NGO, et cetera, and their support, their helpline but I would like to ask whether employers are through this amendment in 2018are required to set up a support structure, a reporting structure for cases of sexual harassment, et cetera. Also to thank you in advance for your willingness to consider repealing Article 111 of the labor code which as you yourself pointed out is rather obsolete today. Thank you very much.We suggest that we respond to those questions in the 24-hour time frame because we will need a little more time to prepare the responses, to prepare the replies but we are very keen to reply to thosequestions. The Head of Delegation is very keen. And now we will move to questions relating to Article12 of Part 3 of the Convention. I would like to give the floor to Mrs. Natasha Stoddisposer for 5 min . Thank you, Madam Chair. I also warmly welcome the Delegation and I particularly thank the Honorable Head of Delegation for her opening remarks in which she did address some of theissues regarding the wellbeing and health of women and girls including reproductive health programs to delay marriage and vaccination programs as well. You also referred to some of the challenges such as limits to accessing universal health coverage and national security service in some areas. You talked aboutthe high rates of maternal mortality, specifically adolescent girls being more likely to die in child birth and experience complications. Indeed, the maternal mortality rate in your country is two times higher than the regional average with a death of 300 deaths per 100,000 live births, 15% of whichare caused by the mother's infection with HIV. And as you will know, HIV is twice as prevalent in women in Djibouti as it is in men. The State Party report indicates that in 2018 a new national health planwas developed and adopted covering the period from 2018 to 2022. And the plan is to, the aim of it is to, and I quote, guarantee health for all and everywhere. And one of the two major expected outcomes is a 50%reduction in malaria, in TB and HIV/AIDS. So can you explain or give us some data on the development plan, how has it been working since its adoption, particularly in relation to the reduction of theincrease in HIV among women and girls, and are you continuing or have you continued this program beyond 2022? Honorable Minister, abortion is not allowed for therapeutic, is only allowed for therapeutic purposesin your country. The rest is a criminal offense under the penal code 447 to 448. And this includes the survivors of rape. Now we know that treaty body jurisprudence is unequivocal when it comes to the fact that denying women access to abortion can amount to violations of their health and privacy rights.WHO data shows that 45% of all abortions are unsafe and that unsafe abortion is a leading but preventable cause of maternal morbidities. I note that there was no reference to any measures taken to address unsafe abortions or to decriminalize abortion, at least in the case of rape in your state party report.Can you perhaps clarify this for us? I do commend the state party on the results of the 2018 qualitative study in collaboration with UNICEF which revealed significant advances in maternal and child health care and breast feeding rates. And while the government has taken many efforts to improve health care infrastructureas you acknowledge population wide access still continues to be a concern. So can you detail for the committee any plans that are in place that you have to improve the health infrastructure availableto women and girls and perhaps any measures of their success? I also commend the state party on efforts to reduce malnutrition among the population and you have seen a 7.5% reduction between 2013 and 2019. But do you have gender disaggregated data? I know my colleagues have also emphasized this point. Couldyou tell us the number of women and girls who are affected by malnutrition and severe malnutrition? And I also note that despite the progress achieved, the levels of malnutrition are still yet to reach the level that is defined as normal by the World Health Organization. So please address any effortsthat you have to deal with this issue. I note the establishment of a universal health insurance under law number 24/AN/14, 7th of the 5th of February, 2014 and I commend the specific protection for vulnerablecategories including women. Furthermore, the higher level of coverage available for vulnerable groups under the social assistance for healthcare program has provided more than 20,000 people with coverage between 2015 and 2019. But I'm wondering if you can update the committee on current data on this andparticularly reference the portion of women and girls that have benefited from this specific scheme.I also note at the time of reporting, the state party was preparing to extend the services available under the social security assistance program to refugees. Has this happened? I note that the target was for12,500 to receive coverage by 2021. Did you meet this target? And what was the gender breakdown of those who received assistance? I thank the Honorable Delegation for their participation in the dialogueand I end by once again emphasizing the need for gender disaggregated data in health as well as the specific programs specifically that I referred to. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like tothank the experts for their questions and I give the floor to the Delegation to respond to the questions.Thank you, Chair. And my thanks also to the Committee member for the questions. The healthcare system just like the national education system is a priority for the Government of Djibouti and all programsthat have been established to improve access to healthcare services prioritize women and children.They are the 1st segments of society that we target ensuring that they benefit from the overhaul and improved structures. The different healthcare system improvement programs have followed one on the heelsof the other. We have been improving the structure, the availability of services. We have also focused on training of staff making sure that properly trained specialized staff are available throughoutthe healthcare system. Now, if I can come back to the health development plan 2018/2022 which you cited,this health development plan is current or its outcomes are currently being assessed and the next health sector development plan is being prepared. Once that's implemented, it will, of course, be guided by lessons learned from the previous one. Things have been knocked a little bit off track by theCovid-19 pandemic which made it abundantly clear the way perhaps that we needed to find actions and other actions that we had planned have been delayed. And where we intended to ramp up the improvements on our healthcare system, this has been, as I say, knocked off course by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sowhat we have done in the interim and in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is focus on delivery of basic primary healthcare and also factor into our changes to our healthcare system the lessons learned from the Covid-19 system and that's across the board. If I can come back to the specific issue of women's healthand statistics figures, we will come back to you with a specific set of figures and statistics as you requested and disaggregated figures as well. We commit to doing that in the 24 hour time frame but a fewelements of interest. Since October 2021, the 1st strategy to reduce maternal mortality has been launched by the Ministry of Health. It covers the period 2022 to 2026. It is focused on the most vulnerable in society and also focuses on the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health andmaking those services available to the most vulnerable. We have also been ramping up efforts to tackle malnutrition and encourage vaccination and to ensure that these can be delivered at the community level, particularly targeting basic child illnesses and diseases. This is part of our driveto ensure that we achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3. We have been focusing on maternal and newborn health. We have been receiving the support of the WHO and borrowing from their models and we enjoyed a particular partnership with the WHO from 2022 to 2023. In May of 2023, the Ministry of Health conveneda symposium or a workshop that allowed us to highlight the different gaps and where efforts need to be concentrated in order to put together a robust, fair and resilient healthcare system as part of our drive to ensure universal health coverage in line with the SDGs. Promoting women's health also takesthe guise of awareness raising and prevention of cancers, particularly cervical, uterine and breast cancers, et cetera. We have created a specific service on sexual and reproductive health and oncancers of the reproductive organs. With regard to actions taken to tackle HIV/AIDS and to providebetter conditions for persons living with HIV, these are seen as one of the most vulnerable groups in society. We do recognize that and the programmes that have been developed by way of response mean that they are a priority for our action. The prevalence rate for HIV/AIDS has dropped over the lastdecade. We think this is largely due to the fact that there is better access to services, to ARV medicines, to advanced screening. The delivery of these services has been really ramped up and also made available in more parts of the country so people don't have to travel so far to have access to them. That said,there are members of society who still live with HIV/AIDS and don't have access to the full servicesthat they should. But they are not discriminated against in the various programmes that we have set up. Of course, when you are talking about improving healthcare delivery, et cetera, you need the infrastructure in place and you need to see who you are targeting and how you can deliver the servicesthat they need. This means, e.g. , ensuring that persons living with HIV/AIDS can have access to an infrastructure and system of services similar to those provided, e.g. , for persons with disabilities. We need to see it's as important as that. It's a priority sector for us as is women'shealth writ large and we intend to do what we can to improve our service delivery. Communicable diseases in Djibouti, they are very, they are under control, very much under control but there are noncommunicablediseases which are increasingly numerous and widespread linked to health behaviours or generalbehaviour of the population which lead to strokes, strokes, obviously in French cancers, especiallywith women, but we have specific programmes with the Ministry of Health to tackle that. Then a lot of cases of diabetes, a lot of kidney diseases, all of these are noncommunicable diseases and the healthprogrammes now need to turn to tackle them. That's our next priority because as I was saying, communicable diseases are fairly well managed. On health coverage now, as I said in my introductorystatement, since 2017 we have had health insurance which covers a significant number of people, people who contribute but also people who do not contribute there too, thanks to which we are able to supportthe public that doesn't work. So even for people who do not have a job, they are entitled to health coverage. The latest 2023 figures were around 100,000 people, 100,000 individuals now havefree health insurance without having to pay anything into the social security fund. That's thanks to theefforts we have made. I hope I have covered all the questions you had asked. Thank you very much foryour answers. I see that there is a follow-up question from the expert. Madam, you have 2 min .Thank you, Chair. I thank the head of Delegation for those answers. I can only imagine the pressures on the health system with the rise of NCDs in particular, need for dialysis machines and things like that which are, of course, exacerbated when you are assisting people in rural or remote areas.Thank you for your comments regarding HIV/AIDS. I was interested in your comment that obviously it's a priority area, priority sector, that you don't discriminate within programs. But I'm just wondering the degree of discrimination generally against people with HIV/AIDS or indeed the stigma associated withthat health problem. And through you, Madam Chair, if I may, I really dearly would love an answer to my question about abortion. It's an important issue for this Committee as I outlined. And I'm wondering ifthere are considerations underway by the government to decriminalize abortion at least in not just the therapeutic cases but in the case of at least survivors of rape. So I'm wondering if there are anyindications that you would consider changes or review the current law which is a very, very strict one. Thank you. I would like to thank the expert for her questions. So I will give the Delegation the floorfor concrete answers to these two questions. On the issue of abortion 1st , as you rightly noted,abortion is prohibited in Djibouti in all cases except medical cases, of course. As things stand in oursociety today, we cannot enact yet another law which won't be enforceable. Now, given the state of play,we can commit to consult civil society as a whole and see what happens. But we cannot tell you thatour country is today committing itself to rescinding these provisions that prohibit abortion. We will becarrying out consultations. We will see if society is ready to accept a rescinding even in the most open, most developed societies such as the United States society. We see that there are setbacks, rollbacks.So this is a very sensitive issue indeed. The only case where abortion is allowed is when the life of themother is at risk. As I was saying, I just needed to add that HIV/AIDS now, as you have noted in our report, we in 2006, 2007, I believe, we were one of the 1st countries of the region to adopt a law to protectthe rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS. I don't know if many other countries of the MENA region or in Africa followed suit, but the fact is we were one of the 1st to pass such a law. We were also one ofthe 1st countries to ratify the Arab Convention on the Rights of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS.HIV/AIDS, people living with HIV/AIDS are entitled to equal protection on the basis, the same basis aseveryone else. For example, if somebody loses their job because they have HIV/AIDS, they are living withHIV/AIDS, then that person can take their employer to court and they will obtain remediation. For thelast few years, and this is thanks to the work done by our state party and civil society, over the last fewyears, we have seen a change in mindsets towards people living with AIDS who are now accepted insociety. 15 years ago, you wouldn't have been able to live in, to hire a property. You were kicked out of your jobs. Just to tell you an anecdote in passing, one of the major centers dealing or providing care forpeople living with AIDS is just opposite our own offices, the secretary general and myself. So people do not encounter any problems when it comes to securing, getting medicine. So we are no longer in asituation as occurred in the past wherein people were socially outcast when they had HIV/AIDS. People withHIV/AIDS now live a normal life and we hope things will improve. We will move now to questions relatingto Article 13 and 14, part 3 of the convention. I will give the floor 1st to Mr. Safarov for 4 minon Article 13 and then to Ms. Roda Redock for 5 min on Article 14, Article 13 for Mr. Safarov and 14 for Ms. Redock.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Dear ladies and gentlemen, the strategy for accelerated growth and employment promoting for the 2015 and '19 period focused on the economically empowering women by facilitating their professional integration and developing female entrepreneurship.Efforts are also being made by government agencies to increase the access to microcredits for women working in the informal and preservice sections. One of the aims of Djibouti's long-term national development plan is Djibouti to 2035, for 35% of women to be economically independent by 2035. In pursuit of this specific needs, microfinancing institutions have been created by the government and its partners in the fight against poverty with plans toextend the microfinance unit throughout the country in the next five years. Djiboutian women noted certain obstacles that are restrictive and slow procedures for the granting credits and payment terms that are too short. Some women, especially young women also mentioned the death of information about microfinance institutions. There are only 14% of adult women having a bank account in Djibouti. According to the World Bank, 2022 Gender Report, access of finance is seen as the biggest barrier to women entrepreneurship. Women in Djibouti work more in the informal and preservice sections. It's harder for them to access traditional financial instruments as credit, bank loans and microfinance. They often don't have bank accounts or know enough financial guarantees. The lack of sex disaggregated data makes it harder to analyze this issue. There is no quota to ensure a minimumlevel of inclusion of women in access to credit. For women, especially migrants, most migrants work in the informal sector. With migrant women as domestic workers without legal documents or access financial services, it's not so easy. Women in sport, we have such kind of limitation participation, especially women and girls in sport competitions, but they make some good results at the same time as the heads of federations, e.g. . We have two sides. From theone side, good appointment. For the other side, we have not such kind of stimulating points from the support of the women. It's different policies. Please clear this information. And I want to go to the no clear measures on the gender gaps in technology, e.g. , the digital connectivity plans, sports, recreation, the green and blue economy or future jobs is invisible. In addition, no clear gender targets are provided in national priority plans, investment, outlay, SDGs implementation. Just go to the questions.How many sectors have legal and policy frameworks to go on gender equality and women's empowerment in efforts to engage women in contribution to the GDP at development priorities? Please provide a current statistic on economic participation rate in Djibouti disaggregated by sex, age and location in entrepreneurship as accessible to loans and credits if you have and how many credits was done by Statistics 2023 to women for the development of entrepreneurship?preneurship, what steps are being taken to ensure that women benefit equally from economic development in social protection and recreation schemes, especially, e.g. , participation in the cultural programs as not just national family traditional or religious traditionalbut especially for the development of the international widely at the same time in full sport competitions. What about especially measures have been taken to maintain the activities of Djibouti Partitional Credit Guaranteed Fund? What steps are being takento improve infrastructure of rural areas to increase participation of women in sport and other creative actions? We know that the real situation is not so easy, especially on the borders of your country, but internal at the same time, the poverty, but you are going betterin economically each year, but the poverty is very strong in your country to this date. Please clarify the real situation and position and political view of your country. Thank you verymuch. Thank you, sir. Madame Redock, please. Thank you very much, Madame Chair, and thanksto the Delegation for their responses so far. According to the World Bank estimates, 22% of the Djibouti population lives in rural areas. The negative impact change compounds alreadyexisting problems, e.g. , armed conflict contributing to urban migration where Djibouti rural women and girls join persons from other countries in the region displaced by drought,water scarcity, agricultural decline, and the crisis among the pastoralist and herder communities. Yet national documents, e.g. , the World Bank Climate Risk Country Profile, Djibouti Vision2035, even the National Gender Policy 2023 to 2030 in its gender and climate change dimension make little or no programmatic inclusion of women and girls or recognition of the differentialimpact of climate change on women and men. Sometimes you see mention of women and men or women and men or this will affect women, but there is really no discussion of how women are integratedinto this process. Rural women travel long distances to collect water, putting themselves at risk of gender-based violence, exploitation or abuse during the journey. Additionally, they are affectedby extreme poverty, early marriage, higher rates of FGM, fewer health and education facilities, which is why I was so interested in the school's project, et cetera. So while we congratulate the State Party on the establishment of community nurseries and child care centers, very important,and other interventions for rural women, we still need to address the root causes of rural women's marginalization and socioeconomic exclusion. So what are the plans to improve rural womenand girls' access to basic services? Education, health care and family planning services, clean water and sanitation, formal employment, social protection, access to justice, very important,other rural courts, land and credit to improve their lives. How do the financial gains from the military rents directly affect rural Djiboutian women? What percentage of these gains have beenused to improve services and rural infrastructure, including climate remediation in rural communities or are there plans to do so? How will women be integrated into the recently launched UN environmentalprogram and government of Djibouti U.S. 26 million dollar project to build climate resilience in Djibouti? Were women in affected communities consulted? Will they be involved in the climateresistant agriculture, ecosystem restoration, flood control infrastructure and water security interventions identified for this project or will they be trained to do so? This projectis proposed to positively impact 110 men and 97,000 women. Are there gender informed indicators and monitoring systems to assess its impact on women and girls? How can women's involvementin gender analysis be integrated into all major development and infrastructure projects? Now, in the issue of undocumented migrants and refugees, this requires urgent attention as many legalmigrants including women, LGBTI persons and girls have no legal status. They experience extreme poverty, endemic unemployment and low birth registration resulting in statelessness and homelessnessoften on the street as beggars. What measures have the government taken or plans to take to improve access to birth certification for refugees and asylum seekers? And are there plans to strengthen the social security assistance program to include refugee and migrant and internallydisplaced women? Now, what measures are being taken to ensure the human rights of all disadvantaged groups of women who face intersectional discrimination? For example, older women, women and girls withdisabilities, women and girls have been stigmatized in the community and LGBTI women and persons. How can these women be better incorporated into broader national development policies and strategiesas well as improve access to services? Thank you. Thank you, Madame. I will now give the floor to the Delegation to provide answers to the questions from the two articles and I would be gratefulif you can sum up for about 10 min , not more than 10 min . Thank you. Not more than10 min . Thank you. Thank you, Chair. We will do our best to answer the many questions put betweenthese two last speakers. We will do our best to be precise in our answers. First, Article 13, especially access to microfinancing, the Committee member on access to microcreditors, as I said before, this isan accessibility which is decentralized nationwide with offer of services always for women. The main beneficiaries of microfinance are women. You noted slowness in procedures to have accessto credit. That's to be understood because there are requirements. These microfinancing institutions are credit funds. So they are cooperatives which belong to groups. They are not financial institutions such as banks. So there are certain procedures which must be respected and which are time consuming.According to the last household survey in 2017, we found that in the active population, the participation of women is 32%. The ratio, female employment to the population remains at 15%. The publicsector is the greatest employer of the country, 60% from 2000 to 2018. The number of state agents, officials quadrupled. To give you more figures, private sector, as I said before, formal, 33%women, private sector, especially in trade and domestic services. In the informal sector, as I said in my introductory statement, there are many more women, between 60 and 74% are thefigures. Pay is equal in the formal private sector. In the public sector, there is no wagegap. In the services sector, which is usually where entrepreneurs work, trade, transport, communication, in the formal private sector, one employee of three is a woman. The formal sector includesthree women out of four. These are 2018 figures. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the business owners are 175 out of 1,141 companies headed by women. So 15%, 15% owned by women. Informalsector now, women lead four units per five. E-commerce, tourism and artisanal work are promising sectors where women are very much involved. To allow girls to be empowered, access to economic resources,to financial resources, to national resources, the structural measures were taken, access to modern technologies, support for moving from informal to formal, law protecting against discrimination in recruitment as well as sexual harassment of the work, the revision of the maternity leaveprovisions, all of these things I would mention to answer your questions. Going back to what I was saying earlier, you announced, you talked about a lot of structures, microfinancing, financing the guarantee funds which is a new institution to provide financing to enable women to haveaccess to credit in the projects. Finance in each area, there is, as I was saying before, a requirement that at least 50% of the financing will be given to companies headed by women.Now, the question always is, again and again, the promotion and the improvement of the condition of women for them to be there, to come up with the projects, to be able to organize themselvesamongst themselves. Much work needs to be done upstream to enable these women to tap into these financial institutions. Before I give the floor to the rest of my team, the issuepertaining to rural, people living in rural areas and access to services, we spoke about that this morning, access to health and education services, while these put out regional programs because the difference between capital and regions is big. It is important to develop strategicprograms to ensure accessibility to services for people living in remote areas. But climate change comes into play because this worsens the challenges which already existed before climatechange really started to have an impact. Now, with the arrival of climate change and I think we are similar to other countries in the region, we need to tailor our development programs we are currently implementing, which is why the 2035 vision with its plans is tailored in sucha way that we our programs are changed every five years so that we can really meet the needs of the public. Competency reduction strategies, we have launched them since 2008. They havechanged over time. We focus on education. We focus on access to micro credits. We have strengthened access to health services. This whole package made available is made available to combat povertyon the one hand, but also to prepare this human capital to become the driving force that propels the development of our country, which is why we need to prepare this new generation, be itthe previous the upcoming generation or the intermediate generation so they can become the live force of the nation and women are one of the main assets or links we must invest in. We haveto invest. We have to speed up investment so that we can have a proper impact on all these things and once again, the questions you have been asking again and again is we need moredisaggregated data, disaggregated by age, region, and that's the major recommendation we are hearing from you that we should be able to come back to you to provide more disaggregated, God willing,in the future. Access in rural areas, if I could give the floor to my colleagues. Just a wordon rural courts. A question was put on that in 2021. We adopted just after COVID a significantlaw to strengthen the courts in our country. Up until then, courts were chiefly in the capitalso we sought to decentralize our court system and a judicial hub was created in three areas,one in the south, one in the north, and one in the outskirts of Djibouti. These courts admittedlyare not yet fully operational but it's not because of lack of political will. It's rather becauselack of means. The state party is currently raising funds to make these courts operational. Very oftenyou need to recruit a lot of people, build courts. You have to build prisons as well. So it's extremely financially burdensome and time consuming. Once again, the courts, the prisons, the recruitment,the training, the appointments. So in the meantime, we have developed what we call a mobile courtsystem in French. They are very agile structures, namely courts that can be moved from one region to another including in the most remote regions of the country and even in refugee camps thesemobile courts travel to hold mobile hearings. Very often these courts deal with family affairs, familycases but they can also deal with such as things such as land disputes involving women but ifI could quickly row back to access for women to land. My colleague this morning I believe clearlyexplained that in Djibouti there is absolutely no discrimination against women and girls. Everyoneis entitled to ownership of land. There is nothing preventing them from doing so. Perhaps toadd, this was touched upon this morning, since 21, 22, we have been building a legal studies trainingschool thanks to which we have been training judicial officials and other judicial operators in order to improve access to justice because the more judicial officials, judges, magistrates you have, the more courtsyou have, the more access the public will have to justice. This training school also trains notaries, solicitors, lawyers, anyone working in the judicial career, the legal career can go there once again. Themore lawyers you have, the lower the lawyer's fees will be in all likelihood so they will thus increase access to justice. We are working on all of these matters. Thank you very muchfor your kind attention. Thank you. Thank you very much for your concrete answers. Now I see that there are two follow-up questions from the experts. First, Madam Redock, up to 2 min , notmore. Another one from Ms. Brenda Akia, not more than 2 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair and thank you for your responses. I will try to be brief. First of all, I would really have likedto hear more about the cooperatives. I think those are very important, more collective development. I think they are more than just financial institutions. They are also social and community institutionsif operated in their full way. But in the state party's report that was just mentioned and their significance especially for women I think could have been highlighted a bit more. So I congratulateyou on the supporting of the cooperatives and I hope that this will be continued. The next thing I wanted to raise is that I was happy to hear about the plans to construct these four judicial courts and since they haven't been built yet, you might wish to consider makingthese courts fully accessible to persons with disabilities. So they could be wheelchair accommodating,they could have information in braille, they could have opportunities for sign language interpretation, et cetera. So I think that since the courts have not been built, they can really integratein them mechanisms to really increase access. There could be childcare centers in the so that women waiting on matters with their children can have support, et cetera. So that's onething. And the issue of climate change, I think the issue is women's actual involvement in the climate change processes. Thank you. Madam, again, then up to 2 min , one or 2 min ,Mr. Safaroff after that. Thank you, Chair. I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the high level Delegation from Djibouti and I would like to commend the government for allthe efforts it's doing in addressing the aspects of migration, including climate-induced migration that Her Excellency spoke about and I'm very glad that I worked closely with the technical team from Djibouti when we were signing the Kampala Declaration on Climate Change, Environmentand Migration. So I must commend you. During my work with Djibouti when we were in Kampala to get that declaration signed, an issue came up and I know you addressed the aspects of migrationalready in Article 6, but also with my colleague, but the issue of the girls that walk from Ethiopia all the way through the Djibouti Desert through the Obok port, that caught my attention a lot and I would like to really inquire from the government what exactly, what steps are youtaking practically and action oriented to really help the girls that walk through that desert? Thank you. Thank you very much, dear Chair. Thank you very much for us, the Delegation membersof Congress. Just clarification, I understand the problem of the segregated data including especially in the slide 2 at the same time, women entrepreneurship. If you have number comparing with men as a number and women in entrepreneurship, if you can send official data after the discussion,it would be wonderful. At the same time, credit loans provided to women especially in entrepreneurship,is it, it will be any number, but did you have such kind of data? Please send it to us. And one more point, I didn't get answer on women in sport, development and increasing girls andwomen in sport participation. Of course, we have no time now to continue. If you can send afterwards, it will be wonderful all the same. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I will passnow the floor to the Delegation for concrete answers from the questions you heard from our three colleagues experts and up to 5 min if possible and also touch upon the issue ofdata to provide them now or maybe in the next 24 hours. Thank you, Chair. First and foremost,to reassure the experts that all of the statistics and figures that we have promised you will bemade available in the 24-hour deadline in writing. We will share with you all available data, all that which we can do by tomorrow. All of that will be made available to the Committee. Thank you for the question that was asked about cooperatives and women's groups at the rural level, women'scooperatives. The action provided to support these groups and these associations has demonstrated its value and it is a programme that we wish to augment and expand, particularly in ruralareas to provide avenues for rural women's development. On climate change, indeed, it is essential that we involve women in development programmes that are being put in place as part of our climateresponse. We need to involve women in our climate response actions and our climate resilienceactions because they are at the forefront of both climate change and its impact and climate action. If we don't involve women upstream more in our climate action activities, then they are pretty much doomed to fail, I think. Women really need to be front and centre of these activities. Aquestion was asked about young female migrants crossing the desert and what steps have been taken. I would circle back to a point I made earlier. As I was saying, with regard to migrationand migrants, the policy of the government is to accept migration flows and to provide the necessary services to migrants to or through Djibouti. On the migration corridors, supportservices, health support services are made available for those, particularly those transiting thecountry. This is a joint approach bringing together different ministries led by the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Health to make sure that people transiting the country do receive the necessary support including health care services. There are other migrants who get to Djibouti and remain in Djibouti. We are not a transit country for them. Those individuals have access to healthcare. There is no discrimination. As soon as someone is ill, even as a migrant, they can go to a health care facility and they are taken care of. That's an added burden for the country because we have to provide that health care free of charge. They cannot pay. That doesn't prevent us fromproviding health care for them. It is a burden for our health care system because there is no one to absorb the cost of providing treatment for these migrants who are ill. If we don't provide health care for them, then we are failing to meet our obligations. We need to provide health care forthem and the same way we do for the native born population. As I was saying, we have support and health care services made available through the migration corridors through which migrants are moving transiting through the country and those who stay in the country have access to the general health care system. Mr. Safarov raised the issue of sport once again. He flagged it once again. I admit that we didn't answerthat question fully. But we are taking steps to ensure that girls from a very early age when they 1st go to primary school have opportunities to practice sport, to play sport. This is part of the programmeof various ministries. We are encouraging, e.g. , girls sporting competitions, identifying girls who we can tap to participate in different athletic activities, et cetera, different female team sports, et cetera and so forth. That's done at the school level. There are also differenttailored activities to provide training opportunities for girls in sport. Internationally speaking, the President of our Olympic Committee in Djibouti is a woman. So I think that women can have accessto sporting activities. I do want to reassure you of that. We have some top female athletes including the woman I just referred to who is the President of the Olympic Commission. We are seeking to get more and more girls, teenage girls interested in sport and make them aware of just how good it is for them. Our head of state is part of that drive to get more women and girls playingsport. There are scholarships available for those seeking to pursue a particular sport, to develop a sporting skill or a sporting profession. More is done to encourage women to engage in sporting activities. I don't know if anybody wishes to add to that answer. The answer is very brieflyJust a quick response to the question asked about vulnerability in the Dubok corridor. Having notedthat many migrants and transit migrants were moving through the corridor to Owork in the north of the country spurred us to build two healthcare centers on the two main towns throughwhich migrants are moving through that corridor pass. Tajoda, which is a regional capital, which is a regional capital, the center is being built. It will soon be ready and Obok itself. Therewill be such a healthcare center there as well. As was said, the departments and the country itself is working on these activities but we also have international partners including theIOM and UNODC in these projects to try and better manage the migration corridors. The IOM, e.g. , is our implementing partner in the construction of a shelter in La Casale which is the hottestplace in all of Djibouti and there a shelter has been built for those migrants transiting the country through that corridor. They can shelter from the hottest point of the day in those shelters. So that's been constructed in partnership with the IOM. On the circuit courts, the mobile courts,35 such mobile or circuit courts have been organized over the last two years in the north and south of the country. 30 of them heard a different 635 different cases pertaining to family law. So635 such cases have been heard in 30 of those mobile courts. I wanted to add that data point.Microphone, please, for the Chair. Part 4 of the convention which covers Articles 15 and 16 and I will give the floor to Ms.Rangita De Silva De Alvis for 5 min . Thank you, Madam Chair. Your Excellencies, I congratulate Djibouti on the evolving journey of harmonizing the draft family law with international conventions guided by theTunisian personal law. That is the kind of transnational cross-pollination of ideas that we would like to see. I will 1st turn to equality under law. Djibouti is a state party to the Rome statute and is currently an active state party before the ICC. However, has Djibouti domesticated the Rome statute? The reason for my question is that Article 7 of the Rome statute addresses gender crimes that are pertinent to Article 15 and 16 including severe deprivation of physical liberty,rape, forced prostitution, forced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence. Have you incorporated this into the domestic law and how do you use the Rome statute within the state party? The Djibouti Constitution provides for equality under law and the freedom of expression and assembly but can the government be more vigilant in safeguarding these fundamental rights? Recently, food insecure women demonstrated theirrights in the outskirts of Djibouti city and they demonstrated to protest inadequate food distribution. They were arrested, detained for one week and released without charges. How do you strengthen the right to the freedom of assembly and expression for women and women in protest movements? Unfortunately, your excellencies, food insecurity in the family is a major challenge in many of our countries. How do you address the fact that women and girls are the last to eat and therefore are the most foodinsecure? Lengthy pretrial detention erodes access to justice and equality under law. I raise this in relation to the family as this impacts any caregiver who might remain indefinitely detained without a speedy trial. How do you strengthen the criminal justice system for women? I now go on to Article 16. Even when the law is reformed, how will you deal with traditional laws that might create a dual system of laws? I refer to traditional law as it is oftenapplied in cases involving conflict resolution and victim compensation. Traditional law stipulates compensation be paid to the victim's family for crimes such as rape rather than punish the rapist. Families often pressure victims to abide by such rulings. My question to you, excellencies, is on the composition of traditional leadership. What is the percentage of women in the informal justice system? Do women have access to lawyers when usingtraditional law systems? How do you guarantee victims and survivor rights in traditional justice? Given the ongoing reform of the 2002 family code, what is the timeline for concrete promulgation? And then secondly, how will you deal with the impact of the head of household law before the new reform? As you know, according to Article 31 of the current law, women cannot be heads of households in the same way as they are men. Will you grant fatherthe law? What I mean by grandfathering the law is that will it apply to any women who may have been subordinated by the old law? At the minimum, would you consider ensuring that women will not need to comply with the husband obedience law? My colleagues have exhaustively raised issues on child marriage and other unequal practices in the family. My question takes on legal accountability, especially in light of Articles 15 and 16. Inthis regard, your excellencies, let me address your comments in the morning on the child's consent to marriage. Let us engage in a quick, tour de force of the relevant laws. First, excellencies, Article 16 is very clear. The marriage of a child shall have no legal effect. Now, the Convention on the Rights of a Child in Article 12 provides legal capacity to the child. And I do agree that this is enshrined in Article 12. However, it says that the child inin particular, we provided the opportunity to be heard in judicial and administrative proceedings. But at the same time, both Article 16 of the CEDO and Article 3 of the CRC enshrines that in all cases, the best interest of the child shall prevail. And general comment 14 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the best interest of the child cannot be manipulated and I quote, \"the protection from physical and mental violence are in no way promotingby the best interest of the child and are in fact impeded by child marriage.\" I hope, Your Excellencies, that this has provided you with some clarity. Are those who register marriages against the lawcriminally sanctioned? Can cases on child marriage be brought in court? For example, in a recent case by two victims of child marriages before the High Court of Zimbabwe, the judge held that the courtmust send a strong message in sentencing predatory adults who sexually exploit young persons. Similarly, my question to you is have victims of child marriage brought cases before the court and do they haveequality under the law? The Mahars practice adopted given to the bride's family is a driver of child marriage. Thus we see the confluence of two harmful practices. How will you combat the practice of Maharsboth via de jure and de facto processes? Even when you revise the law, Your Excellencies, how do the overlapping categories of poverty, climate change, migration and nomadic conditions affect child marriageand polygamy? As you said, families are in constant motion. Apart from mobile codes, how can you use technology and mobile phones to reach nomadic families who need support in access to the law? Would youconsider digitizing codes for nomadic families? Mobile money, too, can have an impact on women's autonomy in the family as women can shelter money from male members, predatory male members of thefamily. Would you consider fintech and telemedicine as a way women can exercise their rights to full andequal decision making in the family even when they are in a state of flux? Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam De Silva De Alvis. I would like to give now the floor to the Delegation for concrete answersup to 5 min to summarize concrete answers to the questions and propose answers to the questions.My thanks to the expert not just for the quality but also the quantity of questionswhich demonstrate familiarity with the subject. We'll try and respond to the questions if I overlook or if we overlook anything by way of response to some of your questions or leave some of your questions unanswered then I'll turn to my colleagues, ask them to prod me, remind me and if we can't answer here and now, we'llprovide answers by tomorrow. Just to provide some clarification, I'd like to start with the last set of questions you asked if that's all right. You asked a question as to whether you intend to usetechnology in the courts including digitized court services and the answer to that is yes. In a jointproject with the European Union and the UNDP who are implementing partner, we have four pillars that we are pursuing to improve or modernize our judicial system and that includes the digitalization ofjudicial services. That's pillar number 4. That will also help in particular in rural areas because I would like to make it clear that the project does indeed cover rural areas. It's a project that's currently underway as I say with our two partners but we are seeking to digitalize court and court serviceswhere we can. You asked a question about sanctions for certain actions such as child marriage cases, et cetera, are they brought before the court and are they sanctioned or punished? Yes, they are. There is a law which provides for the sanction and the punishment but I would like to say it's not justremained a dead letter in the law. We have seen such sanctions and punishments enacted by the courts.When, e.g. , if you are talking about somebody in a position of authority, a professional, e.g. , who is responsible for this crime of child marriage, et cetera, a teacher or so on, then the sanction, the punishment is not just doubled, it's sometimes tripled to try and act as a deterrent to such crimes.Now, of course, this is still a societal issue. This circles back to a point that we were making earlier. Many people see this as a crime. Other people are saying no, not necessarily the case. It's a natural response to the lack of another structure to be able to provide for needs, e.g. , of young peoplebetter than married, et cetera. Judges, prosecutors in cases that they hear involving children need to prioritize the best interests of the child at all times. There are several situations in which judgeshave handed down rulings which did not satisfy either the father or the mother and when we ask the judge why did you arrive at this ruling, he or she says it was because said ruling was in the best interests of the child and the best interests of the child prevail over the interests of either parent or theparents. So that element is clearly understood by judges and it's also clearly provided for in the personal status code. A question was asked as to whether women even in customary law cases haveaccess to a lawyer to a defense. Just like everybody else, women have access to a lawyer. They can have representation. We'll send you the figures, the statistics in writing. What we have found is that broadly speaking is that 7 times out of 10 legal aid lawyer representation is requested by women in courtcases. In statutory cases, now in customary cases, they do have the right to ask for lawyer. Levels of legal aid and legal assistance are not as high in customary or traditional law cases as they are instatutory law cases where the figure stands at about 7 out of 10 cases involving a woman as I said in terms of legal aid, legal assistance provided. It's perhaps difficult to arrive at an exact figure in customary courts. Perhaps people understand who are not tribution that traditional or customary law is avery formal structure. It isn't actually the case in tribute. You are talking about negotiations, interactions between different families, different tribes, et cetera. It's not as formal as statutory law. They don't have the same court set up, the same hearing set up when you are talking about traditionaljustice. The statutory system has criminal judges, civil judges, et cetera. It has that very clear delineation in handling its different cases, et cetera. The same is not true in traditional justicewhich depends on long-standing customary laws and practices. It's not formalized in the same way. It's very informal. And it's only brought into action for civil cases. I do want to make that point. Criminalcases are heard by the statutory courts. It's only when you are dealing with perhaps civil action cases that you have that possibility of having recourse to traditional or customary law or to courts.And so there again also it's not a formal lawyer system. You might be represented, assisted by someone else within that traditional system but not a formally trained lawyer as it were. With regard tolong periods of pretrial detention, to make it clear that pretrial detention has a limitation inthat's provided for in the criminal procedure code. The maximum duration of pretrial detentiondepends on the length of the sanction for the crime for which one is charged. So if the maximumsanction for a given crime is five years, the maximum period of preventive detention or pretrial detention is four years. Some might see that as an aberration and that it's a violation of the provisions of the Rome statute but preventive or pretrial detention when it comes to serious crimes has nolimitation currently but judges are aware of the need to bring somebody before the courts in a reasonable time frame until they do their utmost in order to ensure that this pretrial or preventive detention doesn't go on and on and on even though there's no maximum duration provided for in law. But as partof our ongoing revision of the criminal procedure code and the criminal code, one of the things thatwe are pursuing particularly, e.g. , in line with the steps we are taking to decriminalize defamation, et cetera, to make that a civil crime, one of the steps that we intend to take is to provide limitations on pretrial or preventive detention. For the questions already asked, I would like youto take note of the concrete questions that your colleague said. Yes. And also in order to have time for follow-up questions, but very briefly up to 1 min which will be taken also I propose intoaccount for your future answers in writing because we are really touching to the end. Thank you very much. You have a question? Yes, please. Thank you, Your Excellency. You were doing an excellent jobof going through all of my questions and providing very substantive information and responses that really elucidate and illuminate the ways in which we can also respond in our concluding observations. Soin response to the question on traditional justice systems, as you know, Your Excellencies, they tend to be patriarchal and hierarchical even when it involves families and tribes and neighboring communities.What is the composition of this justice system, gender composition? And do they tend to be led by the male elders of the families and the communities or is there equality in this composition? So that's a quick question. The 2nd was on the Rome statute and issues of access to justice and the domestication ofthe Rome statute, especially Article 7 of the Rome statute on those gender-based crimes. I believe that when you said the criminal justice system is in a reformist process that you would be domesticating the Rome statute in total. And then finally, the increased maternity leave for six months that yousaid could be a problem in terms of disadvantaging women in the marketplace. The way in which you can balance that, Your Excellencies, would be to make sure that fathers have the same increased leave ofsix months. That would equalize the playing field for both genders. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam. The Elvis, I think they took note of the previously asked questions and also the question and considerations now and I would like the Delegation to take into account and to have the answers tothese questions, the answers within 24 hours. Now, are there other questions from the floor, from the experts? So I think that with this concludes the consideration of the combined 4th and 5thperiodic reports of Djibouti. I would like to thank the experts for their questions and comments and the representatives of the State Party for the responses and explanations provided. Does the Headof Delegation wish to make some concluding remarks from your side? Yes, please. Thank you for giving methe floor to conclude our meeting with you. Dear members of the Committee, may I extend to each and every one of you a heartfelt thanks on my own behalf and on behalf of my Delegation for your receptionhere. Djibouti was very proud to report to you today and to be truly involved in this exchange of viewsto hear what you had to say but 1st and foremost to present to you the progress made by us on our various programs and agenda in the near future and in the future in general. We would like to thank youfor all of your comments, your suggestions, your proposals. We will be leaving here having been truly enriched by your suggestions and proposals. We will endeavor to work together with you, the teamof CEDAW, to continue to ensure that women's rights are increased, more accessible and so that they becomea true life force for us who are a developing country. We would like to rely on them. We would like to thank you for your candidness, for your comments, your comments which are for us a true source ofinformation, inspiration rather and things we can use to inform what we do. Our country will continue to work closely on the mechanisms to promote and protect human rights and I can assure you that wewill look forward to receiving your COBS and enforce them. We commit ourselves to send to you within the next 24 hours the disaggregated figures you asked us for to help you to refine your observation. Once againthank you to each and every one of you. We wish you every success in the future reviews of countries you might have to conduct. I would also like to thank my team individually for all the answers you have provided in your various fields of expertise and thank you Madam Chairperson for giving me the floor.I thank the Delegation for the constructive dialogue which has provided further insight into the situation of women in your country. The Committee invites the State Party to accept as soon as possible the amendment to Article 20, Paragraph 1 of the Convention concerning the meeting time of the Committee. Inthat regard the Secretariat will send the model instrument of acceptance with further explanations to your permanent mission shortly. The Committee commends the State Party for its efforts and would encourage it to take all necessary measures to address the various recommendations of the Committeewhich will be formally communicated to you through the permanent mission for purposes of a more comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Convention throughout the territory of the State Party for the benefit of all women and girls in the country. The Committee also reminds the State Partythat it selects a number of recommendations for immediate follow-up. These are mentioned at the end of the concluding observations. It invites the State Party to pay particular attention to the selected recommendations and to submit information on their implementation within the deadline defined in thatsame paragraph. Thank you, Excellency, and we look forward to receiving your next periodic report. The Committee will now convene in closed meeting. The meeting is adjourned."}
{"title": "", "text": "Excellencies, dear colleagues, good afternoon. I hope you have got a good lunch. We are going to continue with our discussions of this morning. We are starting our 2nd part ofthe 1st day of this international meeting, trying to work on the draft declaration. We started this morning by going through the text article by article. We reviewed ArticleNo. 4. We are now at Article No. 5. Yes. Now we have the texts of Paragraph No. 2, subparagraphA. If I remember well, we there are participants in the room who had requested for the floor.And I see the Distinguished Delegation of Japan requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Chair. As the U.S. stated in the morning session with regard to Paragraph 2 ofArticle 4, since this document is not legally binding, we would prefer to change shall to should or some other non-legally binding wording for the declaration as a whole. And with respectto subparagraph A, we also propose to delete environment. This is because we believe that there is still a discussion on whether rights to environment should be considered as establishedhuman rights or not. Thank you. Yes. The Distinguished Delegation of Japan is suggesting also to deleteonly environment or sustainable environment? Environment. Come again. Sorry. Only environment.Yes. It will be deleting only environment will remain with sustainable and are we deletingand sustainable environment? Yes, please. Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Representativeof Costa Rica. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. For us well, for Costa Rica, we believe thatthere would be added value in the declaration having a reference to a the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. We understandthat it has been reflected in the 1st part of the document. So if you have got the reference in the 1st part of the document, we can be flexible in accepting the paragraph in the proposalA as put forward by the USA. However, we also believe once again that it would be worthwhile reiteratingthe right to a sustainable environment and should we wish to include it in this paragraph,our position is flexible if you want to include it here or if we want to refer to the list of all human rights, but if you want to include it and you delete if you delete sustainable environment, thenthat breaks away with that right as such. So what is important is either to include the right to a sustainable environment or to include the other proposal, but the right as such, the name of the right is right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. That's the full name of that right. Thank you. Thank you.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Ecuador. Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chairperson, for giving me the floor. As regards this paragraph 2A, along the same lines really as what Costa Rica has just said, we are flexible when it comes to the inclusion of a reference to the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.However, in any case, in the 1st part, we would be okay with including that. I do want to leave on record our support for the proposal from Brazil this morning to add both online and offline. We support that. That's everything. Thank you. Thank you, Ecuador. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Panama. Thank you, Madam Chair. Onto 2A, our preference would be to keep the paragraph with all the rights, all human rights. We are also prepared to continue discussions, but if we are going to mention some of them, then we have to mention all of them, including the right to development and the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. What we dowant to leave on record is our support for the proposal from Brazil to include both online and offline. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the 1st part of the subparagraph A under Article under paragraph 2, we prefer to keep the language of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rightsand not to be replacing with all human rights. And for the right to development, we believe that the right to development is very crucial for all especially for developing countriesand for people of African descent. It is very important because the people of African descent has also the contribution in developing the country that they reside into. And so we areagainst the deletion of the right to development. I thank you. Thank you. I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Delegation of European Union. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. We have two comments. And the 1st one is related to the chapeau of point 2. We would suggestto turn it around. So it would read: States shall guarantee the enjoyment of all human rightsof people of African descent and then the rest of the text through concrete actions such as the following. So instead of saying take actions to guarantee, we should say shall guaranteethrough concrete actions such as the following. And still on the chapeau, I will have to takeit back to my group, but I think we would be in favor of the U.S. proposal to use the legally sound expression of the equal treatment no, the equal enjoyment of all human rights. Sowe would support the U.S. there. On 2A. We are still trying to reflect your input. Yes. Pleasecontinue with your inputs to subparagraph A. On point 2A, our position is that we prefer not to mention specific rights and we would therefore delete the last part from includinguntil the end. Yes, there. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela. Thank you, Madam Chair. We wantedto add in A, it says all obstacles that prevent the equal and full enjoyment. And full beforeenjoyment. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof South Africa. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Our Delegation would like to propose thatif we replace the formulation civil, political, economic and cultural rights with the formulation all human rights, then we should balance it with including the right of development. In otherwords, we can leave with the formulation all human rights as proposed by USA and Cuba and also by Brazil, the part that says online and offline. But we need to place greater emphasison the formulation that says including the right of development. And then the rest also is retained.Thank you, Madam. I hope I'm clear. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Delegationof Mexico. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. We just wanted to support some of the proposals.So we want to put on record our support for Brazil's proposal into A, both online and offline. Andwe also fully support the comments made by the Delegation of Costa Rica as to maintaining flexibility in terms of which of the two parts where we list those rights, but they shouldbe listed. So we would also keep the full name of the right as recognized in the human rightsresolutions, the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Cuba. Thank you, Madam Chair,for giving me the floor once again on this subparagraph. Regarding the European Union's proposal, I'mnot completely clear maybe something is missing from the sentence. Guarantee that maybe shouldbe a \"that.\" Is there something missing to make it make sense? I genuinely believe that perhaps includingall of these changes we won't be able to actually understand the proposals. Perhaps the idea ofseparating the EU proposal is a good one and you need to put all of the reasoning perhaps. Okay.Okay. Maybe the Delegation of European Union would read the chapeau of the Paragraph No. 2,the full sentence so that we have it reflected. Thank you to my colleague from the Cuban Delegation because there was indeed something missing there. So the sentence would then read \"States shallguarantee\" and then I'm going to take the U.S. proposal, \"the equal enjoyment of all human rightsby people of African descent through concrete actions such as the following.\" So states shall guarantee\"the equal enjoyment of all human rights by people of African descent through concrete actions such asthe following.\" Thank you very much. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Cuba didn't finish the inputs. Yes, please, Cuba. You can go on.Thank you. Looking at this drafting, I think that we can be flexible. We can support the EU proposalthere. I wasn't sure whether we could or not but I mean we will still have debates on it but initiallywe can support that language. On A, thinking a little bit about the 3rd generation rights andcollective rights that are being included, I think it would be perhaps right if the group of Delegations that have spoken about including right to development and right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment which we support, we propose that after the right to development we also include a comma andthe right to peace. I'm asking the Secretariat to write what they have understood and then we willcorrect from there. It's not as well known but the right to peace, it's in the many Human RightsCouncil resolutions and as well as it's crystallized in international law through the UN declaration on the right to peace of 2015. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Japan. I'm sorry, I made a wrong comment earlier and I would like to correct it. Regardingsubparagraph A, we prefer to delete from including to environment. Thank you. I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Sorry for taking the floor again but just as a littleclarification, my previous comment was about supporting the right to development only with regardto the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. I will check it, I think. Thank you.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to echo support for their attention of the right to development and the right to a clean, healthy andsustainable environment. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Panama. Thank you. Apologies for taking the floor again. First just I can't see quite butI don't think it probably went on record the fact that we support keeping the reference to all rightsincluding right to development, right to a clean, healthy, sustainable environment.Yeah, great. That's it. And also to support Cuba's proposal and the right to peace. It's very relevant.This week our regional group had an exchange with Volker Turk, the High Commissioner and stressed theimportance of that right above all in this day and age. And coming from a country, coming from what's been declared a zone of peace, we think that's something that's very relevant. Thank you. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Paraguay. Thank you.Quickly to respond to some of the proposals, support the inclusion by Brazil online and offline and keep the reference to the right to development and to a clean, healthy, sustainable environment. We supportall that. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil.Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would say that just to react to some of the proposalsmade, I think that's I think Brazil should support the original text concerning civil, political, economical, social and cultural rights. I think that's if we are doing a listing, so let's do alisting and both for the and for the others for the 2nd part, we can go together with that. I'mjust double checking about the right to peace, but let's say that we support the listing in thisparagraph. Thank you. Thank you, Brazil. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. And it's to return to the chapeau paragraph, just reflectingon the proposal made by the European Union. There's a reason why it was worded with a focus on the actions that states can take because that's something that states can control. We can control the actions that we take. This is reflected in, e.g. , Article 2/2 of the ISRD where it says states partiesshall when circumstances warrant take in social economic culture and other fields measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups for the purpose of, I'm paraphrasing a little bit, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights. So thefocus is on the actions that states can take which is fully within state control and the outcome of that is the equal enjoyment of human rights. I think by flipping it and saying that states shall guarantee the full enjoyment of human rights, we should just reflect on how reasonable that is compared to otherdocuments that have already been negotiated intergovernmentally and how comfortable our capitals would be with that sort of very strong statement. I think more appropriate and in line with many of the documents in this field are to focus on the actions that states can and should take and the goal withwhich they are taking those actions which I think the original wording of this, the original structure of this chapeau was geared towards and I think is a better approach. Thank you. Thank you. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia. Thank you to respond to some of the proposals for 2A.Obviously it depends greatly on what the chapeau will be at the end but especially respond to theproposals from Venezuela on including and full. Colombia supports that. We can support the proposalfrom Brazil on online and offline and the reference keeping the reference to a clean, healthy environmentsustainable environment. Sorry, before I finish, right piece as well, we support that. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Sorry, Madam Chair, to keep my flag on, just to react to the chapeau, yes, Brazil can be flexible and accept the proposal madeby the European Union. Thank you. Thank you, Brazil. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. Reflecting on something that was recently added, the notion of right to peace, I would have to register our reservation to the inclusion ofthat concept here. And looking at ICERT Article 22 that I just mentioned, here references equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. So I would propose to add fundamental freedomsto my proposal or all human rights and fundamental freedoms. So it would be going back to, yeah, I'll give you a moment to reflect that. So my proposal further up would be all human rights andfundamental freedoms which is directly in line with Article 2/2 of the ICERT. Thank you. Thank you. Iwould like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Costa Rica. Thank you. We supportthe reference proposed by Cuba on the right to peace. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Nigeria. Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving me the floorfor 2A, paragraph 2A. I just want to add my voice to other colleagues who have proposed retainingthe right to development and the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the State of Palestine.Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving me the floor. I would like to echo South Africa and Iran and Nigeriaincluding the right to development and echo the several countries who are with keeping the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. In the beginning, allow me, Madam Chair, the beginningof the paragraph above, yes, Madam Chair, that the State of Palestine is with keeping shall not shouldbecause as we mentioned that these rights are binding and the right to peace, the State of Palestinealso echoes the states that support including the right to peace. Thank you. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think there has been a mistake here. I would like to request adding our Delegation's name to the Delegations requestingthe retention of the right to development. Thank you. Thank you. We were we have got all the inputsto this the chapeau for paragraph number 2 and some paragraph A with the Secretariat who were lookinginto ways of maybe having some agreement and we would like to ask if countries that supportedthe right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment are also in support of keeping theright to development so that we don't have them into separately. Do you prefer that we keep themseparate? We have the impression that yes, Iran? Yes, we prefer to keep it separately becausethere is some difference between the countries supporting the right. Yes, I'm asking the Secretariatto show the chapeau of paragraph number 2 and see if there are chances to have an agreed upon languageor if all your inputs are reflected. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation ofEuropean Union. Thank you, Madam Chair and apologies for taking the floor on this again. I just wantedto make the comment that these references to individual rights, they pop up in several PPs andevery time we are getting a little bit stuck whether we should mention right to development, right tohealthy environment and now right to peace has been added to that and I'm just wondering if it would not be more helpful if we could just decide on having if there is a willingness to mention these separatelywe do it in one place and we have the discussion there but we don't do it ad hoc in, e.g. , this 2A where the key message that we are trying to convey is that states should remove the obstacles and if it is for this right or another right, basically it is for all rights. So to avoid thatwe are going to have this discussion in the next two days and then in May again on separate parts,especially, e.g. , right to development, Article 9 is specifically dedicated to the right to development. So I'm just our proposal to just mention all human rights here and move on would allowfor a clearer path forward as well. It is not that we are avoiding the discussion but let's just have itin one dedicated PP or OP or wherever we want to have it then because this is going to come back.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States.Thank you, Madam Chair and that's kind of I guess precisely why I made the proposal that I made was that states can depending on what instruments they have agreed to, what they have agreed to internationally can interpret human rights based on their obligations and based on their agreements. So if countries havenot recognized either the right to development or the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, both of which I should add have no instrument that defines them which is a key issue here, then they can interpret it as what's currently here, you know, civil, political, economic,social and cultural rights. So it is a matter of providing phraseology that keeps these issues in certain areas like at the beginning and in Article 9, e.g. , as opposed to having the same conversation over and over again. Let's just come up with a term that can be used flexibly and havethese discussions elsewhere. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. As I do not see any other Delegation requestingfor the floor, I'm asking for the last time if there is chances to have an adoption either of the versionthat was proposed by the EU or if we can keep the previous version with inputs that we received fromthe Delegations. Mexico Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you. We can support the EU proposalin the chapeau. It seems it reads pretty well. And we agree with comments made bythe EU Delegate in that this debate will probably be repeated as we already had in the last session,e.g. , on page 12. In the preamble we have these lists of the rights and there we had a debateand that section was one of the sections that couldn't be put in green on that occasion. So again,as we said before, we're flexible in terms of where to mention things, but we do think thatto move forward in negotiations, maybe we could reach an understanding that if we put the list later,we might have to review it at the end and then at the end determine where everything goes, but let's notbetter than repeating the positions, but I guess we're open to hearing the opinions of other colleagues at any time. Thank you. Thank you, Mexico. Brazil Delegation, you have the floor. I just want toappreciate for European Union to find the right rationale for that, as I mentioned. I mean, if you are doing a list, so let's do the listing, but if we agree and I tend to understand the point made byour Distinguished Colleague from Europe, so yes, we can support if you can reflect in DA in a sense of compromise and since we are also going to have the opportunity to go back and detail what would be thatall human rights and fundamental freedoms, Brazil can go with the proposed made there. So the paragraph for us would read like that, right? Remove all obstacles that prevent the equal and full, you decide,enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and full both online and offline, of course. I keep my proposal there. And full stop. If that could be agreeable, I would that would be our suggestion.Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. Thank you.Thank you. Sadly, I don't think I'm afraid we are not as flexible when considering this proposal. We have a number of reasons why. The 1st thing, in our opinion, what doesn't have the same significanceis placing all rights in any part of the document. It is not the same if you put it in preamble where you recall previous documents. It is not the same in just one separate chapter on the right to development and it is not the same here. Like in this paragraph where we are talking about what the obligations would befor states and it is no accident that it is in the 1st paragraph and that part of those obligations are protection of those human rights including the rights that are listed. And I think we shouldn'tfall into the trap of saying that just because the colleagues know when all the human rights are spoke of, then those the 3rd generation rights aren't included because this only refers to the rightsincluding in the UDHR and in the two international covenants. And we have stressed the importance of human rights council resolutions including the resolutions of the GA where in addition to economic,social, cultural, civil and political rights there, they speak about the right to development and other 3rd generation rights. Therefore, we don't think that the all human rights and fundamental freedomsincludes that doesn't include the 3rd generation rights and we think that we should not believe that in any part of the document they have the same significance because it just depends that's not the case and it's important for us to reflect it in this section when we are speaking of stateobligations. That said, the chief idea, you know, we are not flexible when it comes to this new wording and we would prefer to keep the document with the opinions of all states that have supported theright to development, some the right to peace and others the right to environment. So we want to keep it as it was before like that. Thank you. I would like to give the vote of the DistinguishedDelegation of Iran. With regard to the formulation of the paragraph, I think that, yeah, with regard to this formulation upon my understanding the formulation proposed by my colleague from EUmeans that the equal enjoyment of all human rights. It means that, e.g. , the equal enjoymentof such human rights and with such human rights. But what we are targeted here is to having andguaranteeing the equal enjoyment of rights by people of African descent and the others. So we prefer tokeep the original version of this paragraph. I thank you. Thank you very much. As I do not see anyDelegation requesting for the floor, we move to subparagraph B. Yes, the Secretariat is tryingto reflect Iran inputs. Where can we reflect it? Support the original version that we have as thechapel of the paragraph 2. The 1st original. Thank you. Can we move to subparagraph B, Articlenumber 5, paragraph 2? Subparagraph B, consider withdrawing as a matter of urgency their reservations on Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discriminationand other reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention. Comments,inputs are welcome. I see the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Some of my Member States do have reservationsand they include indeed Article 4. That said, of course, Article 19C of the Vienna Convention allowshaving reservations. So it is legally allowed to have reservations. We have agreed to this language previously, though, because you have to consider from time to time whether indeed a reservation remainsnecessary or not, whether the times have changed. This was notably the case in HRC Resolution 42/29, which was the last Consensual Resolution we had on this topic. It would help us if we could use languageof OP10. The main difference is that in this text the words \"as a matter of urgency\" have been added. Somy request would be to take out the words \"as a matter of urgency.\" It means we still agree to the idea that this has to be considered, but given that it is legally allowed to have reservations, we wouldprefer more neutral language as we did during in the last Consensual Resolution on this. Thank you very much. Thank you, EU. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States.Thank you, Madam Chair. We would support the removal of \"as a matter of urgency\" as proposed. We would further request that the final part that says \"and other reservations that are incompatible with theobject and purpose of this convention\" also be removed because it suggests that reservations Article 4 are incompatible with the object and purpose, and we disagree with that and said so in our filing ofthe reservation Article 4. So if there is some other wording that would be \"and any reservation that is incompatible,\" I'm open to some alternative that does not suggest that the reservations Article 4 areincompatible, but we request for now that that be the way to resolve this is to remove that particular section. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Japan.Thank you, Chair. Regarding paragraph B, we understand the importance of this paragraph, but we propose to insert \"as appropriate\" after withdrawing because the status of consideration may be different in eachcountry. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of theState of Palestine. Madam Chair, the State of Palestine is keeping the paragraph as it was. It means that keeping as a matter of urgency and keeping and other reservations that are incompatiblewith the object and purpose of the Convention. Here is why. In international law, the Vienna Convention of the Law of the Treaties 1969, it regulates the reservations, the withdrawal and everything relatedto international treaties. In international law, reservations are prohibited or should not be accepted if I quote Article 19 of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, C, in cases not filling undersubparagraphs A and B, the reservations is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. And Article 4, if we make reservation Article 4 of the ICERT, it means that we are making the reservation that is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty because Article 4 is mainlydiscussing all the elements that will save the CERT to put an end to any form of racial discrimination.Therefore, according to international law, this paragraph should stay as it was and Ithank you. Yes, thank you. I do not see any request for the floor on what we have got as inputsto this subparagraph. We have the state of Palestine who proposed to keep the previous version and we have got inputs from different Delegations that are all captured on the screen. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. I would like to express Brazil is flexibleon retaining the language as agreed in a consensual text. So just dropping out the matter of urgency. Wecan support the European proposal. Thank you. Thank you. Can we now move to subparagraph C? Considerratifying the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discriminationif they have not done so. I see no requests for the floor. I would like to request yes, I give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a drafting suggestion. Wewere thinking in terms of logic if we should not put C before B. So 1st you ask everyone to ratify and then you ask those who have reservations to withdraw. But that's a cosmetic just for logical purposes.Thank you. Can we agree upon the proposal by the European Union to move subparagraph C, put it as paragraph B and then we will have paragraph B becoming paragraph C. And as I do not see any additionalrequests for the floor, we move the paragraph and we highlight it in green. And then we will move tosubparagraph D. D, which reads undertake a comprehensive review of domestic legislation with a view toidentifying, amending and abolishing provisions in order to effectively combat direct or indirectdiscrimination. I welcome inputs, comments to this paragraph. Subparagraph D, Article 5, Paragraph 2,subparagraph D. I do not see any Delegation requesting for the floor. I would like to ask the Secretariatto highlight it in green. And we move to subparagraph E. Subparagraph E reads, yes, it reads adopt orstrengthen anti-discrimination legislation to make it comprehensive and ensure its effective implementation.Any comments, addition? I see the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union. You have thefloor. Our suggestion is to add after the words to make it comprehensive, the words in line with theICERD. Thank you very much. Thank you. We have adopt or strengthen anti-discrimination legislation to makeit comprehensive in line with the ICERD and ensure its effective implementation. Comments, inputs?Before we approve it with the inputs from the European Union, yes, I see the Distinguished Delegation of the State of Palestine. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We echo the EU when in line withthe ICERD and to add other relevant international instruments. The other relevant internationalinstruments that are mentioned in the declaration, but that's what I mean by relevant. The other above mentioned international instruments or the above relevant international instruments, what do you see necessary?Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Panama requesting for the floor. You have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. We were pretty okay with the paragraph as it was drafted originally. We doappreciate the proposal presented by the European Union, but we are concerned somewhat the scope of the paragraph, are we just limiting it to the Convention? When the proposals or the proposal recentlymade by the State of Palestine, that seems to broaden things. We can support both inclusions. We don't think it should be limited just to CERD because in various regional mechanisms we have adopted conventionsand agreements that are linked to the fight against racial discrimination and that would also be very relevant to ensure the rights of persons of African descent. So that would be our comment. We can eithersupport the original paragraph or we can support the proposal from the EU as long as it goes hand in hand with the proposal from the State of Palestine. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. Thank you, Madam Chair. We also support the comment made byPanama. We don't think that necessarily just needs to be restricted to the Convention with the new proposal put forward by the State of Palestine. I think it's a bit more comprehensive. I don't know ifthe EU could agree to perhaps putting that part of the sentence at the end of the paragraph because perhaps putting it in the middle here isn't so consistent as you got it there. It's like the 2ndidea but we could put it might not be that clear to what we are referring to. Ensure its effective implementation is kind of tacked on the end. Are we talking about effective implementation of documentsor of anti-discrimination legislation? It's not necessarily that clear. So if we keep the idea, we perhaps need to include it but then after coming at the end of the paragraph. Thank you, Cuba. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. As a matter of fact, Brazil would suggestto retain the text as what it was originally drafted because whenever you are considering adopting or strengthening a legislation, you can have any source to do that, not only a 3rd or internationalinstruments. I mean, we are at the beginning of this session today in the morning. We mentioned how important could be some input from the civil society. It's not going to be a legally binding instrumentbut can be a new start that will help us to improve and strengthen our legislation. So if we can keepthat and not restrain from any source, that would be helpful. That's my point. Thank you. Thank you, Brazil. I give the floor to Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. We echo suggestions to add in line with theICERD and other relevant international instruments. I also echo the proposal by the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba to keep it in the end of the sentence after to ensure its effective implementation. Thankyou. Yes, I would like to ask the Distinguished Delegation of European Union if they are in agreementof moving in line with the ICERD at the end of the paragraph. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Ithink moving it towards the end is not much of a problem. I'm just reflecting this was a minor I meanit's in my instructions clearly but it's a minor ask and I feel that maybe we are complicating matters beyond what is necessary. I would be willing to take this back to my group to see if we can maybe justwithdraw our proposal so that we can move on but would it be possible that I confirm thattomorrow morning, Madam Chair? Yes. I think we are willing to wait until tomorrow but the Secretariatwould reflect also this proposal so that thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Iran. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to support adding both of proposal to in line with ICERD and other relevant international instruments but as a package. Our support is for adding to asa package, I think. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would like to support the sentiments just expressed by Iran to retain the language that says in line with the ICERD and also other international relevant internationalorganizations. Support that formulation. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I think we on this specificsubparagraph E, we promised European Union and Delegations to come back. Maybe we will be able to have a common language that will be adopted by all of us. I would like to recommend that we move tosubparagraph F. Provide effective protection for people of African descent and review and repeal alllaws that have a discriminatory effect on people of African descent facing multiple aggravated orintersecting forms of discrimination. Comments, inputs to this paragraph, subparagraph F. I see the DistinguishedDelegation of Egypt requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to propose keeping the last sentence of the paragraph as multiple or aggravated forms ofdiscrimination and deleting or intersecting. Thank you. Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa requesting for the floor. You have the floor. I'm terrible. Sorry, Madam. I forgot toremove it. Yes. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Iraq requesting for the floor. You have the floor.We would like to support the proposal made by our colleague from Egypt. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Very briefly for supporting the proposal madeby my colleague from Egypt and Iraq on deleting, intersecting. I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia. Thank you, Madam Chair. Colombia supportskeeping, intersecting. Thank you. Apologies. We are waiting for our colleague. We are not so friendlywith her laptop. But now I think it's coming. Yes. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Panama. Thank you, Madam Chair. We were entirely satisfied with both that the paragraph was drafted originally. But given that there have been proposals, we would like to joinColombia to request the retention of intersecting. Thank you. Yes. I see the Distinguished Delegationof Colombia requesting for the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. The proposal is to keep the initiallanguage or intersecting. Keep the original language. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of Ecuador. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Very briefly, we just wantedto leave on record that we would like to keep or intersecting in this paragraph. Thank you. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes,Brazil supports keeping the original text as it was drafted and keeping or intersecting. Nonetheless,to be trying to be constructive, since this might be the most toxic word nowadays in this Council,I would ask and it is really a fair and a real, a frank request that I make here to the Distinguished Membersof civil society or if we have academia here. One of my readings tells me that there is also another possibility and I don't know if it is that as toxic of intersecting but it would be a possibility forus to consider maybe cross-cutting would be interesting to that. It is just a proposal that I make to our Distinguished Colleagues to assist us trying to find a formulation for that and notactually a it is food for thought, okay? Let's try to see if we can find another language that willdeal with our the different aspects that inflict discrimination to African descendants. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Nigeria.Thank you, Madam Chair. We would just like to support the proposal of Egypt and colleagues from Iran and Iraq to delete of intersecting. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of the European Union. Thank you very much. We have two proposals for this text. The 1stone is to add after the words for people of African descent the words as for all persons because webelieve it is important from a legal point of view that whatever legal initiative that you take,that you don't discriminate between your population and, of course, it has to be done for people of African descent but not only. And I would hope that this can fix that concern while keeping, of course,the importance of mentioning people of African descent as the main group. The 2nd comment, I don'timmediately have text proposal but we have how should I say it? The expression laws that have a discriminatoryeffect is difficult to interpret from a legal perspective. It lacks legal clarity. Either a law isdiscriminatory or it is not. But have a discriminatory effect is a bit vague in our point. But I apologize.I would have to reflect on a better term, maybe just discriminatory laws. And then lastly with regard to the discussion that is starting on intersecting, we had very heated debates on this issue in November. Ithink we spent at least half a day, if not almost a full day, discussing just this at every singleparagraph where it was mentioned. And I would like to repeat that the European Union is also of the opinion that it is very regretful that the deletion of the adjective \"intersecting\" is requested in thecontext of this declaration. There is not a single mechanism of the UN. Look at the reports of the special rapporteur, the working group on people of African descent, the permanent forum. They all usethis adjective in the context of the fight against racism. And what we are seeing here is a spillover of a discussion that we have at the Council in a different context to this discussion where it does not belong. The word \"intersecting\" makes perfectly sense when we are talking about discrimination onthe basis of race. We are not in a gender discussion here. And there have never been references to what we agreed on in the context of the fight to racism in the gender context. This is unnecessary in my opinionand is kind of watering down what we are trying to achieve here. If you want to tackle racism in aholistic manner, everyone knows according to the academic and the political point of view that you have to do that in an intersecting forum because it all comes together. If you are a person of Africandescent, if you live in poor socioeconomic conditions, religion pops into that as well. But gender pops into that at the same level. But it aggravates the situation that that person is in. So your policieshave to take that into account and have to be horizontal. You have to implement it in your housing policy, in your employment policy, in your education policy. And that is exactly what we mean when we say\"intersecting\" forms of discrimination. And it is a pity that because of the fact that this word is toxic in the gender area that we are no longer allowed to use it here. It is actually taking us a stepback. That's what I wanted to share. Apologies for being a bit long. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. Typically I wouldchime in here in support of the word \"intersecting.\" What I will propose instead actually is that we consider deleting this F. If you look up to letter D, it has very much the same effect where we are calling on states to do a comprehensive review of all of their laws with a view towards amending orabolishing those that have a discriminatory effect. The language up in D is I think much more effective and clear legally. As has been pointed out, the language here is not quite as good. So I think if we were to maintain D, which is already in green, we would have the same effect and it makes F unnecessary.The proposal would be to eliminate F entirely and to move on. Thank you. Yes. There is a new proposalfor eliminating this subparagraph F. But if I remember well, there was also a contribution from the EuropeanUnion Delegation to instead of having laws that have discriminatory effect on people of African descent,using discriminatory laws. I don't know if we can also keep it as an input to thisparagraph. Any additional comments, inputs to this paragraph F, taking into consideration the inputsfrom the United States and the European Union? Yes. United States, you have the floor. Just to clarify, I would like to request that at the end of it there be the proposal to delete paragraph. Again, giventhat it is adequately covered in D, a little bit further up. You can just put at the end, okay. Ithink there could also be some use of shorthand where we say things like delete paragraph, USA, something like that, just to make this a little bit shorter. So you are welcome to rather than this, you could always just put something like delete paragraph or keep paragraph as is as well to make it easierto track later on. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a question to Distinguished Delegates from Brazil and EU. ForBrazil's suggestion, I thank her so much for trying to propose a compromise to move forward. I will take it to capital and get back on it at a later stage. For the EU's explanation, I understand where you are coming from, but I understand as well that we are being we are not trying to go back. We arebeing true to the language that's in the DDPA, multiple or aggravated. And you cannot help but imagine that there is a spillover from the gender to the racial discrimination discussion because when we are speaking about multiple aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, we are notconfining it to racial discrimination per se. We are speaking of different forms of discrimination. It is not only confined to the racial discussion or racism. We are not saying forms of racism. So this is aconcern to a lot of countries in the room. And I think we had this debate last time. You are right. Andno need to repeat it. Thank you. Thank you. From the permanent forum. Thank you, Chair. I would likejust to echo what was said by Colombia and others and the detailed presentation made by the DistinguishedRepresentative of the EU to say that I'm aware that this issue has been debated at length in this groupbut to reiterate that it is of paramount importance to the permanent forum that this reference tomultiple aggravated and intersecting go down in the text, be reflected in the text. So the forum has been very adamant about that because as I said, it is practical. The UN Committee on racial discriminationin all its general observations to states has included the reference, those references because itenables us to address the various dimensions that affect the victims of racism and discrimination. So without prejudice to make progress at this moment, I would like to urge Delegations who are here andwho have objected to this reference, I would urge them to reconsider and show flexibility and to lookat the context in which we are working here. I do stress we can still go forward but we will keep the permanent forum will keep coming back to this issue. This is very important for us. Now if theproposal of the U.S. is accepted, which is possible to integrate, either way we would call for reiteratethe need for indirect discrimination that we could add the reference to multiple aggravated or intersectingor forms of discrimination that affect people of African descent. That's our position on that issue which I want to make clear. Moving on, since I have the floor, I also want to highlight the reference,the proposal, in fact, it's in the text made by the EU adding the phrase as for all persons, now we are talking about here the rights of persons of African descent. We are not talking about other groups here.So that reference to all persons doesn't seem to be relevant here, let's say. I think it could generate some confusion and I don't think it has added value for the purposes that we are striving towards. Thankyou. Thank you very much, Pastor Morello. I do not see any additional request for the floor. We have coveredyes, Mexico is requesting for the floor. We have the floor. Thank you just to state our support forintersecting. Thank you. Mexico, I was going to say that we have done one half of our afternoon session.I would like to allow you some 5 min break before we come back and move to next subparagraph.Thank you. If you can go back to your seats, please. Then we were at the subparagraph G which readspromote the effective implementation of national and international legal frameworks against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of violence and intolerance including measures toacknowledge, correct and redress the lasting consequences of colonialism, slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Of course, this is a paragraph that we had reviewed before. This is whywe will see this adopted by IGWG but your comments, inputs are welcome. I see Pastor Morello requestingfor the floor. Secretariat, please delete adopted by IGWG. Thank you, Madam Chair. This morning I referto contributions from academia including from consultations held by the human rights institutefrom Dayton Arizona University in association with other organizations including the human rights instituteof Pretoria University among contributions from academic institutions. Therefore, I would add at the end of this paragraph, I would add the following phrases: Through reparation and other institutionalsupport mechanisms that would be the contribution from those academic contributions that I would like to put to the consideration of the room. Thank you. Thank you. I see the representative of NGO requestingfor the floor. Yes, we also have the view that it is important to add at the end of this throughthe reparations and other relevant measures, reparations should be there. And we also would like to seethe Afrophobia reinstituted after xenophobia like it was in the original document from the Chair. Thank you.Thank you. I see the Distinguished Representative of European Union requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We have a suggestion that is in line with something we suggested previouslywhich would be to replace the verb correct with the verb confront. And I know there was no consensuson that previously but this is the instruction I have on point G. I will also I would like to expressmy gratitude for the fact that this text was adapted. As you know, the term Afrophobia in our view at this point is not in line with existing international law. It is a term that is developing. It is being usedmore and more. I agree. But there is no clear line yet between all the key players about how we interpret it. That doesn't mean that we are blatantly rejecting it but we believe it is too early to put it here.Thank you. Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of United Kingdom.Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, as we discussed this morning, I'm going to have to ask for theUK's reservation on the part of the paragraph here that begins including measures. This goes way furtherthan anything that we have ever agreed before in any international forums. Notwithstanding our reservations about the content here, it also looks like it has been tacked on to the end of a paragraph that istalking about something completely different which is promoting the implementation of national and international legal frameworks. Just a food for thought. It doesn't look like it really relatesthe two things don't look like they really relate to each other. Thanks. Thank you. I give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Palestine has explained today morning the word correct andconfront are not similar. So we prefer to keep the word correct, I think. Thank you. I do not seeany requests for the floor. Yes, I see the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. You have the floor.Thank you. Generally speaking, we support the paragraph as it was at the start, as reached at the last session of the Working Group. But thinking about the comment made by UK in the perhaps thereference including measures, what we could do is maybe separate the 2nd part in a separateparagraph and instead of including, we could put another paragraph, we could talk about ad hoc measures and then the paragraph would continue as it is. And we would like if possible if that wasto be reflected on the screen, that's to say the proposal made by the experts, both by Pastor Murillo as well as the NGO with respect to reparation measures because we think that in the past,in the previous session, there was a long debate on this theme and even though now we are not ready yet to reach a consensus, I do think it would be important to maintain in the document a referenceto that debate that took place and that it is an issue that we need to keep thinking about. So my proposal is therefore to separate two paragraphs, end the 1st part with intolerance, full stop,and then open a new paragraph that would begin with adopt necessary measures, e.g. . We areflexible as to correct or confront. We are very flexible in here. And at the end, we would askthe experts to read out the proposed wording that they had on the theme of reparations. Thank you.I would like to ask Pastor Murillo to come again and provide the inputs related to reparation.As the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba has just supported that we have it included to this paragraph.Thank you. Yes. So at the end of the text, promoting effective application, legal framework, national frameworks against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of violence, intolerance including measures to acknowledge, correct and redress the lastingconsequences of colonialism, slavery and the transatlantic slave trade and then the addition recommended by academia which is through reparations and other institutional support mechanisms. I thinkthat introduces a functional element into the paragraph. And thank you to you, Chair, and thankyou very much to the Distinguished Delegations who have supported that recommendation. I see theDistinguished Delegation of Brazil requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving me the floor and especially thank you for Cuba for suggesting this amendmentto the text. In line with that, I would suggest for letter G then to take what's written in H.So we are separating what's now referred to the past. I would streamline a little bit and havethat so I will read that slowly to make my proposal clear for the G. Okay? So promote the effectiveimplementation of national and international legal frameworks, adopt, strengthen and implement actionorientated policies, programs and projects to combat and then goes on and then we should strike againstand go on with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, full stop,as proposed by Cuba would take the 1st part of H putting together with the G.Yes, can you come back and give the text after legal frameworks?Yeah, adopt, strengthen, implement, action, orientate, oh, okay, no, implement, action, orientation,orientated policies, programs, policies, orientation, orientated policies, programs and projects to combatracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, full stop. That would be ourproposal for G and then H as proposed by Cuba and we also support the proposal made by the permanentforum and as a consequence the H letter that we have as drafted would be deleted. Yes, are your inputsto Paragraph G reflected on the screen? Can you use the mic? And Brazil also supports the proposal made byCuba with the addition made by the permanent forum, yeah. Thank you. Yes, for the correct and confront,what is the position of Brazil? We would prefer correct. Yes, in the spirit of checking if we couldbe able to have an agreed upon Paragraph, we have the 1st part of the Paragraph and the additionalParagraph that was suggested by Cuba and supported by Brazil. I welcome comments, inputs to these proposalsbefore we move to next subparagraph. I see the Distinguished Delegation of China requesting for thefloor. You have the floor. Thank you. We support the position or theproposal voiced by Brazil and Cuba, namely we agree with what is proposed as an addition there. Thank you.Thank you. I see Venezuela requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We supportthe proposal from Cuba. Thank you. Thank you. I see the Delegation of South Africa requesting for thefloor. You have the floor. Thank you, Chair. Thank you once again. My Delegation would like to support the proposals as made by Cuba, Brazil and China and also to retain the formulation correct instead ofof contract. So we prefer the formulation that is on the screen with the word \"correct.\" Thank you.Thank you. Egypt Delegation. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. I also join my colleagues on adding of preparations and other relevant measures in the 2nd part and to keep \"correct\" rather than \"confront\"and for the 1st part of the yes, I would also support the suggestion made by the Delegation of Brazil and I would suggest also adding implement action oriented policies, programs and projectsto prevent and combat racism, racial discrimination. Thank you. Thank you, Egypt. The Distinguished Delegation of Iran, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the proposal made by my colleague fromBrazil and Cuba, we are supportive but we at the next yeah. For the text proposed by Cuba and Brazil, weare supportive but we suggest to replace \"adopt\" by \"take necessary effective and immediate measures.\"Thank you. Thank you. I would like to ask the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba, Brazil, China,Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt and Iran if they are agreeable with the inputs provided by Iran. Replacing\"adopt\" by \"take\" and including effective and immediate measures in addition to necessary. I see theDistinguished Delegation of Syria. Yes, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to add myvoice in supporting this proposal and also we agree with the proposal by Iran to add \"take effective and immediate measures.\" Thank you. South Africa, you have the floor. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Wesupport the proposal. It's even stronger than the previous formulation. Thank you. Thank you, South Africa.Cuba, you have the floor. Yes, Madam Chair. We are flexible on this proposal introduced by Iran. Regardingthe previous paragraph, we also support the proposal from Brazil with the change suggested by Egypt onprevent. We are also flexible on that. Thank you. Thank you. Can I take it that on the next part of the paragraph,we propose that we can have all the countries that supported the addition of this separate paragraphagreeing with inputs from Iran. Then we will have the names of the countries in the 1st part added to the list of countries that have suggested this separate paragraph. I see the European Union Delegationrequesting the floor. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. As I'm following the discussions,I'm a bit concerned that, again, we are doubling our own work. We have Article 19 that is going to come up which is entirely dedicated to the issue of reparations. It's a very long and detailed article.And I will not hide that we have some very strong legal concerns on Article 19, which kind of obliges me to say that on this paragraph, too, I cannot agree at this moment until we have the wider discussion onArticle 19 at least. There is much more behind the sentence than at 1st sight, of course. We all know that this is the hardest part of the negotiation. My suggestion would be not to putthis in Article 4. Article 4 is on state obligations to promote the full and effective equality. It's verymuch current policies. That would be my proposal. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you. In a sense of compromise, I think Ibelieve we can take this as it was proposed by Iran, effective and immediate to get necessary in a senseof compromise and keeping a positive note for the measures that can be taken. Thank you. Yes, I seethe Distinguished Delegation of China requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you. We supportadditional proposal by Iran. Thank you. Yes, Cuba. Thank you, Madam Chair. Given that all countriesthat have supported the paragraph have proven to be flexible regarding Iran's proposal, perhaps we can clean it up a little bit. Perhaps we can delete the dot and delete the list of countries for this 1st part because I think it's clearer if we just delete that list of countries initially given that we haveflexibility. Thank you. Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba, you still have thefloor. Sorry, I just don't understand the square bracket there. Does that refer to the whole paragraphor just the last part on reparations? I don't really understand why that whole part is in square brackets.It is still in brackets because it's a suggestion to have a separate paragraph and this is only supportedby the countries that are between the brackets. Not all the countries have supported to have a separateparagraph. This is the way I understand it. This is why we are keeping the names of the countrieson the screen. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia, you have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to ask for you to include our name in that list of countriessupporting. Thank you. Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Bolivia. Could you also addus to the list of countries that supports. Thank you. Thank you, Bolivia. Paraguay, you have the floor.Thank you. Please add Paraguay to that list. Thank you. Thank you, Algeria. Thank you very much, MadamChair. Please add Algeria to the list of countries supporting this paragraph. Thank you. Thank you,Panama. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Very briefly, Panama would also like tojoin the list of countries supporting this paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. May I ask if Member States are in agreement to have a separate paragraph, not that we agree with all in this paragraph because I notedthe reservation by the EU on the reparation, but if the principle of having a separate paragraph isagreeable with all of us. I see the Distinguished Delegation of United Kingdom requesting for the floor. You have the floor. I almost feel like I don't need to say that we obviously reserve our positionon this entire paragraph. Thank you. I do not see any Delegation requesting for the floor. Wewould move to subparagraph H. I see European Union Delegation, you have the floor. Coming back, but would it be possible to reflect our comment in the text with regard to changing correct in to confrontbecause it was there before but I'm not sure where exactly It is previous. It is not there anymore.Yes, it is there. Split, of course, in case the paragraph does get split in the end,the proposal would still stand for now. I will take this back to my group to discuss, but just so that itdoesn't get lost. Thank you very much. We move to subparagraph H which reads adopt, strengthen andimplement action oriented policies, programs and projects to combat racism, racial discrimination,xenophobia and related intolerance, design sure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by people of African descent. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Well, as expressed before, I made a suggestion. In this case, if wecould adapt if it is agreeable to have some elements of this text adopting the previous item,then I think we could go for the deletion. Otherwise, we can keep as it is. Thank you. Cuba Delegation.Thank you, Madam Chair. Cuba has a proposed new paragraph, but we would like some clarification on whether H is going to be deleted or whether you are going to merge it with the proposal fromBrazil. As that's defined, then we would add our proposal for a paragraph BIS, but that would depend on the outcome of the previous one, I think. Yes. Let's 1st discuss on the possibility of havingthis okay, colleagues, excellencies, if I understood well, Brazil took words from Paragraph H and wereincluded into the Paragraph G and this is the reason the Brazil Delegation is suggesting that we deleteParagraph H. Are you in agreement with this proposal by the Delegation of Brazil? Can the Secretariat godown to H and then give some time to Delegation to read and then go back to yes, I see the Delegationof Brazil requesting the floor. Maybe she will bring clarifications. Thank you. No, just to make clearthat since we agreed in splitting the items, I think in G we should erase, delete where we start includingmeasures to acknowledge and all from now we should simply delete I mean to make it more yes. I'm notsure if we agreed on splitting. Okay. I understood we had but still okay. Sorry for that. Then let me askagain, did we agree the Paragraph G splitting to two and have a separate Paragraph? I do not see anyDelegation requesting for the floor and we can take it as agreed that we are splitting Paragraph G intotwo. Then we have Paragraph G and Paragraph H. Yes. This is what we have as Paragraph G. Do we haveinputs to this to what we have or do we agree with keeping the inputs like they appear here? Then wewill have we move to new Paragraph H that we start by take necessary. Yes. Then the new Paragraph Hwill start by taking necessary effective immediate with all the reservation and inputs that we have gotfrom the Delegation. This will be Paragraph H and we now we are proposing to have the previous ParagraphH. Do we all agree that this previous Paragraph H can be deleted? And because its content is takeninto consideration in the previous Paragraph G as any Delegation requesting for the floor, we will deletethis Paragraph and move to next Paragraph which reads adopt special measures such as I see Cuba requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. As I said previously, we do have aproposal for a new Paragraph which in this case would be HBIS. It would read as follows: Adopt,strengthen and implement all necessary measures and effective legislation to prevent the continuedracially violent and discriminatory practices committed against people of African descent, includingdisproportionate use of force, police brutality and systemic racism in criminal justice systems,and ensure that such acts are treated with impunity. Thank you. Thank you, Cuba. I will go to the DistinguishedDelegation of the United States. Thank you very much, Madam. First I want to ask if there is a source from which that language comes. It would be helpful to know if it is, e.g. , consensual language from somewhere else just for our context. The other question is technical and that is the Englishtranslation. It is coming through very weak. If someone could take a look at the sound for whenever somebody speaks in a nonEnglish language, it is coming through in English, almost impossible to hear.Thank you. Can we get a feedback by Cuba Delegation on the source of the Paragraph? Thank you.Thank you. Thank you to the colleague from the U.S. for the question which allows us to explain the rationale. The language was based on the spirit and objective of 4721 of the Human Rights Council whichwas a resolution adopted by consensus on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of people of African descent specifically against the excessive use of violations of humanrights by law enforcement agents. The objective of the resolution is based on the spirit of the OPs of that resolution. Nevertheless, it is not verbatim any of the paragraphs because we don't think any of theparagraphs agreed here could fully reflect the spirit of the document of that nature. That document is asuperior norm which we should be more emphatic on when it comes to certain concerns as in this case. Butgenerally speaking, yes, it draws on terminology from the OPs in that resolution 4721 from the year 2021.Thank you. Thank you. Can I give the Delegation the floor? Yes.I support the proposal by my colleague from Cuba and we propose to add the after police brutality and racialprofiling. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. I would like to check if thereare comments, inputs, to this newly proposed paragraph. Yes, you have the floor. Thank you,Chair. Just to support what was proposed by Cuba, Iran regarding language. Thank you. Yes, I see theDistinguished Representative of the European Union requesting for the floor. You have the floor.Thank you, Chair. I remember very well when we managed to reach consensus in the Human Rights Council on this important resolution. I would have to take this back to my group, but an initial comment that I wouldhave because I remember from the negotiations is that we decided to use the word police brutality in that resolution by the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials which is more legalistic butin that sense also as a term and so maybe instead of I understand it was drafted in the spirit of the text but disproportionate use of force, police brutality, you could have the correct term fromthe resolution which is excessive use of force by law enforcement officers. And the other reason why Iremember very well this consensual resolution is by the way because it has a very interesting PP that says recognizing also that systemic racism is intersectional by nature as it spreads in a variety of social settings that in order to tackle systemic racism and discrimination response measures shouldalso just giving it as a source. Yes, we are waiting for the feedback from the European Union tomorrow.Can we ask the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba if they are agreeable of replacing police brutality bythe suggested word by the EU? We need to consult with capital but right now we would prefer to keep thelanguage as we proposed originally. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Brazil. Thank you. I think we are at this moment trying to find the good places for goodproposal. I think this is a good proposal. I'm just one would seek some clarification from part of Cubato understand why this should be in this paragraph and not in the in Article 17 when we deal with differentaspects of that and if I'm not mistaken, if I'm reading that properly, we have racial profiling dealtin 17B, 1B and we have different aspects also taken care in 17E, adopt effective appropriate measures includingmeasures as appropriate to combat all acts of racism, incitement to racial violence or incitement to racial we have some good language there and I don't know if that would be just some clarification. I wouldseek for some clarification to be put in the four adding or considering that for the 17. Thank you.Thank you. Distinguished Delegation of Cuba, you have the floor. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Brazil for the question. We think that the idea of including this paragraph here is specifically becausethis is where we're defining what the obligations are of states with respect to the document as a whole and we think that this is a topic sufficiently relevant to reference in this section to it and later as Brazilrightly noted in 17 there we go into more depth into the whole framework for protection against use of forceand other issues related to police violence but here when we are giving a list of what would be the main commitments obligation of states should our duty bound by then we think this is a sufficiently importanttheme, the theme of use of force as well as brutality because it is one of the themes that affects people of African descent and it is one of the themes where states must really turn their focus on and seekto address. Thank you. Thank you. I propose that we keep this new paragraph proposed by the DistinguishedDelegation of Cuba. I see the Delegation of Brazil requesting the floor. You have the floor.I appreciate Cuba's Distinguished Colleague's clarifications and indeed in principle, yes, Brazil can support the text and we would prefer the language proposed by EU when considering police brutality orexcessive use of force by law enforcement officials. I think there is a typo there. I think and as I said,racial profiling, I don't know if we are adding to many elements but we are flexible about racialprofiling as proposed but we are flexible. Thank you. Thank you. United States. Thank you very much. Wewould also support for the same reasons laid out by the EU that these were very heavily discussed issues to use the term excessive use of force by law enforcement officers. I would also support Brazil'sgood suggestion that to maintain in this document that we try to group issues together and this is actually an issue that is covered exhaustively in Article 17. I would implore us to think about adding it in Article 17 as a way to keep this coherent. A lot of these issues are addressed already in Article17 although not necessarily in this totality. It can be added there and considered there butI rather than try to add a bunch of things to the beginning of the articles, let's keep some flowto this document and consider adding it in Article 17 where it really has a good home. Thank you. I do notsee any other Delegation requesting for the floor. United States would like to take the floor again.Okay. I would like to suggest that we move to next subparagraph. Thank you. I was asking why we arekeeping it the paragraph as HBs but the Secretariat told me that they will be cleaning and giving a newnumbering to the paragraphs after the 1st reading. Then we go to Paragraph I, adopt special measures such as affirmative action policies where appropriate to alleviate and remedy disparities and disadvantagesin the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms affecting people of African descent,protecting them from discrimination and over persistent structural disparities and de facto inequalities resulting from historical circumstances. Inputs, I see the Distinguished Delegation of Mexico,you have the floor. Thank you, Chair. In this para, as it is about affirmative action,it would be positive to make a special reference to women of African descent and the importance of adopting special affirmative political measures to protect and promote their rights. So we would liketo propose specifically and sort of halfway down the paragraph where it is affecting people of Africandescent, add, the women and girls of African descent, and that would be everything. Thank you. I don't seeany request for the floor. I see Brazil requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Just not to lose the opportunity to say it is a quite important addition made by Mexico that we support. Thank you.Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of United Kingdom. Thanks. We would just ask to addpositive in front sorry, it would be positive or affirmative action policies in the 1st line, suchas positive or affirmative action policies. That's the phrasing that we are using throughout the rest ofthe text. Thanks. Thank you. Ecuador Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you. With respect tothis subparagraph, we support the paragraph as it is. Also we find very important the proposal made byMexico. So we fully support the addition of women and girls. Thank you. I would like to give the floor tothe United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think we would look favorably in general on Mexico's good proposal. One tweak I would like to propose to that is to replace particularly with including. And thereason why I propose that is that in many contexts it is actually males of African descent who suffer intersecting forms of discrimination more strongly. I'm thinking, e.g. , in cases of law enforcement,in some places enrollment in universities and high schools is actually lower among boys or men than women or girls. So just the proposal would be to say including rather than particularly to highlightwomen and girls but to also acknowledge that it can go in both directions as well. It can bethe women and girls or others who face particularly strong forms of discrimination. Thank you. Thankyou. I don't see any requests for the floor. Can I consider this text with inputs from latest inputsthe Delegation of the U.S. agreeable to all of us? Yes. I would like to ask the Secretariat to highlightthis in green and delete the different suggestion made and inputs made by different Delegations. Let'smove to subparagraph J which reads elaborate and implement national plans of action to promotediversity, equality, equity, social justice, equality of opportunity and the participation of all. I wouldlike to ask the Secretariat to delete adopted by IGWG and also as I do not see any request for the floor for comments input to this paragraph suggest that it is also highlighted in green before we move toparagraph K reads establish and or strengthen mechanisms or institutions with a view to formulating, monitoring and implementing policies to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and promotingracial equality with the participation of representatives of people of African descent. Yourinput comments are welcome. I see Mexico Delegation requesting for the floor. You have the floor.We have a suggestion to bolster the text, give it greater weight when it comes to representation ofrepresentatives of people of African descent which we think should be full effective participationwhen it comes to formulating, monitoring, implementing policies to combat racism. Therefore in that regard we would like to suggest that after with the we add full and effective participation and the rest as is.Thank you. I do not see any requests for the floor. I see NGO requesting for the floor. You have thefloor. Yes, I still believe that the term Afrophobia should be brought back also into this paragraph. Iwould like to quote the recommendations from the working group of experts on people of African descent because they are not here. They stated in their in they stated that the recognition by the Human RightsCouncil of the term Afrophobia as had been recommended by the working group of experts requires an active and systematic follow-up in order to assure the full implementation of this important assertion of thespecial and unique form of discrimination faced by people of African descent and assuring its equaluse with analogous terms that are used to address the stigmatization and prejudice against ethnic,religious and other vulnerable groups. So this is how the updated term Afrophobia started to come intothe UN human rights system and, of course, the Afrophobia term is just an updating in itself by the Negrophobia term that was in existence in the 1990s in the UN human rights system, including inthe special rapporteur. It is just that the word Negrophobia which is coming from the states in the1830s. So it is an older term than antisemitism, e.g. . So Afrophobia is just an updating of a term, the special character of Negrophobia when there were no longer any Negroes. So therefore, it hadto be changed. There was an interregnum where we did not have the term but we are now putting it fully back. This is what it is about. It is very well established and based. So that is why I continueto insist that it is brought back where it is appropriate and that is where we show how to bringit back in the appropriate paragraphs. This is my point here. I thank you. Thank you. Can I take itas a paragraph that we agree upon with the inputs from Mexico? Yes. I would like to ask the Secretariatto highlight it in green and move to Paragraph L, subparagraph L which reads establish and/or strengthenindependent human rights institutions as appropriate in conformity with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, the Paris principlesand/or similar mechanisms with the participation of civil society by them with adequate financial resources, competence and capacity for protection, promotion and monitoring to combat racism, racialdiscrimination, xenophobia, Afrophobia and related intolerance. Your inputs, yes, I see the Distinguished Representative of the European Union requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, MadamChair. It won't surprise anyone that I will request a deletion of Afrophobia here. I think it is wise to use the same terminology throughout the declaration and that's the terminology we have agreed on withafter difficult negotiations and lengthy negotiations in the DDPA. Thank you. United States Delegation, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair and for the sake of consistency we would also support thedeletion of Afrophobia. I would like to request at the beginning similarly as we do with the instruments, et cetera, that rather than say establish, that we could say consider establishing and/or strengthening,so it would be adding the word consider and then ending established and strengthen with ING in bothcases. Thanks. Thank you. Can I consider that we are in agreement with theparagraph except on the use of Afrophobia but if the rest of the paragraph, if we are agreeable with the rest of the paragraph, I would maybe request the Secretariat to put the rest of the paragraph ingreen and only remain with the use of Afrophobia with the reservation of EU and USA. The Delegation of South Africa requested for the floor. Thank you very much, Chair. In view of what you have just said,Chair, we would like to propose that we retain this for now while we are consulting with South Africa.We may have to revert in particular the phrase Afrophobia. Let's ask then, yes, if it is onAfrophobia, we are not, we will keep it to be for next consideration but if the rest of the text isagreeable to you with inputs from the USA, we can highlight the rest in green because using theterminology of Afrophobia will be coming throughout the text of the declaration. I see no request for the floor. I would like to request the Secretariat to highlight the content of the subparagraph in greenand only remain with the reservation of the use of Afrophobia. Would South Africa Delegation maybesuggest that we keep it so that it is reflected for the time being? Okay. Excellencies, dear colleagues,let me give the floor to the Brazilian Delegation. I was going to close. We are already 6:00 p.m.I'm sorry. I'm taking the floor at this point. I haven't seen the time. It's just because we would like to propose new text but I will send that to the Secretariat by email and then we can look at thattomorrow but additions to this Article 5 that we are dealing. Thank you. Thank you very much. Excellencies, dear colleagues, thank you very much for your active participation. I would like to thank again theinterpreters for the good work they have done. I wish you a very good evening and look forward to see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. same place here. Good night. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to order the 2047th meeting of the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee this morning will proceed with Agenda Item 4, consideration of reports submitted by states, parties and Article 18 of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

I take this opportunity to extend a warm welcometo all those who are here present in the room and all those who are online observers on thewebcast during this dialogue by UN Web TV. I would now like to let me see if I can pronouncethis right. I would like to give the floor to Mr. Wee who is the representative of the embassyhere in Geneva who will be introducing the Delegation. Sir, you have the floor very briefly. Thank youvery much, Madam Chair and Distinguished Delegates. Allow me 1st off on behalf of the Delegation of the Central African Republic, the CAR, to convey my sincere gratitude and appreciationto the Bureau and to all of the stakeholders that have taken part in the coordination and drafting of this periodic report on the Convention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In particular, I would like to commend the Secretariat of the Committee aswell as the interpreters, the sound text as well who have made it possible to hold this meeting. I also would like to thank all of the Delegates in particular for their constructive contribution through recommendations that will be made today referring to the Committee members,that is the Delegation of the CAR. It is composed as follows: His Excellency, Dr. Mart Augustine Kirima, the Minister of Protection for Gender, Women and Children and Families, Head of Delegation;Mr. Julius Negodoba, the Head of the Mission for Human Rights and the Ministry of Justice tasked with Human Rights and Good Governance; Madam Melvin Julia Mago-Guerre, the Director-Generalfor the Protection of Women, Families and Children; Mr. Theodore Koinam, the Director-General for the Promotion of Gender; and lastly, Mr. Max Victorian Nagoma Maka, the Director for GenderPromotion. Allow me to also underscore the presence among us of the Honorable Marie-Christine Patassé, that is the Deputy in our Parliament, a representative also to our Central Africanand in our Central African Republic. We have an inclusive Delegation and our Delegation wishes to surely imbibe our work with that representative nature. I have the pleasure of giving the floorat this time to Madam Minister Kirima for her preliminary remarks. Your Excellency, you have the floor. With your leave, Mr. McQueen, allow me to also on behalf of the Committee offera very warm welcome to the Head of Delegation, this high level Delegation led, as you have said, by Madam Minister Kiramat. As you have said, she is the Minister for Promotion of GenderEquality and the Protection of Women, Families and Children. I should like to recall to the Head of Delegation that her statement cannot go beyond 30 minutes. I also wish to recallto all of those in the Delegation that you are to allow for complete and full interpretation of your statements. We ask that all speakers to speak at a reasonable pace and in a naturalspeaking voice. Thank you very much, Madam Minister. The floor is yours. Thank you, MadamChair. Madam Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a true pleasure for me to address this August Assembly as we have our 6th report, periodic report for ourcountry, the CAR. We will be addressing in it the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This report is submitted by my countrylast September or rather is following up on our previous initial reports and our 2nd periodic report in July 2014 as well. This reflects the commitment of the Central African Governmentand not just to work to improve the rights of women and girls but also and especially to make sure that we are meeting our commitments before the international community. The Central African Republic, as you know, has experienced years of conflict. This has brought political andsocioeconomic and cultural turmoil with serious consequences on women and girls that are the primary victims of this heartbreaking crisis. Since ascending to the Supreme Magistrate,His Excellency, the President of the Republican Head of State has included the issue of gender, the rights of girls and women as a priority area of action for the Central African Republic'spopulation. Madam Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, the 6th reportas well as the responses to the list of questions sent on 15 December, 2023, agree to detail on progress made, the constraints and challenges faced and the prospects in the future for the promotion andprotection of the rights of women in the CAR. A summary of the implementation of CEDAW is to bepresented as follows: Progress has been made in our normative framework. The government has moved forward with a deep analysis of the discriminatory texts. The government has put together a repertoireor a compendium of the laws and provisions that are to be revised and overhauled. New regulations have been launched. To this end, the legal protection for women has evolved favorably sincethe last periodic report of 2014. This includes the Constitution of 30 August, 2023, and specifically in Articles 7 and 14. There, the equality of genders and the involvement of women in decision-makingbodies is addressed. Also, Law 16004 of 24 November 2016 establishes parity between men and women in public positions, semi-public positions and private sector provisions. There is a mechanism for follow-upin the national observatory for parity. This draft decree is being signed by the head of state and president. There is the family code which has been overhauled. This allows for us to eliminate certaindiscriminatory provisions, but it also allows us to reinforce certain provisions on the rights of women and children. We have overhauled our criminal code. We have sought to increase certain conviction sentencestied to gender-based violence and to fight discrimination. We have our law on sexual harassment. This allows for us to reduce this phenomenon in family environments, schools, universities, and inthe workplace. The overhauled electoral code grants gender a central place. The law on the commissiontruth, justice, and reconciliation does as well. We have decree 15007 of 8 January 2015. This creates a mixed unit for rapid response, the UMIRR, when there is violence against women and children among others.In the implementation of the rights of law that protects women, numerous decrees, numerous institutions have been created. This includes the minister for the promotion of gender, protection of women and family and children. This ministry, through its general directorship on the promotion of gender andits director general's office on the protection of women and its technical offices has a mandate of defining and developing and implementing programs and projects for women and children and others vulnerablesectors of society. We have our ministry for humanitarian action and solidarity and national reconciliation. Their mission is to define and implement the policies, programs and projectson humanitarian support to be provided for IDPs and refugees. Women and children are to be found among these flows. The ministry for communication plays a cross-cutting role. The mandate there is to define national policy and communication as well as the strategies for the implementation of programs forthe dissemination of information, awareness raising, the fight against inequality and violence against women. There are other ministerial departments such as the health, public health department, commerce,rural development, agriculture, justice, education. All of these other ministerial departments contribute within their respective mandates to programs and projects that are aimed at promoting womenwith an eye on fighting gender-based inequality. It is thus that we can evoke the key role played by civil society organizations, national and international organizations, NGOs on the national level,businesses and private companies as they all fight together against all forms of discrimination against women. We also have our gender, our population gender and development commission that also focuses oninternational humanitarian law and human rights law. They have looked into and assessed the rights of women, minorities, a culture of peace, economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights and international law. There are follow-up mechanisms for evaluation and coordination.This was put together and has been implemented. This is through the committee for the coordination of the gender sector, the sector which includes violence, gender-based violence, women, peace and security. This was instituted by a ruling from the prime minister and head of government. It is partof the and this also comes from the strategic committee to fight against violence in places of conflict and is under the supervision of the president. Turning to public policy and the implementationthereof, our administration has initiated political strategies and plans and programs to bring gender equality, empowerment of women and a fight against gender-based violence. Along these lines we mightnote a national policy for the promotion of equality and gender equality and equity, family policies and a plan of action, a national strategy to fight against gender-based violence and harmful practices in child marriage, a strategy for socioeconomic autonomy and empowerment of women and girls, astrategy for the involvement of men in the fight against gender-based violence, a communication strategy to bring about behavioral changes and lastly a national action plan for resolution 13/25 and relatedresolutions. The programs are also drafted through different projects to fight against gender equality, discrimination against women and gender-based violence. Among these programs and projects we might note the following. There is a human capital program for the autonomy of women and girls andthere is also a gender program. There is a program for the holistic care for victims of gender-based violence. There is a project for the support of affected communities. There is a project for the support for returnees and displaced as a result of conflicts in the CAR. Madam Chair, Distinguished Delegates,ladies and gentlemen, to further illustrate the situation of women and girls in my country allow me to offer you numerous statistics in our gender architecture in our country. The guardianshipministry and the department for the promotion of women, family and the protection of women, families and children have a national policy for equality and equity. This was revised for 2019/2024. However,despite having gender focal points in all ministerial departments we must also note that the mobilization capacity and coordination capacity for gender matters in the ministry remains weak. Poverty has a genderspecific dimension. In rural areas 81% of women are living in poverty and 69% of men in rural areas are living in poverty. According to data from the ILO from 2019 more than 80% of women are working inthe informal sector of the rural economy and in small business. Gender-based discrimination is particularlyrooted in the education sector. The proportion between men or rather boys and girls that are in school isnot showing equality. Thus between 2018-2019 there were some eight girls in the primary school and sixgirls in secondary school for every ten boys. Among adults 75.1% of women are illiterate versus 52.6% of men. In our national assembly women represent 19% of the representatives. According to data from the lastmix 6 RCA 2018-2019 survey 60% of women between 20 and 24 are married or in a couple before the age of 15or 18 years of age. FGM affects 21.6% of women and girls between 15 and 49 years of age. 80% of womenand 84% of men have attitudes of accepting domestic violence. In the human developmentindex, .397 for 2019, in the places the CAR among the countries where human development is the weakest,188 of 189 countries and it notes discriminatory and patriarchal structures and deep inequality. The gender inequality index calculated at .680 in 2019 places the CAR 159th of 162 countries. This bears inmind health indicators with maternal mortality at 829 deaths per 100,000 alive births and the birth rateis at 120 and education indicators have 13.4% of women as having beginning secondary schools versus31.3 men. We also have economic activity information, 64.4% of women and 79.8% for women. Top povertylevels have increased from 70.5% in 2019 to 72.2% in 2020. This is the result of a loss of buying powerof the population and revenue has dropped by 1.3% in 2020. Among sub-Saharan African countries, thehuman development index of .353 in 2016 is greatly below the regional average of .475, which placesthe country 153rd among 177 countries. Informal employment is to be seen for 99% of the active working population and 80% of women are working in sectoral formation, particularly in rural economyand small business. Now, challenges and constraints, despite this progress made, the CAR remainsconfronted by structural constraints and difficulties tied to insecurity. These are not allowed for the implementation or the effective implementation of certain programs and projects. We face insufficient resources for our institutions proper operations and there are social cultural factors that weigh in aswell. As regards the prospects looking forward, the administration plans to endow the country with the national plan for development 2024/2028, this following the national plan for the consolidationof peace, RCPCA, 2017/2022. The ministerial department of which I am at the helm is finalizing our policysectoral policy document based on the program budget. The most important element to mention here is the national policy for human rights. This is the strategic framework is an important aspect of the rights ofwomen in this policy. We have a national policy that looks at the allocating budget to women in all areas of their life and rights. Some texts are being adopted and reviewed. There are programs being implementedas well as projects that are being developed. Turning to all that given all that I have mentioned, there is a firm political will and commitment of the President of the Republic to forge ahead in thecause of the rights of women. This remains a crucial pillar of the implementation of the recommendations or rather the President keeps as a centerpiece of his goals the recommendations on CEDA. The womenrepresent the majority of the population with 51% of the population. They should be sustained in all initiatives that are aimed at socioeconomic recovery of our country. To this end and in the name ofinternational solidarity, I would avail myself of this opportunity to encourage donors, bilateral, multilateral partners and the international community on the whole to continue to supportthe CAR in its programs aimed at socioeconomic autonomy, empowerment, gender equality and the fight against gender-based violence. Madam Chair, Distinguished Committee members, ladies and gentlemen,I would like to reiterate again my appreciation to this table for having given me the opportunity to present the situation of the Central African Republic. My Delegation is willing and able toprovide clarification when needed and additional responses as the Committee members might desire. Thank you very much. On behalf of the Committee, I should like to thank the head of Delegation.Thank you for your introductory remarks. Distinguished Delegate, as you know, the procedureof the Committee for the consideration of periodic reports involves the following. Numerous experts will ask questions after which the Delegation will be given the floor that it may have the opportunity to respond. Afterwards, another group of experts will take the floor again with additional questionsand the Delegation anew will have the floor to respond. The questions from the experts follow theorders of the Articles of the Convention to a large degree. This procedure will take place throughout our two sessions today. I should like to recall to the Delegation that the Committee will try to complete its consideration of the implementation of the Convention by the Central African Republicby 5 p.m. here in Geneva. The dialogue, as we have said, is being webcast live on UN Web TV.I wish to draw the Delegation's attention to the need for careful time management. I encourage the Delegation to provide precise, short, and direct responses to the experts' questions and the Delegationmight also indicate when response cannot be provided. In such a case, the Delegation should take note of the questions that cannot be answered immediately. Subsequently, you may request to submit the pending information in writing within 24 hours, that is to say one working day from the endof the constructive dialogue, that is to say by tomorrow at 5 p.m. in order to enable an additional interactive dialogue, the submission of additional information in writing should be theexception rather than the rule. Should the Delegation submit additional information in writing within 24 hours, such information should not exceed 1500 words. It should also be timely, concise, and answer theconcrete questions asked by the experts. Please also note that such information will also be publishedon the CEDAW website for the 87th session as it will or is part of the public dialogue. A lack ofor inadequate replies to questions raised by the Committee may result in follow-up questions andmight be reflected in the concluding observations of the Committee. I should also like to indicatethat to be necessary, the Delegation may be asked to limit its responses should this become necessary due to time considerations. I would now call upon the experts who wish to pose questions under the variousarticles of the Convention. Experts are also reminded to respect time limits for their questions. Where questions are not sufficiently answered, experts will be given an opportunity to ask follow-up questionsfor 2 min . We will start with questions relating to Articles 1 and 2 of Part 1 of theConvention. I would 1st like to give the floor to Madame Hilary Betama. She will be offering her initial remarks in consideration of Articles 1 and 2 of the Convention. Madame Betama, the floor is yoursfor 6 min . Thank you very much, Madame Chair. And I warmly welcome the High Level Delegation led by Dr. Amate Kirimat. You are most welcome to this dialogue. I commend you, 1st of all, for reportingon time and for your participation in the dialogue and the demonstrated openness in the Honorable Minister's opening statement. We acknowledge the rich resources the countries endowed withdescribed in the agricultural extractives and process industries as stated in your State Party report,Paragraph 27. We also appreciate the challenges, especially the most fundamental one of the conflict and its consequences. Yet note that the immense wealth of the country, if it could be optimallyharnessed, has the potential of actualizing the recommendations we will make today. This, against the obstacles candidly set out in Paragraphs 34 and 35, and comprehensively in the final part of yourreport, sets the tone for this dialogue. Needless to say, not only do women suffer intersectional discrimination that this dialogue will take us through, but also the State Party's commitments underthe Convention offer a pathway to recovery with women as agents, full agents of development. CEDAW combines women's human rights with the development as envisaged by the SDGs. Article 3 of CEDAW calls forall appropriate measures including legislation in all fields, particularly the political, social, economicand cultural fields, to ensure the full development and advancement of women through human rights and fundamental freedoms on the basis of equality with men. This undergirded by CEDAW's preambular provisionthat the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world, and the course of peacerequire the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men. I will move to Article 1. This is againstthe back challenges of poverty, human rights, unemployment, infrastructure, security and stability, the forced displacement internally and externally that Madam Chair has referred to. Two-thirds of theterritory occupied by armed groups has greatly undermined the government's ability both to establish its authority throughout the country and to perform its sovereign duty to assist all vulnerable population groups, especially women and children in the country. We also note the impunity, hate speech, food insecuritythat puts a disproportionate burden on women. We, however, commend you for your laws and policies, the new constitution, the Article 7 about pluralism and wish to ask you about the definition of discriminationas Article 13 does not include sex or gender as a prohibited ground for discrimination. We also commend you for your UPR review and the pledges made, particularly the one Madam Chair has, Madam Head ofDelegation has referred to, to make the national human policy central to your development and boosting cooperation with international and regional human rights protection mechanisms. May I ask in this regardwhat is the time frame for the certification of the Maputo Protocol? Madam Head of Delegation, against the backdrop of the instruments you have raised, how far have you progressed? And can you share timelines for the completion of the revision, especially of the family code? And what steps is the StateParty taking to abolish these practices, particularly with regard to sensitizing gatekeepers, the judiciary in the context of the conflict? We also note the legal gaps in your framework, the gaps in yourlegal framework, especially in respect of FGM, marital rape, which will be discussed later in the dialogue. We know the challenges of the plural legal system, especially in regard to law, to land wherethere is customary law and static law prevailing. We also note the presidential decree which confirmed the nomination of 11 commissioners on the Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation Commission.Has this significant milestone in the transitional justice process and the implementation of the peace agreement be complemented with the provision of state budget to enable the commission independently,financially and effectively carry out its mandate? How have you leveraged international assistance? We also look at the national recovery and peace building plan, which was from 2017 to 2021, which was notpossible to implement fully according to your report owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on donor countries. What areas remain unimplemented? Has a review or evaluation been undertaken? And whatconstraints and if the constraints have budgetary implications, how have you tackled this in subsequent budgets and is there a strategy, a plan to replace this one? I come to the visibility of the conventionand note that you refer to training and capacity building programs and note also that there is difficulty in actualizing ownership of the convention, even though you have done capacity buildings forjudges and also the general public. Can you tell us how many times the convention has been cited in your courts and how the impediments to ownership have been addressed and investigated? Finally, Madam Chair,I will look at the issue of domestication on which we had no clear information. But your state party report,paragraph 183, states that some provisions of the convention have been integrated into national laws, including the penal code, the labor code and the family code, the parity act and the forestry code. Which other provisions have been domesticated and into which laws? And what challengesprevent the undomesticated provisions from being incorporated into national law? And how will these processes be used to harmonize customary law with the convention in spite of these laws and practicesor in light of them being inimical to women's equality under the law? Madam Chair, I thank you. And Madam Delegation, thank you so much. We look forward to your responses. Thank you. Thank you very much,Ms. Bodema. Let me now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation for their responses.Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I should like to thank Ms. Hilary Bodema for all of the questions and comments that she has made regarding the presentation from the Central African Republic.Regarding the RCPCA which came to an end in 2022, the country is currently setting up a nationaldevelopment plan for 2024/2028. This includes then all of the departments of the country within theMinistry of Gender. All of our experts are supported in preparing and presenting the plan on gender, women and family protection. The RCPCA, this is the national recovery and peace building plan, it wasdrafted during a very difficult period for our country. And you know that the country is facing huge financial difficulties, treasury related difficulties. These financial difficulties and thecontext of insecurity have also hindered the achievement and the conclusion of the RCPCA,the national recovery and peace building plan. All of these difficulties and obstacles have been taken into account when we have drafted the new plan which is to be implemented. Regarding thetime frame and the calendar for the family code, the family code is currently being revised within the National Assembly. And the new code will take into account all of the discriminatory measures againstwomen. It will deal with them. The family code is being revised by the National Economic and Environmental Council. Following its revision by that council, the code will then be transmitted to the NationalAssembly for adoption. Regarding the Maputo Protocol, the country has just launched a national council onthe promotion and protection of children. We launched this just two weeks ago, in fact. And the council will include various departments, including the Department of Justice, other departments that alsodeal with family well-being and the well-being of women, children and the family. You know that theDepartment of Gender Promotion is behind the country's development. Essentially it is a real driver of development in the country. The current overview of the head of state is toemerge from this humanitarian sector and move towards a development view. So for that to work, the gender development department is absolutely key. Within the department, the whole population,men, women and children, they are all covered by this department. And all of the activities and actionsare being implemented so that this department, which as I say is really at the heart, is the foundation of taking us away from this humanitarian approach towards a development access and approach, thatthis be really active. Regarding FGM, if we take statistics from 1994, the figures were 43%. Therehas been a great deal of progress. The figures have gone from 43% to 21%. These are or this is a harmful practice which can't disappear overnight. We can't root it out overnight. Awareness raising is being donethrough civil society organizations, also through technical services within the ministry of gender, within the ministry of healthcare, not only in the capital but in all regions where this practice,this traditional harmful practice occurs. Let me also give the floor to a member of the Delegation,the legal adviser, to add to everything I have just said. Thank you. Thank you very much,Madam Minister, Head of Delegation. I was introduced by the Chargé d'Affaires but let me in turn before I give some additional information for the Distinguished Delegates, let me just recall that Imyself am a judge. I am the Chargé d'Admission within the Ministry of Justice. I'm part of this Delegation and that is a key indication of the importance of the judicial system in gender issues and in combatingdiscrimination against women. To respond to the concerns raised by Ms. Bedema, I would like to begin on the last point, integration international law of provisions of the Convention. I would liketo assure you that the Central African Republic has implemented a monist legal system. This means that whenever an international instrument is ratified by the Central African Republic, we don't needto have additional legislation for it to enter into force. Once the international instrument is ratified in the normal way, then it automatically applies. Of course, when it comes to implementing nationalpolicies, the work is done for certain texts, but even if that isn't done, there's nothing preventing the international instruments that have been ratified from being immediately applied in the country.On female genital mutilation, Madam Minister mentioned this, but you also raised the issue of spousal rape. Here again, we are in a phase of adapting our criminal legislation to new challenges that arearising and among these challenges, spousal rape is one issue. This reform that's underway will mean that that is now criminalized henceforth. All perpetrators of spousal rape will be prosecutedand sentenced and convicted. The Truth and Justice Reconciliation Commission has 12 members. This is one of the transitional justice mechanisms. There are two. We have the special criminal court which isoperational and has been in force for some years. It has seen and tried various cases on conflict-related violence. The Truth and Justice Reconciliation Commission, as you said, must contribute toreconciliation. The committee has been established and has developed an action plan. The government has supported that committee by providing them with premises and a budget and the committee has begunto prepare to shoulder its mandate and to discharge its functions. I should also welcome the substantial support from the international community and partners, namely UN system organizations, the EU,the International Organization of the Francophonie. All of these organizations have very much supported our Truth and Reconciliation process and we are in a place where we have the capacity for thatcommittee to properly discharge its mandate. We should recognize that there have been some internal voices of dissent but the government has taken things in hand to settle that issue so that the committeecan properly do its job essentially. You also raised the issue of capacity building among judges, public opinion and you also touched on the involvement of the judicial system in combating discrimination againstwomen. The minister in her introductory remarks talked about the national human rights policy.The Central African Republic has drafted and adopted a comprehensive strategy document on human rights.This was done following a recommendation from the UPR process, the previous cycle of the universal period of review from 2018. This national human rights policy gives a comprehensive overview and assessment ofthe human rights situation including women's rights and girls' rights and it reveals all of the discriminatory aspects, all of the obstacles and difficulties that are hindering the preventing women's situation fromevolving. There are 268 activities that have been planned and budgeted for and are planned to be implemented over a five-year period starting from 2023. As part of this policy, there is an awful lotof promotion work to be done and when you talk about promotion, we mean training, strengthening, capacity building to the benefit of all stakeholders, for the benefit of all human rights stakeholders, judgesprimarily, civil society organizations, state stakeholders working in this area and todaythere is an approach from the government which began here in October 2023 where this policy was presented to partners, to the international community and today the government is mobilizing domestic resourcesprimarily but also is looking for the support of partners as well to implement these activities and actions that are planned for as part of this policy, this policy which will be a consistent framework going forward seeking to promote and protect all human rights including women's rights. Let me leaveit there. Thank you. I would also like to give the floor to the Director General for the Agenda PromotionDivision, Mr. Theodore Koinam for further information. Thank you. I would like to thank Ms. Hilaryfor her relevant questions. Let me come back 1st of all to FGM in Central African Republic. I thinkthat the CAR is the 1st country to take measures to properly abolish female excision and this has beendone through an ordinance number 66/16 of the 22nd of February 1966. This abolishes the practice of excision in the country. Since 1966, female excision has been abolished by law in the Central AfricanRepublic. As the Minister has just said, this is a cultural practice. It is deeply rooted in custom and tradition and we need to carry out awareness raising activities to definitively root out thispractice in our country. We should note that in the CAR it is not in all cultures and ethnicities. Not everybody does it. There are other cultures that don't. I do apologize for interrupting, Mr. Chair. We will have an opportunity to talk about harmful traditional practices later on. We are nowjust focusing on the legislative framework in the country. We will come to FGM later on. Please, if I can just ask you to focus your responses on the specific questions that were put by Ms. Berdena.Thank you. I do apologize. There is no microphone for this speaker. Could we have a microphone, please,so that we can ensure the translation? Let me come back. I think that on the Maputo Convention,the Central African Republic has ratified this convention. This was in 2012. We have transmitted the ratification instruments. Unfortunately, within the African Union, I think the original of thedocument that was to be transmitted has not been actually transmitted. We transmitted a photocopy.We will actually need to look and see what the problem is there and why we will need an additional document for ratification. The action, the things have been done within the framework of this. Ithink that all of the interventions have been worthwhile within the country on that. Regardingthe family code, I think that to be able to revise the family code, we have over 10 years now,we have been looking at revision of that. The 1st stage of this revision is an anthropological code that's a process that's been taking place across the country. We have recruited experts to identifydiscriminatory provisions in the family code. I think that among the discriminatory provisions in the family code, there is the choice of home, e.g. , the choice of dwelling, that was conditioned by the man in the original family code that was the man's choice in the newfamily code. Choices of dwelling should be made by the man and woman together, the choice of where to live. There are original discriminatory provisions that have been abolished on certain practiceswithin our country. We have been able to analyze the family code and highlight and draw out the discriminatory articles. There are 67 of them. We have been revising that. We have also introducednew measures in to the family code. Gender based violence was not included originally in the previous code and that we also had to include gender based violence into the new code as being somethingthat clearly prevents healthy functioning of the family. So that's one example of just what we have been doing in the country. I think I will leave it there and perhaps I can come back later on. Thankyou. I just wanted to thank Ms. Hilary for the 1st round of very specific questions and, of course, weare more than prepared to answer with any additional information you may require. Thank you very muchto the Distinguished Delegation for answering the questions. Ms. Bademi, you have the floor for follow-up questions 1st for 2 min , please. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I again thank theDelegation for the very open and straightforward answers. Madam Chair, you were right at this point.I was not quite asking for the information on female genital mutilation because it will be addressed under Article 5 later. But what I was pointing to is that this is an opportunity to streamlinethat law because there are gaps in the law. The 1st gap that I see in the law is that there seems there is an exemption for the medicalization of FGM. So this is an area that we probably have to lookat closely to make sure that it is not a gap that can be exploited. Secondly, I see a gap also in the cross-boundary performance of the FGM. Indeed, I commend you. It is probably because you started soearly that these issues were not apparent at that time. But these are the facts I want you to take a look at when we come to Article 5. Again, I thank you for the information that the country is a monist country.Indeed, it was in your State Party report. But where I had my doubts was that the same State Party reportin Paragraph 183 says that some provisions of the Convention have been brought into national law. So I wanted to clarify that situation. I want to thank you. And any other matters? Yes, accordingto what I researched, you had signed but not ratified. But it is okay in the sense that you have undertaken that you will follow up the process. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much,Ms. Podema, for all of those comments. We will have time to analyze and look at these things in more detail. Don't worry. Let me now move to Article 3, please, and give the floor to Ms. Esther Egobamianfor her to address national machinery on the advancement of women. Ms. Egobamian, you have the floor for3 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to engage with theDelegation from the Central African Republic and commend the state's ratification of the Convention as well as its commitment to fulfilling all obligations under the Convention to enhance the status of women and better promote and protect their rights, especially in the context of the country. Actionsto strengthen the ministry for the advancement of women, the family and child protection and implement the national agenda and equity policy despite the persistent challenges are noteworthy. The engagement of women in peace management processes and harnessing their mediation and conflict resolution skills areneeded to fully implement the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and boost national recovery and reconciliation. Can the state party kindly indicate if the national agenda machinery has cabinet status and the level of human, technical and financial resources available to coordinate gender mainstreaminggiven the fragility of the national context and the disproportionate bronze of conflicts born byCentral African Republic women? Relatedly, what percentage of national budget is allocated to thenational agenda machinery and how specific strategies have been adopted to facilitate the effectivedelivery of the policy and fulfillment of CEDO? What impact has the machinery, the national machinery achieved to date and are there existing or future plans to generate increased and sustainable fundingfor the ministry? How are women's views, voices and priorities captured in the national security agenda and architecture in order to better promote and protect their rights? Can you please elaborate verysimply the systems that are in place to facilitate policy coordination and the monitoring rule of the national agenda machinery and ensure the comprehensive integration of gender equality into the plans and policies of the country as well as whatever development plans that you might have? What function does thenational machinery have vis-a-vis the gender focal points and do they have any sufficient geographic reach? Please explain the implementation status of the national action plan on 13/25 because plans forreview were mentioned and it would be good to know the level of engagement of women in the peace building processes. Is there any concrete engagement with the Ministry of Defense, police, security agencies or the legislature in the national action plan implementation? Can they provide information on the existenceof and operations of the women, peace and security networks and the roles that they are playing to actively involve women in dealing with conflict-related SGBV and the sexual gender-based violence issuesincluding issues of forced displacement? Can the state party indicate what projections it has forfinalizing the bill establishing the national commission for human rights and the commission that is in compliance with the Paris principle and what is the working relationship with the national women's machinery? I would also like a little clarification on the operations of the truth,justice, reparation and reconciliation commission vis-a-vis the local mixed gender peace and truth committee. Are they independent? Is it decentralized? How do they work together? Thank you.Thank you very much indeed. Let me now give the floor to the Delegation for 10 min for them to come back on these questions. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. My thanks to the committee expert forthe questions. The country has a coordination committee, the sector of gender, gender-based violence and harmful traditional practices. This has been set up in 2020 by the Prime Minister,head of government. In addition to that, we have a national observatory on parity laws. This is being signed by the President of the Republic and set up. Given that time is limited, I'm going to give thefloor to the Director General for him to give us a little bit more information on the different questionsthat have been put. Thank you. I would like to welcome the questions that have been asked. The 1stobservation is on our national budget. I think that nationally we do have activities that have beenfinanced on an ad hoc basis on the country level. We have a process in place for this. The country finances these activities, as I said, on an ad hoc basis. Currently we are trying to move to a programbudget. Each department is to draft a sectoral policy based on a program budget. I believe that in thissectoral policy we will establish guidelines for each program, each gender program throughout the country. That's where we have our sectoral policies. This is being wrapped up. I think that within theyears that lie ahead, we will be able to fully move to a program budget so that everything can bebudgeted and so that a country can make its contribution to gender matters. Now, women, peace and security, I think that our country is in its 3rd generation of the national plan of action. We havedrafted in 2014 a national plan of action. This national plan of action was evaluated. We have moved to the 2nd generation of our national plan of action. That concluded in 2023. That was assessedand it was addressed here at the UN headquarters. I think that all the progress that was made was in our report of activities. We are also in a process of drafting the 3rd generation of our nationalplan of action for women, peace and security in the CAR. Now, turning to mechanisms,the coordination committee holds meetings every three months, quarterly, and we have gender focal point in each ministerial department. It is each focal point in their respective departments that providesindication or information on gender. This allows us to identify the challenges in each sector. This information is provided by the focal points and we bring it together in the coordination committee. Wediscuss those challenges and I think that these challenges are then folded into our ministry programming. The ministry then brings that information to the cabinet meetings and other relevantstakeholders. That's what's done on the country level. Now, for strengthening our partnerships,we have the gender sector coordinating committee in our country which coordinates things nationally. Now, as far as our agencies, we have our working group in the agencies and also decentralized, we have a workinggroup that addresses this as well. We work in close cooperation with the UN system and the bilateral partners and the multilateral partners and some donors. So we sometimes have programs and projects.We have one on gender, financed by the EU, gender 1 and then gender 2. We are in a gender equality program with the EU, with the World Bank. We have a draft program on human capital. That bears in mindthe empowerment of women. We have a program for addressing gender-based violence and a CINI programand we have another program as well. We do a great deal of work yearly with the UN agencies present in our country and with the international organizations in our country. We work together with them and weundertake these activities at the same time to address the reality of women in the CR. I thinkthat's the response that I wanted to provide to your question at this time. I thank you. Perhaps I couldprovide additional clarification on the budget, the operational budget for the committee. The budget ismaintained by the state and the partners also support the state to ensure the proper operations of thecommittee. Thank you. Thank you to the Delegation for the responses. I give the floor to Madam Agobamiafor follow-up questions. Two minutes, Madam. Madam Chair and my sincere appreciation to the Delegation for the responses, the very good responses that you have given. However, I just have a few questionswith regards to the 3rd national action plan. I commend you that you have gone through implementation of two rounds of your national action plan. But as you embark on the 3rd national action plan,is there any linkage between your national action plan and the national security priorities? Because that's usually where the gap is, is that you find the national action plan is a plan for women andthen there is a national security architecture in the country. Is there any linkage between the targets, the plan objective in your plan with the overall national security plan? And then you talked aboutcoordination. I would really want to know that coordination arrangement, what does it entail? What is the core function of the ministry? Does it say the targets? Because I heard you talking about the agenda focal points will set their targets. So if they are self-targeting and self-monitoring,then how do you actually achieve accountability? What is the role of the national agenda machinery as a coordinating entity? And how is it using that role to leverage resources? Because you talked about partnership with all of these entities, the UN. Is that leading to increased budget? Because I had askedabout budget and you didn't say what percentage of the budget. Are you going to be able to leverage more resources that has counterpart funding, not just resources from donors to demonstrate the commitmentof government? Thank you. Thank you. I also would request that you I would also circle back to the question on the project you have in place to launch a national institution for human rights. I give thefloor back to the Delegation, the Distinguished Delegation at this time, that they may that it may respond specifically to these questions. You have the floor for 5 min . I would like to give thefloor at this time to the head of the legal mission for additional clarification. I thank you. Thank you,Madam Minister. Madam Chair has mentioned the National Institute for Human Rights, the NHRI. I would liketo say that that institution exists already in our country. It was operating with a 1st team, but the team wasn't always supposed to be. Since the end of 2022, we had new text drafted. We have a newteam in place and the budget as well was revised upwards, that is, even if that increase isproportional and reflective of the resources we have in the CAR. That body is operational. One of the objectives of that institution or institute is to obtain status A as quickly as possible in step withthe Paris Principles. All of the activities undertaken in Geneva before the Human Rights Council and otherCommittees as well, that national institution is also participating. I thank you. Now my colleague will take the floor on coordination and budget-related matters. We will take the floor to report on thatitem. Thank you very much. As I had said just now, I think that on the level of security and justice inour country, we have a national plan for security and safety. I think that that national plan includes a national plan for gender security. So everything that is done in security and safety also have apillar that is contained within the national actual plan for gender. This is particularly placed for the gendarmerie and the defense forces. We have gender cells that work in close cooperation withthat department. They provide information to us. For example, when we see the training of defense forces, we look at what is hindering, what is an obstacle to women in the police sector and in thedefense forces sector. I think we have been able to gather that information and we are looking at it on the ministerial level and we bring that to the Coordination Committee. Now as regards the budget,as I said just before, we used to quite a bit of time ago, we financed activities on an ad hoc basis. The financing was based on just a given program. However, today with the drafting of our sectoralpolicy, we will have a program for women, peace and security with a budget, a percentage of thegovernment's budget, a gender program, an empowerment program, a family program. That's what we are doing.But beyond that, we do have our partners that support us and that's what I was referring to,annual programs which are annual programs which are planned activities and budget activitiesthat and this is drafted out between the ministry and the UN system and other donors as well.This helps us to undertake our activities throughout the country. So we can't give you a proportion, an exact proportion of the state's contribution. However, based on the program budgets that we will have, we will be able to give visibility to what the government is doing in the arena of gender,peace and security and I believe that in the days that lie ahead, we will be able to providedirect proportions and percentages. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair and Distinguished Committee Members.Succinctly, these are the responses we are in a position to respond to your questions. Thank you very much. We will now then move to Articles 4 or Article 4 of the Convention, special protectivemeasures, temporary protection measures. I would like to give the floor to Madam Betama for 3 min .Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for giving me the floor. Madam Chair, I will make a slight segue backwards before coming forward with your permission and with all due respect becausethis also feeds into how we look at Article 4 on special temporary measures. Madam Chair, the issue of institutions is very important to us because if we are going to make recovery and put women at theforefront of development and reconstruction, these institutions are important. So permit me to come back to the issue of the national human rights institution because we talked about our questionsalso relate to when it will be optimally operational. We know it was instituted in around 2017 and theUPR 3rd cycle in 2029 also accepted the recommendations. So two main things here. When it will comply with the Paris principle, the A status that Honorable Justice talked about and that its mandate includesgender equality and nondiscrimination. This is the way we will move forward progressively as a country. Thank you. Now I come to Article 4, temporary special measures because indeed we can use temporary special measures to increase the number of women on this entity. There are now four as against eightmen. Temporary special measures now. We congratulate you for amending the electoral code and introducing municipal lists and requiring all political parties to have a quota of 35%. That is very noteworthy. Butwhen we look at the chart that you have given us, the table, and we thank you for it because it is this kind of information that enables a meaningful dialogue. In areas like the high court of justice, we see two women as against 22 men. I don't know whether these are judges, but if not, we wouldlike to know. The constitutional court, that is 4, 5. And the diplomatic service, we see two women against 12 men. These are places that we would like to ask whether or ask you to look at putting in temporaryspecial measures, especially in judiciary administrative bodies, the peace process bodies, the minorities and disadvantaged groups. This can be in the form of allocation, reallocation of resources, preferentialtreatment, targeted recruitment to get in more of these categories, hiring and promotion and numerical goals. We also want to like to know about the observatory that was established under the parityact, under Article 10 of the parity act. Please share some of its achievements. How does it monitor the gender parity act? How are parties held to compliance? And we would like to ask more generically whetherthe temporary special measures are known and understood by the public at large and whether you have actually used them for other disadvantaged categories of men and evaluated their use. We do this againagainst the background of our previous concluding observations that asked that you use the temporary special measures to ensure participation of women in national bodies and the plan of the implementation of the Security Council Resolution. So what are the percentages of women especially on this body? Thankyou very much, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Berma. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationfor 10 min to respond to these questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. In my introductory remarks this morning I referred to the decree that implements the observatory and I said that it's being signed. It'sin the process of being signed by the presidency. That will be done fairly quickly. But as the observatory is not still in place and up and running because they will be evaluating the level of implementationof gender parity since it's not up and running, we cannot confirm or deny information on that. However, I will still give the floor to the Chancellor from the mission, magistrate, who will provide additionalinformation. I thank you, Madam Minister. I would like to note that the Distinguished Expert hasmentioned that in the CAR legislation, the political parties are called upon to respect the 35% level.This is in step with law and parity that establishes a ten year transition period toward parity. At the end of that ten year period, which will end soon, I think that it will be total parity, full paritythat's the exigency. However, the political parties currently are compelled to present at least 35% women in their electoral lists. It is true that in all actuality, the amount of women inthese posts, we really don't see the impact of this provision. It's true. I agree with that observation.This is long-term work. This is why we need to bear in mind the reality and context of the country. The law requiring the calling for the 35% does establish a waiver if there aren't enough candidacies or enoughwomen that are presenting themselves as candidates. There is some core work in awareness raising that's essential here. We need to mobilize the effort to achieve this. I think that playing long ball down the road, we will be able to do that. In 2024, at the end of the year, we will have municipal elections.With that 35% threshold requirement, the country has adopted the electoral lists system. Those listswill have equal parity. That provision, we think, will have a positive impact. We believe that all listsor all electoral lists that win for the municipal posts, municipal counselors, regional counselors, all those lists will have as many women as men. When we see those elections held, we think thatthere will be a notable improvement. You also mentioned the issue of institutions and including the constitutional court and the high court of justice. These bodies are jurisdictions. They are courts. Asthey operate in general, there are decisions that are made by consensus sometimes and sometimes theyproceed with the vote when voices are divided. That is why these legal bodies always have an odd numberof members to respect this principle for tie breaking purposes. Decisions have to be made so the tiebreaking reflects that. I think there are 12 members instead of 22 in the question asked. They are notsix women of the 12. That is perhaps due to a lack of female candidacies. These are posts that are amatter of electoral results. Thank you very much. Madam Chair, to compliment the issue of local electionsat the end of the year. In our departments, we have already beginning our work. We have included the political participation of women in local elections as an important item. We have begun to reflect uponthis and to work on this. Thank you very much. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank theDistinguished Delegation. Thank you for the information that you have provided. I'm going to give the floorto Madam Benesheva to address Article 5 of the Convention on stereotypes, harmful practices and gender violence against women. You have the floor for 6 min . Very much, Madam Chair. I would like towelcome the Distinguished Delegation of the Central African Republic and also to thank them for theirreports and responses. The issues of gender stereotyping, harmful practices, gender based violence against women and specifically violence against women during armed conflict and the peace building process are interlinked and have to be dealt in their complex correlation in the Central African Republic. Notonly problems are interlinked, the discriminatory social structures and gender stereotyping that already exist and affirm the inferiority of women and girls in the family, community and society interact withlawlessness and violence during armed conflict. In these cases, women and children are the 1st to suffer as it also worsens discrimination and gender stereotyping. But also the solutions are interlinked as it is in the peace building process and in the eagerness of women to be involved andparticipate that the solution to existing and exacerbating problems with gender based violence and harmful practices should be further sought by the government. Despite conflict situation and related challenges, some achievements are recognized. The revision of the penal legislation with new offensesrelating to gender based violence with harsh penalties added to penalization of FGM, marriage and widowhood rights, the establishing of the national committee you mentioned to combat harmful traditionalpractice against women and gender based violence including child marriage. I can see how much priority you give to this issue in your reports and answers. Female genital mutilation that was mentioned, thepercentage was lowered. You say I have 24% but you said 21 which is an achievement as you said. In spite of penal legislation in force, the practice is still widespread and problems with medicalized FGM mentionedby my colleague cross border FGM persists. And also approximately one half of the girls were mutilated between 10 and 14 years of age and despite the improvement it creates a whole range of issues alsofor rehabilitation. Awareness raising has increased but the situation exacerbated due to the conflict. What strategies and concrete measures are put in place by the state party for targeted and regular awareness raising with reaching out specific groups, teachers, medical staff, religious leaders in orderto combat entrenched patriarchal attitudes and gender stereotypes which contribute to harmful practice and gender based violence. And how many convictions have been issued, you mentioned prevalence generallybut how many convictions have been issued in the urban and rural settings in the last two years and what measures have been taken in the most prevalent regions including budget allocations also with respect to the risk of medicalization as it was mentioned. Considering widowhood rights and accusations ofwitchcraft despite the family code prohibition elderly women without family support are victims of such severe abuses but in the absence of an established definition of witchcraft the state does not intervenein these cases. So when does the state intend to amend the penal code by explicitly criminalizing witchcraft accusations and by abolishing the informal courts that sit on these cases and are theirprotection services for women accused of witchcraft which measures against stigmatization can be taken and with tailored health and psychosocial rehabilitation measures. Concerning gender based violence againstwomen generally you also confess in your report that it has increased and has been exacerbated by conflicts, sexual violence, early marriages and all other forms of gender based violence. According also to yourdata 22% only of rape survivors seek medical legal psychosocial assistance and 68% of girls and boys are either married or in a domestic partnership before the age of 18. There is a national strategy to combatgender based violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation in the Central African Republic until 2023. Has the strategy been assessed and what are the pertinent findings and objectives in thiscontext? Please provide data gathered and assessed by this strategy on the number of prosecutions, number of convictions for the different forms of gender based violence and what is the timeline for criminalizingmarital rape not yet criminalized explicitly in your country. Violence against women in conflict and disarmament and reintegration as I said it is so much interconnected with the issues of gender based violence. Domestic abuse, rape and sexual slavery of women and girls by armed groups and peacekeepersthreatened their security. Sexual violence was increasingly used as a weapon of war. Data for 2019 showed ahigh number of incidents, 322 of conflict related sexual violence from which 174 rapes or attempt rapes and 15 cases of forced marriage. Have you adopted the national strategy to combat impunity in order to ensurethat perpetrators of sexual violence during the conflict are brought to justice, prosecuted and punished for all cases of violence against women? Please mention the main elements and the objectives if possible.Thank you. I would like just to mention women and peace and security and disarmament that is so important to have their increased role. How will you include women, girls, young people in the process more and alsofor fighting against gender based violence and to mention main outcomes from Bangui Forum for women and girls. I would like to say that women in your country would like to be included more. Women would probably be the key to unlocking the solutions also for the field of gender based violence being related andsensitive to the root causes of violence, conflict and the established structures of power. Soto begin with women and for women. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation for 10 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson and my thanks forthis question. You know that Central African women make up over 51% of the population and they havepaid a heavy price in terms of what we have seen during the armed conflict on FGM. The law stipulates a sentence of 5 to 20 million CFA francs for perpetrators of this crime. Let me give the floorperhaps to the Director General of Women's Protection to provide more information and then I will give thefloor to the Advisor to add in to the provisions from the Director General. Thank you, Madam Minister. Mythanks to the Chairperson for giving me the floor. Questions related to harmful practices have been mentioned here now, particularly on early marriage and female genital mutilation. There have also beenquestions on measures taken and what I can bring by way of response to these questions is that indeed the country has drafted a national strategy to combat harmful traditional practices, GBV and childmarriage. Today we are making progress in another strategy document. We are drafting a nationalstrategy to combat FGM, female genital mutilation and child marriage. This with the support of ourpartners, UNICEF and UNFPA. Why? Well, because according to analyses it is very, very importantto focus on these issues which are a severe human rights violation of the rights of children and ofwomen and also when it comes to the government's overview and assessment of the situation, we thought it was important to extract and to make this a separate strategy so that we can see how we addressthese issues within the umbrella of harmful traditional practices. It is true that we do recognizethat the rate of child marriage, the rate of FGM has fallen, thanks to awareness raising, but it isimportant to continue this fight and to ultimately completely eradicate these phenomena, these harmfultraditional practices. Now, on the law, we have a draft bill on sexual harassment according to statistics,women are victims of sexual harassment either in the schools or in the professional domains or in thecommunity and this draft bill is on the table, it is before the National Assembly and will strengthenour combat against harmful traditional practices. When it comes to violence against women, measures arebeing taken, there is an awful lot that is being done specifically. We work hand in hand with society, civil society organizations, there are associations working to combat harmful traditional practices andwe have associations of women jurists as well and we are working closely with them to try and address all of these issues. That's just a brief overview of what I can tell you regarding the questions onharmful traditional practices. Thank you. Thank you. Let me give the floor to the charge admission.Thank you. There was a question from the Distinguished Expert regarding sentences suppressing violence against women and how many convictions there have been and so on. Let me start from a generalpoint. We are, of course, when emerging from recurring military and political crises that the Central African Republic has been doing, the judicial system is in disarray. Intensive work hasbeen done, a sexual policy on justice has been drafted and implemented and today the judicial system is functional across almost the whole country. Courts are in place and they are working normally.Appeal courts and I'm talking about appeal courts for a specific reason, I'll tell you why, they are also working alongside that. So you have the full criminal justice mechanismthat is up and running and we have the special criminal court which was part of the transitional justice system and that is functional. It takes cases of violence against women that were committedduring the conflict. Now, these courts, as I say, are working properly. Cases on violence against women are criminal cases. So they can be given severe punishments. The minimum is 10 years. So thesecrimes are dealt with in the equivalent of the court, we call it the criminal courts in the Central African Republic and these criminal courts are at the higher level, the appeal court level. We have three appeals courts in the Central African Republic in Bangui, Bombari and Bois. These cover all of the jurisdictionsof the country and these three appeal courts hold criminal sessions very regularly. These criminal sessions in 2023, there were three in Bangui alone and during the three criminal sessions,I think a significant number of cases of violence against women were heard, were examined. I don't have the exact figures, unfortunately, but the majority of the cases were sentences were handed downfor them. Much of the many of these acts of violence were committed. We must recognize by the defense and security forces, that must be recognized, part of them, not all of them, but part of them.And so for that category of perpetrator, we also have the martial court. The martial court is a military court and is tasked with trying cases of offenses and crimes committed by the defense and securityforces. The court marshals were held in Bangui 1st of all and they heard cases of violence against women and the culprits were severely sentenced, harsh sentences were handed down. So this is alllinked to the issue of security essentially and the issue of security, security piece in development, this was also, has also been addressed today with government efforts, the support of partners.Security has improved across the country somewhat given the political agreements that were signed in the report in Bangui, then there was a roadmap signed in Rwanda under theinterest of the international community in the Great Lakes region. Many armed groups were dismantled,many of them. And with the implementation of these accords and the work of increasing security across the country, security has come back to almost I would say 90% of the territory. And with the increasedsecurity situation, we have seen that the cases of violence have fallen. Of course, cases do still persist and the government has acted in various areas. As I say, we have redeployed justice. Wehave made sure that the justice system is hearing these cases. There is also training and awareness raising done on the ground for security force personnel, but partners, the Central African Republic,particularly the UN mission, have also been able to intervene. And this has happened several times with these armed groups to draw their attention to the severity of the facts, the gravity of the situation.And we have had substantive results from that because many women who were essentially in the hands of these armed groups, they have been released following the interventions from the UN missionabove all. I wanted to talk particularly about the law that was passed in the country on legal aid today. Anyone who doesn't who isn't able to go to can pay for legal law, they can have access to legalaid today. Thank you. I also just wanted to underline something very important. This is a challenge that we have within the CAR and this is the challenge of women's ownership of these laws. This is achallenge because if women are able to take ownership of these laws, be truly informed and own them, that will really help us eliminate discrimination against women. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the Distinguished Delegation for the information and comments that they have provided. I do have a follow-up question myself, if I may. Somethingthat was raised at the beginning of this dialogue and it's been mentioned repeatedly by my colleagues,the role that you give to women's organizations in this whole process. I would like to hear more abouthow you collaborate with women's organizations and associations, particularly to address all of these challenges that the country has before it. Could you shed a bit of light on that for us, please?Thank you, Madam Chair. Women's organizations are stakeholders in all of these processes. They havea very important role to play and civil society is essentially the population. It's the people. We can't work and leave aside the population. So they are truly stakeholders in all of the activities andall decisions and all laws that are promulgated within the Central African Republic. Thank you.Okay. Thank you for that response, Madam. Let's now move to Article 6 of the Convention on Trafficking and Exploitation of Prostitution. I would like to give the floor to Ms. Egobamian for her to address this Article for 4 min , please. Ms. Egobamian, you have the floor.Please, if you could take the floor on Article 6. You have the floor, Madam, for 4 min .I should speak. I'm taking Article 9. Thank you. I do apologize. I couldn't hear you. There was nomicrophone. Could we have the microphone, please? We will come back to Article 6 later on. We will nowmove to Article 7 and 8. This is on political participation of women. I would like to give the floor to Mr. Silva De Alvis for 4 min , please. Article 7 and 8, you have the floor.I respectfully welcome the CAR Republic to the 87th session of the CEDAW Committee. The state party made history with the appointment of a woman president, Catherine Zamba-Panza. A woman parliamentarian has said only when we leverage women's leadership can we achieve peace in the CAR Republic. This lies atthe very foundation of the evolving General Recommendation 40 of the CEDAW. The 35% women's participation guaranteed in the parity law was removed in 2023. However, the implementation of theparity law itself was marked by a lack of enforcement. Would you consider reconstituting and reinstituting the law with mandatory provisions for implementation with no exception? Your Excellencies, I will go onto the most fearful barrier to women's political participation, violence against women in politics. UN women reported that 43% of women candidates in the 2020 elections were victims of physical, verbal andeconomic attacks during their campaigns and threatened by arms groups and even kidnapped. Moreover, the civic space shrunk for women. Their civil and political rights to free speech, expression and assembly wereviolated. Women involved in politics or peacemaking are targeted because of their gender and their ambition to lead. We want concrete plans of action on how you address gender-based electoral violence.Would you consider a stand-alone law for violence against women political leaders? Bolivia and Mexico have adopted laws specifically prosecuting violence against women in politics. Will you consider anational registry of sanctioned persons for violence against women in politics? Would you adopt a guideline to cancel candidacies for any person found guilty of committing gender-based violence? The UNwomen supported women's situation rooms and a 24-hour hotline during the campaigns. Would you consider continuing those efforts even during a post-election time frame? The constitutional referendum led to the suspension of local elections. What is the new schedule for elections and will you be able to providecampaign finance for women hoping to run for office? In the security sector, we know that the Minister of Defense is a woman, another historic landmark for the CAR Republic and the world. The security situationin the Central African Republic has been exacerbated by the spillover of conflict from neighboring countries, particularly Sudan, including the proliferation of illegal weapons and the exploitation of the country's extraordinarily rich mineral resources. How do you support the collaboration between peacekeepingmissions and local women leaders? And how will you support the five women on the transitional and Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is one of the most important processes in transitional justice? Giventime limitations, I will pick one important area for women's leadership, and that is the special criminal court. How many women are on the special criminal court? The criminal justice process is one of the mostimportant and pivotal processes during a period of transitional justice. The state party which ratified the Rome statute is a state party to the International Criminal Court. On July 1, 2002, the state partysurrendered Mohammed Zayed Abdul Kani to the ICC on January 24, 2021. Self-referral by the CAR Republic to the ICC is extraordinarily commendable. As you know, the ICC prosecutor in opening earlier investigationshas said that this is the 1st time that the court has opened an investigation where allegations of sexual crimes far outnumber alleged killings. However, when Jean Pierre Bemba of the DRC was acquittedby the ICC, the decision was a blow to the many victims of rape and sexual violence in the state party. Now, this is an area that demands women lawyers and justices and their involvement andtheir leadership at the domestic level. What is the percentage of women leading important domestic criminal justice measures including on the special criminal court in cases of sexual violence inconflict? Women's parity in participation in the justice system is pivotal, Your Excellencies, to nation building. I now come to national security and diplomacy. We note and acknowledge the fact that the number ofwomen engaged in the local peace and reconciliation committees in the republic has reached 50%. However, as you know, the state party has been confronted with a multidimensional crisis. This is, therefore, astrong need for women's involvement in every sector including in the security sector, economic sector, in the private sector, in healthcare, in academic institutions and in the extractive industries.Will you restore the parity law and raise the quota to 50% participation of women in every level without exception? A newly launched defense forces official directory of female experts is meant to help pushfor better representation of women in decision making positions and this document was handed over to the prime minister in 2020. In fact, Your Excellencies, this directory of resumes of eligible women forleadership in different sectors developed by you is a unique model that must be adopted by all state parties. How do you use this newly published directory to appoint women in decision making in every sectorand what is your temporary special measure for women in high level positions in multilateral institutions and in diplomacy? Do you have a pipeline for women in diplomats and a school for diplomacy for womendiplomats especially in the women peace and security sector? Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Silva. Let me now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation for 10 min for them to answer these questionsand comments. Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you, dear expert, for the questions, very targeted, specificquestions. What I should say by way of beginning is that our country has been at the forefront of women's political participation. It was as far back as 1974 that a woman was appointed prime minister in therepublic and then following her a woman was appointed to the presidency as you rightly said.Currently the Minister of Foreign Affairs is a woman and so that means that not only is our country at the forefront but we are really sensitive to women's political participation. You know that the armedconflicts that our country has experienced have really led to total upheaval in everything we are trying to implement such as strategies, policies and projects. I won't dwell too much on that. I'mgoing to give the floor to the colleague from our embassy who is going to talk a little bit and come back a little bit on all of the questions that you put and then I will give the floor to thelegal charge admission. You have the floor, colleagues. Thank you very much, Madam Minister. My thanks to the Distinguished Delegate, the Committee Member for her concerns and questions particularlyon implementation or the evolution of the law on parity. I would like to come back to the commentsthat the charge admission mentioned when it comes to the implementation of this law. The colleague has specified that this law was an evolving one. The idea was that during the transitional period, the tenyear transition period that was proposed and enshrined in that law to enable evolution and as you know, the issue of parity, even in western democracies, the longest standing western democracies, that tookmany years to be implemented. It is an ongoing process. It is done in different stages, particularly in our case, there are very many sociocultural factors that we need to work against. We have toraise awareness among women. We have to get them interested in holding public office. We have todo to spark a political vocation among women's communities and to do that, it takes time. It takes a long time to be able to achieve it. I mean, that is the will and the goal set by the governmentof ensuring 50/50 parity and to do that, we need to go through all of these phases, particularly awareness raising, explain to women that they have the capacity, they are able to, they have the right to be involved in politics, to be involved in such management and so on. So, that'sthe additional information I wanted to provide. Thank you. My thanks to the charge d'affaires. Let me give the floor to the legal adviser, the charge d'admission now. Thank you. According to the UNwomen report, 43% of women were victims of violence during the previous elections. That is correct.As I said, this was in a widespread context of insecurity that was prevailing at the time.Following that report, work has been done. First of all, in Central African Republic, we have a gender and election strategy. This is a document which has assessed the situation and which has identifiedobstacles to women's political participation and it proposed specific steps to improving women's participation, particularly in elections. The strategy has been established and put in place overthe past few years. I should like to say that the Distinguished Deputy opposite me is a member of the Parliament. She was one of the beneficiaries of this specific strategy, the support given to women candidates so that they could participate in elections. The electoral code generally speakingstipulates that all candidates shall be made secure given the security situation in the country. Whenever elections occur, there is a security plan, a widespread general security plan that is draftedby the government with the support of security partners, MINUSCA, with the MINUSCA forces. This plan makes provision for security of all electoral operations. The electoral code also stipulatesthat all candidates must have security from national forces that must be supported in that. So thecommittee member mentioned the hotlines that would enable people to flag violence against women and as to whether that will continue, yes, today we still have these hotlines in place. People can call forfree and they can report cases of violence. Financing of candidates, funding for female candidates, yes,yes. The government organizes elections when there is competition for electoral posts. The government itself does not fund candidates who send away the law on funding for political parties and the systemof funding for political parties is being drafted. This draft bill requires a quota of female candidates to ensure that they can benefit from public funding. But there are partners who are supporting the electoralprocess and as I said earlier, these partners, whenever there is an electoral period, when the process is launched, they support candidates and there are partners that have financed, that have paidthe relevant funds for women. There were also points that hindered women's participation in the electoral code. For example, previously in the previous legislation, the electoral legislation, it wasstipulated that women or the candidates generally should produce proof of owning property. Thecandidate had to give a land title proving that the person was a land owner or property owner and this provision was analyzed and we found that this provision harmed women because generally speaking,in a family, land ownership is done in the name of the husband. So this provision was simply removed. It was abolished. It was removed from the legislation, the electoral legislation. So these are some of thepoints that I can share with you on this matter. There is also another question on the five women in the truth, justice and reconciliation commission and I said earlier that this committee is one ofthe transitional justice structures. It received an awful lot of support not only from the government but from partners, both men and women have benefited from the support. In the special criminal court,how many women are judges? The special criminal court is a special court. As I say, it's known at the international level and there are as many national judges and international judges sitting in that fornow at the current time among the judges. There are four women judges in the special criminal court in Bongi. That answers that question. On the international criminal court, as the committee member so wellunderlined, the international criminal court has subsidiary competence, if you will. It is cases eitheron the request of the government, a government that is not able to pursue such cases and that is why the government does not hesitate in referring cases that perhaps exceed its organizational capacities, its logistical capacities or its jurisdictional capacities. We do not hesitate in bringing them tothe ICC and today it is ceased at this case as you say so rightly, Madam. Thank you. My thanks to my colleague and I'll give the floor to the Director General on Agenda Promotion, Mr. Theodore Koinam.Thank you. Among the obstacles, there is also insufficient socioeconomic empowerment of women. Women do not have sufficient resources and they might find it difficult to run for candidates. That is one of theobstacles. We have a law protecting women from violence and that law is a comprehensive one and I think you were asking whether we could have a specific law regarding violence in the political context and Ithink that would require further analysis regarding the situation. We already have a global law, a comprehensive law that covers all forms of violence within the CAR and on the acquittal of Jean-PierreBimba, I think there is a support program for victims of what was done by Jean-Pierre Bimba and this is a program that is being drafted, it is being established and the victims benefit from that support at thenational level. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. These are the responses that we can provide to those questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. The Committee thanks the Distinguished Delegation forthe information that you provided in response to the questions. We will now take are there questionshere? No. We will now row back a little bit and look at Article 6. It refers to trafficking, exploitation,prostitution. So I give the floor to Madam Betama so that she can address this Article 6. Madam Betama, the floor is yours. Again, I thank the Delegation for your response. Now, the country remained on Tier 2and the reasons given were that minimum standards regarding trafficking were not met in key areas such as reporting prosecutions and convictions of traffickers, inadequacy of victim services andofficial complicity in human trafficking. Now, the country's location with the borders of Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, DRC makes it a country of departure, transit and destination. We commend you for theinstrument and laws and policies you have adopted. The Act number 22015 in 2022, just last year,trafficking in persons is a very comprehensive antitrafficking law which has strengthened the criminal provisions within the penal code and included new provisions on victim protection and preventiveefforts. Your 2020 to 2024 action plan with the main pillars are commendable and the National Strategic Committee to combat trafficking is established and chaired by the head of state. We also have aministerial counselor. We must mention that cross-border operations are carried out between the State Party and other countries in the subregion. So we thank you. The trafficking profile includesthe transient merchants, herders, relatives, community members and in the aspect of sex trafficking,criminal elements and engage children as young as 12 years in what they callhouses of joy, private residences with little official oversight. There are also the armed groups and the networks. We note also the trainings that you have done, the revision of the standard operating proceduresin coordination with international organizations. What remains is robust implementation. And we would like to ask how women have been involved in the drafting of these trafficking laws and whether thenational women's machinery has a role on the Strategic Committee to combat trafficking. Have you carried out a study on the prevalence of trafficking in women and girls in prostitution to be able to informthe development of strategy in combat trafficking and forced prostitution? Addressing the root causes,including poverty and eliminating the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual exploitation and trafficking. What are the rehabilitation and social integration measures as we recommended in ourprevious concluding observations in 2014? Have you set a timeline for ratifying the UN Convention against transnational organized crimes and protocol supplementing the Convention? In particular, the protocol toprevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. We would like to know going on further what you are doing to vigorously investigate and prosecute the trafficking crimes andseek adequate penalties for convicted traffickers, including complicit officials with deterrent sentences,appointing specialized prosecutors to focus solely on trafficking crimes using the established standard operating procedures which you have drafted commendably to systematically and proactively identifytrafficking victims in the vulnerable populations, e.g. , the refugee camps and working with civil society to increase public awareness, issues of funding and increasing the number of court hearingsand separate them from informal mediations. Now, as regards the exploitation of prostitution, unfortunatelywe do not have too much information. And your state party report paragraph 152 says although slavery has been abolished, it manifests itself in various forms such as trafficking in persons, sale of children, pimping andprostitution. What steps will you take to document the phenomenon in the country? We also know that recruitment of girls, young girls for trafficking is mainly through force. So again we are talking aboutthe robustness of institutions and prosecutions and whether you have child friendly reintegrationprograms. Now, we would like to know what is the state of your law on trafficking? Is it criminalized? Wouldyou consider decriminalization? And how will you address the harassment by police that those engaged in prostitution or suspected to be engaged in prostitution undergo? What is the training program for themedical, legal, professional and educational staff to deal with this? What about reception centers, programs for those who want to exit prostitution, psychological, psychological and legal care structures and healthinterventions? Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And thank you, Madam Head of Delegation. Thank you verymuch, Madam Betama. I now would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation. You have the floor for 10 min to respond to these questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you to Madam Betama.Thank you for the questions that you have just asked. You know, the highest authorities in our state are involvedat their high level in the fight against trafficking in persons. However, the socioeconomic weight of poverty is an obstacle to this fight. I'm going to give the floor to the Director General for Protectionof Women. This will offer additional information afterwards. I will give the floor to the missionlegal chief for additional information. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, MadamMinister. To compliment the information offered specifically on trafficking in persons, what we doneed to share here as information is that the issue of trafficking in persons has been addressed at thevery highest level, the President himself. For example, in 2017, we the report was shared byAmericans. It placed us in a phase in which the trafficking in persons was a matter of concern.This is a result of the context in which we found ourselves and have moved through. Mechanisms were put into place at a higher level and decentralized as well. Yes, today we do have a strategy for fightingagainst for combating trafficking in persons and there are indicators as well surrounding this strategy.This involves and includes trafficking in persons, children. At any rate, there are a great many indicators now that address our strategies or that are tied to our strategies. Now on the ministeriallevel, there are focal points as well. They are there to address this issue of the trafficking in persons.Today, we have a national institute for rapid response so that the care and intervention can rapidlytarget those who have been or are victimized by trafficking in persons. This is aimed at providing them with support as quickly as possible and eventually benefit from reparations. There is ourstrategy and we have a draft document for standard practices when it comes to providing care for and assisting victims of trafficking in persons. That document has just been validated or confirmed andwe are in the process of implementing it. We are again in the process of document implementation andimplementing the standards for victims assistance. We work with IOM on providing assistance and inprevention as well, specifically again in the issue of trafficking in persons. You also noted that theissue of prostitution is not clear and you are right as regards the concerns you have expressed. As of now,as we are in the process of moving towards the adoption of a law on harassment, we are looking at how we can address these issues at the same time so that the trafficking in persons, prostitution, sothat these different factors be born in mind in order to ensure that those that are in prostitution are not victims also of trafficking or other exploitation. So that quickly are thethoughts I could offer in response to your question. We have our strategy, we have our standard procedures which has just been adopted and we also have launched our implementation of these. Yes, that's something we are still working at but we do need to note that on the strategic level and the presidential levelthese issues are or remain a matter of concern for the President of the Republic. That's what I want to offer as a response at this time. Thank you. The floor now goes to the head of legal affairs.Thank you, Madam Minister. After the adoption of the law in 2022 on human trafficking specifically,that law was implemented. That's a response to one of the questions. It was implemented, rather we stood up a special prosecutor on this topic and an office to specially address this. So the question is whether there are specialized judges. So yes, there are specialized judges in this topic as well. Now,the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, that is a legal instrument that the CR has been participating in since 2004. This favors the creation of all of these policies andactivities that the Madam Director General addressed. I would like to compliment that information byinforming the Committee members that the Central African Republic received a visit in 2023 from the Special Rapporteur of the SGSR looking at human trafficking. An assessment was made. Progresswas noted because during those activities that I mentioned, among the activities, there was the creation of a Committee to combat trafficking in persons. They have an operational plan of action and the UN supported their support to the implementation or for the implementation ofthat plan of action. I thank you kindly. Thank you to the head of the legal mission. I now give the floor to the Director General on matters of gender. So I would like to add some additional information as well.Thank you for giving me the floor. Prior to delving into the strategy on combating human trafficking,there I would note that there is something else we would like to mention. In our country, the definitionof human trafficking varies. We can say that a family that takes a child from the province and brings that child from the rural area and mistreats that individual, that is considered to be trafficking,or human trafficking. This is one of the things we are doing right now. We are looking at how we canput data on this. We are putting in place a mechanism for data collection on human trafficking. I think that is one of the things that the Committee was that is one of the thingsthat our Committee has put together. There are many practices that need to be addressed when it comes to human trafficking. Another aspect in our country is that we have put in place structures for providingcare for victims of trafficking. We have a house, a building that was built with EU donor funds. It is called the House of Hope. We receive victims in that House of Hope of human trafficking victims. Theybenefit from assistance there. I wanted to mention those as examples. Thank you. Thank you to the Director General. I would also like to underscore that on human trafficking, there are social and culturalelements that make it so that those who are victims tend to hesitate to report. We do need in-depth workthat helps the victims and those close to the victims to step forward and report so that we can take measuresand put an end to the scourge. I thank you. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the Distinguished Delegation. Thank you for your responses. I see that Madam Betama has requested the floor. Madam Betama, you have thefloor for 2 min . Madam Chair, I would also like to thank the Delegation for their answers and the assurances of addressing the issue robustly. This is very important because in the context of conflict,this is one area in which violence against women goes underground and totally suppressed. As you mentioned, they cannot even come forward to report. It is in the context of conflict and as a result of conflictthat creates the atmosphere that it is easier to traffic girls and women. I do thank you immensely. This is not really a question but a thanking and putting out one or two thoughts in the area. The1st is the one of data because one of the reasons why the country remained on Tier 2 was the absence of data. This issue of data is very, very important. Then resources, especially for the mixed unit for rapidintervention and suppression of sexual violence, increased resources to be able to address what weall have mutually recognized and acknowledged. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam. I think now we canmove to the consideration of Article 9 of the Convention on Nationality. I would like to give the floor at this time to Madam Ergobami for 4 min . Madam, the floor is yours. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.And once again, I would really like to congratulate the State Party for its commitment to fulfilling internationally agreed human rights frameworks like the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, and in particular for ratifying the International Convention onStatelessness. Also I commend the efforts to intensify birth registration which was raised in the last dialogue. I would also really like to appreciate the responses you have provided to date despite thecontext that the country finds itself. As the State Party is aware, nationality and citizenship rights are foundational to guaranteeing other rights, privileges, and benefits for all citizens regardless of sex. They also equip citizens with the framework that guides the fulfillment of their roles,responsibilities, and civic duties. And, of course, they inform personal aspirations. The Committee, therefore, commends the State Party's efforts to implement recommendations proposed in Paragraph 34of the concluding observations issued following the last dialogue in 2014. It is in this regard that I would like to request that the State Party provide information on the progress that has beenachieved to date on birth registration of all children, including girls, born within the territory of the State Party and the measures taken to facilitate the registration of internally displacedgirls and boys. Similarly, can you provide registration at birth of Central African refugee children who were born in foreign countries while ensuring that registration and provision of validtravel documents is ongoing for women and children by your consulates and working in collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I would also appreciate if you canprovide data and statistics disaggregated by sex and location on births registered and the validtravel documents that were issued. Similarly, the State Party reply on the list of issues, Paragraph 53 states that the ongoing amendment of the national code takes into account earlier raised concerns regardingthe transfer of Central African nationality by a woman to a foreign husband. Can you kindly clarify, one, whether the law has been amended and promulgated and the current explicit provisions on nationalitytransfer to spouses? Second, if yes to that question, can you indicate if the new legislation has been publicized and how many foreign husbands have taken advantage of the provisions to date? If no, pleaseprovide the timeline for completion of the amendments and the modalities that will be put in place to ensure their implementation. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And thank you to the Delegation.Muchas gracias, Senhora Egobami. Thank you, Madam Egobami. The Madam Head of Delegation has to withdraw temporarily from the podium, but I will give the floor to the representative of the permanent mission,the charge d'affaires. He will be responding to these matters and he will also steward the responses fromthe Delegation to the Committee. Thank you very much, Mr. Head of Delegation. The floor is yours.So in order here, I will give the floor 1st to the charge d'admission for human rights, the mission head for human rights. He will provide some responses that will be completed or complimented by the DirectorGeneral for the promotion of women. You have the floor. I thank the charge d'affaires. The Distinguished Delegate, Distinguished Committee Member has commended the CAR for ratifying the protocol onstatelessness. I would like to compliment this by noting that the additional protocol on the African level and the regional level, the two additional protocols on statelessness are being consideredcurrently. And that is part and parcel of our commitment to celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights. That is to say the ratification of additional instrumentsthroughout 2024. Turning to all of the instruments and the texts, I did note in my preliminary remarks that there is a national human rights policy. This is a general framework for us and within these policiesthere is a strategy that ensures that from now on a Committee will be following all of the texts, examining all of the texts that have already entered into force and that are already in force and towhich we are not members and for which we will develop a strategy for joining. Now we have in our citizenship information we have birth data. We do need to note right off the bat that the issue of birthcertificates is a real challenge for our states, African states in general and for the CR in particular that has been through protracted conflict. One of the consequences of this conflict has been thedestruction of archives and civil status documents. A deep dive into this work has already been completedand is being executed still to improve our birth registration. I should like to note that the familycode which establishes a limit, a deadline for birth registration after birth, that was one month. That has been changed to six months now. That helps to that is aimed at facilitating birth registration.Further, the law sets forth that when that delay has or rather that deadline has passed one can go before a judge to receive leave of the judge to go before the civil registry authorities to registera birth. Much work has been done with the support of different partners. I would like to noteUNFPA and UNICEF among them. They have finance programs for a roaming courthouse that sees judgesbring their court to the population to facilitate the establishment and the rulings on birth certificates allowing for the birth registration. Statistics broken down by age and gender, I cannot providethat right now. I would like to ask that this be allowed to be submitted in written form. Now, nationality and the transfer of nationality or bequeathing of nationality is rather delicatefor the CAR in particular. We have had a great many cross-border problems. We had spoken ofcountries, neighboring countries. This is delicate. The code that we have governing this in the CAR was drafted right after independence and they are being implemented just now. Nationality transferor issuance comes automatically when a union is celebrated between a man and a woman. So marriage, citizenship by marriage from the man to the wife and it is automatic. However, in the other direction,from a woman citizen to men, there are conditions that have been placed on this. We do not have datato indicate how many citizenships have been granted from a wife to a husband. We can't offer that information. But the thought is launched on it and for some time have been looking to reform thatnationality code which has a lot of different aspects that are not necessarily adapted tothe current world. So we have reflections launched to improve that. So the thoughts offered here are helpful when it comes to improving and reflecting upon this legal framework so as to bring it intospeed with the international instruments. So the recommendations will be very much taken onseriously by the CAR. Thank you. Thank you. We have a member of the Delegation that will be taking thefloor at this time to compliment the information that we have just heard from the mission chief. Thank you.Thank you, Madam Head of Delegation. Just additional information on the issue of civil statusand birth registration. The mission chief has referred to the consequences of the successive crisesthat we have that have destroyed civil status archives. In addition to that, there is another problem in the CAR or that has been a problem for a great deal of time. That is the issue of access topopulations that are so-called minorities, the pygmies and the people. For some time now, our governmenthas undertaken awareness raising campaigns. These are systematic campaigns held with these populationgroups in order to help them so that these population groups can register the births of their children and thus participate in the development of our country, the country to which they all belong. Sojust additional piece of information that I wanted to add to that which we heard from the head of mission. Thank you very much. Thank you very much to the charge d'affaires. Madam Chair, these are the responsesthat we have been able to offer under Article 9 clarifying that statistical data will be passed along subsequently. Thank you kindly. On behalf of the Committee, we should like to thank the DistinguishedDelegation for the information provided. We take note that the Delegation will be submitting statistical information in writing and I just correct one point that I said at the beginning of my statement whenI said that you had 24 hours to submit that information in writing. Given that it is Fridayat the end of the week, you have until Monday 5:00 p.m. to send us through your permanent missionthe relevant information that you wish to provide either on Article 9 or any other articles that youmay deem relevant. This by Monday 5:00 p.m. if you could, please. With the word limit of 1500 words, please. Mr. Gobamian is requesting the floor for follow-up questions. You have the floor for twominutes, Madam. Madam Chair and to the Delegation, I just wanted clarification on the response that was given because from the reply to the list of issues, the State Party had indicated that amendment of thenational code is ongoing and that the transfer of nationality is an item under that amendment. Just for the record, is that the case? And if so, when would that process likely to be concluded? Becausethe response that we got seemed to be contradictory that you would be considering it but you had already reported to us that that process had started. Just for the record and to correct our interpretationof what you submitted in the reply to the list of issues. Thank you. Thank you very much for thatclarification. Madam Head of Delegation, let me give you the floor for you to respond on that specificpoint on the situation of the law. On this particular point, by way of clarification, I will give the floorto the legal charge to give some detail here. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. I think it is just an issue of the terms used perhaps. I was thinking, I talk about reflection and the thought process. It didn't starttoday. I mean, the country has long felt it needed to reform the nationality code. So there has been a working group that's been set up and the issue of nationality transfer through a civil union, this isone of the issues that's been discussed by that committee. There is prior technical work that's already been undertaken and is already on route. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Thank you for thoseanswers. We understand then that the reform of the nationality code is underway and that the law hasn't yet been fully adopted. We will now move to part 3 of the convention and we will address articles 10 to 14.We will start with the right to education and I would like to give the floor to Ms. Berdema for her to address article 10 for 4 min , please, Madam Chair. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And once again, Icongratulate you, the Delegation, for the specific sector policy initiatives you have taken in the area of education. I will not recount them. They are in your State Party report, paragraphs 59 to 62. But it isnoteworthy that you have flagged issues of preschools, efficacy of the educational system, increasing the rate of completion of schools, professionalizing higher education and adopting transition plan for theministry of national education and vocational education. It is noteworthy that you are looking at preschool and you are looking at higher education with the same enthusiasm. So I would like to ask beyond some ofthese policies that have entered, are there new policies in place? Going forward, I would want to look at the issue of access to education and the disparities that Madam Chair, Madam Head of Delegation, you mentioned in your openingremarks. It is clear that children don't have free access to free education throughout the country. And the access also was hindered by the use and recruitment of children in conflict and the occupation of schools by parties to the conflict and the use ofchildren in mining activities. So what measures are you taking to enshrine education as a universal right, both constitutionally and in the legal framework? Standardize the laws on compulsory education and explicitly guarantee 12 years of free primary and secondaryeducation. And in line with your preeducation policies, ensure at least one year of free and compulsory preprimary education and improvethe functioning of the educational system in the country, especially for girls disadvantaged groups and in areas affected by conflict. Let me touch on the issue of teachers and infrastructure because these are critical for the lack of teachers and adequate school facilities. How will youmobilize resources, incentivize teachers through temporary special measures and revive the educational sector by rebuilding andrehabilitating schools' infrastructure and improving the quality of education, not forgetting sanitary facilities to encourage girls to go to school andto be retained? Issues of infrastructure, rehabilitation and equipping of roads that will lead the schools, are there explicit provisions orprotections for schools in educational infrastructure from military use in any of your policies, rules or rules? What measures are you taking to examine and address or remedythe disproportionate detriment to girls' access to education as a result of the hostilities? Let me move on to disability which is important in itself and in the context ofconflict. What we would ask here that opportunity should be taken in the reconstruction process to align infrastructure to disability and the syllabus looking at gender, human rights and peace education which you yourself, peace education, you have already flagged. Will you train counselors who will help children who have gone through trauma? What plans are inplace to tackle early marriages and other inimical cultural practices through social protection interventions that Transport have already mentioned and promote the retention of girls? As regards vocational training and employment, you have indicated that you have vocational training for persons with sensory impairments. Much as we commend this, may we ask that this not be used as a means to stereotype disability and the rights of persons with sensory impairments?May this not be used as a means to stereotype disability education as being this sector being the only appropriate or the main appropriate one? We also realize that you are recovering also from the pandemic, the COVID pandemic. How these twin challenges, conflict and COVID, how are you handling them as far as education?Thank you. Thank you very much, Madame Bredema. Let me give the floor now to the Distinguished Delegation for 10 min for their responses. Thank you. My thanks to Ms. Bredema for the questions. You know that Committees that are set up thanks to the RCPCA, they are multisectual Committees. They bring to the table, they bring to thetable many sectors, e.g. , the multisectual Committee on Health, Nutrition, the Ministry of Gender is part of that particular Committee, e.g. . So that means that problems can be looked at holistically in a cross-cutting manner instead of dealing with them in silos issue, gender separate from health, separate from education. So that's not how we proceed. So the government has aprogram of integration of 1500 teachers. This project is being finalized and the idea is it will cut problems linked to the human resources in the education system. So that will help remedy those problems. On early years, this is free because early years is the starting point for human capital. If in early childhood the children are neglected, then that has an impact subsequently onindividuals until they reach adulthood. And in our country, young children are given care in what we call a kind of kindergarten. They are free. The Ministry for Promotion of Gender also deals with this kind of nursery, special kind of nursery. And I will give the floor to the representative for the family protection to develop on that more.In a moment. You also asked about schools which are occupied by armed groups. We have a program to restore the state authority and this is called RESA, restoration of state authority and this operates in zones really affected by the armed conflict and they were previously occupied and the idea is to restore the classrooms and the schoolswhere this was the case so that the students and pupils can study in decent conditions. So that's what I can tell you on the specific points. I will give the floor now to the Director General for Protection of Family for her to give a bit more information there and perhaps other members of the Delegation subsequently. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. My thanks to the Minister. The questions raised here pertain more to the right to education as yousay by way of introduction I should say that we have submitted a report that the report was submitted in 2018. The report that was submitted in 2018, the information in it today we can tell you that there has been change since that time. Things have changed. In 2018, the CAR was still getting back on its feet after thethe crisis. Schools were still occupied by armed groups. This was widespread. They were vandalized as well. I'm sorry for the term but buildings and premises had been vandalized and thanks to the support from partners these structures have been restored, a lot of them. And we can definitely count that as a huge step forward in terms of the right to education and restoration of premises and the questionof premises and the physical buildings and so on. What else can I tell you? We together with the support of the European Union are looking to see how we can include in the curriculum teaching on gender from a very young age so that gender related issues, access of girls to education so that this can be reallyaddressed from a young age. That's something that is again another step forward for us. And on the children's nurseries, the age group that the ministry covers is prior preschool basically, prior to compulsory school age because the ministry has the mandate of preparing childrenfor contact with formal education, helping them separate from the leave the family and go to school on a daily basis. So that's what we are doing with these nurseries, through social assistance, we are trying to see how we can help these children be socialized and be able to interact with society. Following the nursery, they will then, of course, be in touch with their peers at the preschool age and it's preparatorywork that's done in the nurseries. After the nurseries then from 4, they go to school, primary school and the ministry of the education then takes over in terms of the teachers and teacher training and so on. Now, regarding the new policy, to date we have been using the education sector policy and this takesinto account the free nature of education. It's been recommended by the committee monitoring the rights of the child that there would be a recommendation on free education and in our childhood protection code it clearly stipulates that school is free for all children on Central African soil and we are putting in place mechanisms to ensure that school is trulyfree. Of course, the mechanisms need to be set up yet. Now, measures taken to deal with keeping children in schools with the support of UNICEF, we have begun to put in place the ministry of education committees on prevention and combating violence against children. These committees are beingestablished currently within Bongui already and gradually they will be rolled out to different places across the whole country so that we can make sure that girls can go to and can stay in school. So that's what I wanted to bring by way of response to your question on access of children to education and the right to education. Thank you. Madam, let me give the floor now to the charge de mission. Thank you.Thank you very much, Madam Minister. Just to add some additional information, I should say that preschooling is not only something we want but it's also included in the law on educational systems in the CAR. This is law 97014 and this has long been enforced and makes schooling compulsory and free for all children. Compulsory and free. Now, over and above that legislation, the governmenthas drafted several programmes, several activities not only to facilitate children's access and particularly girls' access to school but also to make sure that they stay in school. That is with the World Bank, UNICEF and the welfare programme. We have also set up a programme to provide a meal to children to make sure that children from rural areas can particularly stay in schools. This programmehas 1,355 schools benefited from it out of the 3,000 schools that the children have, 3,367. There are expedited programmes to help children catch up. These programmes have been put in place and are working well. There is also a project called making school accessible to girls. This is a programme that is part of the project and it has been launched and I can tell you that today it means that study grants areminimal but they are very encouraging to girls up through to the year 13 for higher education and that helps to keep them in school. It is true that a lot of the buildings were vandalised in the conflict and we are aware of that but work has been done. There is a rebuilding of infrastructure plan that should benefit all of the prefectures across the country. We have got figures on that and there is also a training plan forteachers and capacity building for those who are already teaching. Again, we can share figures with you on that. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. These are the responses that we would give you to the initial cluster. Thank you. Thank you very much on behalf of the committee to the Distinguished Delegation for the information. I understand that you are perhaps going to send us more informationin writing. Is that correct on the last point? There will be some statistics forthcoming. Could you just confirm that for me so that I can record it? Madam Chair, yes, we have a lot of statistics in this area. We have a lot of figures that we can give you and given that time is very brief, we won't be able to give them to you orally so we will send them in writing. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Let me now give the floor to two experts who have requested it for follow-up questions1st of all, to Ms. Boniface and then for 2 min , please, Madam. Thank you, Madam Chair. In line with observations from the CRC from 2017 and from SESC in 2018 and the UPR, they all drew attention to the fact that what is still permitted is corporal punishment for children in schools. I would like to know whether this has been amendedin law and in practice and whether any legal reforms will be given to the Family Code on this issue. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Bademi, you have the floor for 2 min . Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will not ask for an immediate response because you may want Article 11 to be asked before we go for break but I was going to ask the same issue of data. Then secondly, my question aroundthe occupations of schools was also that is there a law? We know they have been occupied. We know they are being reclaimed but is there a law to avoid repetition? Then I was also under the impression education was not free but if it is free, is it being enforced? If it is free, then it gives me the courage to ask a question I was a bit timid about asking thatquestion. Will you include digital technologies all across the country to promote education, especially for those who cannot go to the classroom? I was feeling reticent because I thought youhad too much but if it is free, then there is the opportunity to do this. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very briefly then. Let me give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation just for 5 min for them to answer the question on corporal punishment and the issueof technology and education. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I will begin directly with the issue of technology, digital technologies. Digital technology islinked to electricity and you, of course, know that our country only has solar, yes, but onsolar, that cost is expensive. And I was saying earlier that our country had problems with financial issues and treasury related issues. So we don't have necessarily we are not planning to includedigital technology within our schools in the immediate future. I can put it like that. In one prefecture, three towns, the in three towns, classes are being run digitally with solar energyso that some students can have access to math classes. That's one initiative from the head of state. So in three towns in the country, then the children in the upper years, they dohave little they have more phones that mean they can access those classes, but it is quite exceptional. On corporal punishment, let me give the floor to my colleague, the charge d'affairesfor him to answer. Thank you, Madam Minister. On corporal punishment in schools, since 1997,we have had a law in place prohibiting corporal punishment. Moreover, the Ministry of Educationencourages schools to issue rules formally prohibiting this punishment within the schools. That's what I would say by way of an addition there. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank youfor those answers. Now, let's move on to the right to employment, Article 11. I would like to give the floor to Mr. Elgun Safarov for 4 min , please. You have the floor. Madam Chair,ladies and gentlemen, Central African Republic ratified 47 conventions of the International Labor Organization. Women were most representing in social affairs, health, the civil serviceand financial and budget. National document on employment adopted on 4 November, 2016. This policy covers four sections, namely mining, forestry, infrastructure and agriculture. The public sectoris male-dominated. Women's law educational level and the qualifications diminish their participation in the labor market and in certain jobs. Employment population below international poverty line bysex and age. We are using such kind of line of data of UN women, e.g. , 58.7% of women under theline of poverty. But it's UN women data 2021. It's not maybe exact. Just clarification. The gender wage gap, men and women in the civil service on average 40.6 in the health sector, the gap is 28%. The law prohibitssexual harassment, but the government does not effectively enforce the law. The law prescribes no specific penalties for the crime, especially in workplaces. We say about investigations and criminal cases in workplaces, sexual harassment. It's not a common case of harassment. Discrimination against women occurs in all sectors of the economy and in rural areas where traditional practices that favor men are widespread. The law says it's a standard work weekfor 40 hours in the government employees, but there are really 52 hours. The household provisions discriminate against women who are mainly the household employees. Overtime policy varies according to the workplace. There is no legal prohibition of compulsory overtime. Violations of overtime policy may be referred to the Minister of Labor directly to the labor court. How many overtime violations have been reported, e.g. , investigated?There are many questions at the same time. Labor conditions, safety standards in the workplaces which are under the risk and concern of our Committee. The UPR related its recommendation to amend Article 252 of the Labor Code to combat occupation, segregation, gender stereotyping. What they did especially on this point, implementation. We have information about Muslim women facing multiple violence in the labor sector. Limitationof participation, especially in civil service and different public formal sectors. What about the representation of religious and ethnic minorities in civil service and formal employment sector? Data. What during these difficult situations government do, especially fighting the gender gap in the labor sector? Social security coverage, benefits, measures to address sexual harassment in the workplace. Where important sites are mining in the sector of the economicsector? Working conditions and mining in the industrial sectors, especially houses, state protecting the women representations at the same time, but at the same time, safe conditions in this sector of work. There are many points. I want to go to state in two more. What are the timelines for incorporating ILO violence and harassment Convention and how do you see to implement 47 ILO Conventions which implemented, ratified by your country?How you will make assessment and how you will implement that in the future generations? Because it's difficult directly during the worst situation including the public situation, financial problems, COVID-19 problems directly internal during this year in your country. Last question, the suspension of the parity act how we assume participation in labor market initiatives. Thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Safarov. This brings us to the end of the 1st session of the1st part of our meeting today. This afternoon we will continue with our dialogue with the Central African Republic and we will meet back here again at 3 p.m. The morning meetingis now adjourned. I give the floor to the Secretariat for announcements. Thank you, Madam Chair. The briefing by the NGO coalition on the abolition of surrogate motherhood will take placeat 1:45 to 2:45 here in this room, room 23. Thank you very much."}
{"title": "", "text": "Excellencies, dear colleagues, we are going to start. And we apologize for the delay. We are trying to insert some of the inputs that we received yesterday evening and I think todayin the morning. I hope you had a good rest yesterday night and that we are going to work hard todayso that we can advance as we can as we will have our last day of this intercessional meetingworking on the draft declaration. I don't I will not take much of your time. I think we will straightgo back to our text. But before starting, if I remember well, we the Delegation of the European Union hadrequested some time to consult and come back on one of the paragraphs that they had contributed to. Iwould I think it is the same and I would like to give the floor to the Delegation of the European Union so that they can 1st indicate which is the paragraph that they would like to react to so that we can retrieveit and then we see what they have collected as feedback from the members of the European Union and then we will come back to our last to the level where we were yesterday evening where we were reviewing the text. Withouttaking much of your time, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union. You have thefloor. This was with regard to Article 4, paragraph 2.D, no, I apologize, point E where we had made a proposal that hadthen led to additional text suggestions but we have consulted again and I think we can drop our request becauseif all of that has to be added, it makes the text unnecessarily, Madam Chair. Thank you. You said Article 4.2, paragraph D. So our initial proposal was to add a reference to the ICERT and then there was a reference to other relevant international instruments and then we started working with all of that but it is making the text very heavyand for us it was a minor request so we would be willing to drop it from our side so that we can put this one in green and move on. Yes, we are dropping in line with the ICERT and as well as other relevant international instruments but this was not a contribution from the EU Delegation. If I check on the list ofMember States that contributed to this paragraph. That is correct, Madam Chair. We made the initial proposal and then there were proposals in reaction to ours and then it became a big package and in that sense the text becomes difficult to read and if you do it in E, why don't you do it in the other bullet? So taking all of that into account, we would be ready just to withdraw our initialrequests and then if possible if we go back to the original language. Thank you. Thank you very much. Does it mean that you are agreeable to the text highlighted as Brazil contribution? Adopt or strengthen anti-discrimination legislation to make it comprehensive and ensure its effective implementation? That was indeed the original textthat was supported as drafted by Brazil. So for us that would be fine as well. We would go back to that, yes. Thank you very much. I would like to ask if the rest of the Delegations are agreeable to keeping the text on the screen under subparagraph E indicated as the proposal from Brazil that reads adopt or strengthenanti-discrimination legislation to make it comprehensive and ensure its effective implementation. I do not see any Delegation requesting for the floor. I would like to request the Secretariat to clean the 1st part of the paragraph and keep the one that is highlighted as the contribution from Brazil on subparagraph E. Thank you very much. I would like to check if they wouldbe any other Delegation that would like to react, to comment to the text that was covered yesterday, if they would have new inputs collected that they would like to share this morning? No. I would like to request the Secretariat to go to the point when we left our text yesterday evening. Yes. Then alsoinformed that the paragraph, the subparagraph M that you see on the screen is an addition from Brazil Delegation. Actually we have two subparagraphs under this article and they also contributed with an additional article at the end. And I don't see theBrazil representative. I'm told she is on her way coming. But in the meantime, I think the Secretariat can put the text on the screen and we look at it and we see if it is something that can be adopted. Subparagraph M as proposed by Brazil Delegation reads: Intensify the efforts in the field of education including human rights educationin order to promote an understanding and awareness of the causes, consequences and evils of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. I think there is a reference to the DPA, is it paragraph 127 which is adopted? Take your time, look at the text andwe are available to listen to your comments, inputs if any. Yes. I don't see any comments. Maybe if because it is the 1st time that you are having these paragraphs, it will be better for these paragraphs to wait for Brazil Delegation so that they explain the background and the motivation why they brought these paragraphs. Andif you allow, we perhaps go back to the normal text that we heard while we are waiting for Brazil Delegation to be in the room. I would like to get your feedback and guidance on this one. Okay. As I do not see any request for the floor, we go back to our normal text while we are waiting for Brazilian Delegation. We go down. We wait to put it as Article 5 because we have we consider that we areare just going through our previous text. Yes. Okay. As you would notice, this Articlehad a title that reads \"Preventing and Combating Racism and Hate Speech.\" But we agreed that we will not keep the title of the Articles, but this is a way for you to get to knowwhat will be the content of this Article. And then if you allow, we go then to Paragraph No. 1. Yes,this one. Article No. 1 of this Paragraph No. 1 of this Article, which will become, I think, Article No. 6. \"States shall develop comprehensive strategies to ensure the right to freedom of opinion andexpression while taking all measures necessary to prevent and combat the dissemination of racist messagesand those that result in racial discrimination, xenophobia or any form of intolerance anddiscrimination.\" Comments, inputs to this Paragraph that was discussed before? Yes, I see the DistinguishedDelegation of European Union requesting the floor. You have the floor. We have language suggestion againwhere it says \"while taking all measures necessary to prevent,\" we would suggest \"while taking measuresto effectively prevent,\" because it's not the number of measures that counts, it's the effect that theyhave. \"While taking measures to effectively prevent.\" Thank you. I would like to give the floor to theDistinguished Delegation of the United Kingdom. Sorry, maybe European Union is still checking on the text.Yes, please, you have the floor, United Kingdom. Thanks. For us, it would be really helpful if we could have a source for this kind of language, given that it's touching upon issues relating to freedom of opinion and expression.And in the UK, we have pretty high bar for protection on freedom of opinion and expression. So it's really useful for us to understand sort of where this language comes from. And I'm sure there is ampleoptions that we can choose from. We are just a bit concerned that the threshold here is quite low for us. So, e.g. , the term \"intolerance\" is quite a low threshold for our freedom of opinion laws. Soif we could find some agreed language, that would really help us out. Thanks. Thank you. I see theDistinguished Delegation of the United States requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We have similar concerns about freedom of expression, particularly I think with the word \"prevent\" as it's used here. So we would request to strike \"prevent and.\" I think to balance thatout, we could support the EU's proposal of focusing on the effective combating of dissemination. So I think striking \"prevent\" but using measures that effectively to effectively combat would be a goodway to balance out this paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. United States? I apologize. I should also addthe request to replace \"shall\" with \"should\" in the front of the line, in the top of the line. Thanks.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Paraguay. Use the mic.Thank you, Chair. And good morning. Just a proposal for the end, instead of any form of intolerance and discrimination, we would have unrelated intolerance against people of African descent, comma, in anysphere of life, comma, public or private, comma, both online and offline. Can you repeat slowly?Comma, in any sphere of life, comma, public or private, comma, both online and offline.Any sphere of life, I think. Public or private, both online and offline.Yes, I would like to request that the Distinguished Delegate from Paraguay check if it is well reflectedon the screen. Yes, it is fine. It is fine, Madam Chair. Thank you. Thank you. I see the DistinguishedDelegation of United States requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you to the Distinguished Delegate of Paraguay for the proposal. I would suggest that maybe end relatedintolerance may be a necessary since intolerance is already part of the clause. I would further need to reserve position on the specific phrase in any sphere of life, public or private, here as it relatesto freedom of expression. This paragraph is already a little difficult on the issue of freedom of expression and to delve into private spheres of life given the language that is already in here makes it a bit more difficult to accept. So I think we will have to just reserve position on any sphere oflife, public or private, and we can revert back to that the next time we visit this text. Thank you. There are two things in reservation and I think there is also a suggestion on how to replace intoleranceso that we don't have intolerance twice in the same paragraph, I think. I see the Distinguished Delegation of Paraguay requesting for the floor. You have the floor. I'm sorry, Madam Chair, but my proposal wasactually to remove the section any form of intolerance and discrimination and to simply have unrelatedintolerance instead. Yes, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the UnitedKingdom. You have the floor. Thanks. I think we need to work on this to be honest and use a source ofagreed language because I think it is really difficult for us to be able to agree to, like I said before, the threshold for us is really high when it comes to preventing freedom of opinion and speech andthings like that. So, e.g. , UK legislation means we can only sort of limit freedom of expressionand opinion when it comes to references of racial hatred. So it is difficult for us to be able to accept all of the other things we have got at the bottom of the paragraph, which is why I think we need to find some agreed language from the myriad of resolutions that we have already passed on thissubject. I'm happy to take a look at that, but I think we will just need to put the UK's reservation on the whole paragraph to be honest at this point. Thanks. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of European Union. On the screen, I think from our side, we also have to put a reservation for legal reasons at this point. Publicly inciting to violence or hatred on thebasis of race and a number of other grounds has been forbidden for years. We have a strong legal framework, but yeah, this is language that I need to verify. Yeah. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of Panama. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and a very good morning to everyone in attendance. We just wanted to voice our support for the proposal made by Paraguayto include the reference to any sphere of life, public or private, and also the online and offlinedimension. Thank you. I think the three Delegations expressed their reservation on the whole paragraph.I think we need to reflect it correctly. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to clarify, I will wait until the typing is done.Thank you. I should clarify. I think it is the UK who has a reservation on the paragraph and I only have the United States only has a reservation on the phrase in any sphere of life, public or private.I believe that EU also has a reservation on that particular phrase. I don't want to speak for them.But just to clarify, and if you could kindly remove both online or offline, the part that struck through just before USA because I don't have a concern with that particular phrase. Exactly. Thank you.So I just have a reservation on in any sphere of life, public or private. I believe that's also what the EU views but I will let them speak up and the UK's reservation is separately on the whole paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. I see the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union requesting thefloor. You have the floor. My problem with private sphere possibly is it is not because maybe yesterdayevening I have been thinking about a violent attack that I am a terrorist, that I have done it and that I am a terrorist. It is not because a journalist has been thinking that he wants to write an articlethat contains insults to the head of state that he did it and that he should be punished for it. So that is a very thin line and especially if you bring in any sphere of life, public or private,we have to be careful. Even if I understand I see the reasoning and the goodwill behind the proposalbut this is the legal problem with it when it comes to freedom of expression. Thank you.Thank you. Then the European Union Delegation has reservations on this specific part of theparagraph like the U.S. and then we will have reservation on the whole paragraph by the U.K. onlyif I'm not mistaken. EU Delegation, are we are weJust like the U.S. on that part of the sentence, any sphere of life, public or private. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Excellency permanent representative of Costa Rica. You have the floor.Good morning, colleagues and thank you for giving me the floor. Costa Rica has no issue with thisparagraph in general but it does seem to us that there is a limited potential for putting into practicesomething which says in any sphere of life, public or private. We agree, therefore, with the reading justdone by the EU and the United States, it we feel that and I think this is also a legal issue, legalconstitutional issue for Costa Rica and we couldn't, therefore, accept that matters relating to privatelife be subject to this kind of actions. But we do like the paragraph, but the only point we wouldtake issue with is in any sphere of life, public or private. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of the United Kingdom. Thank you. Just maybe to clarify, our problem is with the 2nd half of the paragraph. So we are fine with the 1st three lines up to the comma afterexpression. It is just after that we think we need to find some language that's been agreed. Thanks. So maybe just change the reservation to the 2nd half of the paragraph if it really matters that much.Thanks. I'm sorry. I'm waiting for the Secretariat to reflect the inputs on the screen. Thank you. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia. Thank you, Chair. Of course, the 2nd part of the paragraphcontains various elements that could be difficult to reconcile with regulations. We believe that the1st part of the paragraph should begin with should. So we believe it should be shall instead of should.We would be in favor of keeping shall. Thank you. I see an NGO requesting for the floor. You have thefloor. Yes. I just wanted to mention once again that this is a paragraph where the original Chair'sdocument included the term \"afrophobia\" there, racial discrimination, xenophobia, etc. So unfortunatelyit has disappeared here in this new basic document here. So I do believe that this it should be restored.Thank you. Can you turn off? Yes. I would like to give the floor to the 2nd NGO represented in the room.Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, 1st of all, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gabriel Dantas fromthe Black Women Institute from Brazil. Maybe the DPA language can help in this discussion. And I wouldlike to highlight that the paragraph number 91, it's a great language about this issue that we are discussingright now. Just this recommendation that I would like to highlight. Thank you. Thank you. I see theDistinguished Delegation of Venezuela requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair.I would just like to react quickly. We think that the language on the prevention of hate speech shouldn'treally be cut out. We are not talking about censorship but prevention mechanisms for combating messages of hatred. I think we should focus, for instance, on awareness raising campaigns in orderto try and avoid freedom of expression being misused and being used to ferment discrimination. So we wouldlike to retain the language on prevention here. We think it's very important. Also, as Paraguay said,the elimination of related intolerance, we think that we shouldn't eliminate the spread of hate speechbecause it can actually go beyond simple racism. So, for instance, if we have xenophobia, after xenophobia we could have hate speech or we could keep the statement on related intolerance and discrimination.Thank you very much. Yes. I would like to ask the Distinguished Delegation of Venezuela if the inputsare well reflected on the screen. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair and a very good morningto all colleagues and experts present in the room. To begin with, we would like to support Venezuela's suggestion to keep the notion of prevention in the text. I'm not going to reiterate the argumentsthat my Distinguished Colleague has already put forward. Perhaps this isn't a solution, but readingthe text, it seems to me that we could invert the order of the ideas that are contained therein. So, the main goal of the paragraph is actually to draw attention to the prevention and fight againstagainst the dissemination of racist messages. And that seems to be subordinate here to freedom of opinionand expression. So, if we inverted the order, perhaps the idea would come across better. So, the idea is to prevent these racist messages without losing sight of the need to ensure the right freedom of opinionand expression. So, I have drafted a proposal which I would like to present to colleagues so they canconsider it, perhaps they can consider whether it might be appropriate. It would be as follows. Statesshall develop effective measures to prevent and combat the dissemination of racist messages andthose that result in racial discrimination, xenophobia or any related intolerance against peopleof African descent, while adopting strategies to guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression.Thank you. Didn't you mean racist messages? Is it racist measures? States shall develop effective measuresto prevent and combat the dissemination of racist messages. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you, Madame Chair. Good morning to everybody. Myapologies for arriving late to this meeting today. I appreciate the proposal made by Cuba. Nonetheless,I believe I also have some language that I would like to propose to this paragraph. So, if I mayinclude that for the consideration of others, we intend, our intention here is highlightingwhat's specific to related to that, to freedom of opinion and expression and the racist message andall. So, I would oh, yes. Thank you. It's already there. Perfect. That would be I know you know I'm notreally fond of listing, but for here to be more specific and clarify what we are talking about andtrying to understand our concerns to misinformation, disinformation, hate speech as usual and the ideathat leads to violence and that's quite important for us to highlight that. But we can flexible to see how this could match to the Cuban proposal in inverting but not complicating the language there. Thank you. Asyou see, we have the reference there. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof Panama. Thank you very much, Madame Chair. In the paragraph under discussion, I believe it was Venezuelawho asked for the verb \"prevent\" to be kept. Yes. I would like to add Paraguay's name next to Venezuela's and Cubathere because in keeping with what we said in another paragraph of similar language, we believe that we shouldn't just limit our efforts to combating dissemination but also preventing racist messages and just respond toCuba's proposal. We think that inverting the order could be a good idea as the main message here perhaps is preventing and combating the dissemination of racist messages and other such behavior whichfoments racial discrimination and xenophobia while at the same time guaranteeing the right to freedom of opinion and expression, a very important right. So we could support the proposal to switch the order in the paragraph round. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Venezuela. Yes, Madame Chair. Regarding the suggestion madeby Cuba, is that what you were referring to? Yes, we can support Cuba's proposal to reshuffle the order of the paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Iran. Madame Chair, good morning, colleagues. My Delegation supports the proposal made by Cuba and we propose to add after resultsthat result to add comma or is likely to result. I thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba. Thank you, Madame Chair. Regarding the proposal made by Brazil which we think is a good idea, we would be happy to include the language but perhaps Brazil couldconsider instead of having the language in the 1st paragraph which might make that paragraph even more complex but instead to perhaps include that language on hate speech, disinformation and misinformation in paragraph 2 which is a little more focused on that particular topic and we feel that it might be more relevant and it would alsomake it easier to reach an agreement on this point. So we would have it in paragraph 2. We have not looked at that paragraph yet. Thank you. In that paragraph, paragraph 2. And to also refer to new technologies and social media, we feel that perhaps Brazil's language suggestion would be better placed in paragraph 2.May I ask the Distinguished Delegation of Venezuela to put down the nameplate if they are not requesting for the floor? Yes. I would like to give the floor to the permanent representative of Costa Rica. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Chair. Costa Rica can agree to Cuba's suggestion regarding inverting the order in the paragraph. We do feel it would impart greater clarity to whatwe are trying to say. However, we cannot agree to Iran's addition. So we would prefer the proposal that Cuba made. And then regarding misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, we could also agree to including that but perhaps not in this paragraph but in a paragraph further down. Thank you. Thank you. I would like togive the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you. Thank you for the flexibility of Cuba. And I appreciate their suggestion. I think yes, we can accommodate that considering the 2nd paragraph maybe what the additional language we proposed might be after for disseminating racistmaterials, and then including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech which may also lead to violence, political violence as well as through new information technology and social media might be something that goes along with the language. Yes, we can accommodate this way. We are flexible on that. And as I mentionedbefore, we can go for this new inversion that Cuba proposed. Thank you. Are you proposing to have this paragraph, the text that you just read on paragraph number 2 or to be added to the new paragraph proposed by Cuba? According to what we have been discussing here on the floor, I think this is aappropriate suggestion made by Cuba. And then we can consider the new language not in the A as I mentioned firstly, but going to the paragraph 2 after for disseminated racist materials for incitement. And then we have to see if it's the language goes good in this way.Yes. I would like to suggest that we go back 1st to the 1st paragraph and maybe because now you agreed to bring it to paragraph number 2, we would cancel, delete the whole paragraph that was proposed by Brazil and remain with the two paragraphs. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. Reflecting on the proposalto put the order of the 1st part of Article 5, I think the order as it was originally drafted is important because the right to freedom of opinion expression is established and should be upheld. And then within that framework we talk about how we deal with particular matters of racism and hate speech or whatever may be. I think if you flip it and start off with how to combat racism, which seem right for me however, Iand then you sort of almost as an afterthought address freedom of opinion and expression, we're turning it on its head. So we would strongly prefer the original formulation of starting off with the basis of strategies to guarantee right to freedom of opinion and expressionand then addressing within that framework the particular way that we address racist messages, et cetera. So our strong preference for the 1st formulation over the 2nd . Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Bolivia. Mike.Thank you, Madam Chair. Very briefly, we just wanted to thank Cuba for its suggestion to reorganize the paragraph. We believe it does enhance the emphasis on the fight against discrimination.Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba.Thank you, Chair. I would just like to react. If we were negotiation covenant on civil and political rights or something of that status, perhaps it would make more sense to includefreedom of expression and opinion 1st and then to relate it to specific aspects. But here we're actually working on a document for people of African descent and a document that is specificly on the issues that we need to address in order to protect the rights of people of African descent. And we need to prevent and combat racist messages and that is a key goal for peopleof African descent. So that's why we felt it would be better to place that at the top because it is the main goal. But, of course, that goal should not be pursued without taking into account the fundamental principles that are enshrined in international law such as the right to freedomof opinion and expression. I just wanted to give that rationale a little bit so you could see what I was getting at. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to an NGO inthe room. Thank you very much. This is Jonas with ADF International. First of all, since it is the 1st time taking the floor, we're very appreciative of the Working Group's effortsso far and we're encouraged to see progress gradual but persistent progress on this text. With regard to the paragraph before us, we have two small comments. One with regard to the question of the ordering, while we are more inclined to agree that the original order was the preferableone, it might be worth considering the chapeau of paragraph 147 of the DDPA which says the following: Taking into account existing international and regional standards on freedom of expressionwhile taking all necessary measures to guarantee the freedom of opinion and expression. We believe this language which comes from the DDPA might be slightly stronger even than the existing language on adopting strategies to guarantee since this both makes reference to international and regional standards. One could even potentially add reference to international and regionalobligations but additionally it talks about all necessary measures rather than merely strategies. So we would perhaps propose the addition of that agreed language if there is an interest in that. Our 2nd comment is with regard to the proposal that has now been moved to the2nd paragraph. So perhaps we will wait with that. Thank you. I would like to ask Excellencythe representative of Member States if you what you think about the proposal that has just beenmade? If there is no Delegation that would like to bring this new proposal, then we will leavethis paragraph like it is and move to next paragraph. I would like to request the Secretariat to just show the whole paragraph so that Delegation may check if all their inputs are reflected.Go back to 1st one, yes? From the beginning? Yes. Thank you. May I request now that we havethe Brazil Delegation in the room to go back to the additional paragraphs, some paragraphs that were added to previous Article so that the Brazil Delegation would background and explain more on the newsubparagraphs that were inserted. The Secretariat will go back to subparagraph M and N, I think,of the previous Article. Yes. M, may I give the floor to the Delegation of Brazil? You have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for your flexibility and apologize again to my colleagues going backto one of the Articles. The additional that Brazil is proposing for these paragraphs are related to important issues that have been raised in our Council, the Human Rights Council. One is mostly abouthuman rights education and it's based on the DPA. So just to read it clear and present it properly,intensify the efforts in the field of education including human rights education in order to promote an understanding and awareness of the causes, consequences and evils of racism, racial discrimination,xenophobia and related intolerance. The 2nd paragraph is based on the resolution approvedlast year on sports, also trying to we believe it's an important topic that was raised last year andshould be reflected in the declaration. So it's adapted from that resolution, 54/25. Combat impunityand enhance accountability for racially motivated crimes in sport and take all appropriate measures in accordance with domestic legislation and international obligations to prevent, combat and addressresultantly and effectively all manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the context of sporting events and to ensure that racially motivated acts are sanctionedappropriately. Just a reminder that was supported by more than 100 countries. Thank you. Thank you.So comments, inputs, feedback on these proposals from Brazil? You have the floor, please. Thank you,Ambassador. Costa Rica can support both of those. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Ecuador. Thank you very much, Madam Chair and good morning to my colleagues.Thank you, Brazil, for raising this point and explaining your proposals. We can fully support both subparagraphs. Thank you very much. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegation of Colombia. Thank you. We support these proposals. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. United States has no concern with either paragraph. We would just suggest and this is just a suggestion to Brazil having proposed itthat looking at the DDPA, the part on education is then followed with a lot more language that focuses on education. It is not to say that we should add that language but there is a section on education further down in this declaration and so for coherence it might be worth considering when we get to itperhaps moving this part down to the education part so that it is addressed coherently as a matter ofeducation. That is just a suggestion. Sorry, I don't see the name plates. Yes, the Distinguished Delegationof Paraguay. Thank you, Chair. We just wanted to add our support to Brazil's proposals. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Sorry if I take the floor again. Just a quick reaction to what the Distinguished Delegate from U.S. just mentioned.I would agree with you in other aspects but since we are highlighting a human rights educationthere I would be appropriate what we are talking about in education is more about the system and allfor this purpose here it is a cross-cutting approach to education not restricted to the system, to be enrolled in a school and those things that will be related in that. That is why we would considerputting there that's the rationale behind that. Thank you for highlighting that. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning,dear colleagues. Just to add support to the proposal made by the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil. Thankyou. Yes. The floor is for Cuba. Thank you very much, Chair. Also just to understand the cross-cuttingnature of these topics we do support these paragraphs. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegate of Mexico. Thank you, Chair. Good morning, colleagues. We also support both paragraphs. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegate of the United Kingdom. Thank you, Chair. I think these are good paragraphs. I'm just lookingat the verbs used in the resolutions in the 1st word. So for M, I think it's urges. That's theDDPA. And then in N, it's underlining the importance of. So it would be useful for me just to see whatthe chapeau is of this paragraph because I think potentially we're strengthening what we've already agreed. I'm not suggesting we put urges in there. I think it would be useful to see the chapeau andwhether we're still having this debate over should, shall, urges, encourages or whatever we're using.Thanks. The text of the chapeau is on the screen. Yes. Then we go back to our paragraphs M and N.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Argentina.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. As this is the 1st time that my Delegation is taking the floorduring this intersessional consultation, allow me to begin by commending you, Madam Chair, on your efforts and the work done by yourself and the Secretariat on this document up until now. As our Delegation hasalready said on previous occasions, Argentina supports the idea of having a draft declaration that is robustrobust and we feel that under your guidance we are now on the right track. We're taking the floor becausewe received some comments from our capital today and that's why given that you have been flexible and allowed us to return to the article we discussed yesterday, we would like to say that Argentinasupports the inclusion of the term \"intersecting\" in 2F of Article 4 or 5. I'm not sure because we'veshifted the numbers a couple of times. And on this particular point that we're discussing now,we would like to join those countries that have supported Brazil's proposals relating to efforts in the field of education and the fight against impunity, especially in sport. Thank you very much.Yes, I would like to give the floor to Pastor Morillo. Thank you very much, Madam Chair and a very good morning to everyone. I would just like to say that the two proposals made by the Distinguished Delegationof Brazil dovetail nicely with the elements highlighted by the permanent forum on these topics. Therefore, we also support them and I would like to take this opportunity to say that the forumalong with other stakeholders has begun communications with FIFA with a view to organizing a specificevent on football and racism and we're well on the way towards that. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate Ambassador of permanent representative of Costa Rica.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I just wanted to ask the Secretariat to reflect Costa Rica's support because I said we supported both subparagraphs suggested by Brazil and our name isn't in the 2nd one. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate ofBolivia. I'm afraid the speaker's microphone isn't active. I believe the Delegate said that she wouldlike to have Bolivia's name added but we missed the 1st half of the sentence. Please come again, Bolivia. Thank you, Chair. I would like to thank Brazil for both proposals and add our name toit those who supported it. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Egypt. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. Also would like to add my support to the 2ndproposal as well. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate ofAlgeria. Thank you, Madam Chair.We support the deletion of the term \"intersecting\" in paragraph 2F. Thank you. Yes. Coming back toparagraph M and N, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Permanent Representative of Costa Rica. I'm sorry, Madam Chair, but as the discussion has just been opened on the term \"intersecting\"I would like to add Costa Rica's name to those who are in favor of keeping that term. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is the last comment I'm receiving on previous paragraphs. I would like now to focus onparagraphs M and N and I would, therefore, ask if we are all agreeable to keep them as they are reflectedand I think there was an addition done by no, there is no yes. Are we all agreeable with the content ofthese two paragraphs? Thank you. I would like to ask the Secretariat to highlight them in green anddelete the different names of countries that were supporting the paragraphs. Thank you. Then we goback to Article, the following Article, I think it is Article number 6. Can you check if it is reallyArticle 6? Is it? Okay. It will be then paragraph number 2. I read the 2nd paragraph with new wordsincluded by the Distinguished Delegates of Brazil. States shall adopt and implement legal frameworksthat allow for prosecuting those responsible for incitement to racial hatred and hate crimes and for disseminating racist materials including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech which may also leadto violence including to including including political violence including through new information technologies and social media. Some review that are needed here. I would like to give the floor to theDistinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you. Yes, there is too many including there. I think I alreadyexplained my point here. The idea of this addition is to highlight what we are looking at and being morespecific trying to solve that maybe including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech whichmay also lead to violence and political violence as well also I don't know if and or also and also, yeah,political violence and coma as well as through new information technology and technologies and socialmedia maybe. I kindly ask my colleagues to assist in that to reflect not just general violence but what'ssomething that is quite important is the political violence too. Thank you. Yes, I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Delegate of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have some proposalsthat would I think both address this from a freedom of opinion expression perspective including our U.S. constitution and might address the issue that Brazil has raised about the importance of addressingviolence. So the proposal would actually be a streamlining proposal which would begin with changingfrom racial hatred to racial violence. So just to change the word hatred to violence really. We wouldalso need to remove the phrase and for disseminating racist materials because that would be incompatible with our constitution and protections of freedom of expression. We think that addressing racial violenceand hate crimes addresses this incitement to racial violence and hate crimes addresses this quite well.There is also we have some concerns with the additions. I looked back at the resolution from which this was drawn and it actually addresses the potential effects that artificial intelligence could have on various matters including misinformation, disinformation. So it is not quite a good fit forthis paragraph in that regard. Also misinformation is inadvertent. Disinformation is purposeful and that matters a lot when we are talking about prosecuting people, the mens rea involved. Sowe have some concerns with the additional language proposed by Brazil on that front. Maybe if there is a much more streamlined way of addressing it. But I think by replacing hatred with violence and reducingand limiting the part about racist materials, there is a paragraph we can live with. Thank you.Yes, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegates of Japan.Thank you, Chair. Regarding Paragraph 2, we would like to reserve our position on this.Wait a little bit. Thank you. Japan, you have the floor.We would like to preserve our position on this paragraph as the status of the legal framework consideration may be different in each country. Thank you.Thank you. If I got it well, Japan expressed reservation on the whole paragraph? Yes. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Panama.Thank you, Madam Chair. We are in favor of keeping this paragraph in the text and in addition we would like to voice our support for the proposals made by Brazil. We would also like to take the opportunityto thank her for the suggestion of the two subparagraphs which are now highlighted in green. As we took the floor, then we would just wanted to thank her for that and reiterate our support forthis bit. So we support this paragraph and also Brazil's proposals. Thank you. Yes, I give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela. Thank you, Madam Chair. In the section where we havetwo new information technologies artificial intelligence, digital tools and social media and after a whilesocial media and while preventing and counter racial profiling. Thank you. I give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of China. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of SouthAfrica. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Since I'm speaking for the 1st time, good morning toeverybody. Two things. We would like to support the paragraph in particular the language thatrefers to racist materials as it comes from the DDPA paragraph 147. So we would like to supportattention thereof and also the language that has been proposed by Brazil and supported by Panamathat says including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech and it goes on and on. So we supportthose two elements of the paragraph. Thank you, Chair. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of the United States. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Tworeflections to provide. One is if you could please list us as the United States as opposing the new language proposed that starts with including misinformation, disinformation through politicalviolence and secondly because it does not need to be written up on the board. Just a reflectionon the good comment just made that racist material is mentioned in the DDPA. I just wanted to flag that it is referenced as a phenomenon that should be sort of considered and addressed. Our main concern here is the idea of prosecuting people for disseminating racist material. So it is a very different context.It is a legal criminal context and just to clarify that that is our concern there is the criminalprosecution which is not mentioned as it relates to racist materials in the DDPA. Thanks. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the permanent representative of Costa Rica. Thank you, Madam Chair. If we could please have the full paragraph up on the screen, that would be very helpful. Thankyou. Now I can't read it. I'm afraid it is my eyesight. We could live with that afterwards. Wewould prefer well, we are flexible. That's what I was trying to say. We don't necessarily mean it is ourpreferred option but we are flexible. Then regarding South Africa's proposal and the discussion thatwe are having of the United States, well, we can say that we think it would be better. However, regarding for disseminating racist materials we can't state our position yet. So we will have to come back to it.Regarding the bit on including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, the problem isthat misinformation, well, I think that all of us at some point have fallen into the trap of misinformation.It is not necessarily intentional. Sometimes it is when you get information that is not verified butverified but you share it. I think that it can be due to human impulses, also a lack of digital literacy.It happens very often to older persons. So I think that the problem, we are talking about prosecutionhere, the problem would stem more from those who invent information knowing that it is misleading or false and they do so with the intention of causing violence of a racist nature. So we could supportdisinformation but we would rather not include misinformation here. Although we do recognize it is a problem, we do not feel that it represents sufficient grounds for criminally prosecutinga person. We have no problem with disinformation and hate speech which may also lead to violence andthe topic of political violence. That's fine by us, too. We would like to support Venezuela's addition,artificial intelligence, digital tools, but regarding the last sentence, I don't fully understand. We dosupport the idea of preventing and countering racial profiling but I'm not convinced it is particularlyrelevant in this paragraph. I feel it doesn't sit that well there. Thank you. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of the Republic of Korea. You have the floor.Thank you, Chair. Since this is the 1st time I'm taking the floor, I would like to thank theChairman's leadership and the progress in the Working Group. I don't have any I don't have specific textual suggestions at this point but I would like to just seek clarification on the point that theDistinguished Representative from Costa Rica just mentioned about misinformation because as the permanent representative of Costa Rica just mentioned, the difference between disinformation and misinformationis that whether it is intentional or not. So I'm not I don't fully understand how you can disseminatemisinformation since if you're disseminating something, then you're probably doing it in an intentional manner and whether this would actually mean that unintentional speech that contains someracist material would have to be prosecuted as well because I'm asking this question becausethere are some countries who prosecute unintentional speech but I'm not really sure if there are countriesthat actually punish unintentional speech or speech that is done by negligence. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela. Thank you. In response to Costa Rica'scomment on racial profiling, we could move that perhaps to the next paragraph, so to Paragraph 3, we could move it to Paragraph 3 to make it a bit more coherent but if we are going to move itto Paragraph 3, we would need to include again language on the use of new technologies, artificial intelligenceso as to tie it in more neatly. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegate of Venezuela. Thank you, Madam Chair. We would like to add a few additional comments tothis discussion to help facilitate perhaps a way forward. First of all, we would note a little bit of concern just reemphasizing what some other Delegations have pointed out that this paragraph is about prosecution. We would note that they are about plan of action as well as the former SpecialRapporteur on freedom of expression have noted that prohibition and prosecution are not the same and even if something is prohibited, it need not necessarily be criminally prosecuted. The standard for prosecution we believe should be a very high one. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur refers to thestandard of serious and extreme cases of incitement. In this regard, we would note, we would emphasize the need to ensure adherence with international law, particularly noting that the only provision relatedto prosecution in international law would be 3rd paragraph 4 which limits that to dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination as well as acts of violence and incitement to such acts. In that sense, we are a little bit concerned that the addition with regardto misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, terms which are not clearly defined in international law and the fact that these are referred to as those which may lead to violence as opposed to which constitute actual incitement to violence, we believe there is an important difference there. We wouldencourage either simply keeping it simple and aligning it directly with the language of international law or removing terms which are not clearly defined universally. In this regard, as a last point, wewould mention that the term political violence is a little bit uncomfortable for us. Our organization has been closely monitoring a number of cases around the world of members of civil society as well aspolitical personalities being targeted and their freedom of expression limited allegedly in the name of political violence. So that term has a history of being abused in various ways in large part because it is not clearly defined. And so while we do understand the concern and the reason it was broughtup, we would express the need for caution with the use of terms which are not defined in international law and would therefore again recommend that the paragraph be either closely aligned to CERT or the DDPA and that controversial terms or terms which are not clearly defined be removed or moved to aparagraph which doesn't talk specifically about prosecution. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the United States Delegate. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I would like to at the bottomof the screen just place a reservation on the specific mention of artificial intelligence and that's because that's being currently debated actively in the General Assembly. So I think we should await the outcome of that discussion before we mention it specifically here, especially since we are already referring to newinformation technologies and digital tools. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of European Union.Thank you, Madam Chair. And I had my flag up a bit earlier already but I think we are overloading this paragraph. If you look at the article in its entirety, to be honest, e.g. , the entire issue of artificial intelligence and digital tools is covered in paragraph 4 of the same article. So there is no need to add more detail on that in paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 is basicallyon what we should do with digital platforms where racist material is being disseminated. And that's the idea that we had focused on for this paragraph. So I actually had a proposal to rephrase the 1st part of the sentence because in our view, we the 1st line of action when you deal with digital platforms wherethere is racist messages being disseminated is that you remind the businesses, those running those platforms, of their responsibility to check content. And for that, we had a proposal that goes as follows: States shall ensure, you might want to type it separately, yeah. States shall ensure that proper measures and legal frameworksare in place and implemented, including by businesses, in particular digital platforms, to effectively prevent the dissemination of racist messages and to allow forAnd then we go back to the original paragraph and the rest of the paragraph, we keep. And to allow for prosecuting those responsible for incitement to racial until the end, we keep it. So you add that element of bringing in the businesses and the digital platforms themselves. In the European Union, as you know, we have a code of conduct. We work very closely. We have a system whereby platforms inform us within a limited amount of time and then take itoff. So there is a lot you can do by cooperating with them on this matter. With regard to the paragraph, the proposal by Brazil on misinformation, disinformation, hate speech and violence and political violence, my opinion at this point is that this does not belong in this article on hate speech. So I would agree with the U.S. and Costa Rica that this is not a good fit here. Andwe should not include this. It's too vague. Yes, I would like to ask EU Delegation to check if the paragraph suggested is well reflected on the screen. Come back, Ambassador. We can also accept we would keep the last bit after the last bit of the sentence that says including through new information technologies and social media that was in your the original draft as well. But of course,up for negotiation. But in our proposal, we were fine to keep that. Thank you. Panama Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Regarding this paragraph 2, I just wanted to respond to some comments or proposals that were made since I last took the floor on this very same paragraph. We would like to express our support for theinclusion of artificial intelligence and digital tools. Unless I am mistaken, these were proposed and supported by Venezuela and Costa Rica. Although we do understand what the EU and the U.S. have said, it seems to us that although there is a discussion surrounding the governance and artificial intelligence, that doesnot mean we have to wait for the debate on that to be concluded before we include elements that have been documented quite thoroughly already, for instance, through CERD and also through the other human rights bodies and, you know, these can exacerbate racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related to intolerance and, of course, this will have a particular impact on people of Africandescent. Moreover, this paragraph 2 is about prosecuting perpetrators whereas paragraph 4, though it also refers to artificial intelligence, is more linked to the use of these tools and ensuring that they are not used for the purpose of racial profiling. So I think we have got two different areas there and within the humanrights council, when we broach the topic of digital technologies, we tend to view it as a cross-cutting matter. Thank you. Thank you. Distinguished Delegate of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. This is a broader comment that applies specifically here and that is I think we are losing some nuance between a request to delete new language versus a request to reserve a new language. One we should strike through as has been donemany times. I am using the phrase reservation in many of these cases specifically because I just don't really know at this point where we would stand on it. All I know is that we are not in a position to accept it. So I would propose that whenever we use the term reserve that there be some way of indicating that that is not striking through and the particular case is artificial intelligence. I am not proposing this deletion. I am proposing that we make sure that this be revisited in the future and there is some way to reflect a reservation differently than a strikethrough. That would be much appreciated. Thank you. And it could be just saying in brackets artificial intelligence, USA reservation, something like that would be a bit clearer as we revisit this in the future. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let's agree to take some 5 min break and then we will come back. Excellencies, dear colleagues, I would like to request you to goback to your seats so that we can continue working. Excellencies, colleagues, let us go back to work. Excellencies, dear colleagues, I would like to check if we still have Delegations that would like to react on paragraph number 2 before we leave it the way it is and move to paragraph number 3. Yes? Let's now move to paragraph number 3 whichreads states shall take effective and appropriate measures including legal measures as appropriate to combat all acts of racism in particular the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiorityor hatred, incitement to racial hatred or violence as well as racist propaganda activities and participation in racist organizations while preventing and countering racial profiling. Inputs, commentsto this paragraph? Yes. Can we ask the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela to formulate the word sothat it fits in this paragraph? Thank you. Yes. We see that the bit on preventing and counteringracial profiling is already included in Article 4 so we could remove it from Article 3 and perhaps work on strengthening it somewhat in Article 4, you know, so as to not be repetitive in thevarious articles. Thank you. Thank you. We are discussing paragraph 3 on the screen. Can Itake it as a paragraph that can be adopted? Yes. I would like to request the Secretariatto highlight it in green as we move to paragraph number 4. Paragraph number 4 states shall address contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination including those derived from the use of automationtools, artificial intelligence and information technology including algorithm bias with a viewto preventing and combating racial profiling. This was also discussed some time back. Comments,inputs to this paragraph? I see the Distinguished Delegation of the European Union. We have thefloor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I have a proposal to replace the word automation bydigital. That said, I am definitely not an IT expert and can't really explain myself unfortunatelybut I think digital is the wider term that we use also in our legislation and that thereforeit is our preferred option. We would also like to add after preventing and combating the wordsphenomena such as algorithmic bias and in case colleagues have an interest in this, the previousspecial rapporteur on the fight against racism issued an extremely interesting report on thisI think a few years ago in the meantime. But that is where this comes from. Thank you. Is there any other Delegation that would like to input to this paragraph? I see the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil. We havethe floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the European proposal. We are flexible to acceptthat digital I think is broader than automation if I'm not mistaken. Automation for me is too specific and digital can be suitable to that. And I just would like some clarification because we are repeating includingalgorithm bias with a view to preventing and combating phenomena such as algorithm bias. Is thatwhat we wanted? European Union. Thank you. Well, thank you for this clarification and I think thatgoes well and we can support. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegateof United Kingdom. Thank you, Chair. First of all, we would seek to replace the word derived with resultingjust think it makes more sense. And then we would also add where it says information technology. Wethink the correct term is information and communication technologies. And then we had a query again on theuse of the word shall in this context. We are sort of unsure about how it gets interpreted in the context of say when a private actor or business enterprise is using such technology. So I think we would preferto make it a bit softer. I think we have been using the word should but we could also suggest sayingstates are urged to or urges states to. So I think we are flexible with should or urges here. Thanks.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of United States.Thank you very much. The United States lends its support to replacing shall with should. I will admit to the room that I have not been raising this in every occasion that we plan to, to save a littlebit of time. But just so people know, this essentially applies throughout the draft declaration. I have raised it in some cases, not in some others. This is one example. But there are some cases where we will probably request this in the future even though I haven't raised it in the room. So just to note that.But this is fine as it is for now. Thanks. Come again. Come again. The last comments. Sure.There is dozens and dozens of uses of shall in this declaration that we have concerns with. So I'm trying to be considerate of people in the room and not raise it every single time. But it is just as itis a concern here, it is a concern in many places. I will raise it specifically in some places and some places will have to deal with it sort of probably later on rather than sort of address it every single time here. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the permanent representativeof Costa Rica. Thank you, Madame Chair. Costa Rica would prefer to keep shall at the start of thisparagraph because we are talking about the obligation that states have to address contemporary forms ofracism and racial discrimination. We can support the inclusions suggested by the European Union,though. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to ask if Delegations are agreeable with inputs made bythe UK and EU except on the use of shall and should that will be coming throughout the text. But if the rest is agreeable to you, we can put this in green and leave the shall and should not highlighted. Igive the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela. Thank you, Madame Chair. We have a commentregarding the EU's additions in the latter part where it would refer to the phenomenon. Maybe if you couldscroll down a little bit. So it is not one phenomenon. It is not like rain. It is a threat. It is not aphenomenon. It is a threat or a risk of algorithmic bias and EU racial profiling. You couldn't call it aphenomenon. These are risks or threats. What do we keep between the two, the risk and the threat?Thank you. I reiterate my question. Is it possible to get to an agreement of the text of Paragraph No. 4? Maybekeeping the use of shall and should not approved but the rest of the paragraph and inputs from the different Delegations approved. I see the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba requesting the floor. You have the floor.Thank you, Madame Chair. In principle, we can be flexible and work with this language. I don't think we would have any problem with the suggestions by the EU or the UK. Although we would like oursupport for Costa Rica's proposal to keep shall to be reflected in the document and we would welcome further explanations from the UK regarding their 2nd proposal. Could they please explain what the difference wouldbe between derived and resulting? For me, when I think of it in Spanish, these are synonymous.But maybe there is a nuance in English. I would just like to know what exactly is meant in English by these two words. You know, what's the change here? Why does it matter? As I said, in Spanish, you know,the equivalent of derived and resulting is synonymous. Thank you. Yes, maybe I would like to ask the Distinguished Delegates ofEuropean Union if they are in agreement to replace phenomena by threats and then we will ask again if we can have part of the paragraph number 4 approved. Thank you, Madam Chair. I was just wondering aboutthat. Are we sure that there are no situations whereby algorithmic whatever it is, algorithms have apositive effect in terms of preventing discrimination? Because then the term phenomena is more objective than threats. Threats seems to indicate that in all circumstances the outcome is always discriminatory.But again, I am not an IT expert. I can imagine there are algorithms that bring up the right thingson the Internet. Thank you. But I think the reason is also coming from the introductory part becausethey are relating to preventing and combating. If we are preventing and combating, I think the negativepart, the negative aspects of the phenomena that will be mentioned here. What are your thoughts onthis specific aspect? Are you agreeable with threats, with phenomena? And then we see if we can havea text adopted on this paragraph. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil.From my perspective and trying to move forward also, yeah, I think we could really highlight in green the parts that you mentioned, Madam Chair, and leave some space for these threats and phenomena and tryto see if we can consider if it is a phenomenal threat or something in the middle. Yes, just to saythat I agree with what you addressed to us. Thank you. Thank you. Can we have the rest of the paragraphadopted and only remain with \"shall\" and \"should\" and \"threats and phenomena\" to be discussed later? I see the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela requesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, MadamChair. In this case, as you said, when we are talking about algorithmic bias, it is a negative situationjust as racial profiling is negative. So it is a risk or a threat, not just a mere phenomenon? Yes. Canwe keep then \"threats\" with a view okay, let me read the whole paragraph. States shall or should addresstemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination including those resulting from the use of digital tools, artificial intelligence and information and communication technologies with a view to preventingand combating threats such as algorithm bias and racial profiling. Can we agree with this text? Yes. Givethe floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba. Madam Chair, as we said earlier, we would welcome greater clarity about the change suggested by the United Kingdom. We would like to know more about thesemantic difference between the verbs \"derive\" and \"result from.\" We would like to explain this to our capital a bit more. Some of the changes we can understand, but for that one, we need a little bit of help. In theory, we don't have any issue with it, but we just need to be able to understand what thechange is. Thank you. Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil. Now that youjust read that aloud, I have to ask my Distinguished Colleagues from Venezuela and European Union, do wereally need those nouns there? Because in the original text, we weren't using anything before algorithm bias.We knew that it was what it was and the racial profiling. Do we need that? I understand some rationale that we are giving some space to maybe for further interpretations, but still in the original text,we didn't have that nothing as threat of algorithm bias and racial profile. Do we need threat or phenomenal or can we simply say we have a view to preventing and combating algorithm bias and racialprofiling? Just really trying to have more green in our screen. Thank you. I give the floor to theDistinguished Delegate of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I think we can support Brazil's proposal to keep this as simple as possible and that would be just ending it with combatingalgorithm bias and racial profiling. It is a clean resolution. My own view on derived versus resulting is that they are equivalent. They are the same thing, but resulting is just plain language and derived isnot a very common term. So resulting is just plain language. It is easier to read.Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of European Union.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the colleague from Brazil as well because I thinkthat's a very useful suggestion. We could go with that. It is more simple. I would like to ask ifeverybody agrees so that we delete the threats and phenomena and just keep to preventing and combatingalgorithm bias and racial profiling. Let's delete this. I would also like to ask to the DistinguishedDelegates of Cuba if they are fine with keeping resulting instead of having derived after furtherclarifications from the Distinguished Delegates from United States? Yes. Can we take this paragraph asan agreed that appears on your screen as an agreed upon language where we will keep shall and should not highlighted in green for further discussions throughout the text? Thank you. Let's highlightthis in green. Thank you. Let's move to Paragraph No. 5 of Article No. 6. States shall take appropriatemeasures to ensure all people equal and affordable access to and use of the Internet as an international and equal forum and promote participation and representation of different segments withinsocieties in media organizations. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegates of Brazil. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We believe Brazil believes that in this paragraph would be importantto highlight the goal that we are aiming in order with to take those appropriate measures. So we would add at the end of this paragraph and to bridge digital divides. Yes, I thought I would be missing muchmore of this meeting than I guess that's why I anticipated that. Thank you. And to bridge digital divides, that's the intention here. And the rationale is that what I just mentioned. I mean, it's we aretargeting to bridge digital divides. Thank you very much. I think we don't have two paragraphs. We havethe same paragraph with the addition of and to bridge digital divides by the Distinguished Delegationof Brazil. Yes. Yes. And then you will delete the previous. I give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegate of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. We would request that the verb \"ensure\" in the 1st line be replaced with \"promote.\" A lot of the things that we are talking about in this draft declarationare things that states have the power to promote but oftentimes don't have the power to ensure. So this is calling upon states to take action as opposed to guaranteeing something that really I don't thinkany of us is in a position to guarantee. Thanks. Thank you. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of United Kingdom. Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, we would prefer to use the word \"should\"given that \"shall\" here implies an obligation of states to provide universal Internet access which is not something that is guaranteed or required by international human rights law. We would alsosupport the amendment of \"ensure\" to promote. And then we have a couple of changes around the use orthe phraseology around the term \"access\" here. So we think the correct terminology should be universal,meaningful and affordable access because we think that the term \"universal\" is a term usually used inthe UN context around the Internet and the term \"equal access\" in our opinion doesn't have a very clear meaning given that individuals may well have different forms of access. And we think it's alsoimportant that \"affordability\" is not framed as the only element of access here. So we think \"meaningful\"is the right phraseology and that's sort of the accepted term in UN context as well. We would also delete \"as an international and equal forum\" because we're not really sure what that means or wherethat's come from. Thanks. We would also strike the word \"equal\" so before \"universal.\" Thanks. Thankyou. I will give the floor to the Distinguished Delegates of United States. Thank you. If you could please add us as supporting the 1st two edits. One of those actually came from us. So it would be USA forthat one and for the all the way on the left, the promote one which I had proposed. Thank you. Thankyou. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegates of Brazil. Yes, we keep the idea of\"shall\" as we already mentioned in other occasions. Just a quick reaction to what we have here. So\"ensure,\" \"promote,\" I understand the rationale. We can be flexible on that. But actually I wouldrather ask for some clarification or source for that universal and meaningful access. I might have seen that in participation, meaningful participation. Wouldn't it be unrestricted and affordable access?Because I understand the idea of you being able to access the Internet, any of the sites that you want,buying and selling our things and using the Internet in an unrestricted way but universal and meaningful.I don't know if I quite recognize that maybe from my side but still I would love to hear some clarificationon the uses universal and meaningful to access. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegates of the United Kingdom. Thanks. I'm not an expert on matters of ITU issues but as I understand it, universal is the term that is used to sort of set out the ambition thateverybody should have access. And then meaningful is the term that is used in UN contexts when we're talking about sort of encompassing elements of reliability to access and the access to skillsneeded to use the Internet. But I will try and find some source material for that. And then a final thing, for our edit promote to make sense, we would need to strike all people because I just don'tthink it makes sense to have promote all people. Thanks. Thank you. I would like to give the floorto the Distinguished Delegates of the United States. I'll have to take it back to capital but I think looking at the use of promote coupled with universal, meaningful and affordable, I think that's to me agood formulation. So if you could add the United States as supporting exactly there, I'll double check but I think that's actually more ambitious because if you were to say equal access, if let's say half ofwomen have access, in this case that would be fine because half of men have access. But what we should be striving for is that everybody have access and that the access be meaningful and affordable. Ithink it's actually a more ambitious goal that we should be seeking to promote. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Excellency of Costa Rica. Thank you, Chair. Just listeningto the conversation and the discussions, I'm interested in hearing if Brazil is actually promoting or asking that we also introduce unrestricted because we heard that meaningful is differentthan unrestricted and so I would like to, if that is the case, to support that we add unrestricted inthat paragraph. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil.Yeah. Actually, that was my it's food for thought because actually I don't quite understand what is ameaningful access and that's why I asked for some clarification. So it's if it's a proposal, we couldlook at that but really I don't know if I understand meaningful access. That's my point. And as a suggestion, I would propose that we look at this possible alternative. That's it. I don't know if I was clear.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of South Africa.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Once again, our Delegation would like to propose retention of theword \"equal\" and to be followed by universal, meaningful, we can support Brazil and unrestricted and then therest up to affordable access to use to and use of the Internet. So essentially, yeah, it's correctlycaptured. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Mexico.Thank you, Madam Chair. We would just like to ask or maybe reflect on the wording towards the end of theparagraph where it says different segments within societies. We feel that the paragraph as it isworded is not particularly clear what is meant by different segments. Perhaps given that this is adeclaration relating to the rights of people of African descent, it could be a good idea to have participation and representation of people of African descent in media organizations and to bridge digitaldivides. We can support Brazil's proposal for digital divides. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Venezuela. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to supportSouth Africa's suggestion to keep the word equal. We feel this is very important because the fact is there are inequalities in access to Internet and there are groups that are discriminated againstwhen it comes to access to information. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa. No, I'm sorry, Madam. I should have. Thank you. I would like to give thefloor to the Distinguished Delegation of Mexico. Thank you. We would also like to support Brazil'sproposal about digital divides. Thank you. Thank you. I have the impression that I will give you some timeduring lunch break to consult your IT colleagues and see if we can come up with an agreeable content of this paragraph. Yes. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of United Kingdom. You havethe floor. Maybe your solution of consulting our IT colleagues is better than me just Googling ITUdocuments. Universal is for me more ambitious than equal. I think when we are talking about equal access,different individuals may well have different forms of access. So, e.g. , mobile access versus wired or community network versus private whereas universal we are talking about everybody shouldhave access to some kind of connectivity. So for us it is a bit more ambitious. And then I have just done my quick Googling. Promoting meaningful connectivity is one of the ITU Secretary General's sort of big workstreams. So as I understand it, meaningful does make sense in this context. I don't know if other colleagues have opinions on that. But that seems to be plastered all over all sorts of ITU documents. So it seems to meto make sense. Thanks. Thank you. May I suggest that I see the Distinguished Delegation of Cuba requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Now, I'm not an expert on this topic eitherbut just drawing analogies and parallels with other topics linked to terminology, for us, equal and universal, neither of those are the appropriate terms. Perhaps instead we could use equitable. That would beour suggestion because I think access does not necessarily need to be equal for everyone because there can be different forms of access including different forms of usage. However, there should beequitable access meaning that everyone can in some form or another and through some channel or otheraccess and use Internet. So that would be our two pence on this. We do support Brazil's proposal for the latter part and we would like to include an additional dimension. So not just digital divides.We would like to add within and between countries following digital divides. Because obviouslythese divides occur not just within states but also between different countries. Thank you. Thank you.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Just because we are yes, we might be hungry, right? That's why we are giving food for thought. Yeah. And just to again food forthought because I don't think we definitely have to consult our colleagues but together with thisequal equitable can I add there to just universal meaningful and unrestricted for us to take aconsideration after our consultations? Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm also a permanent representative to the ITU and I'm very sure that you will come up with a simpler qualification of the access to Internet.We will not have the long list of qualification of access to affordable Internet and this is why I don't want to leave this paragraph. I want to give us some chances to see and check with our IT colleagueswould say about this paragraph before we move to next paragraph in the afternoon. I wish you a very to have a very good lunch and see you this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "I call to order the 2,408th meeting of the committee of the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. This afternoon we will be continuing with our constructive dialogue with the state party from the Central African Republic. Before breaking for lunch we were looking at Article 11. I would now like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation that they might proceed with their responseof their responses. Madam Minister, the floor is yours for 10 min . Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for having afforded me the floor. A question was asked regarding wage gap between men and women in the Central African Republic for equal skills when men and women have the same wage. So we don't have the issue of a wage gap. The law on sexualharassment is on the table in the National Assembly. This is a law that will be voted on directly. I would give the floor at this time to address labor issues to my colleague, the legal affairs chief. Hewill offer clarification on the labor code. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Minister. As you had indicated, labor law in our country includes provisions to address all forms of discrimination. It is for that reason that, as you have said, we do not have a wage gap, gender based, that is. Andthe committee member brought up the issue of health and safety and hygiene in the workplace and asked whether labor inspectors oversee working conditions and if so, do they have enough resources to do that mission. We should note that this does enter into their responsibilities. That's their daily bread. That's what they are paid for.Having said that, do they have enough resources to provide this oversight? Here, this depends, well, you have to look at the resources in our country. We have relatively less than other countries. And labor, this is the case not just for labor inspectors but for all areas of administration. They don't have the resources needed to accomplish their missions. Andin practice, specific concrete oversight efforts are undertaken by the labor inspectors and they either hand down sanctions or penalties or not now for overtime. We cannot say what the level of what the reality looks like. Perhaps we should undertake a study on this. The lawdoes speak to the issue of overtime, particularly in the private sector where there are conventions that impose the rules of operation in the private sector. Well, those do establish the remuneration rate, the amount of hours, the amount of overtime. And the public sector, we do have to recognize that there is no specificregulation governing extra or other overtime. Thank you. That's all I can provide right now. I give the floor at this time to the Director General of Gender Promotion for additional clarification. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellencies. Your Excellency, thank you. The point that I wanted to note here has to do withthe private sector. I think that we have a labor code that sets forth remuneration in step with the professional statutes of the individuals concerned. We do have a minimum wage. All those that work in the domestic as domestic laborers have to be paid this minimum wage. I think that this minimum wage, the President of the Republic has handed down adecree that increased the minimum wage in the CAR. And that's the minimum wage level that we are informing the population about to ensure that there is access to this information so that the minimum wage is born in mind in the employment. But as regards the wage gap as others have said, I wouldsay that in the CAR, we do not have that. Thank you. I would like to add that on the specific point of social protection, we are going to receive your recommendations in written form and we will, when we have data, specific data on the situation, we will make it available to you. Thank you. On behalf of the Committee,I should like to thank the Distinguished Delegation for the information provided. I do have a request for the floor for follow-up questions. I give the floor at this time 1st to Madam Redhawk for 2 min . Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I'm really pleased to know that the Central African Republic has legislation or a situation where you have equal wages for all categories of labor.I just wanted to mention, though, that the wage gap exists despite that. In fact, according to UN, globally women make 77% for every dollar that men make. And it is not because the wages for positions are not the same. But, e.g. , jobs where women predominate often tend to have lower wages than jobs where men predominate. And sometimes you have to actuallydo research to find out the sources of these gaps despite the legislation. So I would really suggest maybe that you carry out some local research to look at the ways in which the wages are actually happening as opposed to just assuming that because you have that legislation that there is no wage gap. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mr. Safrov, the floor is yours for questions.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very much, Delegation members, for your answers. You had 2 h time to maybe give us any statistic data, but I didn't hear on our questions not any statistic data on employment in these questions. No cases of sexual harassment in workplaces. Is it investigated? No. No cases of statistic data of women in, e.g. , as ain employment representation, e.g. , in public and formal, informal sector. For example, now we know that the women representing maybe in agriculture and informal sector in your country. What's the problems? What's the restrictions? What's including do you have any disaggregated data, sex disaggregated data on women representation in employment in the sites? Do you have any statistic? If not now, you can send it later. No problem in this case. But just it will be clear to usthat the gender gap, of course, between the salaries, the gender gap in pensions, when you are informal sector, you do not get any pension, which a woman last 40 years in informal sector especially representing in Central African Republic. Thank you very much. Thank you very much to the experts. Thank you for the questions and comments made. Might you share with us if you have specificobstacles when it comes to not having statistic send data, e.g. , in employment as Mr. Safroff has mentioned, the Distinguished Head of Delegation has the floor. Madam Chair, as regards statistical data that has been requested, we will send that along in written form. However, yes, we are confronted with the problem of data availability. And this is and I will usethe example of my department. We have a database manager, but that individual does not have the tools needed to fully execute their work. So if the individuals have the tools to do their job and if we strengthen, if we capacity build as well to gather data, well, then I do not think that we would have this problem with data availability. But we will provide the data requestedby the committee member in written form. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for clarifying so that we are clear. It is helpful to know more clearly what the problems are that the state has when it comes to not having this statistical data in all areas which are so very important. So we will be awaiting on Monday before 5:00 a.m. or 5:00 p.m., rather, this information on statisticsand employment, Article 11. We will now move to Article 12 of the convention, the right to health. I would like to this end give the floor to Madame Boniface for 5 min . Madame, the floor is yours. Thank you very much, Madame Chair. I should like to welcome the Delegation of the Central African Republic. I am going to ask my questions on the area of health. Among the progress reported by theCenter in health care, we have the 2017/2027 plan. This addresses the building rehabilitation and equipping of medical care facilities. We do know that the pandemic and the armed conflict might have caused setbacks in the goals that were set. I should like to know seven years after the plan was created how many health care installations were rehabilitated. Are they operating appropriately and particularlyin the rural and remote areas? This, as the primary cause of maternal mortality, continues to be or, rather, maternity mortality continues to be high. Only 18.9% of women receive prenatal care in the most recent pregnancy and 53.4% of deliveries in 2006 were delivered by qualified personnel. Specifically, what percentage drop has therebeen in maternal mortality as a result of the most recent programs implemented by the state party. There has been much progress in reproductive rights. This came in the formof law 06005 on 20 June 2006 on reproductive health. This allows women to receive medical attention and contraceptives without the authorization of her husband. However, data points at thedefect that the majority of couples lack contraception, prenatal care, qualified care during delivery and obstetric essential obstetric and postpartum care. 82.2% of women do not use any form ofcontraception according to a report from UNICEF and girls between 15 and 19 years of age among them 88.7% do not use contraception. What measures will be taken to increase sexual educationand increase the use of contraception? Abortion. Law 06005 authorized abortions in the case ofthe pregnancy as a result of rape. However, some women continue to resort to illegal dangerous clandestine abortions. There are other causes as well that could be considered. For example,in the life of the woman is in danger when the life is not viable. How can one ensure that the women and girls that resort to abortion and the doctors that provide care are not subjectto punishment and conviction? Women and girls are affected by the high levels of sexual violenceresulting from the armed conflict. The survivors of sexual violence were discriminated against and the government could not provide appropriate care including health care and psychosocial support.Sexual violence committed by armed actors increased the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS among other STDs. The prevalence of HIV among those between 15 and 49 years of age was at 4.9%. According to Pasteur Institutethe rate is at 18%. What actions will be taken in order to ensure effective implementation of the law on HIV incorporating training programs in key sectors strengthening the national system for preventionand protection countrywide? What measures have been taken by the state to ensure that women that are raped receive comprehensive care? In the ECR there remain challenges in the area of malnutrition forwomen and girls. The national policy for food security and nutrition does it continue to operate? What programs are aimed specifically at less favored groups? Is there a health insurance system in placethat is targeting that targets women and girls with disabilities? These are my questions. I thank you kindly. Thank you very much, Madame Boniface. I will now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation to respond. Thank you. I very much thank the Committee Member for these specific questions onhealthcare. Indeed, there is a national plan for healthcare. This was adopted for a five-year period,2022 to 2026 or rather 2027. This has been implemented. On the amount of those of the centers, healthcare centers that have been rehabilitated or created, I'm going to provide this number inwritten form because the data, we do have the data on that. It is that is in the hands of each departmentand in the departmental ministers of health. They have the obligation of increasing the amount of facilities that have been rehabilitated. Turning to the mortality rate, maternal mortality rate andchild mortality rate, you see that these rates, even if they are low, we went from 480,400,000 to 800,even if the rate, even if we still among the countries that have a high rate of mortality,this, there has been a drop, a significant drop. Cost-free contraception from an NGO is very helpful.Women and girls have the possibility of obtaining condoms for free. We also have a law on targeted free services for women who are pregnant and children that are of less than five years of age.These laws cover the entirety of our nation. Now, the law on HIV/AIDS, the Minister of Justice has begunto disseminate this law, even in primary school, the information in this is being disseminated. The problemthe problem with ownership on these texts is a significant problem in our country. As we disseminate them and if the population can make them their own, that will facilitate the implementation of the contentfor us. Turning to malnutrition, there is a committee referred to as the national committee, multisectoral committee for food security and nutrition. That program is under the aegis of the Prime Ministerand this bears in mind numerous sectors, healthcare, agriculture, and the list goes on. The problem of food security and nutrition is also addressed in the multisectoral committee that I just mentioned. Iwould perhaps give the floor quickly to the Director General for gender promotion for complementary information. I thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. I would like to provide additional information onthe topic of gender violence, gender based violence and also HIV/AIDS. I think that these are two topics that go hand in hand. In the Central African Republic, we do have a national strategy forcombating gender based violence. In this strategy, there is a pillar that includes the holistic careand multisectoral care for the individuals. This pillar now includes care for HIV/AIDS patients. Allthose that are infected by HIV/AIDS are automatically covered by this program.This program is put into place both by NGOs and the government, regional bodies, regional NGOs andnational NGOs. Now, turning to abortion, we have a law on reproductive health. This punishes abortionor criminalizes abortion. There is a college of doctors that authorizes a given abortionand to guarantee the life of the individual, a certain procedure must be taken to ensure thatabortion does not present a risk for the individual. It is a woman that has been a victim of rape canrequest an abortion, but that abortion must be conducted by the college of doctors. These provisions are covered by the Central African legislation. That's the information I wish toprovide at this time. I thank you. I thank the Director General. Before giving the floor to the mission chief, I would like to compliment the information specifically on the state's budgetfor HIV/AIDS. Each department, each ministry has a small budget earmarked for awareness raisingfor HIV/AIDS. That's in all of our ministries. They also all have a focal point for HIV/AIDS. Thatfocal point has a budget. Even if the budget is tiny, that budget exists for awareness raising for the community on the issue of HIV/AIDS. I give the floor to the head of legal affairs in the missionto address the questions. Just to inform the committee members that if there is a voluntary interruption of pregnancy and if outside of a hospital environment is criminalized, while that's the case,there has been a decriminalization of the abortion, the voluntary interruption of pregnancy.They are not punished under the criminal code anymore. That is the result of an overhaul of our criminal code. Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Chair, these are the responses that we have been able to provide and clarifications we have been able to provide on the questions asked. I thank you kindly.I thank the Distinguished Delegation for that information. Madam Boniface has requested the floor again for a follow-up question. You have the floor for 2 min . Thank you. Yes, I do understandthat it is no longer criminalized but only under certain circumstances is abortion no longer covered by the criminal code? Thank you very much. So the question is specifically about the law on abortion.Might you clarify if the modification and reform that you mentioned is so that it is only decriminalizedfor certain causes of pregnancy? Thank you. I give the floor back to our Chief of Legal Affairs.Microphone to the speaker, please. Thank you for the question. The concern expressed is that whena woman has a voluntary interruption of the pregnancy, are they punished or is the dr. punished? That's why I said that in our criminal code reform, the voluntary interruption of pregnancy is nowdecriminalized. However, it must be done in a hospital environment, the abortion. It is no longer sanctioned by prison time, punished by prison time. Thank you. On behalf of the Committee,microphone to the speaker, please. We would like to thank the Delegation for its clarification. I should like to on behalf of the Committee thank the Delegation for those clarifications. We do understandthat this is a reform that is underway. Hence, it is not in place, not in force, but rather it isbeing implemented. Having said that, we will now move to Article 13 of the convention,social protection and economic empowerment of women. I would, to this end, like to give the floor to Madam Redhawk for 4 min . Madam, we are all yours. Thank you very much, Madam Chair and thanksto the team for all their responses. The continuing impact of conflict, climate change and displacementcombined with food insecurity and limited access to education continues to severely affect the economic and social conditions of women and girls in the State Party. Illiteracy, which affects about87% of women, and I don't like that word, but maybe we could discuss later, is a major contribution to women's poverty and access to formal employment resulting in high concentration in the low incomeinformal sector which lacks any benefits and social protection. This has implications for economicsustainability and food security of families, children and society in general, placing women in vulnerable situations and open to various forms of exploitation. Could you please provide details on specific programsand policies focused on women's social and economic empowerment? For example, in relation to sustainable employment, access to land, access to credit and training, agriculture and food security, supportfor cooperatives, skill development, et cetera. And in compliance with the compiler convention, are there specific programs for economic and social stability and food security of internally displacedwomen and girls, especially those in IDP camps? Now, social security systems are critically important for social and economic stability and especially so for women. The national social protection policy adoptedby tripartite constituents in Bangui in 30th March 2012 was an important development for the Central African Republic. It aimed, we understand, to make effective and extensive social protection coverageavailable to all Central Africans. However, self-employed persons including approximately 80% of women were included. We are happy to learn, therefore, that a revised policy which proposes to include voluntary registrationof self-employed persons is currently being drafted. So could you provide us with details on the current status of the national social security policy? Could you advise on the time frame for approval andimplementation of the revised policy? And when can we expect this? In addition, will it be accompanied byan education and outreach program to ensure uptake by women? We have also noted in your reports stated efforts that combat the misappropriation of funds and corruption in the state party, no doubt exacerbated by the armedconflict. Could you please provide information on measures to ensure the integration of gender equality analysis and gender informed planning in all social and economic programs, plans and policy development, and thedevelopment, sorry, and the involvement of women in actions to address poor governance in the management of policies and programs? For example, are women involved in the oversight body, the high authority for goodgovernance which was established to combat the misappropriation of funds and corruption? To what extent are women involved or is there a gender analysis component in economic recovery and national reconciliationefforts? Similarly for social development and poverty eradication policies as well as national macroeconomic and planning policies. In other words, how do we know, can we see in these policies the integration of women andgender analysis? Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very much, Ms. Redock. Let me now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationfor 10 min , please, to respond. I thank the expert Ms. Redock for the questions that she has asked regarding economicempowerment of women. We have several programs within the department which are working to ensure women's economic empowerment. I'm going to give the floor to the Director General who deals with this issue to present the different programsto you within the department. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. In terms of policies and programs, I think as we said thismorning, the ministry has a national equality, gender equity and equality policy and the ministry has also drafted a nationalstrategy for the empowerment of women and girls. Regarding this program, it's been set up across the whole country through thecentral ministry. So there's work that's being done on that across the whole country. Women represent over 15% in businesses and theyrepresent more than 90% in the informal sector. When it comes to the trade and commerce sector, women represent 20%, 22.37% and Ithink that's the percentage of representation of women. In terms of access, we have a percentage of around 10% of women andI think that these figures, we're working on them hugely to try and increase the percentage of women within the different sectors and I thinkthat in terms of empowerment, economic empowerment, there's also the issue of literacy and illiteracy which is, of course, a factor in terms ofempowerment. We have within the education sector a directorate general on literacy and the ministry on the promotion of gender works closely withthem across the whole territory and we include or we integrate all of the programmes in all of the programmes that are developed within the country. Sotoday we are really trying to institutionalize this approach. We're working with different associations and I think that we're also trying to include theliteracy aspect as well. So these associations are considered to be a safe space where women can come and learn. They can come and generate income generatingactivities and learn them and so we have been able to really strengthen the community's capacity with awareness raising through training and when you look at the whole countrytoday, you realize that women are really mobilized around income generating activities. They are working, they want to work and you will see today if you go into the interior of the country, you will see that it's women who are economically stronger than men. They are in an economically betterposition. We tend to think that, you know, women are really driving behind trying to push the CAR out of poverty. So there is a huge amount of work that's being done and that is, that we're trying to push, we're trying to push other sectors so that there's further development there. We should note within each of the departments, we're also trying to mainstream gender in all of the programmes and policies and I thinkthat in terms of the environment, we've just drafted a gender environment strategy on agriculture as well and commerce and trade on SMEs. So gender is really being taken account of in each and every ministerial department and this programme is then monitored by the gender focal points within these ministerial departments. So that's what I wanted to tell you on empowerment of women within thecountry. We're also drafting a social protection policy. I think that this is currently being drafted with the support of the World Bank and that's what's being done and I think that we will be implementing that document in the very near future. Thank you. Thank you. Before I give the floor to the DG on promotion of women, I also wanted to clarify thatwe have had the study on the general promotion with the participation of partners. This document is available and we can share that with you. Let me give the floor to the DG on woman's protection. Thank you Madam Minister. Madam Chair, I'd like to come back on issues relatedrelated to social policy in the social policy document in 2012. This document was drafted initially and we are updating this and taking into account the noncontributory part. Wehad drafted the document at a time when it was focusing an awful lot on contributory payments and benefits and this was also we thought that regarding women it is reallyimportant to update the policy document in a noncontributory term and really to, e.g. , provide assistance, additional assistance to persons with disabilities and tosupport those dealing with socioeconomic risk. As my colleague said, this is a document whichwill be approved, well, we are almost at the end of the validation approval process, talking about the deadline. I can imagine that within a month or so we would have the document andwe will be in a position to be able to use it and start using it. We have been working with the World Bank as I say and the World Bank and UNICEF have been supporting us in drafting this document. Let me come back to the main purpose, it is to see how we can also identifypriority areas. We are part of the Committee drafting this document. We focus, we are focusing a lot more to say on the noncontributory side of things to look at how we address this interms of social security. That is really what I wanted to say on social protection, well,my colleague really touched on economic empowerment. I will leave it there in terms of the social policy document. Thank you. That was my answer on that. Thank you. Perhaps the charge admissionhas something to add on that? Yes. Thank you, Madame Minister. There is just one concern that was raised as to whether legislation or the programmes to combat corruption, whetherwomen are involved and included and integrated and the supreme authority of good governance, this is one of the institutions in the CR. This has been mentioned quite a lot. Yes, as we saidfrom the outset, the law on parity does require a quota of 35% in the transitional period. So the composition of all institutions of the country or the bodies of the country takes account ofthat demand. If you look at the law on the supreme authority for good governance, that is what we are talking about, this institution in particular, the law states that the supreme authority ismade up of 19 members with a minimum of six women. So that is to guarantee respect for that quota. In reality, sometimes we go further. It can't be any less because this is a legalrequirement, at least six women out of 19 members. But in practice, the current team of the supreme authority of good governance, there are eight women. So we have gone a little bit over the quota. And it is this rule itself which is applied in all institutions that the CAR hasset up, whether you are talking about the national election authority, the economic, social and environmental council, the supreme authority or the supreme council on communication and so on. So all of these state institutions, these state bodies are subjected to that rule. Thankyou. Thank you, Madam Chair. These would be our responses that we would bring for the questionsraised by Ms. Redock. Thank you. Thank you. On behalf of the Committee, we would like to thank the Distinguished Delegation for all of the information that you are providing to us. I wouldlike to ask for a list of all of the strategies and the policies and legislation that you have underway. You have been mentioning it a lot, but a lot of it wasn't mentioned directly inyour initial statement, Madam Head of Delegation. That really gives us a clear overview and a clear list of all of this information and it is precise specific information that we want to bear in mind when we draft our concluding observations. If you could provide that tous, we would be very grateful in writing. Ms. Redock, you have the floor for 2 min .Thank you to the Delegation for their responses. Some of them were quite informative and thanksfor that. In relation to my 1st question about details and specific programs related to women's social and economic empowerment, I didn't really hear what the specific programs are. I justheard that they exist in each ministry, but if I could get one or two examples, that would be good. Also, I didn't get any response to my question in relation to the IDP camps andprograms for economic stability and food security of the internally displaced women and girls, especially those in IDP camps. Also, I wanted to clarify something with social security becauseI was quite pleased to hear that the new draft would include self-employed persons since close to 80% of women are in the informal sector, but I didn't hear that in the response thatI got. I would really like that clarified. Also, I had asked whether there would be an outreachprogram. In fact, I'm calling for a robust outreach program when the social security policy is approved to ensure that women in urban and rural areas, all of these 80% of self-employed women, thatis if the policy will include that, know about it and actually get involved and register. In fact, I wanted to know and I forgot to ask earlier if you have any data on how many womenare currently registered in the social security program that currently exists. Thank you. Thankyou very much. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation for 5 min for them to answer these follow-up questions. Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving me the floor once again. Onyour questions to the strategies that are underway, the list will be submitted to you in writing as you request. Let me give the floor to the DG for promotion of gender for clarificationon the detailed program that the committee member asked for. Thank you. Thank you. As I said earlier, we have policy 1st , the national equity and gender equality policy gives us the guidelines,it gives us the guidance. Now, within the programs, we have a program to strengthen female leadership and for economic empowerment of women. I think that in that program there is a whole packageof actions to be undertaken and from through that lens we are talking about strengthening economic activities, social professional activities and vocational activities, e.g. , womenand girls who haven't been lucky enough to perhaps go further with their studies, they are invited and they are trained, they receive training. There is a partnership program, female entrepreneurshipand these are programs that are developed specifically within the country that are being really put in place and we are trying to see how we can create a women's bank. This is something perspectivesaid that the country can have a women's bank. I think that this would really be a valuable assistance to women in the CAR. Also on land access, access to land, I think that this problemis less of an issue today than in the past. In some of our communes we have drafted local charters where local authorities have been able to grant land to women who carry out incomegenerating activity and I think everything that I am telling you about is in partnership with UN system agencies or with certain financial backers and partners, bilateral partners, theEuropean Union, the World Bank and other organizations. So these activities and specific programs that have been tailor made for us and we are now going to include them in our central policywithin under the ministry and I think it is this central policy which will then be submitted to the government and the government will allocate funds for implementation of this central policyand I think it is this central policy which is being drafted and which is what is being finalized. So that's really what I wanted to explain and I think that within the country we have a programfor support for returnees and this is managed by humanitarian action. It is a program that supports those who have left and those who come back to the country, returnees and they are given a bit of financial support so that they can settle in the country, back into the countryafter they have left and there is a law which gives them rights for them to get back land that they might have lost. So these are specific programs on humanitarian action. We have gottwo projects. There is the Paret project and there is the PACAT project which is a community support project following crisis period. Thank you. Thank you. Let me give the floor to themission here for him to give some additional information. Thank you, Madam Minister. I just wanted to come back on the concerns from the expert particularly regarding concrete examplesof economic empowerment and empowerment of Central African women. I would like to just take about one specific project which contributes to empowerment of women within the framework of the BICU fund.This is a multi-stakeholder fund created by the European Union for resilience of CAR. Some years over the past few years it has allocated 4 million Euros which has been distributed intwo phases under this international fund in partnership with COPI. There has been a project set up to promote integration and participation of women and young girls in the economic, socialand political life of the country. The goal of this project is to create community spaceswhere specific premises have been identified to economic empowerment centers for women. We call them TAZEP centers. We have the home of hope that the Minister mentioned this morning.The home of hope has women and young girls who are in vulnerable, precarious situations, particularly in terms of material, those who have extreme protection needs, if they are extremely vulnerablethey can go to that home. It has dormitories, temporary shelters. Women can stay for up tofour weeks. There are ten beds. The idea is that people who come can get back on their feet as soon as possible. They can get back to their lives. They can have a social autonomy, if youwill. In addition to the facilitation of those community spaces, we have had many awareness raising sessions on issues linked to health and the risks that adolescent girls face inparticular. Information is given to them on their rights. It is not just this home of hope project. There is also a will to offer economic opportunities to women. This will is clearand has translated 1st of all to some prevention, work on prevention of gender based violence. The project focused on access for women and young girls to economic opportunities. Therehas been a group created whereby seeds were distributed, tools, materials to enable members of the group, this collective, if you will, to farm small parcels of land or land that theyown. They are given some basic inputs. That's a specific example that I wanted to give you to demonstrate the clear will of the Central African Republic's government to move towardsgenuine economic empowerment of women. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. These were the clarifications that we wanted to give you on the specific follow-up questions. Thank you. Thank you very much tothe Distinguished Delegation for the clarification and provision of all of this information. Let's now move to Article 14. We are going to continue to talk about women in rural areas, rural womenand climate change, disadvantaged groups of women. This is Article 14 of the Convention. To do so, I would like to give the floor to Mr. Silva de Alvarez for 7 min . Thank you, MadamChair. Once again, I greet Your Excellencies. The International Criminal Court's investigation in the case referred to by the State Party revealed in the words of the prosecutor and I quote hundredsof rape victims have come forward to tell their stories, recounting with careful detail crimes acted out with particular cruelty. My question to you is would the State Party consider creatinga repository of these stories as a way of memorializing women's narratives in conflict and as a way of stressing never again? My next question is a very difficult question. Hundreds of womenand children in the Central African Republic have reported being sexually abused by UN peacekeepers. It has been noted by the code blue campaign that UN investigations have revealed allegations of lack of psychological and other support from the UN and lack of reparations. How do you dealwith survivor justice in rehabilitation, restitution, trauma recovery in sexual violence among survivors, especially rural women survivors, women with disabilities and older women? I next go on tominerals and the extractive industry. Minerals are the newest battle ground for conflict. Given the State Party's huge mineral wealth, how can the guiding principles on business and humanrights call for the State Party's own due diligence in holding extractive industries accountable to exploitation of natural resources with the tension particularly to rural and indigenouscommunities? Please provide us information on measures on environment and social and governance indicators, ESG indicators or corporate social responsibility of the state on extractive industries.Illicit arms trade also have an impact on the most disadvantaged women. Are women involvedin dialogues with the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration coordination unit and other stakeholders? Does the 35% quota apply here too? My colleague earlier focused on the confluenceof gender, food and climate change. I will take a different track on this. As you know, climate change has provoked far more conflict and the migration of nomadic pastoralists from Sudanand Chad due to desertification and deforestation. This has triggered contracted conflicts in communitiesthat are particularly disadvantaged. What I would like to see distinguished Delegates is how canthe general recommendation 37, especially 3725 which calls for accountability and access to justice to ensure that all women and girls whose rights have been affected by disasters and climatechange can be provided with legal remedies. Now, this is a complicated legal issue which is a growing legal phenomenon. Do women have access to courts in cases relating to accessto water or access to grazing lands in times of climate crisis? And will they have legal aid in these important cases? And state parties, will the new agricultural land code which was developedin 2017 but which is still pending adoption include these legal remedies for women who are disproportionately impacted by climate crisis? I next go on to detainees. Cruel conditions have been reported in prisons. Foodscarcity and overcrowding in cells impact both women and male incarcerated persons. In fact, this position knownas Abaracha was an issue brought up in the trial of a trial that is before the ICC and calls for addressingthis through the torture convention. Now, would the state party consider applying the Nelson Mandela rules which represent the universally acknowledged blueprint for prison management in the 21st century and the Bangkokrules which are rules for the treatment of women prisoners and noncustodial measures for women offenders. I next go on to rural land. Women's access to land is a transformative right as it helps the exercise of all other rights, includingthe right to live free from violence. There are two land tenure systems and the customary and informal system applied by communities and the modern legal tenure system where the land belongs to the state. Your excellencies, my question is how will thestate party ensure women's access to land and the registration of land in women's names. As the distinguished minister stated, the state party removed the land ownership as a qualification for political office because women would be disadvantaged as men own land intheir name. So how can you change that, Your Excellency? Please explain a land registration policy for women and the equal rights to inheritance of land and the equal distribution of marital property upon the dissolution of marriage. In terms of land grabbing, how do you address corruption's linkages to gender equality and also rent seeking? Now, this is an economic term for politically protected transfers of licenses and contracts toselected people which generally excludes women from those licenses and transfers. And finally, older women, how does the state party monitor prosecutions for witchcraft which mainly involve older women and providing them the kind of legal aid that is necessary to defend themselves? Now, women with disabilities are an important part of our discussion because they are at the epicenter of climate crisis, conflict, COVID and food insecurity. Now are the two seats for persons with disabilities allocated in the 2013/2015 National Transitional Council, does it include one woman representative? Now does the quota of 10 % of positions in the civil service workforce that was established include more women? Because right now there are only 12 women as against 172%two persons with disabilities who were appointed. How would the State Party use temporary special measures to ensure that women are not disparately disadvantaged in their recruitment initiatives?Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Madam De Silva. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation for their responses. Thank you, Madam De Silva. Thank you for all of the questionsthat you have asked on Article 14. Before giving the floor to the other members of the booth, I would like to address the issue of rural women. They are often grouped into associations andthey are very much dealt in to programs and policies on the department level and the development there of gender policies, that is, and also in other ministries. Now, prisons, women andmen are not together in the same prison facilities. There is a prison for women and there are alsomeasures, texts that have been drafted to cover the presence of women in the penitentiaries. I'm going to give the floor to the Chargé d'Affaires and then other members of the Delegationto provide information and clarifications on these issues. I thank you. Thank you, MadamMinister. I would like to circle back to the concern of the Delegation, specifically whetherthe government is bringing together the testimonies of those who have suffered from the conflict. What I should like to respond is by saying that the work of safeguarding memory is importantafter a conflict. It is a pillar of lasting peace because sometimes when we don't remember the past we are condemned to relive it. Of course, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commissionhas the mission of not merely confronting or bringing together the victims and the executioners so that the victims know what happened, so that they are aware of the underlying causesof the atrocities that they faced, but also the goal is to allow for there to be a mourning process and so that such a conflict does not come about again. To do that, we need to writedown, record the memory, the testimonies of what happened for future generations so as to avoid this type of barbarism. Thank you very much. I give the floor to the legal missionchief. Thank you, Madam Minister. There are great many points that were brought up. We will tryto the degree we can to respond. The duty of memory, the charge of the prior order, you mentioned this, this is indeed the mission of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. It istrue that sexual abuse committed by UN personnel, that's an issue and there were cases. A UN missionwhen it arrives, it does so based on an accord, agreement. It is an agreement that is signed with the state so that there are rules of procedure and these rules of procedure set forth thatshould there be an infraction committed by a member of the UN mission, that individual can be brought before the jurisdiction of their country of origin. There are some cases of theseabuses committed in Bangui and all of these cases were documented. There is a zero tolerance principle in our country and in the UN. All of the authors of the sexual abuse cases wereimmediately they were taken out of their missions immediately. They were repatriated to their states and they are judged to put it that way or tried. The CR government through its foreignministry follows up on these cases. It does so together with the MINUSCA leadership. Theyensure well, they provide oversight domestically on punishment and then reparations. This is we don'tmake a distinction between a survivor of an act committed by a citizen or of a member of theUN missions. All victims receive holistic support by our healthcare structures, by NGOs, by the structures that have been set up to this end by the state. What is true is that the reparations dossierare followed up in MINUSCA with the legal affairs division. So there are cases that have led toreparations that have already been covered. Others are still underway and there is still follow-up. Turningto mining companies, how does the state ensure this and that any time a mining company sets up businessbefore beginning their business, there is a document signed with the state regarding the scope of theirwork. This reflects the local authorities because they are the ones that provide oversight on respect by the companies in environmental matters and general rules for the protection of the environment. We doneed to recognize often in practice that document is not very well respected by the companies and thestates to have to take measures. There are great many mining companies that have seen their mining permitwithdrawn for not having respected the conditions of the contract. But the follow-up is to ensure that the local population benefits from the exploitation but also there are measures to ensure that theenvironmental protection measures also be taken. Prison overcrowding, a question was asked about this andit is a real problem in our country. We have to admit this. The detention centers are centers that werebuilt some time ago and the demographic growth that we have seen has led to more detentions, more crimes andmore detentions and yet the facilities have not kept a pace. So immediate measures have been taken through the Ministry of Justice. There are some measures that were able to be taken right away. First of all, theMinister of Justice has circulated a letter, instructions really from the administration calling upon judgesto systematically resort to detention unless the crimes were bloody crimes. And this is the case as well formen and women. Other measures were taken immediately. This includes the naming of a judge that looks atsentences and that judge over time evaluates the sentences, the behavior of the individual and thisjudge looks at good behavior releases and other factors. However, the criminal code in the CAR or in other areas of ourlegislation, we do not have alternative sentencing, alternative punishments. There are things such as community service and othersimilar programs. So we are undertaking a vast reform of our criminal law, a big overhaul and we are looking toward theinclusion of alternate sentencing other than deprivation of liberty. So we want to avoid systematic imprisonment and also there is a plan for the rehabilitation of detention centers and construction of centers in the majority of ourcountry, the detention centers have been rehabilitated and some are being rebuilt. Now, property rights. Access to land. The land doesbelong to the state but there is no discrimination. Men and women can have access to land as long as the request is made to thestate. Perhaps I cannot say how many women are land holders, title holders either in Bangui or the interior but there is no discriminatory aspect ofthis. All individuals that express a need to have access to land and that meet the conditions to do so can have access to property. Inheritance.The CR legislation makes no distinction between male or female heirs. Women, boys, girls, they all have the same rights of succession. All heirs have thesame rights in matters of inheritance. Boys and girls, women, men, they all have equal access to succession when such cases arise. Now, the dissolving of amarriage, same thing here. The majority of marriages that are contracted in the CAR are done so by our legal structure set up to this purpose. Theculture of contracting holy matrimony is not really necessarily understood in the CR. So the majority of them are under the legal regime and this has to do with theassets regardless of the status of them and it is often the man that works or generates money but whatever the status is, when it comes time to dissolve amarriage, it is commonly held assets that are liquidated equally between the two individuals. I hope that I have not missed anything. The transitional council and itsmake-up. I think that the CAR has moved out of its transition since 2016. We have institutions that came as a result of elections after the crisis and as I said earlier, the implementation of all these institutions since 2016 follow the 35% quotas rule. In some cases, some institutions have gone beyond the 35%because the law says that it must be at least to a 35%. But the 35% rule is respected in all cases. It is enforced. Now, turning to persons with disabilities, I do think that Madam Director General perhaps could provide information on this topic. I thank you kindly. If there is additional information, I can circle back to that. Thank you to the mission chief in legal affairs. I give the floor to the Director General.That she might compliment the answers just given. Rather, it is the Director General of gender promotion that will provide additional information. Thank you very much. I wanted to provide complimentary information regarding the DDR program. I think that in our country, we have a ministry of the state that is in charge of DDR. This ministry works in close cooperation with numerousand the entirety of the sector really. We have a specific program for women within DDR. This is called the program for the reduction of community violence. In this program, there are actions that have been taken in order to benefit women and not just in actions aimed at supporting women, but there are also follow-up bodies, oversight bodies that have beenbrought into the fold of the DDR programs. I think that women are, in effect, indeed, born in mind, taking into account, that is, in the DDR programs. Clarification on the statement from the minister just now as regards property and construction, I think that erstwhile, the documents were issued in the name of the men and that left women without property in theirname and that was an obstacle. It was for that reason that we said we have to eliminate the obstacles. In the new plan, the documents will no longer be issued under the name of the men, but rather they will be produced, issued rather under the name of the man and the woman. I think that's the clarification I wanted to provide on that point. That was an obstacle. Documents were issued under the nameof the men and not the women, but now that will not be the case. They will be issued, property with assets in real estate will be issued under the names of the men and women. I would like to add one more idea. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Minister. I would like to circle back, if I might, to the concern over the rights of persons with disabilities. The CAR constitution ensuresprotection to persons with disabilities, whatever the gender might be of the individual, and specifically on the legislative front, we have a law of 20 December 2000 that looks at the promotion and protection of persons with disabilities. There is a 30% quota set for recruiting in the public sector for persons with disabilities. Man or woman, 30% of theposts are reserved for persons with disabilities. We should also note that for the last ten years or so, there are provisions on accessibility for construction, particularly for people of limited or reduced mobility. Working together with the international organization, a study was conductedin three regions of the Central African Republic, and this study allowed, among other things, to identify barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities, men or women, to include Indigenous persons because for the Indigenous persons, there is an additional, the obstacles are more pronounced. The study was aimed at lifting or supporting the post-conflictpeople in the post-conflict period. Now also to fight against stereotypes, many campaigns and awareness raising, dissemination are regularly conducted by the government, the idea being to inform those living with a disability regarding their rights in our society. That's the additional information I wish to provide, and I thank you. Thank you to the Chargé d'Affaires. Madam Chair, these are ourresponses under Article 17. On behalf of the Committee, we wish to very much thank the Distinguished Delegation for the information provided to the questions asked by Madam Da Silva. Madam Da Silva has requested the floor with a follow-up question. Madam, you have the floor for 2 min .Thank you, Chair. We wish to very much thank the Distinguished Delegation for the information provided to the questions asked by Madam Da Silva. Madam Da Silva has requested the floor with a follow-up question. Madam, you have the floor for 2 min .Thank you, Chair. Thank you for all your detailed answers, Your Excellencies. I just wanted to get a response to the issue that I had raised on the application of General Recommendation 37, which deals with CEDAW's own focus on the climate crisis and the linkages with gender.My question to you dealt with a very specific Article of GR 37 which calls for legal accountability and access to justice to ensure that women and girls who are affected by disasters andclimate change can have access to legal remedies. Now, this is about public interest litigation or strategic litigation which involves women who have been impacted disproportionately by the climate crisis, either through access to water, the inadequate access to water, thedrying up of the river Chad basin or in terms of the conflict and the ways in which pastoralists may not have sufficient land for their animals to graze. Would there be a possibility for thestate to be able to provide through your new agropastoralist land code which is still being developed and still evolving a legal remedy, capacity for these victims or survivors of climate crisis to be able to come to court. This is a very new and evolving almost likea revolutionary new legal action which is strategic litigation, public interest litigation that is being adopted by many countries in the global south in terms of the climate crisis. Thankyou. Thank you very much, Madame de Silva. I also wanted to ask a follow-up question. Truthbe told, I was very much surprised and I wish to commend you for the 30% quota for persons with disabilities in public posts. I come from a country, Spain, and the EU where at the mostthere is 5% as a quota. So your reference point here, I am extremely concerned over the belief that I know exists in parts of your country that curing AIDS can come by having sex witha virgin woman. Often this exposes women and girls with disabilities to sexual violence. What measures have been taken to protect women and girls with disabilities from this exposureto sexual violence in this context? Also I should like to know if given the situation that you described, Ursula, whether women and girls with disabilities are taken into account inthe prevention and treatment programs for HIV/AIDS. You have the floor for another 5 minthat you may respond to these follow-up questions. I thank you very much. The floor is yours. Thank you, Madam Chair. For clarification on these points, I am going to give the floor to thehead of legal affairs for the mission. So HIV/AIDS and the other issues as well. Yes, the goalof our programs are to eliminate the problems of accessing land and water. However, in the majority of cases, conflict between ranchers and farmers becomes an issue. As you have indicated,Madam Committee member, our country has suffered from this problem as a result of the nomadicranching. A lot of this comes from abroad, cross-border work from Sudan or Chad. And the majority ofour population are farmers working in agriculture. So that gives rise to conflict. So this does give rise to conflicts regarding land and water. And we have tried to and we have moved to reform the agricultural code. Yes, access to justice for reparation, particularly for the victimsof climate change and natural disasters will be ever more born in mind. I do think that thatis a concern worth noting because we today are experts in the reform of this legal framework.As regards persons with disabilities and HIV/AIDS, all policy for providing care for those living with HIV/AIDS are drafted and supported by the government and supported by partners, amongthem UNAIDS. This practice which consists of or rather this belief, this belief, to say itthat way, that says that sexual relations with a young virgin can cure AIDS, I have to say that I have never heard of this. But if Madame Chair brings this up, it is because it doesexist. The criminal code does punish the voluntary transmission or intentional transmission of HIV/AIDS. There are vast awareness campaigns that have been implemented and that are beingimplemented. So the voluntary, intentional transmission of AIDS is criminally punishable, whether it is whether the victim is a person with a disability or not. Thank you to my colleague for thoseresponses. Now more on the law on HIV/AIDS, this has begun to be disseminated by the Ministry of Justice. The dissemination of this information also is being conducted in our national language,in French, yes, but also in our, in Sangol. The idea is to ensure that the population can make it their own, they can have ownership over this and so that they can protect themselvesfrom the scourge. That's what I wish to add to the response on HIV/AIDS. I thank you. Thank you so very much to the Distinguished Delegation for the information that they have providedus in the follow-up questions. We will now move to the 4th part of the convention. I would then like to give the floor at this time to Madame Janina Gonzalez-Ferret to ask questionson Articles 15 and 16 of the convention. This looks at equality before the law and family relations. Madame, the floor is yours for 4 min . Thank you, Chair. I would like to joinmy colleagues in the Committee to thank the High Level Delegation of the State of the Central African Republic for this constructive dialogue. We do appreciate that in the CAR in legislative matters for the family, steps have been taken to eliminate expressions of discrimination inmarriage and family relations. The overhaul that the ministry for the advancement of women in the family and the protection for children has undertaken and which continues to be underway in the family code shows just that. There have been elimination provisions that say that theman is the head of the household and that the marriage age is 18 years of age and that there is no discrimination in the law between children born in and outside of wedlock and this includesinheritance and citizenship. However, marriage of persons less than 18 years of age is possible with specific authorization. A UNICEF report indicated in 2017 that 68% of girls were marryingbetween before the age of 18 and 29% of girls were married before 15 years of age and 27% of them were married before 18 years of age. In practice forced marriage is common and insome communities nor has there been elimination of the polygamy provisions. We would like to know if these legal modifications are being implemented, are they in force? I would furtherask if you could update us on the state of the reforms in the family code. What plans do you have in legislation to overturn discriminatory laws on marriage and family relations and reformulatelegislation particularly we would like to know what is being done to eliminate the exceptions for marriage of girls less than 18 years of age, the elimination of polygamy and what is being done to prohibit corporal punishment in the family environment committed againstgirls. What actions is the government undertaking to eliminate the practice of forced marriages and false marriages that cover up sexual exploitation of girls and women. Might you share with usmore on the educational activities that you are undertaking to destimulate or rather create or eliminate incentives to these marriages and to slow early pregnancies. Looking at alsothe role of religious leaders and traditional chiefs in the effect in addressing the effects of practices against how they are harmful to girls and women. Also polygamy, I have heard publications indicating that there is resistance to this practice, polygamy by women, particularlythe youngest because of the negative effects that these have in the enjoyment of their rights and it is not merely during the marriage but also after divorce. As regards the economic effects of separations and divorce, I should like to know of the protection that women havewhen it comes to insuring property acquired during the marriage and also tell us more about alimony for children and ex-wives. We appreciate the work undertaken with the UNFPA and the UNgender empowerment body for women that make visible the national text for discrimination against women. Based on the results of the study conducted, in what way is the state working towards capacity building for the primary governmental institutions, formal and informal agents ofjustice, law and order, the idea being that they bear more in mind gender issues and that they are accountable regarding the effective policies regarding gender including the gender perspectivein conflicts within families. In what way are traditional leaders being brought into this process and is there training on the effective rights of women, gender equality and women's empowerment?Also we appreciate the discrimination in the law between children born in and outside of wedlock regarding inheritance. What practices are being undertaken to ensure that this is that thereis full compliance with the law? I thank you kindly. Thank you very much. I now give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation. Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez, for these questions. UnderArticles 15 and 16, these questions pertain to the family and this is really the absolute heart of the Department of Gender Promotion and Protection of Women, Families and Children.We know that the family code is a huge building site, if you will. The code is vast and customs do constitute obstacles and they put a break on progress in many ways. Let me give the floorto the Director General of Protection for her to give more details and explanation on all ofthe questions you just asked. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Minister. Thank you, Madam Chair.Just briefly, what pushed us to amend the discriminatory provisions in the family code, let me just takeyou through a little bit of history on that. An inquiry or inquiries, plural, have been carried out both in the capital and within the interior of the country and to see how women's lives,particularly how their lives are affected by provisions that are discriminatory. The result of these inquiries and surveys showed that within the country, the stats showed that womenare not against polygamy. Women are not against polygamy as such. Women in the rural areassay they are not against it. However, the question on heads of families and the authority, whether the authority was the man that is of concern, the figure of authority. That was one resultthat came out of the surveys which led us to revise those provisions and also child marriage that you mentioned earlier. There was one provision which expressly stipulated that the child thatis under 18, if the child, if the girl falls pregnant, she can be authorized to marry. Thatprovision was also revised and took into account of the child protection code, that it took thatinto account. So for the time being, the draft that is being revised has deleted that provision. So the child, even if the girl falls pregnant and she is under 18, she doesn't have to havethe authorization from her parents to get married. That has been deleted and as I say, it is not included in the new code, in the new provision. So colleagues will add to what I have said butwe thought that the review, the revision was really essential and on this, when we werelooking at revising discriminatory provisions, experts who were accompanying us, the president of the commission of text requested that all of the content, all of the provisions be gonethrough with a fine-toothed comb to see if there was anything missing, to see if they had forgotten to include any particular discriminatory provisions and that took two weeks to go through everything, really with a fine-toothed comb, just to go through all of these provisions that are discriminatoryagainst women and to pick them out and to women and girls. There is also a national strategy, a national policy and an action plan that the minister raised earlier in her remarks to protectand to ensure protection of and promotion of the family. This policy document deals with issues like how parents can be encouraged to be responsible, how within the family, howshould relationships be built, all of this and it is part of, it is important and it is part of our journey. We are focusing on these particular areas now as awareness raising and so on. Youalso talked earlier about the treatment of children. I didn't fully understand the question but I just do want to focus on, as I say, these discriminatory provisions in the code, the familycode and the child protection code. These are, these dossiers are currently before the economic and social council and the counselors therein, they have recommended that this be, that itgo via them for them to also check through and to see if we didn't miss anything, any points that should be revised or that should be amended or any provisions that run counter to women'sand girls' rights. So it is before that body right now. That's what I can tell you on that. What we are doing in terms of customary leaders, what action are we taking? These are lobbyingand advocacy actions that we are carrying out, awareness raising, to show the downside, the negative side of child marriage. In 2017 we carried out awareness raising more within theinterior of the country. According to the statistics we find a high level, far removed from the capital and that has enabled us to draft a strategy to combat child marriage with the priority areasas I say. So that's what I wanted to give you by way of an answer. Madam Minister, thank you. Thank you. I give the floor to the representative from gender promotion. Thank you. Just I don'twant to repeat what my colleague said but as was said earlier, I think that to amend the family code, the studies and surveys had to be carried out and the survey that was carriedout did see points highlighted and these points included challenges, there was the issue ofpolygamy, there is also the issue of succession inheritance and there is also the issue ofauthorizing child marriage. Now, the there were 67 discriminatory provisions picked out and in the 67 provisions now we are revising them and we have realized that there are other discriminatoryprovisions which featured in the document. So we needed to generally revise the whole document and that's what we have done. This work really took quite a long time and was done firstlyby it had national validation by this text commission and then it has gone to the Council of Ministersafter the Council of Ministers it went to the economic and social council as my colleaguesaid. So I think that's what we have seen and in terms of polygamy, there were diverging ideas, there were intellectual women, there were rural women and there were indigenous women. In termsof indigenous women, most of them recognized that polygamy was a chance, it was an opportunity for them. In terms of rural women, they found that polygamy had no impact on women and itwas intellectual women in urban areas who rejected polygamy. So we thought that perhaps it was due to the ignorance of these women, the fact that they weren't aware of the downside. Itis a long-term goal. You can't just wipe out polygamy in one fell swoop. We have to carry out awareness raising and that's being done and when the attitudes towards it have improved,I think the communities will reject it themselves. I think they will reject it from within the community. So there is work being done there and at the same time when you are talking about,e.g. , dowry is given, you know, that still happens but the value given is by way of recognition in the family code. We didn't want to stipulate an amount for a dowry because we didn't want people to think that it is a way of selling women. So the dowry would bea symbolic nominal value and these are provisions which are included in the family code that is being revised. In terms of family relationships, I think there is a law providing protectionfor women from violence. There is one article that does suppress incest. Incest is considered to be gender-based violence and this is moral deprivation. This is punished very strictlyif you look at the family, the code protecting women, I think you will see there that it is criminalized very strictly indeed. So this is also covered in legislative terms. In termsof traditional leaders, the new constitution recognizes traditional leaders and so we are trying to currently put in place a law on traditional leaders so that they can be recognized and sothat specific actions can be focused on them so that things can be improved in the community. That's where things stand now then. There is a study being carried out on the ground to tryand gather information as to how traditional leaders work, how they exist, how we can improve things and really put in place a structure for traditional leaders within the CAR to developto help the country develop further. So these are all the actions that the government is currently undertaking. I thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. If you don't mind, Madam, can Ijust give the floor very quickly to the charge admission, the legal adviser for additionalinformation? Thank you. Sorry, just a couple of points. On child marriage, early marriage,the Director General explained it but I do want to come back on it as well because the point has come up several times. If the family code at the time did stipulate some exceptions thatwe mentioned earlier, the marriage can emancipate the child or in a pregnancy the child could be protected through marriage but the child protection code has completely prohibited it with no exceptions. There are no longer any exceptions permitting this in this area. Now, the reformof the family code is to really remove the exceptions that existed originally in that code. So that's been taken care of. There was a question as to alimony and how that's paid to women, mothersof children, single mothers. Generally speaking, alimony is taken by the justice system. It's done by judicial decision and is directly sent to the mother through the justice services. They collect that from the bank and then it's directly transmitted to the mother, transferredto her directly. In terms of children born inside and outside of wedlock, I did talk about this earlier but let me clarify once again, there is no longer any distinction between the two. This is a distinction between natural or legitimate child. These are old notions, outdated notionsfrom the Napoleonic code of 1864, since the reforms and we have to recognize that the CAR is of a legal tradition inherited from the colonizing countries. Since reforms that were done in France,this distinction has disappeared. There is no longer any distinction. There is no differencebetween a child born inside a marriage or a child born out of wedlock. Since the 1997, 1992 reforms, this is also entered into legislation in our country. There is no distinction betweenthe two in terms of inheritance. All children take equal rank when it comes to inheritance and succession and inheriting the goods and property of their parents. Thank you. Thankyou, Madam Chair. These were the answers to questions that were raised by the Distinguished Committee Member. Thank you. Thank you very much indeed to the Distinguished Head of Delegation for the information provided. Ms. Widemi, you have the floor for 2 min of follow-up. Thankyou. Sorry, the very comprehensive answers that were given. I am still I am a bit intriguedabout the answer on polygamy. I am not sure whether I got it right. Please, I do not need an answer right now. It is just my mind coming out. I thought I heard you say that it wasthe women in the urban areas who liked the idea of polygamy. Uh-huh. I find it a bit unsettling.But I think that nevertheless, in your reforms, we should look at polygamy not only from the viewpoint that I like it, I don't like it, but is it discriminatory or is it not discriminatory?Now, when one man has the option of several wives, that cannot be equality. We are not asking that women also marry several husbands. No. All we are saying is that when we are lookingat the concept of equality and equality in the family, which is the basic unit of society, the optics should be right. We must now use law as a tool of social engineering. When we startedwork on elimination of violence 30, 40 years ago, men said are you telling us now that we can't beat our wives? Is that what you are telling us? We said yes, please. So they hadto understand that wife beating was no longer acceptable legally. For the reason that it's discrimination, it's violence. We should use a similar principle to explain polygamy. It'snot that I like having five of us marrying one man. It's not liking or not liking. It's discriminatory. I thank you. Thank you very much, Ms. Berdema, for your thoughts and commentsthere. They are very timely indeed. Ms. Gonzales Ferrer, you have the floor for 2 min for follow-up questions. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I should also like to thank the Delegation for the extensive responses that they have given. I wanted to make a similar comment to thatof Ms. Berdema on the role, the very important role that law has, the legislation has in terms of educating as an educational purpose and that in turn drives change and it drives educational campaigns, awareness raising and everything that can be achieved there. I just wanted furtherclarification, please, on the issue of corporal punishment for girls. I wasn't entirely clear if within the studies that are being carried out on the family code or in the law on protectionthat the official mentioned, whether they properly eliminate from the law the corporal punishmentof girls. Thank you. Thank you. I also have a follow-up question as regards what you were saying in Paragraph 19 in your responses to the list of issues. You talk about levirateand surerate. You say there that these are also, these phenomena are also being revised in the family code. My question is what has happened to the situation of levirate and sureratein this revised code. Given that it is a revision of the family code where you are, where we takeit that a lot of the challenges that the state has before it are, a lot of them are covered by the law. I would like to know when you think this family code will actually be adopted. Asfar as I have understood it, it is still at the phase of negotiation and revision. These will be my two questions. Let me give the floor back to you for you to answer briefly, just in fiveminutes, please. Thank you very much. You have the floor, Madam. Thank you, Madam Chair. As I was saying earlier, I was talking about the sociocultural weight, if you like, and the waythe customs have an influence on the family code that is currently before the Economic and Social Council. The Economic and Social Council will be sitting through until March and then from March onwards we will be able to say that the code has been adopted. If this Council,the Economic and Social Council finishes with the document, then it goes to the National Assembly from then. So there is just still an extra step that it has to go through after the Economic and Social Council. It has to then go to the National Assembly. On corporal punishment inschools, that no longer exists. It used to exist when I went to school, e.g. , but it is no longer a thing. It doesn't exist anymore. Let me give the floor to the Chair for him to explain it and to tell you about the different provisions, but it no longer exists, corporalpunishment in schools at all. On the problem of the sociocultural traditions, again I'm coming back to that, it is a problem because when we come up with these new texts, when weadopt these new texts, then those who are most affected by it need to take ownership of them to implement them in practice. You can't just turn up with a whip to try and get people to do what you want. You have to get families and people to accept it. So that is why awarenessraising campaigns are so important. They are going to be carried out to make sure that families understand why these things are harmful practices and why they are bad for their health, theyare bad for their mental health. This is huge long-term work. The results won't be there by tomorrow even assuming that, of course, they are positive as we hope they will be. Let me give the floor back to the Chair for him to add. Thank you, Madam Minister. On Leverett andSurat, I just wanted to clarify the following. This is a practice that does exist even today. It does still exist. We can't deny that. But we recognize that these are harmful practices.They date from the belief or from culture, if you like, and we are talking about this, the cultural weight. But the reforms that the country are undertaking, it wasn't even a conversationbefore the prohibition wasn't expressed in the law. So it was a real elephant in the room. It was really not mentioned anywhere. The practice continued and was quite widespread. Today theidea is that it be expressly prohibited in law. It is true that awareness raising will contribute to that and the efforts will continue but it will now be punishable under law andthis will act as a deterrent hopefully. So this is just what I wanted to bring by way of clarification. Before it didn't used to be taken into account by the law. It just wasn't included at all. We tried to discourage it through teaching, through awareness raising and through informationbut in the reform, the upcoming reform, it will be expressly prohibited as a harmful practice. Now, just to come back on corporal punishment, we said earlier the law on school guidance since 1997, I think, prohibits corporal punishment in schools. It is completely prohibited. Andto implement that, there are structures set up in schools for teachers so that should there be any corporal punishment reported, the administrative punishments would be meted out within the schoolmanagement. The perpetrators would be probably punished within family. Corporal punishment is the throwback to violence which is prohibited and punished generally. All forms of violenceare prohibited and punished more generally. So corporal punishment is punished. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. We have given our answers on the specific points that were raised there.Thank you. Once again, we would like to thank you very much Distinguished Delegation for having answered the questions raised. Let me just conclude then the review of the Sixth Periodic Reviewof the Central African Republic. This was submitted in line with the usual procedure. I should like to thank the experts for their questions and comments. And I thank representatives of theState Party for their answers and explanations that they provided us with today. Would theHead of Delegation like to make any closing remarks? Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chairperson.I would like to thank the Chair and all of the community members here present for the way they have conducted this extremely constructive dialogue with the Delegation of the Central African Republic and for all of the attention that you have paid and the guidance you have givento our country. The President of the Republic, Head of State pays great attention to eradicating all forms of discrimination against women. And this attention is taken note of by the Government. The Delegation has taken good note of the specific points that we need to answer in writing andwe undertake to do that within the required time frame. However, I do want to flag just some restrictions that my country, the CR is facing. We have the point about capacity building,the issue of managing data. We have difficulties with that. We also have problems regarding ownership of policies because it is not just a case of drafting policies and laws but we need to ensure that the beneficiaries can take ownership of them. We have issues with that. We do strugglewith that. And there are also financial restrictions when it comes to financial constraints with implementation of everything that we draft and adopt because that is where that's the crux of the issue. It is implementation that makes the positive impact of these laws visible thatclearly demonstrates the impact of all of these policies that we are adopting. That is why I would issue a call on behalf of my Delegation to ensure that particular attention be paid to all of these issues, all of these constraints that I have raised, all of these obstacles tohelp us truly strengthen these areas in the CR. My full Delegation thanks you all for yourattention, for your guidance so that this dialogue has really been very constructive one to serve to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in my country, Central African Republic. Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chairperson. On behalf of the Committee I would like to thankthe Delegation for the constructive dialogue with the Committee. This has enabled us to better understand the situation of women and girls in your country. The Committee would invitethe State Party to accept the amendment to Article 20 Paragraph 1 of the Convention pertaining to the meeting time of the Committee as soon as possible. The Secretariat will be sendinga model form for acceptance with more explanation to your permanent mission in the very near future. The Committee commends the State Party for its efforts and courage in taking all the necessarymeasures to address the different recommendations of the Committee which will be formally communicated to you through the permanent mission for purposes of a more comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Convention throughout the territory of the State Party for the benefitof all women and girls in the country. The Committee also reminds the State Party that it selects a number of recommendations for immediate follow-up. These are mentioned at the end of the concludingobservations. It invites the State Party to pay particular attention to these selected recommendations and to submit information on their implementation within the deadline defined in that same paragraph.Thank you, Excellency. We look forward to receiving your next periodic report. We wish you a goodjourney home. The Committee will now convene in closed meeting. This meeting is suspended."}
{"title": "", "text": "Excellencies, dear colleagues, good afternoon. We are now trying to have our final afternoonof this intersessional meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group on effective implementationof the DPA, an intersessional meeting that I have invited you so that we can try to gothrough again the text of the declaration so that we can advance with the review, the 1streading of the text that we will continue in May and be able to give a status report to theGeneral Assembly as it was in the resolution. Then this morning we discussed the paragraphat the end of this morning, today morning we discussed the paragraph 5 which was relatedto IT access and use of Internet. We have got so many inputs, comments from different Delegationsand I would like to check if you have got some inputs from your IT colleagues or if you haveconsulted documents that would help us have some consensual terms, consensual words and that would be, that can be used for this paragraph and your comments, inputs to paragraph number5 on the screen are welcome. If not, we will keep the text as it is and move to next paragraphor next Article. Thank you. The floor is yours. Yes, I would like to suggest that we move tonext paragraph and we leave this one there. It is a new Article. It will be Article number7. The title for your information was promotion and recognition of and respect for the culture,history and heritage of people of African descent. The title that we are going to delete and start by the 1st paragraph of Article number 7. If I can have the whole text of paragraph 1 ofArticle number 7 on the screen. Article 1 reads: States shall promote greater knowledge and recognitionof and respect for the historical contributions of people of African descent to the growth and development of the global economy. The historical contribution to the conservation of biologicaldiversity and development of the sustainable use of genetic resources and the contribution of their traditional knowledge and languages to scientific knowledge. This paragraph was alsodiscussed previously. Your inputs, comments are welcome. I do not see any Delegation requestingfor the floor. I see the Distinguished Representative of the European Union, you have the floor. Thankyou, Madam Chair and good afternoon. When we 1st discussed this text, I think it was two years ago, our position was that it would be helpful for us if this could be aligned as muchas possible with the existing paragraph 12 C of the programme of activities for the implementation of the international decade because I think that's the source of this paragraph but thereare quite a few new elements here and I was just wondering whether the I'm not sure who the pen holder is that I should address, whether there are sources for this. That would be veryhelpful because we based our position on Article 12 C from the programme of activities. The Secretariatis trying to bring in the content of the paragraph as suggested? Yes. We brought the paragraphfrom the programme of activities, paragraph 12, as that was suggested by the Delegationof the European Union on the screen for your consideration. If I got it well, the EuropeanUnion Delegation would prefer to use the paragraph, to use the content of the paragraph 12 of the programme of activities of the international decade for people of African descent insteadof having the paragraph that we have, I had I proposed at the beginning of the session. Yes,I see the permanent representative of Costa Rica, you have the floor. Thank you, Ambassador. Now,obviously, we have no problem with 12 C of the programme of activities of the decade. We support it, but we think in this context we would be losing an important part of the paragraphthat refers to the historical contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.I think that is an element that should be contained within the paragraph. In our case, we have African descendant peoples who are tribal peoples, indigenous peoples and who have a special relationshipto the land resources, medicinal plants, ancestral knowledge, which is handed down from generationto generation, which in the case of Costa Rica has helped greatly in the development, including to the pharmaceutical industry. I'm not going to go into anecdotes here, but there is a seriesof components used, Chanel, e.g. , some of its creams, they use these elements, they use it in those creams, they have done that with thanks to the work done by indigenous peoplein African, people of African descent in my country. So it is important for that reason that there is a relationship, a different relationship with those specific peoples and that merits recognitionbecause we are here talking about promoting knowledge of the contribution of persons with African descent and the tribal peoples, their contribution to conservation and the sustainableuse of biodiversity. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good afternoon, Chair, everybody. Yes, I thinkI agree with both our colleagues from the European Union and Costa Rica in which sense. It mightbe interesting to have that language 12C from the programme of activities. Nonetheless, I think they are different things. They are talking about different contributions and not differentcontributions but they are talking about different aspects and by replacing one for the other, we would miss that and that's the sense that I agree with Costa Rica. Maybe we could havethat it would be important and it is also something that I agree with our Distinguished Colleague from the European Union that would be important for us to recognize the source of this paragraph.But in general, we support the text as drafted. If the Chair or the Secretariat could help us, assist us on providing the source for that, that would be really helpful for us in a 2ndmoment. But we Brazil supports the text as drafted and maybe that proposal made by European Unioncould be as an additional paragraph. Thank you. Yes, the Secretariat is still checking. Theyhave the they think it may have been a contribution from the permanent forum. I'm not yet sure. Theyare still checking. And I noted that the suggestion is to have the paragraph proposed by the EuropeanUnion Delegation to be a 2nd paragraph as per Brazil intervention. But let me give thefloor to the representative of the United Kingdom. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Theseare an interesting set of paragraphs I think we can broadly support. We just have the same issue here where we have several paragraphs that begin with the word shall which again for us implies some sort ofobligation that in this respect we are not able to commit to. So, e.g. , in the 1st paragraph, although our national curriculum enables schools to teach all of these things, the government doesn'tset in this level of detail what each institution should be teaching. So it is difficult to agree to the word shall when we have got this sort of level of prescription here. We think we could addressthis by adding a chapeau or just like you have done there, changing the words shall to should or somethingsofter. Thanks. Thank you. Can we have to state shall should promote greater knowledge as the contributionby the European Union Delegation as a 2nd paragraph? Yes, European Union Delegation, you have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. We are not actively asking to add that paragraph separately. If the room feels that it is necessary, that's all fine. But for us, the issue was in the previous paragraph where a lot of additional language is introduced that we have not yet seen previously in any of the documents relatedto the fight against racism adopted. And in order to be able to take that step, therefore, it would be extremely helpful if we can have the sources where this language comes from. I happen to be in a previouslive I covered WIPO and I know that, e.g. , everything related to traditional knowledge and there is another element there in the text. This is being debated, genetic resources. This is very muchbeing debated in WIPO with its own complexities. I have no idea where they stand. But if there is WIPO consensual language on that, perfect. But it would be good to know. I'm not saying we are necessarily againstall of it, but it would help us to take that step. Thank you. Yes, can I propose that for this paragraphwe just mentioned that we recommend that the source be mentioned in order to have it analyzedin the original text. And then leave it as it is in the text and consider the paragraph that was proposed by the European Union and see if we can have it improved or bring it to a consensual text that we can all approve.But as it is a concern of a number of Delegations, it is for them very important to get what are the sources of the paragraph that is proposed. I think this is what I'm getting from yourcomments and inputs and I would like to just suggest that we leave it there while the Secretariat is still looking for the sources and we rather go to the paragraph that was proposed by the EU and see if we can keep it, improve it or just leave it as well while we are waitingfor the clarification from the previous paragraph. Can the Secretariat note in bracket that theywill look into the sources, the references for this paragraph? Yes, can we have the 2ndparagraph on the screen? Yes, the EU 1 and C. You have on the screen the paragraph thatwas proposed by the EU Delegation and with its references which is paragraph number 12 C of the programme of activities of international decade for people of African descent. Do youhave comments, inputs to this paragraph? I would like to give the floor to the DistinguishedDelegates of Brazil. Actually, considering what was mentioned by the European Union, we arein your hands, both of you, the Chair in European Union. That would be I don't know if this isgoing to be actually this is an interesting language that can be added in the text, maybenot in this article, the following one that talks about actually research and education, but as I said, we are in your hands. We are flexible to accept that because it is good languagethat comes from the international decade, but no strong feelings for that paragraph. Thankyou. Yes, I would like to give the floor to Pastor Morillo. Actually, we had the paragraph,the paragraph 1 on this article. Member States are requesting for the source of this paragraph and the Secretariat is telling me that it may be coming from the permanent forum. Is it correct?If it is, can you bring more clarity on the background of this paragraph? Thank you, MadamChair. This is an initiative of the permanent forum on people of African descent. The forum in its deliberations addressed one of those issues, namely the importance, the criticalimportance of the issue of people of African descent in addressing many of the major globalchallenges including the climate crisis. The forum emphasized the importance of the contributionof people of African descent to the close linkage between biological diversity and cultural diversityand focused on the need to show how after the pandemic or in the context of the pandemic approximately15% of the excess deaths in cities like New York and in Lombardy and other places were associated with respiratory issues. What we are pointing to is and we have since the start is that theissue of people of African descent and their rights cannot be limited only to racial discrimination but also must take into account all dimensions including their contribution, e.g. , inthis case to sustainability of the planet. It was felt that approximately 75% of diseases,including COVID-19 are zoonotic. In other words, they come from animals and move into humansand we should be calling on states to recognize these contributions, the region of the Pacific,Colombia Pacific. Colombia has the 2nd greatest biodiversity in the world and that potential, the importance of that contribution to global sustainability is something that the forum wantsto emphasize and this is something that the social movement of people of African descent should be calling for. We should reiterate that the declaration on the rights of people of African descent shouldnot be limited to considering only the issue of racism and racial discrimination. That is one dimension. But when we look at ethnicity and contributions, there are other issues and this issomething that needs to be taken into account in the language. Thank you. Thank you. I thankPastor Moreira for the clarifications and I would like to check with Delegations if they are willingto consider the Paragraph 1 on the screen, input it or approve it before we move to next Paragraph.European Union Delegation. Thank you, Madam Chair. To allow us to move forward, maybe you could just indicate EU reservation as has been done in the past. I sincerely thank Pastor Moreira for the explanationand I will take that back to my group but I cannot solve it on the spot. Thank you. Any additionalcomments, inputs to this Paragraph? Thank you. Does the EU Delegation allow that we go to the we don'tconsider the suggested Paragraph and we go to the previous 2nd Paragraph that was in the text? Yes.Yes. Let's combine the two. The EU reservation on the proposed Paragraph number 1 will go withthe new them proposing yes, we do this like that one and then we move to Paragraph number 2. Paragraphnumber 2 reads states shall recognize the domestic and international histories and heritage and culture and other contributions to societies of people of African descent. States shall also raise awarenessof and take educational measures on the histories, heritage and culture and other contributions to societies of people of African descent. Input comment? I see Brazil Delegation requesting for thefloor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just one quick thing about the previous Paragraph.If it's going to reflect as a replacement, I don't think Brazil can support the proposal made by the EU.We would stick with the draft, the original draft and we cannot support the EU proposal as a replacementfor the previous Paragraph. Thank you. I agree we can improve the language there but not having theEuropean proposal as a replacement. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to theexcellency permanent representative of Costa Rica. Thank you, Ambassador. I want to say two things. First, what I understood what the EU said and I would like to request if they can actually clarify because Ithink we are getting all confused. I think that they wanted to know the source and once they knew the source, what they said is that they would reserve their position on the Paragraph that is that youproposed. And I think that they just brought the Paragraph 12 C to compare because they thought maybe that was the source because actually the 1st part of the Paragraph C is identical. I didn'tunderstand that it was a proposal one for the other from the EU but I would like to seek clarification from the EU. Maybe what we should do is just wait until the EU can hold their consultations internallyand then we can come back to this Paragraph but then that would also affect the Paragraph 2 because of what I'm going to say now because I actually believe that Paragraphs 1 and 2 should be merged. There is,they are both speaking about the recognition of the history and the heritage of people of African descent and raising awareness and taking educational measures that actually seems very much alike withthe 2nd part of the Paragraph 12 C. So I think that maybe we should wait until we solve the part of the reservation of the EU and then Costa Rica would propose to merge Paragraphs, your originalParagraph 1 with your original Paragraph 2. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. EU Delegation. Thank you,Madam Chair. We have no comments on this Paragraph 2. We were ready to adopt it as it stands. I can see the point made by Her Excellency the Ambassador of Costa Rica to merge the two elements. For us,the reservation in Paragraph 1 is on this entirely new language that the permanent forum is putting forward that is related to contribution to the conservation of biological diversity and development of the sustainable use of genetic resources and the contribution of their traditional knowledge andlanguage to scientific knowledge. Because this, yeah, it's just entirely new. We have never discussed it in any human rights related document. And if you would have been able to tell me this comes from anagreement adopted at WIPO Treaty I don't know what, then it's easily done. But I know there are serious discussions on this topic in other agencies here in Geneva. So I just need to know whether all my MemberStates can approve that. And we are not there. So you can do the merging exercise and maybe keep then the reservation on that difficult part if that is helpful. But in any case on Paragraph 2 we werefine. Thank you. And apologies that this is complicated. Thank you. Pastor Morillo. Thank you,Chair. I just want to point out that as regards the previous paragraph,the support can be found in Article 8J of the biological diversity convention. Thank you.I see the Distinguished Delegation of Venezuela. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. We wish to support what Pastor Morillo has said. There is also Article 7 on the promotion of recognition andrespect for the culture and heritage of people of African descent. There is no specific direct or indirect mention of climate change and the impact on people of African descent. On that, we would liketo suggest reviewing the paragraph and seeking to include what we discussed at the 28th session of the expert group on people of African descent where there is mention of climate justice and the climatecrisis placing together with conservation of biological diversity a specific focus on climatechange. So the proposal is climate change. Or climate crisis could also be placed in there. Thank you.Yes. The Secretariat is proposing to have the source of this paragraphthat is coming, that is the convention on biological diversity, Article number 8J. I would like to givethe floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. We are making that bigger than was expected. Let mesee if I can be really clear about that. I believe that what our Distinguished Delegate from the Europeanraised here was some concern about the language. It is a new language. It is something that we have never seen. I think it is appropriate for us to take this step even to create language or to be able torecognize that there are some new things to be endorsed in this declaration. I don't see any problem. I understand the worries, the European worry about that and being really grounded. So we have to do thenew language if it is necessary but that be grounded. That's how Brazil agrees. So I think there are important issues that are raised here and it is important that they are there. This is one thing. Sowe should give another round of negotiations as we did in the previous paragraph about technology. Maybe we should consult our experts and colleagues on those matters and see if they fit appropriately here andthere. That's the thing. This is one thing. So let's try not to get that bigger and give appropriatestud on those matters there. It is one thing. The other thing I don't I have to ask my distinguished colleague from Venezuela if they are really sure to make that amendment there because I'm seeing thatthere is historical contribution to climate crisis and I don't think that's what we are intended to see here. I cannot support that language because I don't know if it is really summing up something that Ido not consider actually true. But I seek clarification from my colleague from Venezuela. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa.Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. South Africa would like to support the paragraph and thelanguage by Brazil and Venezuela but we also seek clarity on the phrase climate crisis from Venezuela. We hear this phrase for the 1st time. We want to believe that we understand the sentiment but thelanguage looks new. Along the same lines as Brazil would like to get more information on what it is that they mean. We know that issues of climate change, loss of biodiversity or biological diversity alwaysgo together but the phrase is a bit unfamiliar. Overall we support the formulation as presented byBrazil. The new text introduced by EU, we are still consulting on that. We will allow the discussion to flow while we are consulting and then we may have to revert. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, SouthAfrica. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Venezuela. Thank you,Chair. In response to the recommendations from my colleagues, I also understand that the paragraphis a positive one. So the mention of the climate crisis on the basis of the contribution, it is not directly to be taken to mean that people of African descent are responsible for the climate crisis butrather on the contrary, they contributed and promoted protection of the environment and protection of the climate. So the agreed language should say something like that. English. To the conservationof biological diversity, the protection of climate. We can take out crisis and we are also flexible asregards any other contributions from our Distinguished Colleagues. Thank you. Thank you. I would like togive the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia. Thank you, Chair. I'm just waitingto see how that clarification from the Venezuelan colleague comes out. But we have understood thatthe paragraph is being kept and there was a reservation from the European Union on the basis ofthe need for support from the countries. Colombia would like to be in the list of countries supportingthis paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the permanent representative ofCosta Rica. Thank you, Ambassador. Costa Rica would like to make everyone's lives simpler bywithdrawing what we said before about merging the two paragraphs. I think we have come to that point. Asregards paragraph 1, we support the way that it is proposed by yourself. And we would like to addCosta Rica to the list of countries supporting your proposal as drafted as regards includingthe including the Venezuelan text. I also understand the intention and I believe that we can agree with the intention of seeking to reflect the way that people of African descent have contributed not tothe climate crisis but rather as written now. As it is written now, I'm not sure that we can actually protect the climate as human beings. We can protect the resources, natural resources. So if we aretalking about the protection of natural resources, that would work. But this when we talk about theprotection of climate, I think that is problematic. I just wanted to point to that as food for thought.Thank you. Thank you, excellency. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa. Thank you, Madam Chair. We will try to help here. I think we understand the sentiment as expressedby Venezuela that people of African descent should be protected from the impact of climate change becauseit is not their own making but they are the ones who suffer most comparatively speaking. So maybe theformulation that goes like protection from the impact of climate change. So what Venezuela just introduced,we can just slightly amend it to make the reading flow biological diversity and protection from the impactof climate change. Thank you, Madam. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof Colombia. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Again, I believewe are diverging for what is the purpose of the paragraph. Here we are talking about the contributions. If we want to talk about climate change and how protected these or that people or that population,okay, this is great. Let's formulate a proper paragraph on that. Making that grow from there,I don't see we are going to get to achieve much. Unfortunately, I cannot support for that reason, not because I don't want to protect anyone from the climate change's impact and all but just becausewe are diverging for the objective or the goal of this paragraph which is recognizing the contributions that the African descendants have in different aspects of our life which is in economics, in environment,in scientific knowledge and all. It is just that. If you want to talk about the climate change and how to protect and all, great. Let's do another let's propose another paragraph. Not try to extract fromthere. That's what I'm asking, please. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I would really like to encouragethe Distinguished Delegations of Venezuela and South Africa to read through the whole text so that we seewe really look into the contributions that we are giving if they are aligned to the meaning of theparagraph. Then maybe we will come up with a solution. Pastor Morillo. Thank you. There is no doubtthat we will need to distill and flesh out these issues. In one section, as you have said, on the one hand we have this reference to the recognition of the contributions of people of African descentto this symbiosis between cultural diversity, conservation, protection of the planet. Thatis from 8J from the CBD. It has also been reflected in Article 31 of the declaration on Indigenous Peoples.That's one dimension. The other dimension, and here too the forum has spoken out, is that of climatejustice. My point is that on the one hand, people of African descent has contributors because of their potentials. On the other hand, you have the impact on them as victims. For example, when it comes tothe Caribbean countries, the CID, small island Caribbean states, there is a concern and a special interest in seeing this declaration in line with what is sought by Venezuela to recognize this situationof particular vulnerability that African descendants find themselves located in those geographic regions.That suggests the need for different formulations and different paragraphs. So what we need is to sort of separate the two issues. On the one hand, recognition of the contributions. In other words,there's a global collective conscience, e.g. , that the Amazon is defining when it comes to the survival of the planet and the Indigenous Peoples there in the Amazon. They are crucial to the preservationof the Amazon. For that, there is recognition and a collective awareness. Now we need to take a step further, though, towards recognizing the role of people of African descent, African descendent territories more or less in parallel with the situation of Indigenous Peoples when it comes tothose regions of greatest diversity, the 12 million hectares of biodiversity in the Pacific when it comes to protection of water, et cetera. And on the other hand, I stress how these contributions or howthese territories and how that relationship between and the way that these communities' development in their territories, in their environments, how they contribute to the sustainability of the planet andfinally how also the situation of the climate crisis affects disproportionately those same peoples. Sowe need different formulas. So the forum reserves the opportunity to return to those issues of providing further contributions and for now we invite you because obviously we share the initiative of Venezuela andothers, we urge you to separate these two issues to facilitate understanding and that here in this article we focus on reflecting Article 31 of the declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples and8J of the CBD. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think the logic of this paragraph by that was proposedby the permanent forum is very well understood. What we are now trying to check is the contribution fromVenezuela adding something new into what the paragraph 31 and the suggestion from the permanent forum wastrying to express because they are talking about contribution to the conservation of biological diversity but protection of climate, protection from the impact of climate change, there is nothing newthat is added to what the paragraph 31 and the contribution of the permanent forum was saying.I think this we need to clarify it and then we see if there is something that is not addressed, we try to address them in other paragraphs. I would like to give the floor to the Delegation, Venezuela Delegation.Thank you. With respect to the recommendations of my Distinguished Colleagues we have decidedto leave the paragraph as it was originally but we would urge you to review the document, the reportfrom the group of experts, the working group of experts on people of African descent of the 21stMarch, 21st of March 2021 called environmental justice, climate justice and people of African descent. The findings in that document are in a language that I think the language is pretty spot on and is veryclose to what Venezuela wants to propose in terms of including the importance of people of African defense and their role in combating climate change. So as not to belabor the discussion on the paragraph, we would prefer to leave it as it was originally drafted and move on. Thank you. Thank you. Ifyes, I would like to check with Delegation of South Africa because now Brazil, Venezuela is suggesting that we leave the addition. Are you also agreeable that we keep the paragraph as it was at the beginning?Well, thank you, Chair. We have no objection to that. Okay. May I suggest that we move to if there isno yes, I would like to give the floor to the Delegation of Iran. Very briefly we support thisparagraph as it has been drafted. I thank you. Thank you. I had proposed that we delete thenew paragraph that was proposed by the European Union. But if you suggest that we keep it, we can keep it. But I think it would bring some confusion to people that would be reading this version. BecauseEU has expressed reservation. Let's delete this proposal. Then when we will be going back to a 2nd reading, we will consider the new proposal. Yes? And we move to paragraph number 2. And Ithink there are already Delegations that have expressed their support to paragraph number 2.It reads, let me read it again. States shall recognize the domestic and international histories and heritages and culture and other contributions to societies of people of African descent. States shallalso raise awareness of and take educational measures on the histories, heritages and culture and other contributions to societies of people of African descent. I think EU had also already expressedsupport to this paragraph. And additional comments, inputs to this paragraph are also welcome. I don'tsee any Delegation requesting for the floor. I consider that this paragraph can be, the text of this paragraph can be adopted as it is and would like to request the Secretariat to put it in green.And we will move to paragraph number 3. Paragraph number 3 reads, states shall adopt and implementcomprehensive programs to recognize, disseminate and promote knowledge about the cultures, histories and heritages of people of African descent including but not limited to research and education programs witha view to restoring the dignity of people of African descent. This text was also discussed before. Thesecomments, inputs, proposals, I see no Delegation requesting for the floor. I would like to requestthe Secretariat to highlight it in green. And we move to paragraph number 4. Paragraph number 4 reads,states should ensure that textbooks and other educational materials reflect historical factsaccurately as they relate to past tragedies and atrocities in particular slavery, the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism so as to avoid stereotypes and the distortion ofor falsification of these historical facts which may lead to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobiaand related intolerance including the role of respective countries therein. And this is a new paragraph that has never been discussed before. And we, you have got the source of this paragraph, GeneralSummary Resolution, International Decade, A/RES/69/16, paragraph 12G. Inputs, I see Delegation of Colombiarequesting for the floor. You have the floor. Thank you. We would like to make a suggestion with regardsto the beginning of the text, textbooks and educational materials, it is important to reflect accessibilityto those materials. So in the line 2, after materials we would add Accessibly. Thank you. Thank you. I wouldlike to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like tosupport Colombia's additional concise and precise to that. Thank you. Thank you, Brazil. I give the floorto the Distinguished Delegation of European Union. Madam Chair, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. On paragraph 4, we have no comments. But I had an instruction on paragraph 3. I'm in your hands if you want me to dothat now or we take it at the end of 4? Yes, please, your comments to paragraph number 3 are welcome.We would like to see at the end of the paragraph the word \"restoring\" replaced by \"respecting.\" And the reason is that in our view, when we adopt a UN declaration, it should be a positive, empowering,forward-looking document. And we believe that restoring does not really have that connotation. Sorespecting would make the text more future proof. Yes, Delegation of Ecuador. Thank you, Madam Chair.I want to respond to the Colombian proposal in 4. I want to go on record to say that we supportthe inclusion of \"accessibly.\" Thank you. Thank you. Can the Secretariat go back to paragraph number 3?As there is a change that was suggested by the EU, I would like to still check with Delegations if they are still agreeable that to replace \"restoring\" by \"respecting\" as it is proposed by the Delegationof the European Union. I would only like to get input to this paragraph 1st before we move to paragraph4. Yes, South Africa. Thank you, Chair. Quickly, in response to the proposal by the EU, we propose that we retain both formulations, \"restoring\" and \"respecting.\" We don't see any contradictionthere. So they sit very well if we are to retain both. Thank you, Chair. Thank you. I would like to givethe floor to the Excellency, the representative of Costa Rica. Thank you. I understand the business wasrestoring, but I think technically it is not used because all human beings, we are born with equality and dignity, and in dignity, therefore, I don't think \"restoring\" is the word that we want to see here. SoCosta Rica could support the EU proposal to replace \"restoring\" with \"respecting,\" and then I'll comeback to 4. Thank you, Excellency. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would propose an alternative because I recognize what's beensaid about the connotation of \"restoring,\" \"respecting\" as well. I would propose that this could actually be promoting with the view to promoting the dignity of people of African descent in the same way we are promoting knowledge about cultures, histories, et cetera, that results or it's all being done with theview to promoting the dignity of people of African descent. So that's another option there. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the representative of Colombia. You have the floor. Thank you. Inprinciple, I support the proposal of South Africa, although with a view to making moving forward, we couldalso leave the three terms including the U.S. proposal, but it depends on how the debate goes. Thank you.Delegation of Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to support the proposal made by SouthAfrica. Thank you. Colombia, would you like to take the floor again? I don't see this Colombia's positionproperly reflected. So in principle, we support the use of restoring and respecting the proposal by South Africa, and we would be flexible if we need to make progress. We could also live with promoting,but as it's reflected now, it's as if we were in favor of replacing, and that's not our position.Thank you. We also think that the term restoring has an important dimension, so we support South Africa here. Like Colombia, if it can help us move forward, we could also live with the U.S. proposal promoting.Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of Iran. Thank you, Madam Chair. We believe that this word restoring has crucial importance here, so we support the proposalmade by South Africa to have restoring and respecting both of them. I thank you. Thank you. Egypt.Thank you, Madam Chair. Just echoing support to the South African proposal. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to Venezuela Delegation. We want to also show our support to the proposal made by theSouth African Delegation. Thank you. I see that there's a broad consensus on usingthe two concepts if needed, the three, in fact. Just to echo what was said by the Distinguished Delegation of Iran, obviously the concept of restoring which has been very much developed in international jurisprudenceand doctrine is the crux of the matter and it's extremely important here for the purposes before usin this paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to Distinguished Representative of the European Union, Costa Rica and USA and see if they would be flexible that we keep restoring andrespecting on this paragraph. If not, we will keep the two, the three options as alternatives. Thank you.Costa Rica, you have the floor. Costa Rica is flexible. We can agree to this. Just to say thatI get it. I get it. I realize where we are coming from and what the discussion is about. I do think that to restore something, you need to 1st the dignity 1st needs to be stripped from one but human beings have intrinsic dignity. Now, I get it through the transatlantic slave trade, slavery,colonialism, there was an attempt to strip our dignity. We were stripped of the condition of human beings. But I do it's a more philosophical discussion perhaps to make things more simple, as I said,to make things more sensible. Costa Rica is flexible. We can live with whatever. Thank you. Thank you. United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree completely with what the Costa Rican Ambassador juststated about the idea of losing dignity and then regaining it. That said, I'm happy to drop thepromoting proposal to simplify the discussion. Thanks. Yes, I see the European Union Delegation requestingfor the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. In an effort of showing flexibilityand allowing the work to move forward, I think we will be able to accept the combination of both restoringand respecting. So I agree to put it in green then and if all goes well, I will not have to come backto it. Thank you very much. Yes, I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of theUnited Kingdom. Just to raise our little quibble with shall again. We prefer to see a more neutral wordthan shall. Otherwise, the paragraph looks Yes. Thank you. Maybe I would like to suggest that we start byrespecting and then restoring after if possible. Thank you. Let's move to paragraph number 4. Wehad already collected the number of inputs. Yes. NGO. We are supportive of this paragraph whichbuilds on the programme of activities of the decade and would actually suggest that the followingparagraph in the programme of activities of the decade would also be added to this or immediately after itwhich states should give recognition to the victims and their descendants or through the establishment that is of the transatlantic slavery through the establishment of memorial sites in countriesthat profited from and/or were responsible for slavery, the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism and past tragedies where there is none as well as departure, arrival and relocationpoints and by protecting related cultural sites. So that is what I read out is that paragraph that followsafter this one in the programme of activities and I would suggest that this would be added to this. Youhave the text in the programme of activities which is just following this one. Thank you. I would liketo give the floor to the permanent representative of Costa Rica. Thank you. Just to state that we supportthe language proposed by Colombia on accessibly. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like to givethe floor to Mexico Delegation. Thank you, Chair. Mexico also supports the Colombian proposal. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to ask Excellencies Delegations if you are agreeable with the content of this paragraphtaking into consideration the additions from Colombia and the countries that supported it. I would like to give the floor to the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. I apologize. I didn't realize thatthis paragraph had been added since sort of previous instructions I had received from Washington. So Ididn't have any comments on this. Assuming it is verbatim from ARES 69/16, I think it will be totally fine. As a result, I would request that as we put it in green, we put it in green except for the word \"accessibly.\" It is not that I have any objection to \"accessibly,\" but just to give a chance forcapital to see it, to have some visibility on it. So I won't even put a reservation on it necessarily, but just if we could put in green. And also maintain the citation at the end. I think it is helpful to maintain citations as we go through this process, even as we put things in green so that we can alwaysgo back and see perhaps a bit why we put it in green. It is very helpful. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Iwould like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Iran. But before moving forward, I would like to make a clarification on the previous paragraph, paragraph 6, subparagraph 1. Is itpossible to make on the screen? Paragraph 6, subparagraph 1. Yeah. For this paragraph in whichwe have made a suggestion to include \"or likely resulted to.\" Yes. This one. Okay. Thank you. Asour support was a package, I would like to withdraw the support of the whole paragraph, the name of ourcountry from the support of our whole paragraph. I thank you. Thank you. And you? Thank you, MadamChair. In recognizing, of course, to not delay the discussions, I did want to make a small proposalto add an additional paragraph from the international decade. Again, just for your consideration, if there is no interest, no problem. But in that same listing in paragraph 12, subparagraph D specifically speaks of the role of non-state actors which we believe is an element which could add just a littlebit of extra comprehensiveness to this article. And so the paragraph reads It is for which article?So this is end of Article 6. So to add an additional subparagraph essentially. Or I'm not sure how the numbering is. But the one we are currently on. Yes. So just before that. Yeah. And so this is takenverbatim again from paragraph 12D from the international decade. And it reads States should promote the positive role that political leaders and political parties, leaders of religious communities and the media could further play in fighting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intoleranceby, inter alia, publicly recognizing and respecting the culture, history and heritage of people of African descent. We believe this is a relatively harmless it doesn't add much in terms of substance but it does expand the scope to include the encouragement also of non-state actors to be involved.Thank you. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Brazil.I appreciate the representative of the NGO but I believe we are talking about the Article 7 when we are talking about the contributions, right? Not the 6 or we are really talking about the 6?Sorry. I might have gotten the numbering confused. So having just the paragraph just before it would be the one about textbooks and educational materials? Yes, sorry. It might have been at the end of Article7. My apologies. I believe that can be useful if we can take a look at the text if the Secretariat couldassist us on adding that we just might have a look if it's okay. Thank you. Brazil is suggesting that we have a look at it just now? I believe so, right? They are making a proposal. Thank you. Yes, please.Thank you. In the meantime let's take 5 min break and then we will be having the text on thescreen. Thank you. Excellencies, dear colleagues, we are going to consider Paragraph No. 5 that has beenproposed and supported by Brazil. I would like to invite you to look at it, promote the positive rolethat political leaders and political parties leaders of religious communities and the media could further play in fighting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance by inter aliapublicly recognizing and respecting the culture, history and heritage of people of African descent.I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Costa Rica, permanent representative. Excellency, you have the floor. Thank you, Ambassador. We support thisproposal. Thank you. Yes, we were just checking the beginning of the paragraph if we can harmonizewith what we have got in other paragraphs. States should promote comments, inputs. I will come tothis paragraph, Paragraph No. 5. Egypt Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Egyptsupports the inclusion of this new paragraph. Thank you. Thank you. Brazil. How can I expressthat? Just to make that clear. Brazil, yes, we initially support the idea of having this language but since we are not it is really new language for the declaration. I know it is the verbatim. I alreadyagree. But just to make clear, for this paragraph, since this is the 1st time we are adding that to the declaration, I would kindly ask for us to consider that positively but not put it in greenimmediately. And give our capitals the chance to also take a look. I don't know if I was clear on that. But that's the idea. I wouldn't put that immediately because I want to give the capitals thechance to look at that but might be appropriate to have that there. That's my point. Thank you.Thank you very much. There is no additional inputs. We just keep the paragraph as is and we move to nextparagraph. A new Article. Yes, Article number 8 is on educational systems. And there was a new alternativetitle that was suggested, right, to equal access to education but we agreed that we do not have titles for our Article. Then we go straight to our paragraph number 1 which reads states shall committhemselves to ensuring access to free primary education for all girls and boys and access for adults to lifelong learning and education based on respect for human rights, diversity and tolerancewithout discrimination of any kind. Again a paragraph that we have discussed some time back. I would liketo give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Colombia. Thank you, Chair. A suggestion to bringin the language of STG4 after free in the 2nd line. Free English. Inclusive, equitable and quality.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of South Africa. Thank you very much, Chair. I'm sorry to take you back, Madam Chair, but after paragraph 4, the paragraph we justlooked at, there was a proposal by one participant here. I think it was made in my absence when I stepped out that should form part of the text. I don't know whether I should read it or forward itto the Secretariat for typing. It is quite lengthy. Is it on paragraph 4.5 or an additional paragraph?4. Yes. Just after that paragraph. It is a language that was extracted from the document about theprogram of activities. Sorry. So I'm trying to establish the best way to have it reflected. Either I send it or I read it out. Yes. I just need to be clear if it is an additional paragraph or if it isan additional sentence to the paragraph number 4. Then additional paragraph. That should be locatedafter 4. Yes. Please read it and provide the references so that we can check it on the documentshere. Come again. Repeat. My mic is off. States should give recognition to the victims of thetransatlantic slavery and their descendants through the establishment of memorial sites in countries. Go slowly. That profited from and/or were responsible for slavery. That profited from and/or wereresponsible for slavery, the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade and the colonialism andpast tragedies where there is none, as well as at departure, arrival and relocation points and byprotecting related cultural sites. The sources, the program of activities as contained in the decadeof the people of African descent. Which paragraph? I'll get the paragraph shortly. Yes. We have a newparagraph number 5 that has just been suggested by the Delegation of South Africa. Maybe we wouldconsider it if you have some quick feedback on this suggestion, you are welcome or if you need sometime to reflect on it, we can move to the paragraphs where we were. Yes. United States Delegation, you havethe floor. United States would like to lend its support to this paragraph. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Colombia Delegation.Thank you. We support South Africa proposal. Thank you. Thank you. Brazil Delegation.Thank you, Madam Chair. Brazil can support that initially, but as the if it's agreeable to everybodyin the room, we can keep that still in not in green and give the chance to our captors to take a look at that one, too. Thank you. Thank you. Excellency, permanent representative of Costa Rica, you have thefloor. Thank you. We support the proposal. Thank you to the Delegations that have expressed their supportto the proposal. Venezuela Delegation. Thank you, Madam Chair. We want to support also the proposal madeby South Africa. Thank you. Thank you. Egypt. Thank you, Madam Chair. We also support the proposal bySouth Africa. Thank you. May I suggest that we move to we keep the paragraph like it is and then we moveto our next Article, I think. Yes. We are collecting inputs and comments to Article number 1 of Paragraphnumber 1 of Article number 8. United States Delegation. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. We think that the original wording of this paragraph was correct and it is very much in line with what I have seenin other resolutions of this kind. In particular, the use of quality can be quite vague. So we would actuallyrequest the removal of the new addition in that respect. Thank you. Thank you. Excellency, permanentrepresentative of Costa Rica. Thank you. Just to support the proposal by Colombia based on SDG 4. Thankyou. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to Brazil and then we will have Iran. Yeah. Brazil supportsthe proposal made by Colombia. Thank you. Chair, we support the idea of the paragraph. As you know, we areone of the countries who give the free education to all children who are in our territories. However, withregard to the word diversity, we have the reservation. I thank you. Thank you. I give the floor to SouthAfrica Delegation. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. We have reflected on the paragraph. We can go along withthe proposal by Colombia, Costa Rica and Brazil. We have added the language inclusive and equitable and qualityeducation. The reason being that it is not just numbers when it comes to schooling. It is also about quality andinclusiveness, especially in the African context. We say that education should be accessible to all on an equitable basis but it should also be quality education. I can give examples about South Africa but it is not the time forthat. The point is we support the formulation as proposed by the three Delegations and maybe we could also try to understandbetter the rationale behind the proposal to delete the phrase as proposed by the USA. Maybe there is some logical rationale behindthat. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. Mexico Delegation. Thank you. We support Colombia's proposal regardinginclusive, equitable and quality education. We also want to say that we reject the Iranian proposal to delete diversity after human rights. We would be against deleting it. Thank you. Thank you. Ecuador. Thank you, Chair. In this para, we would like to state our support for the Colombian proposal as the colleague fromSouth Africa said it is not just about guaranteeing education but the need for it to be inclusive, equitable and quality. Furthermore, in that same para, we would ask you to keep the reference to diversity towards the end of the para. Thank you. Thank you, Ecuador. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of the United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. We would support maintaining diversity in thisparagraph. Perhaps the proposal made by the representative of Iran was not so much to delete it but perhaps it was a reservation. I will leave it to them to clarify. To explain on the issue of quality, I know it has come up in many other resolutions and from our perspective and there may be others as well, but from the U.S. perspective, our education system is extremely decentralized. The federal government has relatively little control over education. It isvery much up to the 50 states. So there is a requirement that education be free to all, but when we get into quality, then the question becomes how do we define quality, who then enforces it. If we are ensuring something, we have to be able to define what we are ensuring and we have to be able to actually deliver on what we are ensuring. So we are not in a position to ensure that particular adjective. This has come up several times before. I think I am trading on thepretty solid ground here as I raise this. Thank you. With respect to the proposal by Iran, the word \"diversity,\" Costa Rica wants to keep it, but moreover, it needs to be reflected. To our understanding, the words that are in bold are the proposals made by statesand this was in the text, so it shouldn't be in bold. Okay. And with respect to what USA said, I would recall it is exactly the same form in which SDG 4, it is the exact same wording for SDG 4. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe we would come back to Iran to clarify if they have suggested to have diversity deleted.or if they have made reservation, if there is a difference? Thank you. We are thinkingthat inclusive is a very good word to reach out our goal from this paragraph. However, as the diversity has the other dimensions and it is not very clear for us in whichdimension it will be used after this stage, we keep our reservation on this word. I thank you.Egypt Delegation. Thank you, Madam Chair. First I would like to add my support to the suggestionmade by Colombia on inclusive equitable and quality education. For the proposal made or the reservation made by Delegation of Iran would as a compromise would inclusivity be a good term that would beagreeable to all instead of diversity? Thank you. Thank you. Argentina Delegation, you have the floor.Thank you. We would support Mexico, Ecuador, U.S., Costa Rica to join them in supportingthe term diversity. Diversity is an important term and we would like to keep it in the text. Thank you.Brazil Delegation, you have the floor. Since it was a proposal made after I already agreed on the Colombia'sproposal, then I just want to add Brazil's voice to diversity to be kept in the text. Thank you. Yes.Thank you. European Union Delegation. I think you can add the European Union to the listof Delegations that supports the term diversity. It is the EU motto, united in diversity. Thank you. UnitedStates Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to clarify the issue when it comes to quality while it is in the SDGs, the SDGs are goals that we pursue and promote. The difference here isthat we are seeking to ensure certain things. Whenever we use the term ensure, we have to be careful with what we are committing ourselves to ensuring. We take that wording very seriously which is why we have difficulty accepting quality in this context. If it were to be something else like promoting, we wouldbe able to. It is the mixture of words like ensuring with words like quality. Thank you. European UnionDelegation. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had no specific requests for this paragraph. Listening to the U.S., to be honest, I think from a legal perspective, there is a case to be made here because we shouldcompare this Article basically to the ICESR, the covenant on social economic and cultural rights, which has Article 13 on the right to education and that is the golden standard currently in internationallaw. If you look up Article 13 from the ICESR, it says when it comes to primary education, it usesits compulsory and it should be free. That is where international law currently stands. I fully understand why we would be adding inclusive, equitable and quality, but and also the rest of the paragraph,we do go a bit beyond here what currently exists. Maybe indeed changing ensuring into promoting can solve that issue. For me personally, the EU position is that what we want to avoid is that we would nolonger be defending the universality of human rights by creating specific rights that would only be appliedto one group of people. It is not a problem here because we are clearly saying all girls and boys, so that is universal, but just to flag an issue that I will have to bring up in some of the followingparagraphs. Thank you. Regarding the EU's concerns, I think it is important todiscuss this aspect more because on the one hand, you know, there is talk of it is about recognizing rights, not creating rights, but recognizing rights. That is very important to be noted. Secondly,it is specifically that working on the basis that the recognition that the identities, here we arespeaking of diversity of peoples of African descent. In other words, I stress we need to transcend the view, go beyond the condition of just victims of racial discrimination until we are able to dothat. It is going to be difficult to move forward in drafting and formulating a declaration which could reflect the aspirational goals of people of African descent. We are working on the basis ofrecognizing diversity and the differences in specificities and particularities and singularities of people of our defense which obviously people of African descent have among themselves. Therefore,I stress, I urge the Distinguished Delegation of the EU is to consider looking at things fromthis other dimension, from this different angle with a view, and I'm not referring here to the specific theme that is being addressed right now, but at the very substance of the considerations at stake. Thankyou. Thank you. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegation of Colombia.Thank you, Chair. Please add Colombia to the list of countries who want to keep diversity, 1st of all,and regarding the 1st part of the para, as has already been mentioned, as Colombia said,as was mentioned by the Ambassador of Costa Rica and others, the language from SDG4, I understandthe rationale regarding the SDGs, and we would hope that this half, this 50, and there's this 50-yeardifference, the time that has passed, you know, what was agreed back in the day by states and what the situation now, so with targets and indicators and timeframes, therefore, it's important that we needto move forward and that the progress be reflected generally and that that progress be reflected in this text. Thank you. And that's respect, sorry, to the International Covenant on Economic, Social,Cultural Rights. Thank you. Thank you. I don't see an additional any Member States requesting for thefloor. I would suggest that we keep the text of the paragraph as is and move to next paragraph. I seethe representative of Brazil Delegation have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair. Sorry for taking that longer. I believe that I see the proposal made by the US and European Unionto add promoting but as I after explanation given by our Distinguished Colleague from Colombia, I believe we should keep and give a try to ensure. It's really specific. I mean, we have a goal. We have deadlines.We have specifics on that. So I would suggest that we may retain that and give a try. Thank you.Thank you, Brazil. Can we move to Paragraph No. 2? Paragraph No. 2 of Article 8 reads: States shallensure that quality education is accessible and available in areas where communities of African descent live, particularly in rural and marginalized communities with attention to improving the qualityof public education. And you have the source. Your comments, inputs are welcome. I give the floor to theDistinguished Representative of United States. Thank you, Madam Chair. And for the same reasons explainedin depth earlier, we would request that the term, that the word quality be removed. Otherwise, everythingelse is fine. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to get your yes, United States. Just to make a furtheraddition, it is kind of internally inconsistent to say that we ensure the quality education, that education is quality while at the same time improving the quality. It brings into question what is the definition of quality. Is it something that is attainable or not? If it is already quality, then why do we needto improve the quality of it? So that's sort of central to our concern is I think improving the quality of public education is that part is fine and it is a positive inclusion here. But the quality education phrase at the top is what we have concern with no matter what the context is in which it isused. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have someone to clarify on the quality and quality of publiceducation? For me it is clear, but maybe we would have someone to give it a try. Colombia, you have thefloor. Thank you. Based on what was said for the previous paragraph, we think it is permanent to keepthe same adjectives that we proposed before for this new paragraph. Of course, we are in favor of keepingquality and we would suggest also that before the word \"that\" we add inclusive, equitable, we should ensurethat inclusive, equitable European Union Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'mafraid this is exactly the problem that I was trying to explain previously. Going here is saying that in areas where communities of African descent live, we have to ensure inclusive, equitable and qualityeducation. While the accessor which goes for the entire world, at least although have ratified, only saysthat we need to have compulsory and free primary education, e.g. . There is more than primary education. So the accessor that goes for everyone else doesn't have these adjectives, inclusive,equitable. Here we are introducing them but only for people of African descent. I very much understand, of course, that with this declaration we want to send a strong political message that basically everyoneshould have this kind of education. But that means we need to adapt the language. It could be something, e.g. , states shall ensure that whatever objectives we choose, education is accessible and availableeverywhere including in areas where persons of African descent live, e.g. . Like that, you set it as a general standard and, of course, you learned that this goes also for communities of African descent.Costa Rica, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Ambassador. First thing I want to say is that CostaRica was okay with the language as you introduced it, as drafted. That language is verbatim taken,resolution 69/16, paragraph 69/16, which was a resolution adopted without a vote. Therefore, wethink that the paragraph is good as it is. When doing these drafting exercises, all of us know it can get complex. Sometimes we repeat things. Sometimes not everything is perfect. But the consensus is that wecan get there. I think this last section, yes, it may be repetitive, but I'm sure that the consensus wasreached. Therefore, we don't have a problem with the language as you proposed it. And with respectto the inclusion by Colombia there, we're flexible. We can live with it or not in this paragraph because in any either way in the previous paragraph included and respecting the EU's argument, I would deferto the position because SDG4 does establish it for everyone and that paragraph, it's not drawing a distinction between African descendants and other people. Rather, it's placing emphasis on the need forthis high quality education for people of African descent. So the reality of the world shows thatthe majority and I can speak about my own continent where the majority of descendants in our region,Latin America, they live in communities that don't have the best living conditions. And they liveunder poverty indicators, extreme poverty. In fact, those populations are over represented in extreme poverty indicators and therefore all social services on that basis are of a poorer quality. So ratherthan creating discrimination, it's a matter of complementing the spirit of what is trying to be sought through this declaration. Either way, the other argument is that look, basically, the ICESA is onething. It's law and this is a soft law exercise. This is a declaration. Therefore, I would defer when itcomes to the reading for when it comes to comparing what we are doing here and what's stipulated in the covenant. Thank you. Thank you, Excellency. I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Delegationof Brazil. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm hearing our discussion here at the floor. I think I would preferBrazil would support the text as was originally drafted and since it's based on the internationaldecade, so that would be sufficient for us to have the text as it was drafted and not because I don't valuethe proposal made by Colombia. It's just because I'm trying to avoid some repetition and insistence on theterms. We already from our perspective at least in case of Brazil, we already agreed and supported the ideason the ODS. So that would be my case. And giving the proper attention to the idea of accessibility andavailability, that would be my point here to keeping the text as was originally drafted because of that,because we already mentioned that and not taking quality here and there. The point made by United States would make some sense, but I see that we are also saying improving the quality of public education incase of Brazil, we do have both systems, the private and the public system. So we are sticking to a state'scommitment and all and highlighting the public education. So I think there's value also to say quality of publiceducation and keeping the 1st there. That's the whole point. Thank you. Thank you. MexicoDelegation. Thank you, Chair. We agree with the Colombian comments on keeping and moving forward inthe language on education in keeping with SDG 4. So we support the proposal. Thank you. Thank you,Excellency, permanent representative of Costa Rica. Thank you. Just to clarify that Costa Rica supportsthe language drafted from the resolutions of 69/16 on the proposal of Colombia and equality. We believethat is necessary. These adjectives were included, but we should perhaps put that at the end of the text.Cuba Delegation. Thank you, Excellency. Thank you, Chair. We have moved a bit beyond the debate,but we would agree with the proposal by Colombia on the language of SDG 4 with these adjectives andthe language used in the 2030 Agenda. That is a universal document where states commit to complyingand what we need to have is something that follows up a resolution 69/16. So we believe that this isperhaps more complete and ambitious. We share the EU's opinion regarding broadening this to all personsfocusing on people of African descent because as we have said in previous paragraphs, this is a specific declaration on persons of African descent. It is not a general text on the right to education.Therefore, we would prefer in this 2nd part of the paragraph not saying everywhere including butrather keeping it as it was proposed originally by the Secretariat and on the statements bycertain Delegations that it is repetitive when it speaks of improving the quality of education. There is a specific nature of public education which requires attention from because it needs additionalbudgeting to protect that type of education which is generally free while private education is different because of the income it receives in many countries of higher quality. That is not the case of Cuba whereall education is 100% universal and free but if we are thinking about public education, that is generally more vulnerable and therefore we should keep that focus on it because Governments need to pay moreattention to that type of education. Thank you.Thank you. I would like to give the floor to Mexico Delegation. Yes, I do not see any request for thefloor or input from Delegation. Maybe we would pass and go to paragraph number 3 of Article 8. Paragraphnumber 3 reads: States shall ensure access to education and promote access to new technologies that will offer Africans and people of African descent in particular women and children adequate resources for education, logical development and long distance learning in local communities. States are also urgedto promote and accurate inclusion of the histories and contributions of Africans and people of Africandescent in the education curriculum. The text was discussed previously. Input comments? The floor isyours. I see European Union Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you very much. I have a similarproposal on this paragraph again to make sure that the universality of human rights is respected.And after the words new technologies that would offer, we would like to insert all persons, includingpeople of African descent. Thank you. Any additional comments, inputs? Yes, some request for clarificationfrom European Union Delegation. They suggested wording would replace which part of the paragraph?I think it would replace the wording Africans and people of African descent but then the phrase would just continue in particular women and children remains. So all persons including people of Africandescent in particular women and children, that's how it would then read. Thank you. Yes, United StatesDelegation, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. We would support that proposal as well.Any other Delegation requesting or do react to the inputs and additions from EU and U.S. Delegations?Yes. Do you allow, is this an agreeable text that we should adopt? Brazil Delegation, you have the floor.I think it's interesting that language has been introduced all persons including people of African descent and since we are dealing with the declaration of African descent, Brazil would prefer retainingthe text as it was drafted. Thank you. And if I may, since we would suggest also to have to keep theto have the text in green and just highlighting that area and give further consideration to all persons including people of African descent, that would be something. But in our case, just because all therest of the paragraphs seems to be agreeable. Thank you. Venezuela Delegation, you have the floor.Thank you, Chair. We support Brazil's position on keeping the original text and in the, thank you.Thank you. Algeria. Thank you, Chair. We support Brazil's to keep the text as is.Its original formulation and drafting. Thank you. Thank you. Excellency, permanent representative of Costa Rica.Thank you. I apologize. I would like to know where the text comes from before saying what our position is.Thank you. Thank you. United States Delegation. Thank you, Madam Chair. Looking at this further, I have noticed that this is the only time in the entire text where Africans are referred to in termsof something being insured or promoted. It's 90 something percent of this resolution is people of African descent. There are some places in which Africans and people of African descent are referred to, particularly in reference to enslavement, et cetera, but that would be a reason I think why weshould at a minimum have this focus on people of African descent, so would offer people of African descent as opposed to would offer Africans and people of African descent to maintain some internalconsistency in this declaration. Thanks. Thank you. South Africa Delegation. Thank you very much,Madam Chair. South Africa would support the original formulation that says Africans and people of African descent. This whole exercise is about people of African descent, so we need to place emphasis onthat. Thank you. And you? Yes, the wording from the DDPA is in that paragraphs that established theWorking Group, et cetera, is Africans and people of African descent in the diaspora because that'swhat it is about, of course. So that's how it should be understood according to the DDPA. Thankyou. Cuba Delegation, you have the floor. Thank you, Chair. Just a comment. It would be really usefulto define what terminology is going to be used throughout the document. It could be useful to have Africans in certain paragraphs and in others people of African descent, but it might be important to haveconsensus on the terminology that's going to be used, whether it's that that comes from the Durban Declaration Programme of Action, whether certain states have another opinion, but Africans and peopleof African descent is more inclusive in my opinion. At any rate, we need to see what we're going to do throughout the text because we have not, as far as I recall, used this particular wording of Africansanywhere else. We could agree on including it, but it would be a good thing to take a decision on that so that we can be consistent throughout the text. Thank you. Thank you. You have the floor.Thank you. As the U.S. and Cuba have pointed out, I would also like to know where this wording comesfrom because it seems to me we're not being consistent with the rest of the text and as I see it, Africansis too broad a term, but we're in the hands of the African states present in this room, but it's perhapsslightly beyond the focus of what we see here. I would agree that if the DDPA speaks of African personsin the diaspora, that could make more sense than Africans in the absolute, but it would be really useful to know where the language comes from so that we can take a decision on that and be consistent.Thank you. Thank you. Venezuela Delegation. Thank you, Chair. I wouldn't like to drag out the debate,but to mention to my colleagues that the terminology used here does appear throughout the text at least 10 times, but if we have not been totally consistent or agreed on that language, so it would be usefulto go through again subsequently and see whether we actually need to be consistent in that usagethroughout the text or simply follow the draft. Thank you. Thank you, Venezuela. Brazil Delegation.Thank you, Madam Chair. I think I'm really grateful that Cuba and Venezuela raised that point and also Costa Rica raised the point of some having the whole text revised concerningthe use of that expression, those expressions, Africans and people of African descent. I think we should take care. My main concern was mostly of the use of this new language proposed by the EuropeanUnion, all persons including and that would be my concern for this paragraph and since it also appeared in the previous one. But yes, we should bear in mind to have a deep revision and considerationon the use of the terms Africans and people of African descent and how this is going to be appliedto the whole text. Thank you. Mexico Delegation. Thank you, Chair. We also share the comments made bycolleagues, namely that we need to try to be consistent in terminology throughout the text and also take into account that this is the declaration on the rights of people of African descent. I also wouldlike to make a more general comment as the colleagues said in terms of food for thought. For example,this paragraph that we are looking at, this article that we are on now, education, starts all of itsparagraphs, the reference to things that states should do, that they should guarantee access to educationand so on. It doesn't mention the corresponding rights of people of African descent along the lines that people of African descent have the right to a quality education, e.g. . We only have 10minutes to the end of the meeting. So I think that is something that perhaps could be considered for the future, for future negotiations on the text. This is a declaration on rights and we need totry to align the language with rights and link those rights, of course, with the obligations of states.Thank you. We still have the suggestion by Brazil to have the rest of the paragraph highlighted in greenand with the part with inputs from the European Union. Second, on being consistent throughout the wholetext on the use of African and people of African descent, I would like to maybe suggest that this is a task that will be done during the 2nd reading because it is not only on that one. I think consistencywill be also looked at on other aspects. Remember the use of and everything. But for the discussion on this paragraph, I would like to suggest that to look into the proposal by Brazil to highlight the rest ofthe paragraph in green and remain with the use of Africans and people of African descent or plus the suggestion by the European Union Delegation that refers to all persons including people of Africandescent. I see the Parliamentary representative of Costa Rica, you have the floor. Thank you, Ambassador.We would agree with the proposal to place the paragraph, almost all of it in green, except startingwith Africans and the EU proposal. So these considerations can remain for the 2nd reading. Iwould like to remind colleagues in the room, I think it is important to in Resolution 69/16, the reference to the declaration, I would like to read it in English. Measures to further promote and protect the humanrights of people of African descent as enshrined in international human rights instruments including through the elaboration of a draft United Nations declaration on the promotion and full respect of human rights of people of African descent. That is the mandate that we are fulfilling and the language Ithink is clear. I think we need to be consistent with that resolution. Thank you. As I do not see anyother Delegations on the floor, maybe we would request the Secretariat to highlight the paragraph in green,except on the use of the terminology Africans and people of African descent versus the suggestion byEU and U.S. Delegation. Excellencies, dear colleagues, we remain with 4 min and I think it will bethe end of our intersessional meeting that we had on two days. I don't want to use it, the 4 minby starting another paragraph, but I would like rather to use this time to thank you very much for your participation,for your presence and request that the work that we have been doing doesn't stop here. Please go back, look into the text so that maybe by next time when we are meeting in May we will go faster looking tothe consistency of what we have been discussing. We are still doing the 1st reading, but if there is work, preparatory workthat is done before the session, I think it helps all of us to move fast on the work we do. Before closing, I would like to check ifthere would be any Delegation that would have some final remarks before we close the meeting. I see Cuba Delegation.Thank you, Chair. I would like to congratulate you on the excellent guidance of our work during this sessionand the previous one and look forward to the next session. I propose that at the start of the session we give an hour or soto taking a decision or discussing certain technical terminology pertaining to this issue of Africans and people of African descent,because that might be the way to resume this. We can't finish it now, but perhaps we could look at that and achieve some form ofconsensus on what the terminology is going to be used. I'm not an expert on this, but I understand that among people of Africandescent there can be people who are also Africans. We need to understand what the added value is of having both terms. Perhaps we could agreethat we would start the next session with an hour or 45 minutes to address this issue and take a decision on consistent language. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, would like to also thank you on behalf of the permanent forum for your excellent work, your very astute leadership of the group. I'd also like to support what was recommended by the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba. It's definitely important to distill certain concepts and identifysome concepts which need to be made uniform in the text. Similarly, I want to take the opportunity to state that having taken note of the sense of the proposal made by Costa Rica and the U.S., when we speak of restoration of human dignity, certainly following that narrative of clarifying conceptualaspects, these are themes that require subsequent reflection, too. Thank you very much again, Madam Chair. I wish you a good weekend. Thank you. South Africa Delegation, you have the floor. Madam Chair, I wish to join other Delegations in extending the word of credit to you for the stewardship of the process, the leadership that you have demonstrated since we started yesterday. I would like to make a proposal ofsuggestion that in our regular session in May, time be allowed for Delegations or groups at least to make statements at the opening of the session, maybe the 1st hour, so that we can pronounce ourselves and set the tone. That's our humble proposal. Thank you, Chair. Thank you very much, Excellencies, representatives of different Member States. I think your suggestions are well noted. The Secretariat is taking good noteof that and will be taking into consideration during next session in May. I would like to thank you very much. I would like to thank the interpreters and I wish you a very nice weekend to all of you. Goodbye."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good morning, Secretariat General of UNCTAD, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to open the 75th Executive Session of the Trade and Development Board. It is my pleasure to welcome SG Greenspan and all Delegations to this session and I very much look forward to an engaging discussion on the important agenda we have before us. Allow me also to congratulate the Delegations ofCongratulations to my colleagues in the room who celebrate the Lunar New Year of Dragon 2024. Let us proceed with Item number 1, adoption of the agenda. Theprofessional agenda has been circulated in document TD/B/EX/75/1. My propose that theboard adopt the professional agenda, I see no objection. It is so decided. A program has been circulated to Member States last Monday. As you can see in the program thisthis morning we will have the opening remarks by the Secretary General of UNCTAD which will also cover item 7. And after that the board will consider item number 3, the Least DevelopedCountries Report 2023. And this afternoon we will consider report of subsidiary bodies as well as item number 9 on institutional organizational administrative and related matters. On Tuesdaymorning the board will take up item number 2, interdependence and development strategies in a globalized world. Tuesday afternoon we will consider item number 4 concerning the reporton international trade outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2023. On Wednesday morning there will be no formalization of the board. This time is allocated for consultation amongregional groups and coordinators with a view of reaching agreement on draft agreed conclusion for LDCs and the topic that guiding question of the next session of the IGE on financingfor development. The closing plenary will take place on Wednesday, the 14th of February at 3:00 p.m. in this very room. Concerning the outcome under item 3, the Least Developed CountriesReport 2023, the board is expected to adopt agreed conclusion. A draft was circulated to regional groups to facilitate the consultation. Under item number 8, the board will be invited to considerthe proposal for convening the 76th Executive Session of the board and should they agree to the proposal, approve its professional agenda. And I hope this Organization of Works is agreeableto all. I see no objection. So it is so decided. I now have the great pleasure to invite Ms. Rebecca Greenspan, Secretary General of UNCTAD, to make some opening remarks. Madam Greenspan, you havethe floor. Thank you so much, Mr. President, Ambassador Fabrian, your Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends. It is my great pleasure to be here once more.Barely two weeks since we last met during the closing session of one of the longest trade and development boards in recent history. I want to thank you all again for your commitmentand engagement in the closing of the previous TDB and especially for your willingness to reach common ground on even the most difficult issues. Thank you. Thanks to you, our board has beenable to deliver once more on its mandate. On that note, let me add I am very happy to see you this often. Partly because I honestly believe that with each conversation we forge and fortifytrust and inject meaning and understanding to this forum. I will divide my remarks in two parts today. First, I will speak briefly about the work we have done now that I am halfwaythrough my four-year term. Second, I will share thoughts on what comes next with special reference to the 60th anniversary. I will start with the work done. When I arrived in September 2021,I came with a clear mandate of reform with the hope of delivering a more agile, more transparent and more impactful institution. But at the same time, I said very clearly that I didn't believein a shock therapy or type of reform. This institution has great staff and a great history. It has great expertise, deep analysis, statistical power, knowledge and capacities that merit respectand praise. On those strengths, we needed to build the future and that's been my goal. As you might remember, barely a few months in, I brought about a ten-point plan of restructuringwhich kick started our reform cycle going forward. I won't go one by one but I want to highlight some of the most notable results from this process. A key point in the ten-point plan was the creationof a standalone statistics service, a team which is now producing important results in key areas for UNCTAD and the UN as a whole, such as our work on beyond GDP which will be centralto the summit of the future. Another point was the creation of different inter-divisional working groups on gender, on climate, on the WTO among others. These groups have played a criticalrole in producing very relevant research laying the groundwork for our global crisis response group and G20 teams which have also achieved remarkable success. Some of our recent researchhas influenced and informed important UN processes in New York and have been picked up by the Secretary-General himself on many occasions and by several country leaders also. This is real influence by wayof team work that breaks silos and research that meets the most rigorous standards. Here on the subject of our inter-divisional working groups I want to highlight that within the genderworking group a recent expert consultation was convened to develop a strategic plan on trade and gender. This gathering brought together 17 experts from diverse backgrounds, academia,policy making, the private sector and international institutions. This consultation shed light on research gaps and policy making needs in the realm of trade and gender offering a plethoraof ideas and proposals for this house to carry on. This consultation exemplifies our commitment to integrating gender perspective into our work underscoring the rich pool of gender expertisewe possess in our collective effort to make our contribution in this field as substantive as possible helping to close the unacceptable gaps women around the world face. Another importantpriority was the preparation and execution of a new technical cooperation strategy which has now been reviewed and launched. A priority that we have been less able to deliver on isto have a fundraising capacity at the OSG, something that has been frustrated by the budget freeze. But I hope we will finally be able to hire a person in the next three months. An importantrequest you have made is to launch a detailed annual report. We delivered one last year. And the next report will be launched this April. Another priority in our plan has been to bolsterour publications committee to increase the peer review and quality of our research. This isan area where I have devoted much of my own personal time. Meeting with the research teams, often working on the reports myself line by line, chapter by chapter. This has been a very valuableexperience for me as I have learned a great deal from my amazing colleagues here at ANCTAD. As I said when I arrived I did not bring the expertise to ANCTAD. The expertise was already here. AllI am trying to do is ensure that this expertise is more synergetic, more coherent, more impactful. I know how much all of you value this particular point. So you can be assured that we will continue working very hard to deliver. Another key point you ambassadors have also insisted upon is tobring ANCTAD closer to you and to make our work ever more transparent. This commitment is also deeply personal to me. We have revamped the Delegate's portal and my own agenda and statementsare regularly published at the ANCTAD website and I have made sure to always have time available to meet each of you as often as possible. I fundamentally believe that trust is something that can always be built upon no matter the geopolitics. This is why I have kept my doorsopen knowing that this is my best way to contribute to revitalizing our conference. The last DDB we just closed is perhaps testament that we are on the right path here. Another importantpoint and another of your most frequent requests has been to deliver on the bridge down covenant through result based management. Here I am happy to say as announced at the working partylast December that we will organize a briefing to the membership in April to present our progress so far in ANCTAD's RBM. From the beginning of this exercise my objective has been to providethis house with a complimentary management tool for comprehensive analysis and results monitoring. In particular in relation to the implementation of the bridge down covenant for transformations.I look forward to sharing more on this with you in April. Lastly a key priority of our strategy and one which I am very excited about has been our work on the communication front. I willsay today what I said two years ago. Effective communications is part of our mandate delivery.It is not a PR campaign. On this front the results speak for themselves. Last year we broke the million person readership number in our publications downloads. Our website has received more than8 million visitors and we have closed to 1 million followers in social media from less than half a million two years ago. But there is one special further announcement I want to maketoday. I am pleased to share that in the 60th anniversary year ANCTAD will launch a rebranding to better communicate our mission to enhance our visibility and to expand our global voice.Following an extensive year long brand audit we identified a critical need to ensure ANCTAD had a strategically managed brand. The audit revealed a concerning level of fragmentation with over 31different logos in circulation, 31. 18 different types of visuals for meetings. 32 different designs for publications. 29 websites and little name recognition or understanding what ANCTAD stands foramong key audiences. All of which indicated a lack of a cohesive strategy. As we commemorate our 60th anniversary this year we are proud to share with you a new revitalized branding for ANCTAD that builds onour heritage, looks to the future and underlines the essence of our mission. It is UN Trade and Development, ANCTAD. Maybe we can put it on the screen? Okay. Here it is. This rebranding initiative isnot a cosmetic change but a strategic realignment to strengthen our organization's position as a leading global voice in trade and development. And we have this in the different languages if you want to see itor we have also in terms of the publications how this will look. Maybe we can see the yeah. So we havethe different languages there. And there was another one, Amalia, I think. Yeah. So these are in different colors so the different divisions for their publications can use the same logo but it will identifythe different reports. It builds on our heritage and integrates the ANCTAD acronym too. Our name will remain the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This will not change but the new logowill reinforce our commitment to our mission and to the UN, retaining the UN emblem. And it clearly explains what we do, trade and development. In a few weeks we are excited to confirm that you will startto see our new branding across various touch points including our website, social media channels and reports. I believe that now as we start our 60th anniversary celebration is the best time to dothis. Our expert team will be happy to answer any questions or provide further information. As always your continued support and engagement will be very important. Excellencies, with this let me verybriefly touch on the future. I am very happy to say we now have a date for our 60th anniversary celebrations, the 12th and 13th of June. And now we also have a theme, charting a new development course in a changingworld. Charting a new development course in a changing world. The anniversary aims to reflect with an eye on the future on the transformative journey of ANCTAD's past six decades, a period that has been significantthat has seen significant shifts in the global economic landscape including the rise of the global south, the digital revolution and significant strides in reducing poverty and hunger. Achievements, however,that have been shadowed by growing inequalities, environmental disasters and a pressing need for a revamped system of global governance and finance. Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic our worldhas lost its capacity to recover sustainably and inclusively from crisis and has fallen out of track. As a result, key development indicators including extreme poverty, the human development index and foodinsecurity have been in dangerous regrets in the last four years. ANCTAD has been at the vanguard of the changes of the last six decades advocating for a globalization that leaves no one behind. The 60thanniversary presents a unique opportunity to forge new directions in a world that is increasingly interconnected and multipolar. Our mission is to deliver a new ANCTAD for a new world. The event will conveneglobal leaders, thinkers and stakeholders across our thematic segments. The UNSG and other heads of state and government have already confirmed their participation. We very much look forward to celebratingthis milestone together. Lastly, our hope is to also use the 60th anniversary as a springboard to kick start the discussions that will inform our 16th ministerial in 2025. We are now in the finalstages of choosing our host country which we hope to be able to announce to you soon. Your excellencies,ANCTAD starts a very important anniversary year with two years of hard work that are bearing fruit. Weare now also in the final stages of the process to choose the three division directors post that we will allocate this year, a process in which I am ensuring both gender equality and geographic balance. Pleaselet me assure you that I know how important this process is to all of you and that we are doing our very best to be able to fill this post as soon as possible despite the very real constraints we arefacing due to the liquidity crisis of the UN. Our hope is to have our three new divisional directors at their post before this summer. To close as we look forward, let me emphasize the power of our collectiveendeavor. The journey we have embarked upon together at ANCTAD is more than just reform. It is about reimagining and revitalizing our role in the global landscape. The challenges we face are daunting,but our resolve to address them is unwavering. Our work on gender, climate change, trade technology, investment and development finance among others is not just responding to the goals of today, but isproactive, setting the agenda for a sustainable and equitable future. This has been accompanied by a strong effort to respond to the needs of Africa, the LDCs and CITs that we have done with you together.The road ahead is filled with opportunities to deepen our impact and has our agility and amplify our voice in the global discourse on trade and development. As we celebrate our 60th anniversary, let us rememberthat we are not just marking six dates of history. We are laying the groundwork for the future, a future where trade and development are accessible and beneficial to all where no one is left behind.I thank you for your trust, your collaboration and your commitment. Together we are achieving and can achieve remarkable things. Let's make this 60th anniversary year a turning point, a new phase inour goal to elevate the purpose and impact of this great house. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Madam Secretary General. Thank you for the inspiring yet very informative remark as is always. AsUNCTAD approaches its 60th anniversary 2024, we stand ready for sure to support UNCTAD to be a beacon of hope and catalyst for a change fostering growth and development across the globe. We support UNCTAD'swork in contributing to other multilateral process including the upcoming Summit of the Future this year. Rest assured of our support in making UNCTAD 16 not only a successful convening of theconference but also the one resulting an impactful outcome for the Developing Countries. We will now take up item number 3, the Least Developed Countries Report 2023. Under this item, I have the pleasureto invite Mr. Junior Davis, head policy analysis and research branch division for Africa, Least DevelopedCountries and special programs to present the LDC report 2023. Mr. Davis, you have the floor. Goodmorning, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, ladies and gentlemen. The 2023 edition of the Least Developed Countries Report is entitled Crisis Resilient Development Finance. The report is timely and bringsto center stage the critical issues of fiscal space, debt and climate finance in the LDCs. In my remarks, I would like to focus on three key messages of the report. First, as a consequence of multiple crises,many LDCs today are not able to generate the fiscal space they need to set out on a resilient path to SDGs without the support of the international community. Second, the specific and often disproportionatechallenges and risks faced by the LDCs call for solutions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of these countries. And 3rd , there is now urgency but also an opportunity to tackle reforms in keyareas such as climate finance and the international financial architecture. The LDC report 2023 comes at a time when the dust is starting to settle after the COVID-19 shock and its huge impact on the economiesand populations of LDCs is becoming clear. Estimations presented in the report indicate that in 2023, the combined GDP of the LDCs was 10% below the level it would have reached if their prepandemic growthtrend had been sustained. Consequently, in 2023, almost 15 million more people in the LDCs were living in extreme poverty than in 2019. At the same time, LDCs are hit with the fallout of geopoliticaltensions and the consequences of the climate crisis which is taking a disproportionate toll on these countries. For example, the report highlights that in 2021, among the 20 most vulnerable countries tothe impacts of climate change, 17 were LDCs. Another manifestation of crises is debt. That has reachedunsustainable levels in many LDCs. As of the 30th of November, 2023, six LDCs were in debt distress and 15 more were classified as facing a high risk of debt distress. The debt crisis is not only a financialissue but has immediate, direct and significant consequences for socioeconomic conditions in the LDCs. Moreover, debt service obligations are squeezing out important investments in health and educationand other key areas of the SDGs. The analysis of the LDC report show that these interlocked challenges block the way back to a sustained growth and development path for the LDCs. Based on this diagnosis,the report looks at potential solutions for crisis resilient finance for the LDCs. First, there is the issue of external aid in which LDCs remain highly dependent. The figures presented in the report show that ODA levels continue to fall behind targets and commitments made by developed countries. This isan alarming trend and given the lack of fiscal space in LDCs and the short time remaining to achievethe SDGs, it is certainly troubling. In this context, the report argues that improvements are needed in each of the three key dimensions of ODA, quantity, quality and access. The same is the case for climate finance which has also fallen behind commitments and even farther behind the actualneeds of LDCs. Reflecting the vulnerabilities of LDCs, the report proposes an LDC specific climate finance goal in the spirit of the LDC specific ODA targets. Furthermore, the report shows that LDCs needmore access to more grants for climate adaptation which is their clear priority. In addition, asdisasters intensify and rising sea levels threaten the livelihoods of millions living in LDCs, the cost of climate related loss and damage are also on the rise. Here the report argues that the new loss and damage fund could play a pivotal role for LDCs but only if adequate additional funds are made availableprimarily in the form of grants and if transaction costs and lead times are kept at a minimum and disbursement starts quickly. The operationalization of the loss and development fund at COP28 was an important step. Now it is crucial to achieve concrete results in terms of payments to and disbursementsfrom the fund to make it credible and useful for the LDCs and other developing countries. Second, there is a need to find a lasting solution to the debt crisis in LDCs. The report argues that a solution must combine debt relief, immediate injection of liquidity as well as measures that prevent debtcrisis from occurring in the future. And finally, tackling an entirely novel question, the report examines if and how central banks and LDCs should use climate mitigation and adaptation tools. So to close with some good news, the LDC report shows that there are opportunities to break the deadlockand achieve crisis resilient development in the LDCs but it is urgent to take action now. So at this juncture, I would like to hand over to my colleague, Ms. Matvobi Reber who will just take youthrough some more of the detail in the report. Thank you, Junior. Excellencies, Delegates, ladies andgentlemen, I will go through the report fairly rapidly as you have heard the comments from thechief of the branch. The report, the LDC report 2024 basically takes off from the findings of the LDC report 2020/19 which looked at the issue of the present and future external development finance,old dependence, new challenges. Well, the challenges have only grown since 2019. The findings of the 2024 report are that the LDCs development has huge associated costs. These costs are not only largebut they are growing day by day. The 2nd main finding is that the shortcomings of the international financial system hinder the LDCs. And this leads us to the 3rd main finding which is reforms aretherefore needed to break the deadlock over LDC development finance. Looking at the issue of thehuge associated costs, I'm going to present to you here a series of statistics which demonstrate how big a problem this is, what a disaster it really is at this point. The doubling the share of industry inGDP which is a target from the LDC programs of action, successive programs of action and also SDG 9.2implies an annual investment of 1 trillion in each in these LDCs. This means three times current levels of fixed investment and is equivalent to an annual rate of economic growth of 20%. Clearly this is unrealisticfor the LDCs. The social objectives of the SDGs themselves imply spending levels which correspondto 45% of GDP. This again emphasizes how unrealistic this kind of financing and funding of the development effortin LDCs is beginning to look like. Now, what has brought LDCs to this point? Well, it's a longstanding problem but we have also had the multiple crises which have come back to back in the last three years. Wehave COVID-19. We have the slowing world economy as a consequence. We have rising global inflation which has come with the various disruptions to the supply chains that are a consequence of the variousdisruptions which are happening on the level of the global economy. We also have the geopolitical tensions and wars that have been mentioned by the previous speaker. And, of course, we have theacceleration of the climate crisis which is going to be with us for some time yet. What this means effectively for the LDCs is shrinking fiscal space. LDCs currently spend two times on debt service than on health.LDCs are forced to cover all shortfalls in development finance and shrinkages in fiscal space through external financing. And what is the consequence of that? Well, basically it is debttraps. Per capita income in 2023 in LDCs was 16% below the growth target. The debt trap, how does itmanifest? Well, LDC debt service has increased 37% to 27 billion in 2021. The median public and publiclyguaranteed debt to GDP ratio went up from 48.5% which was already a crisis in 2019 to 55.4% in 2022. This is thehighest level since 2005. Almost half of LDCs were in debt distress or high risk thereof when this reportwas in preparation. In summary, what is happening is that progress towards the SDGs and the low carboneconomy has been derailed. Coming to look at the shortcomings, what are the shortcomings we keep speaking about of the international financial system? In short, the international financial system is notfit for purpose when it comes to the LDCs. It simply cannot mobilize the kind of development financethat the LDCs require. Donor countries have consistently failed to fulfill their commitments onaid. For a very long time now only a handful of donor countries have met internationally agreed targetsfor ODA. There is a sharp drift from the traditional ODA in grants to loans which raises external debt forthe LDCs. ODA is in any case susceptible to economic and political conditionalities. This is compoundedby the fact that as detailed in the LDCR 2019, the development finance landscape for LDCs has becomeincreasingly complex. It comes with high transaction and administrative costs. In summary, it is inadequatein predictability, quantity and quality as explained by the previous speaker. Further shortcomings of the international financial system that we are seeing currently is that private financing is often shortterm and very expensive. It is too expensive for the LDCs. This is a problem because development by itsnature is dependent on long-term patient capital. The financial system is simply not delivering it. The voice of the LDCs critically is not heated when it comes to making decisions on the international financialsystem. So we also have a problem of inclusivity and voice at the level of the international financial system. Climate finance is no different from the traditional ODA and development finance and theprivate finance that is coming. It is insufficient. It is too complex. It is fragmented and it is opaque. Soagain, increasing the administrative costs and transaction costs for the LDCs. Now, what the reportis going to propose or has proposed to deal with the current issue is AAA guiding principles for developmentand climate financing for LDCs. The AAA is amount appropriateness and access. Amount basically refers to the issue of quantity. The amounts of development finance that should be accessible to LDCs shouldbe commensurate with their needs for sustainable development and structural transformation. It also needs to be appropriate and this speaks to the issue of quality. It should prioritize grants, long-termand low-cost modalities of aid. When it comes to access, it has to be simple and transparent with minimum conditionalities and appropriate debt workout mechanisms in place. An adapted appropriatelyadapted international financial system provides long-term concessional financing which comes mainly from public sources. This is what the report is proposing. This means ODA has to be increasedand we know from the calculations that have been done in the preparation of the report that had donorsmet the commitments that they have already signed up to at the international level, aid to the LDCs couldhave doubled. We know also that an appropriate and adapted financial system needs multilateraldevelopment banks to do more to unlock cheaper sources of financing for the LDCs. We know from the G20 initiative that it is possible for the multilateral development banks to unlock morethan 700 billion additional financing to LDCs without affecting their AAA ratings. The internationalfinancial system which is appropriately adapted to the specific needs of LDCs will be one ifthere are also appropriate management, there is appropriate management of external debt. That means more transparent contracts and debt work out mechanisms. LDCs, I repeat, have to have a say inimportant decisions on the international financial system. The loss and damage fund launched at COP 28 could be a game changer for LDCs. However, it will only meet this condition if funds are sufficientand accessible and LDCs are among the main beneficiaries. An appropriate climate financesystem also adopts an LDC specific climate finance target and is additional to traditional official development finance. Now, at the domestic level, LDCs could look at the possibilities of central banksplaying a role in channeling financial flows towards low carbon transition. However, there are certaininstitutional conditions that must be in place before the tradeoffs that are inherent in engaging inclimate central banking can be dealt with appropriately. So central banks will have to have the legal mandateto engage in climate central banking. But crucially, their actions need to be guided by or they should complement industrial policies to foster green structural transformation and they should betailored to country specific economic and social context for the challenges in terms of tradeoffs that will be thrown up by climate central banking will very much be related to the conditions,the starting conditions in each LDC. I will stop here. Thank you very much for your attention.Thank you very much. I would like to thank both speakers for presenting us with the report. Now the floor is open for the statement. The list of inscribed speakers was circulated on Friday, on the 9th of February. For those who registered, we guarantee that they will be able to take the floor andthose who request the floor in the room will be able to deliver their statement subject to the time constraint. Now I would like to look at my list of speakers. I would like to give the floor to Distinguished Delegates of European Union on behalf of its Member States. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. Dear Secretary General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. We wish to thank the Secretariat for preparing the 2023 LDC report. The document makes several interesting and relevant points.The presented data sometimes raises curious questions, for instance, how some LDCs appear to be spending considerably on their SDG needs, yet are experiencing a decline in their PCI or how a handful of countries accounting for more than half of LDCs public and publicly guaranteed debt are not indebt distress, contrary to some other LDCs with lower debt values. These examples indicate that drawing general conclusions may lead us to suboptimal or even potentially misleading recommendations and, therefore, making a more granular country-specific analysis a necessity. In light of these points, wewould like to highlight two key messages we take from the report, namely, the importance of domestic policies and the required synergetic support by the entire international community, by developed and by other developing countries. For many of the reasons elaborated in the report, the authorities and LDCsare faced by inherently limited fiscal space, at times confronted by seemingly impossible internal policy trade-offs with exogenous shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic and the global impact of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine making matters worse as highlighted by the report. ODA, MultilateralDevelopment Bank, South-South Cooperation, FDI, these are all indispensable for bringing in additional resources and supporting national SDG objectives in LDCs. But as the report notes and in line with Addis Ababa Action Agenda, public policies and mobilization and effective use of domestic resourcesare vital to our common pursuit of sustainable development. Reform of regulatory environments, including domestic resource mobilization, good governance and transparency should be encouraged to crowd in private investment and promote open rule-based trade. Indeed, as indicated by the report,debt relief as well as official and multilateral flows will have very limited effect unless they are complemented by reforms of domestic policies and institutions. This brings me to the 2nd point we wish to make, importance of the entire international community to act in synergy. Indeed, as the reportnotes, LDCs' interests are often overtaken by the interests of the wider global development objectives, arguably chipping away the advantages contemplated for the most vulnerable. Indeed, as witnessed during the bridged on covenant negotiations but also during the discussions at WTO, the EU's explicit objectiveto grant a preferential consideration for the most vulnerable, including the LDCs, is at times hampered by other parts of the membership. In the same vein, the fact that since the multilateral debt relief initiative and the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, LDCs' debt had ballooned largely dueto loans extended by non-Paris Club countries. This confirms that responding to LDCs' needs cannot be effectively delivered by developed countries alone. The EU remains committed to our part, multilaterally and bilaterally. For instance, we are very happy that at COP28 in Dubai, we managed to operationalizeand raise initial capital for the fund to address climate-related loss and damage, in particular for the most vulnerable developing countries. This was one of our key objectives at the conference. While important progress has been achieved at the Paris Summit for the new global financial pact back inJune, for instance, on carbon markets and on climate resilient debt clauses, continued reform of the global financial architecture is of key importance. The EU and its Member States are pushing for stronger partnership that should help make the MDEs more efficient and thus unlock additional resources.In addition to numerous smaller actions, our global gateway initiative now counts with a portfolio of more than 220 transformative actions, large part of which are in LDCs. Majority of these supported projects promote green transition in our partner countries with transport and digital remainingthe other two key pillars. In conclusion, allow me to again reiterate EU's unwavering solidarity and support as well as continued partnership with LDCs in these challenging times and we look forward to further nurturing and developing this partnership in implementation of the Doha Program of Action.Thank you. I thank Distinguished Delegate of European Union and I would like to invite Distinguished Ambassador of Cambodia speaking on behalf of the G77 and China. You have the floor, Ambassador.Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning. Mr. President of the Trade and Development Board,Secretary General of ANTAC, Madam Rebecca Greenspan, Excellency Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.Allow me to start by thanking Her Excellency, the Secretary General, for the information shared in her intervention, particularly regarding item 7 of the agenda, preparation for the 16th ANTAC UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development. As this information is new to the group, we will need timeto process it and we may request your indulgence if we come back after this TDB session with questions andsuggestions. Our group appreciation would also like to extend to the Secretariat team for preparing and presenting the report with outstanding findings and recommendation. The Group of 77 and China wouldlike to commend the opportune selection of the SIM of the Least Developed Country Report 2023. Thesuggested discussion of crisis resilient development finance is particularly pertinent to the recentlyestablished loss and damage fund. Small economies such as those of the LDC are in deep need of fundsto rebuild infrastructures, trade competitiveness and production capacity after facing the extreme climateevents caused by climate change and in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic and even worse, the conflicts.It is particularly relevant to recall that the contribution to climate declaration caused by LDC andother developing countries is particularly insignificant while it is precisely who are paying the higher costof the climate crisis. The principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities should not remain atthat letter. The Group of 77 and China would like to invite developed Member States to nominate theirrepresentatives for the board of the loss and damage funds. Mr. President, the associated costs incurredby LDC to overcome the limitations that prevent them from graduating require revisiting the currentstructure of international financial system in a way that allows LDCs to access much needed fundingwithout falling in debt crisis. In many LDCs there is a need to build complete productive and basicinfrastructure from scratch. This challenge represents an opportunity not only for LDC but also for humanityto start on the right foot and use green technology from the beginning through technology transfer andcollaborations. But for that to happen we need a fair financial system and access to technology. The LDCbeing considered marginal actors of financial system do not have a space to put forward their concern and needs even though they are extremely vulnerable to financial crisis. Mr. President, in addition, thereport mentioned the complexity of the international financial system as a challenge but to the lack ofhomogeneity in its process and condition. In this regard, the Group of 77 in China would like to stressthat despite the challenges we recognize the immense value of multilateral development banks and invitethem to consider the call to consider recommendation of the report to facilitate access to funds and grantsfor LDCs through standardization and simplification of the process and requirements. Let me highlight the importance of financial system that learns from the past and serve as the fundamental bricks to builda better future for all, supporting countries, particularly LDC, to follow the path of sustainabledevelopment while avoiding falling into the debt trap. To conclude, addressing low carbon economy and green development, the LDC would need more assistance to overcome both national challenges and mitigate externalthreats in the effective implementation of the international climate change, finance U.S. 100 billionU.S. dollars per year, green technology transfer and capacity, green structural transformation and smoothtransition to work a low carbon economy. There is a role for UNCTAD and other different partners in support the LDC accordingly. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Ambassador of Cambodia for the remarks.I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegate of Nepal speaking on behalf of the LDC group. We have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the LDCgroup. At the outset, on behalf of the LDC members, I would like to commend the UNCTAD Secretary General, Madam Greenspan and her team for bringing out the least developed country report 2023 titled CrisisResilient Development Finance. We found the topic timely and analysis insightful. The report has succinctly elaborated the needs of LDCs. In fact, I see the five chapters as five levers to lifting LDCs'economy and leading them to the development path. Pandemic, geo economic fragmentation and climatechange tend to reverse the LDCs' hard earned economic growth and retard their pace to achieving LDCs. Thecombined GDP of the LDCs was less than 10% of the prepandemic years. This pushed additional 15 millionpeople to extreme poverty. The LDCs need some 100 billion annual funding to meet their STG target. The internationalfinancial mechanism must restore the LDCs' resilience to the systemic shocks. The ODA flows are lower thanthe target. External debt sustainability is worsening. Current debt stress in LDCs has constrained their fiscalspace. The 46 LDCs hold only 4% of voting weightage in the World Bank and less than 2.5% of the special drawing rights inthe IMF. Therefore, we call upon international community to address the fragmentation of international financialarchitecture. The development and climate financing must be commensurate to the LDCs' needs. We urge for rapid adoption of the LDCs'specific climate finance target as the LDCs have the high vulnerabilities, low readiness and less able to leverage investment in adaptation measures. Development assistance needs to be aligned with the specific need of LDCs to achieve greaterstructural transformation. Financial flows need to be consistent with less greenhouse gases emission and climate resilient development as outlinedin the Paris Agreement. We emphasize the meaningful mobilization of the loss and damage fund with greater access to the LDCs. We strongly believe in multilateralapproach to the global challenges and express gratitude to the countries and organizations contributing to the development of LDCs. We urge UNCTAD to play important role to the implementation of Doha Programme of Action for LDCs and the Bridgetown Initiativefor the Transformation of Global Financial Architecture. While appreciating the continuous support of the donor countries to LDCs, we also encourage them to replenish the UNCTADtrust fund for LDCs. The just green transition demands concerted efforts of all the stakeholders. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Excellency Ambassador of Nepal for this statement and Iwould like to invite the Distinguished Delegate of Nigeria on behalf of the African Group. You have the floor. Madam Secretary General, Rebecca Greenspan.Thank you, Mr. President. Your Excellency Ambassador Fabian Redyard, Board President, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I offer this statement on behalf of the African Group. At the outset,I would like to offer my congratulations to you, Ambassador, upon your election to preside over our work. I would also like to offer my congratulations in the same vein to the Secretariatof UNCTAD for the publication of the Report 2023 on Least Developed Countries entitled Developmentfor Finance Developing that is Resilient to Crises. The report is very timely and it gives us very pertinent analysis of the work that's been done and the facts on the ground. It highlightsthe needs of the Least Developed Countries, the LDCs, most of which are to be found on the African continent. Different crises, current and recent, that have shaken the world suchas the COVID-19 pandemic but also geopolitical tensions and climate change all have massive negative impacts slowing economic growth and development, annihilating the efforts of ourcountries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 according to the goals we have established. The LDCs, more than this, are exposed due to their extreme vulnerability. The reportidentifies notably that major resources are needed in funding for the LDCs to achieve the SDGs, estimated at around $100 billion annually. To do this, it is urgent that we start a fundamentaloverhaul of the international financial system to funnel funds to meet the needs of these countries for development where around 45% of the GDP of these countries are being spent on achievingjust the social part of the SDGs. In this context, we reiterate our call to the international community to work more to resolve the fragmentation of international financial architecture in orderto make it more inclusive, innovative and better adapted to the needs of the time and to allow these countries to catch up in terms of development. As regards the issue of climate change and resilienceto the impact of climate change, our group recognizes that loss and damage can be found in all regions and all countries of the planet. However, least developed countries which contribute the leastto the climate crisis are those most confronted by the worst consequences and paradoxicallythe least equipped to handle the impact. Therefore, we call for a rapid adoption of climate financinggoals that are adapted to the needs of this group of countries to fully draw advantage from the funding currently allocated to deal with climate change. As regards greenhouse gasemissions and reducing them through investment and increasing resilience to climate change in line with the Paris Agreement, we need these investments to flow. We strongly express ourcommitment to the multilateral approach to facing global challenges, recalling and strengthening global partnerships that need that renewal. Commitments have been made to the Doha Programmeof Action to help LDCs for the decade 2022 to 2031 and these commitments must be translatedinto concrete action. We consider that UNCTAD has a major role to play in implementing this programme as well as the Bridgetown Initiative aimed at transforming the global financial architecture.To conclude, we launch an urgent appeal to donor countries to rebuild and shore up the trust fund, a special fund for UNCTAD with fundamental support for the LDCs and specific programmesin this area. Thank you. I thank the Ambassador of Nigeria for the remarks. Now I would like to invite Distinguished Delegate of Jamaica speaking on behalf of GRULAC. You have the floor. Thankyou, Mr. President, for giving me the floor. Jamaica delivers the statement on behalf of the group of Latin America and the Caribbean. GRULAC thanks the Secretariat for her update on the preparations for the 16th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. As we commenceour preparation in earnest for UNCTAD 16, it is important that we collectively commit to ensuring that the conference responds to the global trades and development challenges. Since the hosting of UNCTAD 15, we would have agreed to the bridge down covenant. The global economyhas experienced a series of poly crises that has served as a reminder that developing countries need to build resilience against external shocks. For this reason, the group requested that the report titled International Trade Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2023, structuralchange and trends in global and regional trade, challenges and opportunities be placed on this agenda of the 75th Executive Session of the TDB to highlight the situation in the region and the critical role UNCTAD has to play in assisting to address these challenges. UNCTAD16 will provide us with the opportunity to ensure that the organization is responsive to the needs of members and remains relevant and fit for purpose within the UN system. GRULAC stands ready to support and will actively engage in the preparatory process leading up to the conference. Turningto agenda item 3 on the Least Developed Countries Report, 2023, crisis resilience, development finance, the group thanks Mr. Davis, head of the policy analysis and research branch for presenting the report. This annual flagship UNCTAD report provides a comprehensive socioeconomicanalysis and data on LDCs and includes policy guidance and recommendation. The group comments UNCTAD for continuing to deliver on its research and policy analysis pillar. This report confirmsthat LDCs continue to face unique financial challenges that hinder their requests for sustainable development. According to the recent UNCTAD sustainable development goal transition cost exercise, e.g. , LDCsface the highest per capita costs of meeting their goals relative to the base of their economies. As highlighted in the report, to get back on track to achieving the sustainable development goals, LDCs need a financial institution, financial architecture that is inclusive, innovative andadaptive to their needs and challenges. In 2021, there were 17 LDCs among the 20 countries with the highest level of vulnerability and the lowest level of readiness to tackle the effects ofclimate change. They are also the group least able to leverage investments in adaptation actions. Mr. President, as GRULAC region includes an LDCs 80, we support the view that no one behind leaving no one behind is not just a moral imperative and we must collectively ensure that LDCs aresupported in their economic and social development pursuits. The LDC report 2023, while it delvesdeeply into the challenges facing LDCs, it also sheds light on potential solutions. In this connection, the group would like to pose the following questions and note that some of it would have been addressed in the presentation. It is proposed in the report that the LDC financial sector primarily needsto contribute to the green transition and climate adaptation within the overall context of achieving fundamental progress on structural transformation. How would the LDC practically pursue such recommendation given the challenges they face? Two, what mechanisms should be bolstered or developed to ensure LDCshave adequate access to development and climate finance? And three, the report states that achieving a just transition in LDCs is not only with appropriate industrial policies implemented in tandem. While recognizing the difference in economic and social profiles of LDCs, what are some of the immediateindustrial policies that LDCs should pursue to achieve a just transition? I thank you, Mr. President. I thank Distinguished Delegates of Jamaica on the remarks and I would like to invite Distinguished Delegates of Bangladesh speaking on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Group. You havethe floor. President, Secretary General of UNCTAD, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Group.At the outset, the Asia-Pacific Group wishes to align itself with the statement made by Cambodia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The group would like to commend the UNCTAD Secretariat for the choice of topic and in-depth analysis. Mr. President, the LDCs have been battered bythe succession of crisis, the spiraling impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, the slowdown of the world economy, the worldwide effects of ongoing conflicts and the ensuing explosion of the prices of food and energy, the sharp rise in the interest rates of developed countries and the rising leveland cost of external debt. Independent of how the decade continues onward, it has started with LDC countries experiencing years of backtracking on development, be it in terms of its previous achievements in poverty, health, education or well-being of the populations. The outlookfor the remainder of the 2020s and for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals do not look promising, in particular for LDCs. The gap in financing for the Sustainable Development Goals alone in all developing countries including LDCs is now about 4 trillion US dollar per yearup from 2.5 trillion in 2015 when the goals were adopted. We take note of the report's observation that the LDCs face challenges in terms of decisions that shape international financial flows resulting in external financial flows that are not always aligned with LDCs' national development goalsand objectives. The report indicates a deepening debt crisis. In addition to challenges highlighted above, the LDCs are in the front line of the climate crisis. By their classification, the LDCs are the most environmentally vulnerable with instability in agriculture and fallingvictim to natural disasters. LDCs account for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and yet they are on the most affected. In addition, the LDCs are the least equipped to deal withthe adverse consequences of climate change or to bounce back when economies and societies are hit by external environmental shocks. Mr. President, for a timely achievement of SDGs, financing is one of the most critical factors. Unfortunately, the international financialinfrastructure is barely aligned with SDGs nor can it respond to the financial needs of developing countries including LDCs, especially during crisis. LDCs' fiscal space is rather limited for them to work on SDGs. Today, we urgently need an international financial architecturethat will help LDC countries receive concessional low cost, low interest rate funds with minimum conditionalities. Furthermore, the LDCs need to be provided with adequate assistance to overcome both national challenges and mitigate external threats. Inter alia, the effective implementationof the international climate finance of U.S. dollar 100 billion per year. Green technology transfer and absorptive capacity. Green structural transformation and smooth transition towardsthe low carbon economy. Granting LDCs priority for ideas of loan, greater adaptation related climate finance, et cetera, have long been argued. Ideas covered in the LDC report suchas rechanneling of special drawing rights from developed countries so as to be leveraged by MDPs to fund LDCs as well as new and additional laws and damage fund open for LDCs in the formof grants are worth implementing. In sum, LDCs need new, green and additional funds, preferably as grants and concessional loans. For graduating LDCs, there should be some incentive for theirperformance. They enjoy the international support measures for LDCs for an extended period of time for smooth and sustainable transition. There can be some innovative and transition financingmechanism for them to adjust to the concessional funding gap. Mr. President, our world must do better with LDCs. The international community must realize their commitment to the LDCs expeditiously.We cannot fail the 880 million people in LDCs. I thank you, Mr. President. I would like to invitethe Distinguished Delegate of Egypt speaking on behalf of the Arab Group. You have the floor.President of the board, Madam Secretary Greenspan, ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of making this statement on behalf of the Arab Group which also aligns itself with the statementof G77+China. At the outset, we would like to thank Mr. Junior Davis, the chief of the branch head for the LDCs and we would like to offer our gratitude for the compilation of this report.We are concerned by the contents of the report, specifically concerning development of LDCs andthe impact of multiple complex crises that have struck the world including climate change, increased conflicts and debt. All of this has impact on achieving the SDGs. We must recognize thatto handle and resolve these crises we need economic justice within the international system and emphasis must be placed on a fair decisive transition where countries in difficulty andthe LDCs suffer the cost of development and increased cost of losses. The funding of climatechange adaptation largely comes from debts. The LDCs have to pick up the bill for mitigation of climate change caused by rich countries. In line with the Paris Agreement, developingcountries and developed countries have to make a fair contribution to mitigating climate change.The process of mitigating climate change and eradicating poverty must be fair. This is why the Arab Presidency of the last two COPs of the UNFCC has made it possible to achieve anagreement at the COP 27 creating a loss and damage fund which was activated during COP 28. Funds were established at $400 million for the poorest countries who suffer the most fromclimate change. We recall that Arab efforts undertaken then led to a success during the5th UN Conference on LDCs in Qatar. That Conference saw the adoption of the agreement increasinginternational commitments to support the DOA plan of action for the 45 LDCs across the world. We reiterate that it is important to adopt a general approach bringing together all aspects of climatechange. An approach in short that would encourage development efforts to overcome the hindrances currently seen in the development and climate change adaptation process. This is vital fordevelopment and the Arabic Group calls for an honest assessment of the current reality arounda number of worrying indices. For example, ahead of these the drop in implementation of commitmentswith constantly increasing costs looking at unilateral efforts through taxes, through funding and financing there are measures taken which are hindering justice and undermining joint activitiesto support LDCs. To conclude as we talk of LDCs we cannot fail to highlight the humanitariancrisis that has struck occupied Palestine due to crimes by Israel in contravention of allrights and international norms indeed against human values. As we have seen statements madeby high level officials in the Israeli Government they have declared that they are starting a military operation preparing a widespread military operation across the occupied territories. Thiswould lead to a great exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis. We call on the international community to intensify regional and international efforts to prevent a military operation in Rafah giventhe immense number of Palestinian refugees. These are the last safe areas in the Gaza Strip. If the Israeli efforts that are hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid continue this means thata policy is being put in place to evict the Palestinian people unjustly. This is in violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolutions in violation of the relevantresolutions of the General Assembly. We reaffirm the need to mobilize development, economic and social resources to bring a response to the basic humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip wherenumerous people are being killed and injured according to the report compiled by UNCTAD itself analyzing the economic and social destruction. This came from the very beginning of the Israelioffensive in Gaza. We have seen decades and billions of dollars that will be needed to rebuildthe area. That's if we can start reconstruction immediately. If we look at the trend since2007 to 2020, despite all of what we have seen, the economy will not be able to be restoredor achieve the GDP of 2022 before 2092. Only in 2022 will it be possible to restore the economyof the Gaza Strip even if we start right now. Meanwhile we are seeing a constant deterioration of the circumstances for the population. The GDP growth might be forecast at 10% annuallybut the fear is that we will not get back to the level of 2006 before 2035. The situationthat we see in the field now is the result of policies that were applied, shoring up an illegal occupation, pillaging the resources. We have seen also Israeli military incursions in thewest bank, attacks against holy sites and an ongoing occupation, a rejection of all attemptsto calm or resolve the situation. This is the cause of the tragedies that we have seen recently. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegates of Egypt. I would like to invite the DistinguishedDelegates of Islamic Republic of Iran. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Due to preoccupationof my Ambassador, I read the statement on his behalf. Mr. President, Madam Secretary General,Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, on behalf of my Delegation, I extend my appreciationto the Secretariat for their independent analytical work, particularly the meticulous preparation of the Least Developed Countries Report, Crash Resilient Development Finance, a significantflagship publication. I associate myself with the statements made by the Group of 77 and China as well as the Asia-Pacific Group. However, before highlighting the critical points to follow,I respectfully request the Secretary General to wholeheartedly support UNCTAD's pillars on independent analytical work Could the interpreters request the speaker to change microphone, please?He is almost inaudible. Thank you. Can I invite the Delegates of Iran to change the microphonefor the interpreter use? There is huge interference and he was almost inaudible. We are very grateful.Thank you. Is this any better? Much. Thank you. Please continue. Dear Chairman, from the 1stor from I continue? From you continue. Mr. President, I refrain from prolongation of the sentimentsechoed by the Group of 77 and China and the APGA. However, I wish to emphasize certain crucial issues. Historically the contribution of Developing Countries, particularly Least Developed Countriesto climate change has been minimal. Therefore, it is imperative that expectation regarding decarbonization and emission reduction differ for Developed and Developing Nations, particularlyfor the LDCs. This underscores the importance of adopting a nuanced approach. I endorse the pressingneed for capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance for LDCs. While acknowledgingthe imperative of decarbonization, it is essential to recognize the unique circumstances of DevelopingCountries, particularly LDCs, and apply the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.Mr. President, finance remains a cornerstone for LDCs. The realization of decarbonizationhangs on adequate financing to develop infrastructure suitable for such endeavors. Therefore, creatingan international conducive atmosphere where climate finance is interpreted as financingthat does not exacerbate the debt burden of LDCs is imperative. For example, access to concessional financing would pave the way forward. Furthermore, reminding our Developed Partnersto fulfill their financial commitments is imperative, as effectively only a few have honored the pledgethus far. Mr. President, last but not least, while addressing the transition to a low carboneconomy and fostering green development, LDCs require substantial assistance to tackle both internal challenges and external trends. This includes the effective interpretation, climatefinance, and implementation of international climate finance commitments, green technologytransfers, enhancing absorptive capacity, promoting green technology, green structural transformation,and facilitating a smooth transition to a low carbon economy. UNCTAD and other Development Partnershave a pivotal role in supporting LDCs in this endeavor. While emphasizing the significance of UNCTAD mandate and its three pillars, it is essential to ensure that the core mandateof UNCTAD is not overshadowed even when addressing interconnected issues such as decarbonization and emission reduction. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Distinguished Delegates of Islamic Republicof Iran. I would like to invite Distinguished Delegates of Peru. You have the floor. Thank you very much, indeed, sir. Secretary General, Rebecca Greenspan, Excellencies, Delegates, atthe outset we should like to thank the Secretary General for the statement including the valuable information on the preparation for the 60th anniversary and for UNCTAD 16. We believe thattaking into account the current multiple crises, we need to address these important events from a different approach, a different perspective than what we used to so that we can ensure that for UNCTAD 16, the next four years will be more productive and will have a greater impact onmembers while we continue to address the different shocks. Similarly, we are not losing sight of the fact that the previous year at the end of the mandate that we gave ourselves, we willneed to see us make progress on our most important agenda, that is Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. The mandate will need to bear this context in mind in the future. These next years will be a hugeusually heavy work but you can count on Peru's support. We are undertaking preparation and we are pleased with the report that we have before us which has a great deal of data asregards the impacts of very many crises in LDCs which have meant that the number of those living in extreme poverty has increased. They are suffering huge issues when it comes to survival. One majorconcern is the debt crisis. This brings about the need for urgent reform to the current international financial architecture. The fact that LDCs spend more on servicing their debt than on educationis the formula for a clear disaster and a vicious cycle of poverty and lack of development. The UN Secretary General in his statement to the 3rd summit said that the international financialarchitecture has failed when it comes to providing a safety net for countries in difficulty. On the other hand, the issue that draws our attention and this is a new range of assistance possibilitiesfor UNCTAD pertains to the issues that LDCs have in acceding to financial options due to the administrative burden and the transaction costs. In this case, we could look at potentialsupport to reducing those transaction costs. We through our experience and knowledge support we understand the complexity of these operations. Another crisis that affects us all but LDCsmost is, of course, climate change. It is LDCs who are on the front lines given the ravages of climate change despite the fact that they are not the biggest polluters. In addition to that, the report states that they are at a risk of falling into the trap of climate debt. Inaddition to the challenges, we welcome the priority areas for action indicated in the report. However, we are aware that many of these will particularly depend on developing societies. For example, when we refer to complying with the LDA promise, when we refer to the work of the multilateraldevelopment banks or to special drawing rights among others, in order to not fail as a collective, we need to attach priority to assisting LDCs to bring them back on to the path of achievingthe SDGs. One crucial task here is to reform the international financial system so that it is in line with the needs and particular situations of countries that most require this. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Peru and I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegateof Russian Federation. You have the floor. Mr. President, colleagues, we are grateful tothe Secretariat for compiling the report on LDCs for 2023 which analyzes the tools for crisis resistant funding for development of the LDCs. We note the useful recommendations for overcoming the budget deficits in these countries. The budget restrictions in LDCs caused by a cascadeof crises, the climate crisis, growing debts, the dependence on commodities and reducing foreign investment seriously hinder achieving the SDGs in these countries and slow the energy transition.The situation is worsened by the growth of foreign debt. Just in 2021, $27 billion was spent on servicing this debt. The risks of uneven distribution of the global funding to overcome the climatechange are also growing. These do not reflect the actual damage from climate change in these countries. A 3rd of the allocated climate funding is not grants but loans and this canmean that LDCs can fall into so-called debt traps. We share the proposals and recommendations to resolve these problems that are in the report. Without international support, LDCs are unlikelyto be able to overcome these crises. We underscore the need to increase official aid to the levels in international agreements achieving the climate change goals. It's important also to ensureaccess to cheap international funding including increasing the volume of subsidies. It's important also to strengthen the potential and capacities of LDCs to implement their own adaptation andmitigation projects and fight illegal financial flows. Russia supports the efforts of the UN to assist these countries for decades. We have been a responsible donor through the UN andon our own. Bilaterally we continue to additional projects and to developing new technical assistance initiatives. We have priorities to execute projects to help the poorest and most vulnerable countriesin agriculture, digitalization and building critical infrastructure. Also clean power including nuclear power. A successful example of such cooperation is the project implemented since2018 with Rosatom to build a nuclear power station in Bangladesh costing 13 billion U.S. dollars. This project includes the construction and commissioning of two reactors, total power 2400 megawattshas already received the 1st nuclear fuel components and is to be launched in 2024. Boosting training is also critical in LDCs in transport, power, healthcare, manufacturing vaccines, trainingand high technologies. The Russian government has established a quota for higher and vocational training for foreigners in Russia with federal funds in 2023 supporting 30,000 students. Around27,000 African students have currently studying in Russia. Around 5,000 sponsored by the Russian budget. Russia is making a major contribution to relieving the debt burden. We have writtenoff $23 billion of debt. We place great importance in agreements for the LDCs, notably those of July 2023 at the 1st Russia Africa Summit in St. Petersburg which facilitated cooperationin many areas including industry, power, developing infrastructure, agriculture, medicine, education and scientific and technical cooperation. In conclusion, I would like to note the goal of Russia for strategic cooperation with the countries of the global south to achieve a justworld order with our natural allies. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Russia Federation and I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegate of Kenya. You have the floor. Mr. President,the outset Kenya aligns with the statement delivered by Niger on behalf of the African Group and Cambodia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We thank the Secretary General, Ms. Grispan, for her reportespecially as it relates to the preparation for the 16th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Indeed, the report is timely given that we are coming to the tail end ofthe implementation period of the Bridgetown Covenant even as it remains valid mandate. As we look forward to the preparation of UNCTAD 16, the biggest and most important question we should ask ourselves is where are we vis-a-vis the implementation of Bridgetown Covenant? Itis therefore imperative that the Secretariat conducts a comprehensive situation analysis to ascertain what we have managed to achieve and what we have not and why so that it not onlyinforms the next process but also improves on it for enhanced impact to millions of people in Developing Countries but more important to LDCs. Mr. President, my Delegation profoundlycommends the Secretariat for the preparation of the Least Developed Countries Report 2023 dubbed Crisis Resilient Development Finance. Indeed, the theme of the report aligns objectively with the theme of Bridgetown Covenant from inequality and vulnerability to prosperity for all. TheLDCs are the most affected by the inequalities and vulnerabilities and therefore appropriate and crisis resilient development finance is the much needed cure to treat the structuralchallenges inherent in LDCs. The report highlights findings relating to structural challenges which are interlocked and which have lived with LDCs for a very long period as well as outlining excellentrecommendations to address these challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic reversed gains already made by LDCs towards achievement of inclusive and sustainable development and further exacerbatedexisting challenges. The geopolitical tensions have made the situation worse and LDCs are now immensely suffering from a myriad of challenges which include debt distress orchestrated bycommodity dependence, lack of necessary physical space, rising food and energy prices, inflationary pressures, widening digital divide and accelerating climate change with its significant negativeeffects. Statistics have shown that LDCs are spending more on debt repayment than on education and health combined and the LDCs are suffering disproportionately from the effect of climate change. Therefore,effective and climate resilient development finance at the required scale delivered through appropriate instruments and underpinned by an international financial architecture that is inclusive in innovative and adapted to the specific needs of Developing Countries, especially LDCs, isthe overarching factor that guarantees LDCs' transition to inclusive and sustainable development yet the current international financial system does not support the said transition. In this regard, Kenya has been and continues to be at the forefront of championing for the reformof the international financial architecture. The report highlights the need for LDCs to be on the table as we even continue with the discourse on the reform of the international financial structure so that the influence decisions that affect them. The international community shouldtherefore make this possible for LDCs. To this end, for LDCs to build productive capacitiesand achieve green structural transformation, support from the international community in terms of availing necessary liquidity, both for development and climate adaptation and mitigationas well as debt relief, restructuring, suspension and in some cases write-offs are indispensable. UNCTAD should therefore work with other relevant international players to ensure that the recommendationsfrom the report are implemented as envisaged. I thank you. I thank the Excellency Ambassador of Kenya and I would like to invite Distinguished Delegate of Indonesia. You have the floor. Thank you, Chair. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Indonesia aligns itself to the statement by G77and China as well as the APG. First of all, we would like to appreciate the SG for her update on the UNCTAD's work and structure reform plan at UNCTAD which Indonesia supports dearly. Rest assured that we would support your work to make UNCTAD closer to us, the Member Statesto revitalize UNCTAD and to substantively implement the Bridgestone Conference even more robustly. And then for the UNCTAD 60 celebration, we also want to share that Indonesia is going to also held at our national capacity to have national event commemorating the importance of UNCTADin Indonesia. Regarding the topic of this session, the Agenda Item 3 on the UNCTAD report on the LDCs 2023, we would like to appreciate the Secretariat's hard work to produce the report and Indonesiais compelled to share its visions and commitment towards a world where the principle of no one left behind is not just a motto but a guiding principle for our collective actions in global economic development. First, the report before us shed light on the disproportionate impactof global crisis on LDCs emphasizing the urgent need for resilient development financing mechanism. Indonesia firmly believes that the global community must intensify its effort to assist LDCs toachieve SDGs. In alignment with initiatives such as debt suspension initiative and common framework for debt treatment endorsed by the G20, Indonesia recognizes the critical needfor broadening fiscal space, reforming the international financial architecture and mobilizing climate finance through multilateral forum and beyond, including the operationalization of loss and damage fund. These efforts are essential for providing tangible benefit to LDCs enablingthem to build resilience against economic shock and to invest in SDGs. Second, promoting economic diversification is crucial for creating a more inclusive and sustainable global economy. A significant challenge facing LDCs is their high dependence on the commodity sector for export and fiscalrevenues. This vulnerability underscores the imperative need for diversification including to value addition to domestic commodities via downstream development. Economic diversification, for instance, through the promotion of the creative economy is paramount. Such synergy not onlyenhance resilience but also create new pathway for sustainable growth and development. Third, it is important to support integration of LDCs to the global system. It is vital for developed countries to refrain for implementing policies under the guise of environmental protectionsand human rights that could resist trade and impeded economic growth of LDCs. Such measure while well intentioned can have unintended consequences that further marginalize vulnerable economies. Last but not least, we view that some key take away of the report on LDCs could be in theinput for discussion in other multilateral forum including negotiations of the pack of the future. As we deliberate on the findings and recommendation of the report on LDCs 2023, let us be inspiredto forge actionable commitment that will drive forward our agenda of ensuring that no country is left behind. Indonesia in its capacity in the trade development board is dedicated toleading and supporting initiative that will bring this ambition to fruitful. Thank you for your attention and commitment to this vital cause. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegates of Indonesia and I would like to invite Her Excellency Ambassador of Hungary to have the floor. Youhave the floor, Ambassador. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, 1st and foremost, although she left but I'm sure the message will get to her, let me thank Secretary General Greenspan for her comprehensive but forward looking accounton the progress that has been made under her tenure so far. I can underline that we do see the results of the reform efforts which brought UNCTAD closer to its global membership not only here in Geneva but worldwide through its valuable database publications as well. We look forwardto continuing on this path under Ms. Greenspan's leadership. I would also like to thank Mr. Davis for presenting the LDC report which has a clear light on the burdens, risks and challenges that the LDCs are hampered by. However, it also provides us valuable guidance on how to improveour work on the partnership with countries most in need. The LDCs around the world are facing serious financial challenges due to the global crisis. ODA, FDIs, multilateral development banks are the backbone for lending aid to LDCs to support their sustainable and transparent development.However, the interconnected and systemic challenges LDCs face require more efficient aid and assistance. As Mr. Davis said in his presentation, geopolitical tensions and the climate crisis have a disproportionate negative impact on the already vulnerable LDCs. Thus, it is indeed imperative to find a wayto ensure quantity, quality and access to finance in order to break the vicious cycle of shrinking policy space for LDCs and help their green structural transformation and development progress. The UNCTAD 16 will present a much needed occasion to see what are the possible paths ahead forthis organization for the crises present themselves in an increasing number of shape and form. These new crises force us to evolve as well in order to find suitable answers to the increasingly complex and interconnected challenges. We look forward to participating both at UNCTAD 16 butalso at the stocktaking at the UNCTAD 60th anniversary event in June in a constructive manner lookingback to our history and by drawing on the lessons learned defining the way ahead to fulfill UNCTAD's important goal because the methods might need to be reshaped but the goals of UNCTAD remain the same from inequality and vulnerability to prosperity for all by seeking new ways forsustainable development to build bridges, to ensure connectivity, to ever tighten the integration of LDCs into the multilateral trading system. To conclude, allow me to underline our steadfast support for the leadership of the Secretary General as well as to the division for Africa,Least Developed Countries and Special Programs. Hungary remains committed to engage in a constructive and inclusive manner in order for this organization to deliver on its mandate enshrined in the Bridgetown covenant and have meaningful dialogues at the upcoming two conferences. As Secretary GeneralGreenspan said we will be there to support delivering a new UNCTAD to a new world. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank you, Your Excellency, Ambassador of Hungary for the remark and I would like toinvite Distinguished Delegate of Nepal to have the floor. You have the floor. DistinguishedDelegate of Nepal, are you in the room? Thank you, Chair. Actually there is nothing from usin the national capacity. Thank you. Thank you. And I would like to invite Distinguished Delegateof Morocco. You have the floor. The declaration of the Kingdom of Morocco aligns with the G77and China, the Arab Group and the African Group. Mr. President, Madam Secretary General of UNCTAD, Chief of Branch, ladies and gentlemen, my Delegation would at the outset very much like to commendthe UNCTAD Secretariat and in particular the African LDCs and Special Programs Division for the extremely valuable report from 2023 on the LDCs. This report is extremely educational andhighlights particularly the multifaceted restrictions given the current international situation and the many challenges that LDCs are facing in this specific context, notably achieving theSDGs, socioeconomic recovery post-COVID-19 which is to be sustainable and resilient, alleviatingexcessive debt burden and participation in international trade. Mr. President, the 2023 report underlinesthe vast gap in terms of ODA for LDCs. This only represents 0.09% of GNP of members ofthe Development Assistance Committee, the DAC, whereas the threshold stipulated in SDG 17 and the program of action stands at 0.15% through to 0.2%. In addition, the report underlinesthat budgetary restrictions are endangering the progress achieved by LDCs in terms of achieving the SDGs as well as the transition to a low carbon economy and the implementation of crucialdevelopment policies. To overcome these challenges, it is vital that political commitment and international solidarity be stepped up as well as mobilization of the private sector. To that effect, allowme to focus priority on four main areas. Firstly, the different strategic directions of the Doha program towards LDCs for the decade 2022 to 2031. These must be translated into specificactions on the ground promoting the sustainable development of these countries. Secondly, ODA remains a vital pillar of development finance. It serves as a way of transferring knowledge and of disseminating best practices with a view to supporting developing countries, in particularthe LDCs as they seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Thirdly, promotion of regional south-south initiatives. These are important sources of financing of the long-term in Least DevelopedCountries so as to achieve large infrastructure projects and to be able to respond to the multifaceted central challenges linked particularly to food security and energy security. By way of example,let me mention just two structural projects at the regional level. First of all, the Nigeria Morocco gas pipeline which will provide gas to all West African countries. And I should also like to mention the international initiative of His Majesty King Mohammed VI to promoteaccess of Sahel countries to the Atlantic Ocean. This initiative will see the Kingdom of Morocco offering vast opportunities for economic transformation of the Sahel region as well asparticipation in international commerce and trade and making available to Sahel states road, port and rail infrastructure. This with a view to bolstering their participation in internationaltrade. Four African countries have acceded to this international initiative which is promising for the whole region. The 4th priority that I would mention consists of strengthening andpromoting south-south cooperation. This offers huge opportunities to address challenges that LDCs are facing by contributing to the financing of sustainable development in these countries.The Kingdom of Morocco has always shouldered its commitments towards LDCs in the framework of south-south cooperation. In this spirit, specific initiatives have been put forward bythe Kingdom of Morocco for LDCs in Africa, the Caribbean and in the Pacific which in Talia consists of counseling the debt of LDCs, African LDCs rather, exempting certain products fromparticular African LDCs from customs, tariffs, the development of public-private partnership which is mutually beneficial and the achievement of a huge number of initiatives in terms of infrastructure, climate finance and so on. To conclude, Mr. President, Morocco would reiterateits availability to provide with readiness rather to provide a contribution in achieving the SDGs in LDCs through its south-south cooperation policy based on solidarity exchange and sharingas well as the promotion of innovative mutually beneficial partnerships. Thank you very much for your attention. I thank Distinguished Delegate of Morocco and I would like to invite Distinguished Delegate of Finland. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank UNCTAD for the veryimportant and interesting report. It has been four years since the previous LDC report by UNCTAD and the newest edition of 2023 is again of very high quality. I commend the work ofUNCTAD Secretariat. It is extremely important to bring high quality research to the center of the discussion and development efforts. Having worked for 12 years as the Director of theUN Office for LDCs, OHRLLS in New York and in that capacity chaired the UN wide Working Group on LDCs, I understand the challenges the LDCs are facing but also the opportunities thatLDCs have and countries such as Finland have to support LDCs achieve the SDGs. As the reportand our colleagues from UNCTAD rightfully put it, we have to make sure that LDCs themselves will be in the center of the discussion shaping the international financial infrastructure and also other processesaiming to support their development. In this regard, I would like to brief the Distinguished Representative of one such initiative championed by my country, Finland, namely the LDC FutureForum. In the 5th UN Conference for the Least Developed Countries held in Doha in 2023, Finland announced that it will organize five annual LDC Future Forums in close partnership with the UN Officesupporting Least Developed Countries, UN OHRLLS, my former office. The LDC Future Forums will offer practical and evidence-based case studies, solutions and policy recommendations to achievingsustainable development. The forums will bring together LDC ministers and policymakers, researchers, private sector and experts from LDC countries, their development partners and international organizationsto identify innovative solutions to the multiple challenges faced by the LDCs. The forums keep LDCs and their needs on the agenda annually, but only once a decade, not only once a decadewhen the UN LDC Conference is organized. They help us to gain attention to the situation of the Least Developed Countries. The forums' themes are guided by the Doha Program of Action priorities.They will also contribute into other UN processes such as the Summit of the Future. The LDC Future Forum series demonstrates Finland's long-lasting commitment to be a reliable partner to the LeastDeveloped Countries and in accelerating SDGs. Finland has supported LDCs since the beginning of our development cooperation both bilaterally and multilaterally. The next LDC Future Forumwill take place in Helsinki, Finland from the 4 to the 7 of March. It will focus on how innovations can support LDCs in achieving sustainable development and many of the LDC ministers have confirmedtheir participation. We look forward into innovative solution for accelerating structural transformation, diversifying economies, entering new markets, accessing education, building capacity and creatingjobs among others. Distinguished participants with these few words, I want to confirm Finland's continued support to all the LDCs. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency, Ambassador of Finland.Now I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegate of Niger. You have the floor. Thankyou, President. I would like to make this statement in my national capacity. President, Madam Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to reiterate, Mr. President, our full appreciation of yourexcellent conduct of our work and thank you once again and thank the Secretariat of UNCTAD for compiling the report on LDCs on crisis resilient development finance for the LDCs. Thisis a very timely report because it comes when the multiple negative impacts that are crossing the world are being felt acutely but particularly in the LDCs. The report is published at a timewhere my country, Niger, continues to face the adverse impacts of numerous crises, geopolitical, sanitation, security, which all exacerbate the already existing structural challenges. Tothis we add the last six months of economic and financial sanctions imposed by organizationssuch as ECOWAS and UMOA. This is against the backdrop of inflation and political tensions.In 2024, a budget is established by our government focused on mobilizing our own funds to achieve the macroeconomic goals in our program for resilience and to save the fatherland, PRSB. We are focusedon promoting socioeconomic development for the wellbeing of our population. We share the recommendations in the 2030 report of the LDCs. We believe that partnerships should boost coherencebetween the policies of our countries with a positive impact focused on policies that helpachieve the SDGs. Social SDGs are estimated to cost 45% of GDP for our countries. Sponsorsshould support international architecture for financing which is inclusive, innovative and adapted leaving behind the conditionalities of the past and focusing on the priorities ofputting all countries on the path to true development. These recommendations are all the more pertinent at a time when the new program of action at Doha for the LDCs for the decade to 2031 should be translated into concrete action. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Nigeriaand I would like to invite the Excellence Ambassador of Ethiopia. You have the floor. Thank you for giving me the floor. I am going to present the statement on behalf of my Ambassador. Presidentof the Trade and Development Board, Secretary General of UNCTAD, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, I would like to begin by thanking Her Excellency, Madam Secretary for the enlighteningupdate. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to UNCTAD Secretariat for the excellentwork in preparing the report of the LDC 2023 and for Mr. Junior Davis for presenting the report. Mr. President, Ethiopia aligns itself with the statement made by Cambodia on behalf of Group 77 in China,Niger on behalf of Africa Group and Nepal on behalf of Least Developed Countries. LDCs economy is suffering a setback due to the cascading crisis occurring in the world which resulted the rising number of people living in extreme poverty. There is crisis that LDCs grappling with iscreating an impediment on their social economic development as they have already limited resource available to pay their debt. Even though LDCs have insignificant contribution to climate changecrisis, they are the most affected by its impact. Determined and integrated action is needed to build resilient economy and address systemic problem of the Least Developed Countries. The2023 LDC report shares light that it is a crucial juncture where international financial architectures need to be reformed in a way that they can meet the actual and specific need of the Least DevelopedCountries. And every commitment and initiatives need to be converted into action so as to realize sustainable development goals. In conclusion, we call on for revitalized efforts to attainimproved climate finance with the aim of mitigating climate change impacts and facilitating a smooth transition to low carbon economy and seek lasting solution for the vulnerability of LDCs. Furthermore,for the enhanced support for the LDCs to utilize their untapped potential to move forward their economy. Mr. President, as Ethiopia, as a Least Developed Country itself, my country, I wouldlike to reaffirm my country's readiness and commitment to work to continue working with UNCTAD and development partners to ensure inclusive and sustainable development for its citizens.I thank you, Mr. President. I thank Distinguished Delegate of Ethiopia and I would like to inviteDistinguished Delegate of Pakistan to have the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. President of the trade and development board, Ambassador Fabrian Rudyard, excellencies andDistinguished Delegates, at the outset Pakistan aligns itself with the statements delivered by Cambodia on behalf of G77 and China and Bangladesh on behalf of the Asia Pacific Group. Let me take this opportunity to appreciate Mr. Davis, Ms. Reba and the Secretariat for the preparationand presentation of the 2023 LDCs report. While highlighting the dire state of development finance, this report underscores the urgent need for action. Mr. President, in the backdrop of efforts for global economic recovery, LDCs have been disproportionately affected by theimpacts of the interlocking crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflict, climate change and rising cost of living. This is compounded by mounting external debt, a sharp rise in interest rates in developed economies and an insufficient mobilization of international financial resourcesto meet the SDGs and address structural vulnerabilities. Additionally, many LDCs suffer high financial costs from susceptibility to the effects of climate change and natural disasters even thoughtheir contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is insignificant. Pakistan is at the front line of the climate crisis. We witnessed unprecedented devastation from super floods in 2022 despite being responsible for less than 1% of the world's total carbon emissions. This not only has environmentalcosts but raises food insecurity risks by destroying local agriculture. In this context, my Delegationappreciates the report's focus on crisis resilient development finance and its recognition of the crucial role of development finance and debt in boosting the development prospects of LDCs. We also welcome the report's recommendations on measures to expand the fiscal space for LDCsand lower sky high borrowing costs enabling them to overcome their structural weaknesses. The existing financial architecture is not fit for purpose and requires earnest efforts for reform to be more inclusive, innovative and adapted to the specific needs and challengesof LDCs. International commitments including the setting up of the loss and damage fund have been made to ensure a better flow of financing to LDCs. However, the move from commitment to implementation must come sooner rather than later. My Delegation would like to draw attentionto the following measures for financing development. First, collaborative action is needed for establishing and implementing a comprehensive debt work out mechanism. We reiterate the call to establish a permanent international framework for sovereign debt restructuring. Second, the reallocationof unutilized SDRs by delinking them from the IMF quota can serve as a key mechanism for creating a new asset class to finance sustainable development and climate related loss and damage. Third, commitments to achieving the 0.7% of gross national income ODA target and mobilizing 100 billion dollarsannually in climate finance made by the international community under the De Saba Action Agenda and Paris Agreement need to be fulfilled. Finally, concessional financing is needed from MDBs to form a sustainable infrastructure investment facility to assist LDCs in developing feasibleprojects in SDG-related areas and to attract the necessary scale of investment. Mr. President, a clear policy direction and effective coordination at the international multilateral level is required to ensure that LDCs can progressively achieve sustainable development targets. I thank you.I thank the Distinguished Delegates of Pakistan. I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegatesof France to have the floor. You have the floor. Thank you, President. President, Excellencies,ladies and gentlemen Delegates, the 2024 report on the LDCs underscore the difficulties that they confront. Budgetary margins for maneuver are limited. There is a difficult circumstance with many challengesfrom climate change, COVID-19, international conflicts have negative impacts on their fragile economics. 900 million people are brought together in these countries and they deserve attention of the international community. France is fully mobilized to support developing countries, notably LDCs and thepresence of the public is committed to actions. We are very attentive. The 15 billion Euros has been exceeded by our foreign development budget. We already allocate a significant part of our GDP toLDCs, one of the largest, in fact, the 4th largest sponsor in the country. We deploy most of ourforeign aid to help LDCs. Sustainable policy put in place in 2023 ensures a partnership approach tomost effectively meet the needs of our partners. This is a part of the raising funds across the European Union to ensure development in the LDCs in addition to the multi-annual budget for up to 2027. The EuropeanUnion will mobilize over $30 billion for sub-Saharan Africa. As we face the scale of the challenges, France is aware that this is not enough and we need to do more. This is why the President of the Republicin June 2023 organized a Paris summit for a new global pact for funding to bring together the international community around the goals of a green transition and funding development. This led to the Paris agreementfor the people and the planet on four pillars. First, no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and preserving the planet. The LDCs are particularly vulnerable to climate change and theymust have the necessary resources to adapt to climate change whilst continuing the economic development.France, therefore, which welcomes the funds allocated to the green fund that flows from the Paris agreementwill be mobilized, will allocate more than 7 billion Euros, almost 3 billion for adaptation. We will alsocontribute 100 million Euros to the new loss and damage fund. Second, the deployment of adaptation strategies is vital for these countries. Each country in its own context must be free and possess the resourcesto choose its own path to achieve the goals in the Paris agreement. This is particularly true for the LDCs. Third, new financial support is necessary to bring people out of poverty but also protect ourplanet. This requires a significant increase in the resources available, both public and private resources. This is why the international financial system must be reformed to perform better. Franceis working on this overhaul to ensure that funds are raised to ensure equitable participation. More needs to be done collectively and particularly with the following two priorities. First, to better use thetools we already have. We have achieved allocating 100 billion in foreign aid. We also need to go furtherand we can do this. The private sector must also contribute more. Each dollar lent by the development bank must be supported or inspire an investment of the same amount. The multiple development banks mustincrease their loan capacities in part by taking on greater risks. The 2nd priority is that we needto bring a response to the burden of debt for the most vulnerable countries. We need to accelerateprocesses of writing off debt with suspension clauses in the case of natural disasters. Thissummit of the future next September will focus on this and France thanks the 56 countries that have joined this compact. We have two issues at the heart of our work in Geneva helping LDCs. First,commercially France and the European Union supports work underway at the WTO for countries leaving the category of LDCs. We have already achieved an agreement for countries leaving LDCs to continueto have access to provincial tariffs. We hope that the next ministerial conference which will take place in Abu Dhabi in a few days for LDCs will ensure progress for other groups of LDCs in developingcountries. France and the European Union are happy to see technical completion of a draft agreement on facilitating investment for development which brings together over 100 countries and should make LDCsmore attractive to investors. Here also we hope that the ministerial summit will help reach new agreements. The AG7 plays a major role for LDCs on the international level and making the business climatemore favorable for LDCs. We invite UNCTAD to continue these activities to help LDCs notably through promoting fair trade rules providing technical development assistance to LDCs and also capacitybuilding in terms of technology and innovation. I thank you. I thank the Executive Ambassador of France for the remarks and I would like to invite the Executive Ambassador of Gambia to have the floor. You havethe floor, Your Excellency. Mr. President, thank you for giving me the floor. Good morning, MadamSecretary General, President, UNCTAD, Secretariat, TDB Bureau and colleague excellences. The Delegation of the Gambia notes with appreciation the information shared on the preparation of the 60th anniversaryof the UNCTAD. We assure you of our support for the successful organization of the anniversary and look forward in receiving further details on the program of activities. The Gambia comments the UNCTADSecretariat for organizing the 75th Executive Session of the Trade and Development Board and for the report on item 3, that is the Least Developed Countries Report 2023, Crisis Resilient DevelopmentFinance contained in documents UNCTAD/LDC/2023 and overview. The Gambia supports the statements delivered by the permanent missions of Cambodia and Nepal on behalf of the G77 and China and the Least DevelopedCountries and the African Group respectively. Excellencies, the report certainly will complement efforts in the implementation of the Doha Program of Action for LDCs 2022 to 2031 and it has come at atime when the world is facing multiple challenges of armed conflicts, climate change and irregular migration, UN budgetary challenges, challenging multilateral environment and uncertain and shiftinggeopolitics. In addition, the alarming security threat facing maritime transportation is likely to increase the cost of trade transactions and disruption to supply chains. We take note of theanalysis on the financing gaps for Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement targets in particular for the LDCs. Accordingly, we welcome the recommendation to enable LDCs realize the SustainableDevelopment Goals and to help them rekindle their economies and GDP growth back to pre-COVID-19 level or higher. Distinguished Delegates, the Gambian Delegation acknowledges the recommendations on theinternational financial architecture for LDCs that is inclusive, innovative and adapted to our specific needs and challenges. The LDCs have low and undiversified productive sectors and often lack the capacity andinfrastructure to leverage on market access opportunities and to diversify their businesses and private sectors. Therefore, the importance of adopting financial support systems for the developmentof LDCs cannot be overemphasized as they continue to be heavily reliant on an uneven financial architecture and overseas development assistance. In this regard, it is critical to mobilize adequatefinancial support for LDCs to bridge the financing gaps and enable them to undertake the necessary infrastructure, education and healthcare transformation. Mr. President, climate change crisis continuesto affect LDCs ecosystems, livelihoods and food security. However, we encounter unique bottlenecks such as inadequate resources and susceptibility to external shocks as 17 out of our 20 most vulnerablecountries to climate change are LDCs. The climate change crisis has uneven impacts and it is likely that the LDCs will continue to bear the brunt of this climate crisis even though we contribute the leastto carbon emissions. This is exacerbated by the difficulty of securing meaningful financial commitments to undertake the necessary climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation measures.Allocating climate finance to LDCs is not only an ethical imperative but also a strategic investment in global resilience. Therefore, the Gambia calls on UNCTAD to continue to strengthen, accelerate andintensify our work with LDCs and facilitate our access to climate financing opportunities,technology transfer and diversification of our productive sectors for more inclusive growth and sustainability. In addition, we call on UNCTAD to deepen her efforts on meaningful and value creatingdevelopment to sustainably take root and in particular urgently facilitate for LDCs innovative and pragmatic mechanisms and intervention to rethink and address the debt trap and crisis to equip us with tools,programs, actions and constructive engagements with our donors and partners that will include meaningful debt relief, restructuring, suspension and forgiving to help unshackle LDCs from the escalating debt crisisand compressed fiscal space. This will result to sustainably resituate LDCs to be more responsive to our urgent and diverse socioeconomic needs and requirements for economic revitalization andinvestments. It will also help us decompress the fiscal space and help meaningfully improve the quality of lives of our peoples. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you so much. Thanks,Excellency Ambassador Gambia. And I would like to invite Distinguished Delegate of Portugal. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President, Excellencies, colleagues. Portugal aligns itself with the statementdelivered by the European Union. We thank the Secretariat for its presentation. LDCs are facing the most severe consequences of multiple global crises intensified by the effects of climate changewhich disproportionately impacts them. Portugal has consistently supported the LDCs with many of our key partner countries being part of this group. We are active in both bilateral and multilateral effortsseeking to establish effective partnerships spanning government, civil society and the private sector. Our national development cooperation strategy 2030 gives particular attention to LDCs, their needs andpriorities. As highlighted in the LDCs report, access to finance is essential for the sustainable development and prosperity of LDCs. Through collaborative efforts in our national capacity and within Team Europe,Portugal has been supporting initiatives aimed at enhancing financial support for LDCs. Portugal recognizes the importance of solidarity and cooperation in addressing the unique challenges we are facing.In this context, we emphasize the vital importance of drafting a pact for the future to be adopted at the summit of the future in September 2024. In the process leading up to the summit, there are importanthigh-level events such as the CEEDS IV and LDC Third Conferences in 2024 which will be essential to focus our efforts on sustainable development and will be excellent venues to discuss how we can allstep up our efforts to support the LDCs. Looking forward with the 2030 Agenda in mind, we recall the importance of the FFD4 Conference and, of course, the World Social Summit. We reaffirm our active andconstructive commitment towards financing for development, recalling the importance of implementing the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to achieve the SDGs. This commitment extends from the voluntaryrechanneling of special drawing rights to multilateral developing banks reform and financing as demonstrated by the Paris Summit for a new global financial pact which included the NDV vision statement. Commitmentshave also been reiterated at the annual meetings of the Bretton Woods Institutions in Marrakech, including the evolution roadmap of the World Bank. Portugal has been calling for measures of progress on sustainabledevelopment beyond GDP, including a potential multidimensional vulnerability index as criteria to access concessional finance. In addition to this, we will continue to support our partner countrieswith initiatives such as the investment platform named Lusophone compact implemented with the African Development Bank aimed at accelerating private sector growth and infrastructure development in developingand least developed countries. When it comes to financing for development, we are also seeking innovative measures such as debt conversion as high level debt and servicing costs are preventing LDCsfrom making the necessary investment to tackle climate change. Following the participation of Portugal in Cabo Verde Climate and Environmental Fund through a mechanism of debt for climate swap, we are nowimplementing a similar project with Saint-Domingue and Principe and LDC. The initiative shall support vital sectors including sustainable tourism, the blue economy, digital economy and renewable energy in Saint-Domingue andPrincipe. Capacity building and technical assistance are essential to enhance domestic resilience in LDCs.Therefore, Portugal has been reinforcing its national programs to support the LDCs in areas such as financial systems, enhancing governance structures and promoting sustainable investment practices.Mr. President, while only concerted efforts can produce long lasting and sustainable and sustained impacts, let me stress that Portugal will continue to advocate for the special treatment that LDCs needin different areas of action such as ODA, trade, debt investment, institutional capacity building, governments among others. We look forward to continue our work with the United Nations includingUNCTAD in these topics. Thank you. I thank Distinguished Delegate of Portugal. Now I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegate of Spain. You have the floor. Thank you very much indeed, Mr. President.Mr. Akiwumi, Mr. Davis. Secretary General, Deputy Secretary General, ambassadors, Distinguished Colleagues, we align ourselves with everything that's been said by the European Union but allow me to addthe following thoughts in my national capacity on some of the very many issues covered by this report.We thank UNCTAD for reminding us of the scope of the climate and development needs of these developed countries and for proposing a range of ideas to address them. Spain is fully committed to contributingto this as shown in law 1/2023 of the 20th of February on cooperation for sustainable development and global solidarity. This law obliges us to allocate 0.7% of GNP to ODA by 2030. At the sametime we must bear in mind that the necessary resources for development finance in all its forms are expensivethus channeling additional funding to LDCs through grants over and above what we have all committed to may well depend on the LDCs themselves depending on the individual level of indebtednessof each country. Here there are good practices which may well serve as a source of inspiration such as the LDC specific funding windows of the World Bank which already channel funding to indebted countriesvia grants. However all of these decisions have their pros and cons and ultimately their consequences.While the IDA has said to increase the percentage of the proportion of grants which it dispersesbecause of the level of indebtedness of its clients the shorter the time frame becomes in which it is possible to deploy that strategic capital. We don't support the emergency financing going hand in hand with debt relief because the IDA carries out an ex ante write off granting grants to its indebtedclients and because we haven't managed to pay off the MDI initiatives. However one interesting idea that it might be worthwhile exploring is channeling the special drawing rights through multilateraldevelopment banks. This is preferable rather than the IMF and central banks endangering their mandate of reducing risks to financial stability and monetary stability over stepping the mark of thedevelopment banks. Talking about the financial system we are also doubtful as to the argument that developing uniform climate standards in the financial sector is contrary to the principle of shared differentiated responsibilities because having uniform standards is vital to combat greenwashing. Furthermore the climate funds of the UNFCCC such as the green climate fund must pay a crucialrole but many developing countries are still facing huge obstacles in accessing those funds and sowe need to find a rapid solution to the governance and efficiency problems. For the moment we need to improve coordination of the very many existing funds to prevent them ceasing to finance activitieswhich are not necessarily profitable but which are essential. Lastly as referred to in the report it is essential to mobilize domestic resources of countries, internal resources. The 1st step here is to have a fiscal system which is just and progressive with institutions that are capableof managing it. Without such institutions little can be done to expand the tax basis and we wonderthen whether the issue of the tax exemptions would not apply more to advanced economies rather than LDCs. At the international level we all need to collaborate with the OECD initiatives and the G20such as the BEPS initiative as well as the FATF. Participating constructively in negotiating the terms of reference for a framework convention of the United Nations on international cooperation in taxmatters and its potential early protocols. We will leave our comments on the issue of indebtedness until tomorrow and we will be delighted to continue discussing these issues during the 4th international conference on funding for finance for development which we have the honor of hosting next year. Thankyou very much, Mr. President. I thank Distinguished Delegate of Spain. Now I would like to invitethe Distinguished Delegate of China, you have the floor. Mr. President, colleagues, China supports thestatement made on behalf of Group 77 and China, that is the statement made by Cambodia and by Bangladeshwho spoke on behalf of the Asia Pacific Group. The LDC report of 2023 made an in-depth analysis of variouschallenges facing LDCs including financing difficulties and proposed recommendations on strengthening the effectiveness of assistance to LDCs reforming international financial governance architecture andregional coordination and cooperation. This will help enhance the economic and financial resilience of LDCsand their capacity to cope with the multiple challenges posed by climate change and the food crisis. In March 2023, the UN conference on the LDCs was successfully held. The conference provided a newroadmap for international community to support the LDCs development. China supports UNCTAD in continuing its research and technical cooperation projects on LDCs. China is ready to make efforts in relevant areasand thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of China and I would like to invite theDistinguished Delegate of Palestine. You have the floor. I think we are already in Selamat Sayang.Palestine aligns itself with the statement of G77 and China delivered by Cambodia, the EPG delivered by Bangladesh, LDCs by Nepal, the Arab Group delivered by Egypt and finally the African Group delivered by Nigeras Palestine observer of the African Union. I will start by repeating what some Delegations raised today, commending the excellent work done so far by the Secretariat through the three pillars of UNCTAD andwith the help for sure and assistance of donors and all partners for delivering studies and research that helps our politicians to plan and build our national development strategies. Many thanks foryour presentations. Palestine has no more strategy and the ongoing war and aggression perpetuated by the occupying power of Israel against our people and the destruction of the economic and financial systems,the impact of the war on civilians and the vital infrastructure of all services, health, culture, industry, agriculture, SMEs of the whole besieged Gaza Strip enclave by land, air and sea, all sectorsare destroyed and affected by this war. This is in the Gaza Strip enclave, the socioeconomic situation in the area of the West Bank is not different. As no development project allowed by the occupyingpower of Israel, we have more than 700 Israeli military checkpoints and military gates in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. How can we talk about development without any freedom of movement ofpersons and goods? I think silence here is complicity. Saying that, the UNCTAD has upheld the principles of neutrality and impartiality continuing its valuable work on the socioeconomic development studiesand research and lastly within its mandate, the assessment of the destruction in Gaza, the prospects for economic recovery, excellent report of the EPPU, many thanks to Dr. Rami, Dr. Richard under theguidance and the leadership of Madam Secretary General Greenspan. It is painful to hear sometimes the word self-defense from some countries around the world. We are not anymore on the self-defense norprotection of borders knowing that the legal definition of self-defense is a state self-defense against another state aggression which is not the case in the occupied Palestinian territory. The ongoing waragainst Palestinians is a pure revenge and occupation military operations on an occupied Palestinian territory. Mr. President, Palestine is not anymore in a situation to talk about development or any economicprogress or saying that we are a middle income country or LDC. There is no category of countries or grouping for Palestine right now. We are facing hunger and starvation and ethnic cleansing and continuousde-development with this wanton destruction of life in the OPT. For that we call all donors to review their funding to rebuild what your taxpayers already gives in the past as development projects to thePalestinian people and destroyed by the occupying power of Israel. Billions of dollars and many years needed to rebuild the OPT. Palestine call upon all free nations, the Palestinian people call upon allfree people of this world to stand up for justice and peace. You know why Palestine is calling for that?Simply because humanity has failed. We have to maintain our dignity a little bit. I thank you for listening to our statement and looking forward to see all Delegations working together and confirmingour slogan at UNCTAD very close to our hearts, leaving no one behind and keeping the human being in the centerof our works. The LDC's report and all UNCTAD's reports deserve our deep dive on the findingsto build strong outcomes and agreed conclusions. I would like to invite the Distinguished Delegate ofBrazil. You have the floor. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President of the TDB board, Ambassador FabianHoodyard, Mr. Secretary General of UNCTAD, Rebecca Greenspan that was here with us, excellent Delegates, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. We align ourselves with the statement of G77 China delivered by yourexcellence, Ambassador of Cambodia and with the statement of GRULAC delivered by the Distinguished Delegate of Jamaica. First of all, I would like to express our solidarity with the state of Palestine, with thePalestinian people who are facing the occupation and the ongoing war. It is a tragedy that we collectively arefailing to stop. On the LDC report, 2023, we commend UNCTAD for it. We acknowledge the need for reform inthe international finance architecture in order to mobilize much more funds for development, especially for LDCs. We acknowledge the need for more policy space to be provided by international trade rulesto allow industrial policy for economic diversification, industrialization, to be designed and implemented by Developing Countries, especially LDCs. Mr. President, Brazil acknowledges that the debit trap is real, inparticular for LDCs, but also for several Developing Countries. So debit relief can be a key mechanismfor development. Developed Countries are concerned as well as Developing Countries in a position to do so.We are engaged in the G20 initiative to foster multilateral banks' capacity to finance development.Mr. President, we call for appropriate climate funding, including for sustainable development andeconomic diversification. We hope that the loss and damage fund could become fully operational and effective. In addition, we stress that the transfer of technology is essential to allow DevelopingCountries, in particular LDCs, to achieve sustainable development. In this context, proposals are now being made by the Developing Countries members at WTO, and we call members to actively take part in thediscussions going on there to make SDT provisions under the TRIPS Agreement, e.g. , full operationalfor LDCs. We are right now supporting the graduation process of LDCs to be smooth and sustainable, according to UN resolutions. That's why we support the LDC efforts at WTO to have a ministerial decisionin the MC13 at Abu Dhabi on the Annex 2 of LDCs' smooth graduation, consistent in the extension for a short period of time, three or six years, of already existing flexibilities in the WTO agreements.Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Brazil, and I think this is the last speaker on my list. Now I would like to give the floor to the presenter to respond to several questionsthat have been posed by Delegates. You have the floor. Thank you very much, Chair. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the insightful observations on the LDCreport of 2023 and your continued support and engagement with UNCTAD's work in support of theLeast Developed Countries. It's been useful for us to hear your response to the report, and we willtake note of the emphasis on the uptake of our research and analysis recommendations in the reportas practical technical assistance and partnerships to implement the policy recommendations that you've highlighted, particularly around debt relief, climate finance, investment, ODA, and domestic resourcemobilization. Coming to some of the points that were raised on the floor, I think there were a coupleof points which basically I think focused on or considered, I suppose, specific measures that LDC should think about if they are to begin to extract themselves from the difficult financing and fiscalsituation they are in given the context of cascading crises. I think the report itselftries to highlight the importance of domestic policies which compliment synergistic actions at the international level. I think that's quite an important point to make, especially in the contextof this discourse on international financial architecture. In fact, in the UNCTAD report from2019, we provided an assessment of how LDCs could adapt their national development strategiesto focus more on mobilizing the needed resources to strengthen the relevant institutions and set the right terms to begin to benefit from global partnerships. In a sense, this report takes thatfurther by linking this discussion around the synergy with the international as well as the domestic.I think there were a lot of comments around the reform of international financial architecture. I think it would also be useful just to highlight what I think are some complimentary but positivesigns, I would put it that way, of momentum on a few fronts. First of all, if we think about the reform of the multilateral development banks, I think that's moving. The World Bank has now introduced disaster clauses in its new loans and this is very much in line with one of the recommendations of theLDC report for 2023. The reform of international financial architecture is increasingly reflected in international development discourse and we have seen that, e.g. , as highlighted in the recent UN Secretary General's policy brief on reform of the financial architecture to achieve new forms ofcooperation but also it is reflected in the Bridgetown covenant. It is also reflected in other reports, including the most recent trade and development report. Thirdly, I think the loss and damage fund,which has just been operationalized at COP 28, if properly implemented, has the potential to enhance climate finance resource provision in the LDCs. There was also a question, a couple of questions, Isuppose, that relate to the kind of industrial policies that LDCs need to pursue in light of some of the recommendations that we made. I would just like to highlight there that UNCTAD in general but I guessalso the division for globalization and development has a longstanding engagement on industrial policy issues. Just thinking about this in the context of the Africa and Least Developed Countries division ofwhich I'm a part, we have begun to address these issues by focusing on the LDCs and so, e.g. ,we have launched a project which is seeking to address these industrial policy issues for the benefit of the five LDCs that are prequalified in 2021 for graduation. Now, the lessons learned from that kindof work, some of which articulated in the UN General Assembly mandated vulnerability profiles which this division is required to produce will benefit, we hope, all LDCs. In addition, the division is continuingto refine the productive capacities index and its related work on national productive capacity gap analyses and we are also fostering new partnerships focusing on industrial policy and capacity developmentin LDCs and such as with the OECD and national governments through the development of production transformation policy reviews which provide industrial policy assessments but also quite detailed guidancetools at the national level. So we are beginning to try and take on board the importance of turning elements of the recommendations that we make into actual technical assistance and some guidance forthe LDCs. If leave no one behind is to be more than an empty slogan, then a more comprehensive visionof sustainable finance and development for LDCs needs to be articulated and we hope that the LDC report of 2023 has at least contributed in part to that policy dialogue. I would like to conclude byagain thanking you all for your insightful comments and statements. We are taking note and we look forward to your continued engagement and support in delivering as UNCTAD for the Least Developed Countries and with that, I thank you for your kind attention and hand back to the Chair. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Thankyou for your clarification and response. Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies, we will reconvene this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. to take up item 5, 6 and 9 and the Vice President will Chair the next session.Now I declare the meeting is adjourned. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good morning. I call to order meeting No. 3 of the 75th session of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It is my great pleasure to welcome the Distinguished Delegation of Romania, in particularly the head of Delegation, His Excellency Mr. Traian Hrestia, State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who will deliver the opening statement and I believe the Ambassador has hisExcellence Ambassador Razvan Rusu, permanent representative of Romania and the United Nations office in Geneva has just come in. Very warm welcome to him as well and to the Distinguished Members of the Delegation of Romania. I would also like to welcome all those observing this dialogue through webcast. Before giving the floor to the Delegation for the consideration of the 6th periodic report of Romania, I would like to outline the methodology we will follow for thedialogue today and tomorrow. We have prepared a sheet with the proposed speaking times which Your Excellency I shared with you for the dialogue which will be conducted following the four clusters of our covenant led by the Committee members constituting the task force for Romania for this review. The initial questions will be posed by the country rapporteur and lead member of this cluster that is dealing with the articles fund1 to 5 of the covenant and that's my colleague Ms. Carla Lemus Vasquez. Other members may pose follow-up questions afterwards. Other members of the task force are Ms. Ju Yong Lee who will deal with cluster 2 which is articles 6 to 9 of the covenant. Mr. Mohamed Amarti is here, cluster 3, articles 10 to 12 and then Mr. Aslan Abashidze,who will deal with cluster 4, 13 to 15. The 3rd cluster, Your Excellency, will be dealt with by my colleague Mr. Ludwig Hennebel. The Delegation and members of this Committee are kindly requested to speak at a reasonable pace and to provide any written material that will be read out by the Delegation to the Secretariat. We have a limited time and so in the interest of time,we have a timer out there on the monitor which will keep track of the time for all the speakers and so it is requested that the speakers who take the floor kindly also pay attention to the time allotted. To facilitate this process and to enable us to cover the full range of issues at hand, I would like to invite my colleagues in the Distinguished Delegation to speak in a concise manner giving due attention to the time allocations. With this,I have the pleasure to give you the floor, Your Excellency, to deliver the opening statement. You have, Your Excellency, 10 min for that. Thank you. Madam Chairperson, thank you very much, Distinguished Members of the Committee. It is my great pleasure to be here today leading the Romanian Delegation for this interactive dialogue on Romania's periodic report and subsequent list of issues. I will benefit of the support of Ambassador Razvan Rusu, our permanent representative to the UnitedNations in Geneva as well as from the high level representatives from the National Council for Combating Discrimination, Mr. Astalos Chaba, its President, the National Agency for Roma, President Julian Paraschiv, the Department for Internet Relations, Mr. Dinser Jaffer, Undersecretary of State, the Ministry of Culture represented by its Undersecretary, Mrs. Irina Sanda Kajalmarin and the Ministry of Labor and Social Solidarity represented by its Deputy Secretary General, Mrs. Gabriella Nika. We are joined by colleagues from manydomestic institutions and ministries as a clear sign of our engagement in this exercise. In my intervention, I will introduce you to some of the main aspects characterizing the current human rights situation in my country. Since the transmission of our report and the responses to the list of issues, we have achieved significant progress in our efforts of promoting and protecting human rights at national, regional and global levels while battling like so many other countries subsequent crises. The exchange we willsubsequently have will allow me and my colleagues to explore in more depth the realization of rights covered by the Convenant. Madam Chair, it is already an understatement to refer to the last years as being challenging firstly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards following Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. This crisis required urgent and decisive whole of government reactions focusing on immediate and medium termeffects that firstly the pandemic and subsequently the war against our neighboring country had on human rights and fundamental freedoms of Romanian citizens, on individuals under Romanian jurisdiction and on people in serious, sometimes vital need for protection. For Romania also, the pandemic meant not only fighting for the life and health of our citizens but also for the well-being, supporting financially the parents during the closure of thechildren's school, adopting measures to alleviate the burden on employers and employees during the suspension of business activities, transitioning to online education, work and life. Administration, justice, social and healthcare were moved online and from this perspective, the technological impact and the creativity in its application revealed amidst hard times the solution of a much needed recovery. The outbreak of the war in Ukraine required from neighboring countriesat 1st and onwards for Europe to provide a safe space for persons displaced because of this illegal war. Over 7 million Ukrainian citizens crossed Romanian borders since the end of February 2022, of which over 2.5 million benefited from direct support from the government of Romania or from the support of our partners. This can be seen in the resources allocated for ensuring basic needs as well as for theirprotection and inclusion in our communities. Over 650 million Euros were allocated from the budget of state and international partners. Six ministries were involved in the national plan of medium and long-term measures and more than 20 laws were amended and adopted for the management of displaced persons from Ukraine. More than 1,500 local authorities and 300 nongovernmental organizations were involved in providing direct support torefugees from Ukraine. Madam Chair, Distinguished Members of the Committee, at the same time against the less optimistic odds, the last years were fruitful for completing and renewing the Romanian institutional architecture and human rights legislation. Vital national strategies and other national pragmatic documents were adopted or renewed and I will briefly point to the most important ones structured around six vital themes. During the dialogue, my colleagues will offer you more detailed insights into their content. Preventing andcombating discrimination 1st remains central in our human rights policies. On May 13, 2021, the Romanian government formally adopted the 1st national strategy for preventing and combating anti-Semitism, xenophobia and its action plan. In 2022, building on the previous programmatic documents, we adopted a new strategy for the inclusion of the Romanian citizens belonging to Roma minoritywhich introduced a mechanism of interinstitutional cooperation between relevant ministries to ensure an integrated approach recommended for years by the civil society and reporting and monitoring mechanism. Combating harassment at the workplace remains a priority for the Romanian government. The ratification process of the ILO Convention No. 1190 already reached the Parliament. Our authorities developed meanwhile and approved a guide model for central andlocal military and civil public institutions as well for the private companies together with its application methodology, thus addressing concrete intervention measures to combat moral harassment at work. The most recent strategy for promoting equal opportunities for women and men and combating domestic violence was based on a thorough analysis evaluating the situation of women in the countries. This strategy covers the period 2020 to 2027 and aims at improving the generallevel of equal opportunities by addressing the specific situations particular groups are facing and promoting targeted interventions. Preventing sexual violence through education, training and awareness raising at all levels is also strategically approached. Two other programmatic documents for combating poverty and promotion of social inclusion were adopted in 2022, namely the national strategies for social inclusion and poverty reduction and on social inclusions of homeless people. Ensuring a decentstandard of living is a transfer to all national policies, but notably in ensuring active and dignified aging. The 2023 law on reforming the public retirement system carefully balanced full contribution and respect for dignity. In addition to more decent pension revenues, the 2022 national strategy on long-term care and active aging for the period 2020 to 2030 lists the development of a network of new 71 day care and recoverycenters for elderly with mobile home care teams. The strategy for the protection of children's rights, another document covering the period between 2023, 2027 focuses as well on supporting children living in poverty and social exclusion through development of integrated services for vulnerable children and their family. The summer of 2023 also saw the adoption of new laws for undergraduate and higher education prioritizing a safe, sound and inclusive education for all age groups in the country. The 2023 law on reforming the public retirement systemand the educational environment on the respect of each student's rights and needs. The educational system will be aligned with the educational, social and emotional needs of students and, of course, the targets, provisions and measures are aimed at enhancing the quality of education and improving pupils' learning outcomes by focusing on competence building, including functional literacy and digital skills and ensuring equality of chances, equity and support for participation andin education from primary beneficiaries belonging to disadvantaged group and dropout risk and, of course, the transformation of the technical and vocational education. The law on higher education also puts a great emphasis on the ensuring equity in supporting participatingin higher education of students belonging to disadvantaged group. Romania is currently comfort with negative trends in the population's health to list reduced birth rates, lower lifeexpectancy, high preventable death tolls, obesity and low performance of the health systems to list the central elements of the new health strategy built on. As such, the document shifts the focus from the unilateral perception of the patient to putting in its center the individualwith its multidimensional needs, strengthening the preventive approach and the intervention for a better environmental quality. The strategy is complemented by other strategies on preventing and monitoring HIV infections and the national action plan for combating cancer. The effectson corruption on the enjoyment of human rights are also well documented. Our current anti-corruption strategy adapts the measures to current challenges and deals with corruption in the health sector and in protecting the environment, an objective which is more imperative than ever given theimpact on climate change on human rights. Romania's goal as expressed in the long-term strategy for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from 2023 is to achieve climate neutrality by the year 2050 and in January last year we adopted the 1st national strategy on environmentaland climate change education which promotes greening of education throughout pre-university education. Madam Chair, mindful of the allocated and overpassed already the time slot by a few seconds, in respect of the schedule I will end here my preliminary remarks and during our dialoguemy colleagues and I will bring many substantial compliments to this non-exhaustive opening introduction. We look forward to today's and tomorrow's sessions and to providing responsesto your questions. Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Excellency, and thank you for keeping to the time. I know it has been quite precise. I would now request my colleague Ms. Carla LemusDeVoskis to kindly take the lead in posing questions under Article 1 to 5. Ms. Lemus, you have thefloor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Minister, Ambassador, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Honorable Delegation of Romania, on behalf of the Working Group responsible forpreparing this dialogue I would like to extend to you cordial greetings. I want to thank you for being here and for bringing with you such a high level experience Delegation which I think augurs for a frank constructive dialogue based on the information provided to us in your countryreport and in your replies to the list of issues regarding the 6th periodic report. We are also grateful to all stakeholders who have provided us with inputs and information in preparingfor this dialogue. From our point of view, and we trust that you can share this idea, thisdialogue isn't just confined to these two days but rather we have a long-term goal, a shared mission which is that of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights. Thereforeit is in our interest that the concluding observations that stem from this dialogue be relevant so that the state can build on its efforts to ensure full enjoyment and exercise of economic, social,cultural rights of its population. Along those lines it is our goal for this dialogue to give you the opportunity and to ourselves also to elaborate on actions related to the state'sobligations and responsibilities to live up to the commitments acquired as a state partyto our covenant. As the Chair explained, we have a working methodology that allows us to split up, for us to divide into four groups of four experts to prepare for the dialogue. Itfalls on me to address the issues raised under Articles 1 to 5 of the covenant linked to generaland cross-cutting themes such as national implementation of our covenant, non-discrimination, maximum use of available resources among other themes. First of all, questions on the internal implementationof the covenant. Paragraph 3 of your replies to the list of issues, you say that training activities that have been carried out are reflected in better awareness or knowledge of the covenantand that since 2011, the provisions of our covenant have been invoked by courts or by parties in more than 1,770 cases. We would be grateful if you could explain to us what is the legal natureof the observations adopted by the committees created pursuant to international Treaties, the Treaty bodies and specifically our covenant within the national legal heritage. What measureshave been taken to motivate internal implementation of the covenant for the goal of raising awareness of it among judges, lawyers and human rights defenders? What efforts have been made to ratifythe optional protocol to our covenant? And what have been the obstacles you faced or the reasonsthat have impeded this process? Secondly, on the mandate of the Romanian Human Rights Institute, Paragraph 2 of our list of issues, we asked for information on the mandate of that instituteto promote and protect and specifically economic social cultural rights. We also asked for information on measures adopted so that the institute can live up to its mandate effectively and independentlyfully respecting the Paris principles. What is the mandate of the Romanian Human Rights Institute to promote and protect economic social cultural rights? Can you provide information or examplesof certain cases where the institute has acted to promote and/or protect such rights? What measures have been applied to strengthen the independence, impartiality and the operational effectiveness of the institute? Has it received sufficient resources to carry out its mandateto function properly? What measures have been established so that the mandate of the institute corresponds to the requirements of the Paris principles? You mentioned in your replies that the institute initiated in 2019 action towards accreditation in line with those principles.What progress has been made and what level of coordination exists between the institute and other human rights institutions such as the National Council Against Discrimination on ClimateChange and Environmental Degradation? Paragraph 7 of your replies, you say that Romania has complied with its obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that currently it is reviewingits national strategy on climate change with the goal of drawing up a new adaptation strategy up to 2030 while also working on a long-term strategy in parallel with the review of thenational climate energy plan. In your opening statement you stated that in January 2023 Romania adopted its 1st national strategy on climate change and environmental education. Since thisis the 1st time that Romania has such a strategy, can you provide more information on the goals, scope and outcomes that you hope from its implementation? When it comes to the review of the nationalclimate energy plan, we would be grateful if you could provide information about this process, this review process, what have been the results so far, what measures will be implemented basedon the findings of that review? Maximum use of available resources with a view to assessing whether the state party is making the most of the resources it has to give effect to rightsin the covenant. We would like to know what measures have been taken to increase public spending as a percentage of GDP, what measures have been implemented or are planned to beimplemented to improve the administrative capacity and transparency in assigning budgets. Turning to corruption, in general in Western Europe and throughout the European Union accordingto information that we have, the situation is said to be getting worse and according to a transparency international report 2023 on combating corruption, the data is not very encouraging.Paragraph 6 of the list of issues, we asked for information on the outcomes of legislative measures and policies adopted by the state to combat corruption in the public sector, especiallywhen it comes to the health sector and we also ask you to tell us what challenges have stood in the way of implementation of such measures and what measures have been adopted to overcome those challenges. In your replies in Paris 25 to 27, you say that the government approveda national anti-corruption strategy 2021/25 and its related documents. The strategy identifies the priority sectors as being the health care system, educational system, business, publicrecruitment, et cetera. In that respect, could you provide information on cases of corruption that have been brought, investigations, proceedings, providing annual statistical data and convictionsand rulings against perpetrators and also could you provide information on measures adopted to combat corruption in the private sector and also with regards to combating illicit financialflows? The late sluggish legislative response has led we know to the closure of certain cases of corruption and the repeal of certain convictions. What measures have been taken to bolster therole of the national integrity agency as the line authority for receiving complaints? Does that agency have sufficient resources and budget to function properly? Turning to inequality,Romania has the 2nd lowest GDP per capita in the EU. Poverty and inequality continue to be relatively high. In territorial terms, economic development of the regions has been unequalsince economic progress has been swifter in the capital. Now, what measures are being implemented to promote greater equality between the regions and urban and rural areas? What measures have been launched to provide greater administrative support to the least developed regions and toimprove the effectiveness of investment? With respect to nondiscrimination, 1st of all, I would refer to structural discrimination against the Roma population provided for in No. 7 ofour list of issues. As part of the national Roma inclusion strategy 2015/2020, what specific measures have been implemented to combat structural discrimination against the Roma population inlight of the challenges identified in implementation of the national strategy? You say in reply 28 that progress has been moderate in implementing that strategy and that there are still difficultieswhen it comes to access to the labour market, to social housing and collection of data. This is paragraph 28, you say that. What action has been implemented to improve the situation of the Roma population when it comes to enjoyment of those rights and what measures have been implementedto improve the follow-up and assessment mechanism of that national strategy? Paragraph 9 of our LOIs, we refer to progress made by the state to combat discrimination on grounds of sexualorientation and gender identity. What measures have been adopted to implement the recent ruling of January 2021 of the European Human Rights Tribunal on recognizing gender identity of transgenderpersons? What measures have been taken to train and educate personnel from judicial and administrative institutions who have attributes related to issues of gender identity? Finally, equalitybetween men and women. Paragraphs 36 to 39 in the replies to the list of issues, you mention sudden progress in promoting greater representation of women in decision-making posts, in particularin central public administration and gender representation in the parliamentary elections. What measures have been launched to promote representation of women in decision-making posts both in thepublic and private sectors? Could you please elaborate what measures have been taken to bridge the gender gap when it comes to participation in the labour market and in the workplace and how effective have those measures been? In the interests of time, I will leave my stop my questionsthere. I want to thank in advance the Delegation for all replies that they can provide to the Committee. I look forward to hearing all the information that they can give to us. I thankyou. Thank you so much, Your Excellency. You have requested for a five-minute break just to organize your work in terms of responding to the questions posed in the 1st clusterby my colleagues. We will just adjourn the meeting for 5 min . I will request Your Excellency,Mr. Triane Christia, State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to kindly respond to the questions that were posed by my colleague under cluster 1 of the covenant. You have the floor, Your Excellency. I just thought I would let you know that we have about half an hour. You would have half an hour,you and your Delegation, to respond to the initial questions. Thank you. Definitely. Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. First and foremost, I would really like to take this opportunity to thank Madam Vasquez for quite an impressive number of questions we received. We will tryto go in answering in a harmonized, I would say, way, meaning that we will not answer exactly in the same order of the questions that were put in. We will take the opportunity to myselfI would say a few words and to give the floor to the colleagues here present in the room to compliment the answers. Definitely, the covenant is part of the national implementation frameworkbecause it's an inspiration source and the source of principles and values that are being reflected in the national constitution of Romania in the body of law that are organic laws, some of them,and definitely subsequent legislative acts that were adopted in Romania during the transition period. I would also like to mention that from that perspective, this chapter of economic, social andcultural rights as interesting as it may be are also part of the review program of the Romanian government in its accession exercise to the OECD. So permanently the provisions of the pact,the obligations that are assumed by Romania within the Council of Europe, within the European Union, and now in the process of negotiation of accession of the OECD are being taken very seriously intoaccount. In terms of ratification of a certain conventional instruments, the ratification ofconvention on the elimination of violence and harassment is pending. The draft law is already presented before the Parliament and as regards the protocol on the convenant on the ESCR, further institutional consultations are necessary because several domestic institutions and ministries coverin their mandate some of economic, social and cultural rights or with teams affecting these rights. As such, before any decision on ratification, it is essential to evaluate the manner in which the future individual communications can be dealt with in a coordinated and efficient and effective way.Definitely here I would also like to underline that this is not a dilatory tactics. On the contrary, it is a tactics of allotting who is who doing what and in what synergy with the other institutions. Sothis analysis is very seriously undertaken on the governmental area. On the on the national humanrights institutions and accreditation of the national human rights institutions in accordance with the Paris principles, 1st I would like to state from the outset that the person is an autonomous and independent public authority stipulated in the constitution. According to his governing law,the institution is a national institution for promotion and protection of all human rights as established by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of December 93 adopting theParis principles. As such, in 2018, the institution initiated the demarches to register for accreditation as a national human rights institution before the subcommittee on accreditation. The Romanian Institute for Human Rights is an independent organism under parliamentary control and its mission is to raiseawareness through reports, studies and training of public entities, nongovernmental organizations and individuals on the all human rights issues. It can provide the Parliament background informationon the projects of law on the docket of its commissions and dedicated to various research projects on different aspects of the protection and promotion on human rights worldwide and in Romania. And the institute also requested accreditation as a national human rights institution. Giventhat both the Ombudsman and the Romanian Institute for Human Rights requested accreditation beforethe UN subcommittee responsible for the accreditation of human rights institutions, the domestic authorities plead for identification of a formula that is respectful of the subcommittee's rules and atthe same time allows for maximizing the national institution's mission and cooperation. The mandateof both Ombudsperson and the Romanian Human Rights Institute covers all human rights. The Ombudsperson covers individual rights pertaining to social protection, family and youth protection, health,education, to give you some examples. Likewise, the institute dedicated studies on women's rights, education, social protection, rights of persons with disabilities. Along these two institutions, Romania also has an equality body which is the national council for combating discrimination whosepresident is here present today and that can provide additional information on the council mandate.Regarding to the trainings on the field of human rights and non-discrimination on the Convent, in each cases for the stakeholders, human rights cases, the 1st question is what kind ofsource of law that we use when we have cases and for sure we have at least three source of laws.First of all, the source of laws from the level of UN and the Convent, it is a source of law. Then after we have the regional source of laws, Treaties and Convents from the level of Council of Europe andthen the ACU from European Union and after that we have the source of law of domestic source of law. Allof these are a complementary system that were created, was created in time. At all levels, at the level ofUniversities and after that at the National Institute for Magistrate for judges and prosecutors, there arecourses on regarding to the Convent and we train judges, prosecutors, police, civil servants on how tointerpretate and how to apply the Convent. We can see this on the case law of the courts where the provision ofthe Convent are used as being a source of law. The legal nature in the national legal heritage, the legal nature ofthe Convent is important in our domestic system because it is mandatory for judges and prosecutors and fromthis perspective we use the Convent. Regarding to the relations between the national, the Romanian human rights institution andthe National Council for combating discrimination, this partnership, we have different activities. National Council forcombating discrimination is an equality body under the parliamentary control and we are a law enforcement agency and we are we adopt legally binding decision and we have the power to apply sanctions in case of discrimination. In comparison with the Romanian Institute for human rights, they have competencies in just in the field of promotion ofthe human rights and, of course, non-discrimination and they adopt different reports, surveys and recommendations but they have also the power to submit complaints to the National Council for combating discrimination. We have a constructive partnership because the goals are the sameand we work together in different trainings and conferences. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Now I would like to give the floor to the national agency on equality of chances and opportunity to report on the women representation and connected areas. Please, you have the floor. Thank you. Regarding thethe field of domestic violence and violence against women, the continuous training of all categories of professionals were carried out in the last years. Approximately 4,000 policemen, 350 social workers, 200 judges, 200 prosecutors, 1500 workers in mobile teams. In 2023, through different partnerships with international institutions, trainingswere organized for professionals on the management of sexual violence situations and case management for victims. Approximately 300 trained professionals. In the period of 2022, 2023, more than 900 police officers were trained, training of police officers from public order structures regarding friendly intervention and work procedures with the victims of domestic violence andtheir children, issues and enforcement of temporary protection orders. Regarding gender equality, we annually collect data on women and men in decision making positions in the central public administration. At the central level in 2022, there were 751 decision making positions of which 119 were vacant, so the occupancy rate being around 84%Decision making positions in the central public administration were occupied in equal proportions by both sexes. So in the last five years, there have been slight fluctuations in the percentages compared to 2021. In 2022, women recorded slight decrease, around 50% from 53% in 2021. The national strategy regarding the promotion of gender equality and preventingand combating domestic violence for the period 2022-2027 stipulates objectives and measures for improving women and men participation in decision process, appointing some of them, obtaining an analyst regarding the participation of women and men in the decision positions, organizing learning sessions in leadership for the political parties, women, sustaining initiatives for adopting affirmative measures, especially zipperquota, and creating support networks which contributes to increase the access of women in decisional positions in public or private domains. Also, the national strategy regarding the promotion of gender equality for 2022-2027 on labor market, we have as objective ensuring equal opportunities between women and men in the labor market, especially in terms of employment rate, income, and fields of employment. Amongthe main actions that have taken place in the last two years by national agency for gender equality, we had awareness raising campaigns for the promotion of gender equality under the auspices of week of gender equality and a series of seminars were organized that touched several topics like promotion of women in decision making positions, worldwide balance actions or integrating the gender perspective in the field of education. Thank you.I would like to give the floor for the national agency on Roma on the issue on the non-discrimination and issues related to the Roma population. Mr. Chairman, you have the floor. Mr. President.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to mention that the Romanian parliament has adopted the law number 2 in 2021 for preventing and combating anti-gypsies. This law is defining the anti-gypsies and provides persuasive measures for combating and anti-Roma attitudes actions such as definition of anti-Roma attitudes, boththe perception of Roma expressed as hatred against them, verbal or physical manifestations motivated by hatred against Roma, direct against Roma or their properties, against Roma representative institutions or NGOs, leaders of Roma communities or their places of worship, traditions and the Romanian language. Definition of anti-Roma organization is any group made of three or more people who carry out theiractivity temporary or permanently in order to promote anti-Roma ideas, conception of doctrines. This category can include organization with or without legal personality, political parties, and movements, associations and foundation, commercial companies. The national Roma inclusion strategy has comprehensive measures in the fields of education, healthcare, employment and housing. Along with dedicated measures aimed and combat to the protection of Roma, we have thealong with dedicated measures aimed at combating discrimination and hate speech as well as promoting the Roma contribution to the Romanian society to role models and change extent of making more visible the Roma history and reconciliation with the past promoting Roma traditions, languageand cultural heritage. This strategy has both mainstreamed and targeted policy measures aimed at Roma inclusion and it's synergic with other national strategies in place, strategy for employment and for social inclusion and poverty reduction, strategy for housing andthe national strategy for health care. All the measures within the strategy above mentioned are approaching both sectoral and interdisciplinary ratio of socioeconomic disparities and discriminationof Roma of other vulnerable people. And just one point that I want to mention is that Romania I think is the only country from the EU and not only that has two institutions on centralgovernmental points, national agency for Roma and also national center for culture. So that'sa point that I want to mention. Thank you. I would like now to give the floor to the laborand social solidarity ministry on poverty eradication. In the area of social services and poverty reduction the ministry of labor and social solidarity has constantly been involved in analyzing andimproving the legislative framework and financing from the state budget and European funds to increase the capacity of the public social assistance services to provide social services and to tackle the gaps between rural and urban and thus improving access to social servicesof which we highlight the following. From the state budget we have special financial programs such as the national programs of interest currently being under implementation for the developmentof public and private social services for over 5,000 vulnerable elderly and persons in the rural areas and small towns. The eligible applicants are the public social assistance services, thelevel of communes and cities with a population of less than 20,000 inhabitants and until December2023 a number of 71 social services were set up already. From European funds Romania implemented a series of projects to increase the social inclusion of vulnerable people aiming also at strengtheningthe public network of community social assistance as well as to creating and implementing the integrated provision of social medical educational services for poverty reduction and social economic integrationof people from marginalized communities including those with Roma population. I can give as an example the project creating and implementing integrated community services for poverty reductionand social exclusion in 149 vulnerable rural and small urban communities and also the project aiming at the development of the social assistance system for combating poverty and social exclusionby strengthening the technical and administrative capacity of the public community social assistance network. Also the recently revised strategic framework in the field of social inclusion prioritizes the development of integrated community services provided through integrated community teamsin rural and small urban areas with marginalized communities and the development of social services such as day care and recovery centers, home care services, adaptive social housing, support of informal care as measures that can prevent or reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusionfor elderly. I can say that in this sense the ministry intends to continue in the next period the implementation of financing programs for social services sector including those that providelong-term care for the elderly from the state budget and from the European funds as well includingthe national recovery and resilience plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would kindly recommendthe experts to introduce themselves when I give them the floor. On the budgetary aspects I would give the floor to the Ministry of Local Development, Public Works and Public Administration. Thankyou. Can you hear me? I'm from the Ministry of Development, Public Works and Administration.Concerning the budgets, the improvement of administrative capacity, I can tell you very briefly that there is a balancing of the local budgets for areas with lower capacity. So actuallyit's a redistribution of the incomes coming from VAT and other national taxes. They are redistributedto local administration so that they can function. And also for our programs, our ministry's programs for local development, the local income has been a criteria in allocating, meaning that when weallocated the funds to counties, counties are not free. So they are at the regional level with administration. So the allocation was higher for the counties with lower incomes based on the formulawhich we used. Concerning the transparency, we can say that the data concerning the income and the expenses of local budgets are public for over 20 years. And they also include the figures on expenses ontypes of expenses such as culture or well, I can, culture, social assistance, housing, publicdevelopment, environmental protection, health, education and so on. And also we have a project for anadministrative procedure code which will establish the applicable regime for contracts, administrative acts and contracts including by eGovernment solutions so that we can facilitate the access of citizens topublic administration and to increase the transparency and efficiency of public institutions. So that's it for the budget side. Thank you. On the budget side, I will come back with additional information and I will speak about the environment. So we will have additional figures dedicated to that. Now I wouldlike to take this opportunity to come on the Ministry of Education. I was wants to complete Ministry of Education. Just sorry for that. Okay. I will give the floor to the Ministry of Education then on the budget.Thank you. Okay. Thank you. My name is Alexandra from the Ministry of Education and we would like to respond to the question on the national strategy regarding climate change. In January 2023, Romania adopted its1st national strategy on environmental and climate change education for the period 2023-2030 which promotes the greening of education throughout general education. The objectives and measures envisaged bythe strategy cover several areas, formal and nonformal education, human resources including teacher training, investment, creation of open education resources partnerships and the four strands of actiontargeted by the strategy are implementation of a national environment and climate education program, creation and use of educational resources, rehabilitation of infrastructure for sustainable schools andtraining of human resources involved in environmental and climate change education. The strategies foresees the creation of a network of green schools which will be supported financially for the national recoveryand resilience plan. In this same to this scope, a framework methodology on the organization and functioning of these green schools was adopted in June 2022 and foresees that green schools implementmeasures to ensure a sustainable school infrastructure as well as implement a curriculum that incorporatescontent about and for climate and environment integrated in a cross-curricular manner in all years of study. And also as an element of innovation, the national program green week has been introduced andhas already been implemented in the school year 2023. And during this green week, all schoolsorganize activities related to climate change and the environment exclusively and the program has a duration of five consecutive days and can be organized during the school year. Thank you.I see we have 3 min . So the question is still to be covered and definitely we have to try to do our best. I would like to refer to the gender identity measures to train the judges on measures to implementing the X and Y judgments. On this implementation, the compelling majority of domesticcase law applied directly after the judgment was delivered. The European standards did not condition the gender recognition on prior surgical intervention. The authorities made a working visit to Portugal to study the legal gender recognition model applied by the later country and the person together withthe accept association and the prosecutor general office initiated in 2022 a working group on the implementation on the European court on human rights rulings on the rights of the LGBTI persons inRomania. This working group contains all stakeholders in the matter including governmental institutions and NGOs and in all these meetings the participants are invited to debate and agree on the most appropriate measures for the implementation of the court's judgments against Romania. Both the national council of combating discrimination and the national audiovisual council are consistent with theirlatest calls and section on homophobic speeches and broadcasts and here Mr. Astalos, the president of the former council can provide additional input on the council. Thank you. I will try to speak slowlybecause I think that the translators are very happy with us. Regarding the question of the trainings,if there were trainings delivered to the judges and prosecutors after the decision of European court of human rights or gender identity, I can inform you that the public ministry, the prosecutor officein partnership with the most relevant NGO on the field in Romania accepted. They implemented a project,two years project since December 2021, November 2023. It's called partnership for equality of LGBT person implementation of HR jurisprudence on sexual orientation and gender identity. One of the activitiesin this project were about trainings delivered for judges, prosecutors and police officersto train them in the case law of European court of human rights in the field. And in two years, theywere delivered training for more than 500 judges, prosecutors and police officers. And also in thisactivity, as opposed to organized training, TOT training, the aim is to create the own resources for justice system to have trainers, their own trainers in the field for the future. And the same,it was the goal for to create the own resources for police. These trainings are targeted also how tomanage cases, hate crime cases directed against LGBTI people and it was very successful and that we cansee on the results on the case law in the last years in the field. Thank you very much. Is there anythingimportant that you want to address right now? Actually, I wanted to go on the environment, but that will come after because that will be an important topic to be asked. It will take a little bit longer.So thank you so much, Your Excellency, for showing your understanding about the timing. I have been informed by the leader of the Delegation that they do have residual responses, particularly on the issues of environment that were raised by the country under Cluster 1 and perhaps in the follow-up questionsand the responses to them, the Delegation will try to respond to some of these. So what we could do is now request our Committee colleagues to perhaps address follow-up questions that you might have under Cluster 1 and I will open the floor. But since, Your Excellency, I have the floor myself at themoment, just to save time, I thought I would take the 1st one while colleagues think of and kindly indicate who all wish to raise questions. So my question really relates to Article 2, Paragraph 1of the covenant, which talks about international cooperation and assistance. And I would like to draw your attention to the concluding observations of the last review of the State Party where it hadbeen mentioned in our concluding observations that the State Party increased its official development assistance with a view to achieving international commitment of 0.7% of its gross national product. So I wanted to know from you what have been the efforts and have we been able to achieve that target thatwe have all put to ourselves. So that would be my 1st question. But I also see that Ms. Zhu YongLee and Mr. Santiago Fiorio also have questions. So I will give the floor to them in that order.Ms. Zhu Yong Lee, you have the floor 1st . Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Your Excellency and the Distinguished Members of the Delegation. I would like to pose a follow-up question on economicinequality. I note that the State Party has not provided the information on the level of income inequality and the level of wealth inequality which we asked in the list of issues at Paragraph 5B and C.Could you please provide information on the level of income and wealth inequality in a manner that we asked in the list of issues? And also according to the State Party's reply to the list of issues onParagraph 5E, taxation, the personal income tax is set at 10% since 2017 regardless of income levels.Given the high economic inequality persisting in the society, does the State Party have plans to enhance the progressivity of the tax system by such measures as the introduction of progressive incometaxes and further differentiation of the value added tax by the nature of commodities and services? Thank you. And I look forward to hearing your responses. Thank you, Ms. Lee. And Mr. Santiago Fiorio, you havethe floor. Thank you very much for giving me the floor. Two quick questions 1st . Duringthe list of organizations set out in the prepared report, there are many institutionsthat have an impact that work with human rights. Nevertheless, I would like to ask the Delegationwithin the drafting process, what is the institution that has the main mandate when it comes to followup an implementation of international recommendations received by the state from the Treaty bodies?Especially I would like to know is the specific office that is tasked with monitoring of implementation?Second question is in para 2 of the report in the introductory observations. It says that the reportwas subject to a public debate before being approved by the government. I'm very grateful, therefore,that the Delegations could inform us if the report was also shared with representatives of minorities inRomania. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Fiorio. Are there any other requests for the floor? Yes. I see Ms.Julieta Rossi, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you very much to the Delegation.For the information provided so far, I would like to endorse Yu Yang's question about the composition of income for the state in particular, the positive state. If you could give us information about thescope of indirect and direct taxation and if you can provide information if people with the greatest income, do they proportionally pay more tax than people with lower income? Are there also specifictaxes on tax and fortune? Are there taxes on the bigger companies and on multinational companies?And have they also included taxes or does the tax system have do they promote conversion of energysystems from fossil fuels to move towards clean energies? Also analysis on the impact of tax onindividuals and marginalized groups and the impact that the current tax system has in Romania. And withrespect to that theme, what is the scope of tax evasion in particular when it comes to high income peopleand the biggest companies and the largest corporations, multinational corporations? And a 2nd question is to do with gender equality. I would like to ask you about what measures have been taken by the statewith a view to recognizing reduction and redistribution of women's nonremunerated work such asincreasing availability of child, accessible, affordable child care and other care policies and also to promote participation of men when it comes to domestic tasks by, e.g. , granting parentalpermits and shared permits or licenses. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Rossi. The floor is still open in case there are any requests. I see none at this stage. So I will perhaps then turn to theleader of the Delegation to respond to the four sets of questions and also to respond to the residual responses. Yes. Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Indeed, as you mentioned, I will try totake the answers from different questions here and I will take on this international obligations, ODA particularly and on taxation. For the questions on taxation, I would like to mention that when we will speak the budget, for instance, for the fossil fuels and promotion from the fossil fuels to theclean energy, I will refer to the environment part and the budgetary and tax issues, there is a part of the question or the answer there. So it will not be exactly pending on the question but rest assured that you will get the answer as it is. On the tax evasion, maybe on the anticorruption, I will askthe colleagues if they could put something in for the women here, most probably for the NS colleagues. So I will start with the ODA. Definitely, as I mentioned, as you mentioned, indeed, there is thispart of obligation, just to let you know that Romania in the implementation related to its obligation established recently this raw aid agency. It is a new agency that has been established within thegovernment system. Definitely, this assistance is being directed in a gradual way because it is part of the general budgetary plan, yearly plan but also in the multi-annual planning and we try to do every effortto reach the allocation level of 0.33 of the gross national income by 2030. In 2022, we reached therate almost half, 0.14%. And we have the commitment that we will increase this ODA as a EU Member Statesby 0 sorry, to 0.7 of the EU collective gross national income but definitely it is a larger and longerstage for Romania. What I can also add here is that this ODA was mainly directed to different bilateral andmultilateral projects aimed mainly to the climate change component and equal opportunity and education.These are the areas where we tried to contribute with our own resources, financial resources and knowledge in areas related to the integrated management of river systems, hazards in the coastal area, biodiversityand forests through better monitoring and forestry resources. We made contributions to the green climate fund and, of course, we also contributed to these resources that we have not only bilateral but alsowith the international, you know, multilateral fund of the international organization. Additionally, in the bilateral projects, we focused also on education and women empowerment. Bilateral projects in countrieslike Africa, particularly Kenya, Nigeria, we are focused mainly on the education for women and basically for young girls. So we are having programs in that specific area additionally and it is not exactly,I would say specifically monetized but we have a system of scholarships and tuition from the national state budget for the African countries, Middle East countries and also worldwide projects, scholarshipform which is for the post-doctoral graduates and also here we have encouraged the universities that based on their national autonomy to grant universities scholarships and tuition by their own. So definitelyall in all, we are on the positive trend on the ODA and I can only reassure you that in this regardlessthe budgetary difficulty, we are keeping in line with this commitment for this activities. According to the newly adopted strategy for partnership, new partnership with African countries to education,development and peace, 14.7% of the total ODA is dedicated to the African countries. On taxation,I would like to go and to reiterate that the rate of profit tax payable by the Romanian companies is generally 60%. However from this year, credit institutions, banks will pay an additionalturnover tax of 2% until 2026 and 1% onward after 2026 as well as companies exceeding a 50 millionturnover that they will have to pay the minimum turnover tax if their profit tax will be lower than the minimum turnover and then gas and oil companies exceeding 50 million turnover or aspecific turnover tax in addition to the profit tax. The rate of personal income was 16% between 2012and 2017 with some exceptions. 20% and later between 1 and 25% depending on the amount of income from gambling. From 3 to 1 depending on the market value of the property and the specifics of the transfersof properties for immovable property transfer. The 5% for the dividends and since 2017, the rate of the personal income tax is 10%. Some exceptions being maintained. For instance, the tax rate for gamblingincomes between 33 and 40% depending on the value. The standard VAT rate decreased from 24% 1 of January2012 31st of December 2015 to 20% between 1 of January to 31st of December 2016 and further down to 90%from 1 of January 2017. There are reduced VAT rates for 9% and respectively 5% that are applicable to food, sport facility services, tourism, ecological food, firewood and lately for heat delivery duringthe call session for certain categories of consumers because of the energy peak we had in crisis we had the specific support scheme for the consumers. I have to also add additionally that there is nowpresently a discussion on the new budgetary related issues where the tax is being taken into consideration. Iwill refer for the environment to other budgetary task issues when I will refer to the environment because it is very much important to see on the greening facilitation. But meanwhile, I would really liketo give the floor to the Ministry of Justice representative for his own answers to the questions, additionalquestions and also to the unresponded questions from the previous cluster. Thank you. MOG. Thank you very much. I am representing the Ministry of Justice. There have been a number of issues that have been raised inrespect to prevention and fighting corruption previously and we didn't have the chance to offer an answer. I am not sure if the time is quite enough to give you the answers that you have requested but we do have them preparedfor all the questions that have been raised in the 1st part. So if you feel the need that we can follow up with written materials after that, the Delegation has prepared these answers if we do not have the time to fully respond to youright now. There have been major developments in Romania in this respect and the last two we are currently implementing the national anti-corruption strategy 2021/2025 as very well it has been put out by the rapporteur. Previously we had otherfive national strategies. We have more than 20 years' tradition in fighting corruption in Romania and we are quite successful. I am not agreeing with the affirmation that was put forward that the corruption fighting is at the lower stageright now. This is not confirmed by neither OECD or European Union or other relevant international bodies that are assessingus. The last two strategies have been audited by the OECD and their reports using the OECD indicators shows that in what concernsthe previous strategy Romania has scored more than the average of OECD's countries in terms of prevention and fighting corruption andit is actually in the top 10 of OECD. The new anti-corruption strategy has been developed on a broader consultations scale that the previousone and came with a new monitoring mechanism addressing former concerns but also new concerns that we all have had, especially in thepublic sector but also in the private sector. We have very strong monitoring mechanism that has been put in place by our strategies and Irefer to the peer review missions that are replicating the Greco's type of missions. Last year Romania has carried out 34 peer review missions indifferent institutions in the country by team of independent experts or team of anti-corruption institutions or team of independent experts fromdifferent NGOs and we plan for this year many more other such evaluation missions to be carried out. At the same time we have our platform ofcooperation, five platforms of cooperation that have been put in place and they meet annually and they deal with the issues provided under thestrategy but also as a new additional monitoring mechanism we have the establishment of working groups and we have two established, one on education andone on the issues related to the health system because we know that the health system was a priority in the former strategy and we saw that we still needto work under the new one. And we have one specific dedicated objective related to the health system under the current strategy with eight measures. They areaccordingly to the data provided by the Ministry of Health under the regular process of implementation of the strategy that is being carried out annually. They are consideredeither fully implemented or partially implemented. I don't want to go and I don't have the time to go through all of this but I can provide you with a specific progress reportthat we have prepared for our annual reporting period for the strategy. But also it is very important to say the fact that as a major development on this field in January2022, Romania has received the invitation to accede to OECD together with either five countries. If there had been no progress, no serious progress or there had been problem under this domain, this invitation would have never been followed through. And more than this, in 2023 in September we acceded the Working Group on Bribery after we have acceded to theConvention, the Anti-Bribery Convention. So these are major progresses that are acknowledged at international level that we need to look at. And also we need to look at the European Union because fighting corruption and increasing the capacity of the national agency for integrity were among the recommendations under the former mechanism of cooperation and verification.And the last European Commission report in November 22 said thoroughly that Romania has implemented satisfactory, fully implemented these recommendations and they closed the mechanism of cooperation and verification for Romania. Of course we continue to be monitored under the rule of law report as all the other Union Member States. And we more than this, the drafting of the new current strategy to fight anti-corruptionis part of the plan for resilience and recovery. Romania is monitored to have this strategy elaborated and we did. But also not only its elaboration but also its implementation. We have to carry out more than 70% to be able to get the money from European Union after the COVID. So we are on the track with all these things and we are really keen on having this followedthrough. This is a general overview of the major progress. On the healthcare, I said if there is the need, Madame Rapporteur, I can provide you with details related to all the measures that we have in the strategy so far. And we have for just to mention them, these are having in mind the strengthening of the mechanism for prioritizingthe budget allocation and evaluating the timelines of Ministry of Health and National Health Insurance House decisions on the use of public funds. We also have a measure in respect to the transparency of the use of public resources to centralize publication of data on health procurement and this is all available and all the datas are public. Then we have another measure on supplementing and strengthening the control and integrity structures in the Ministry of Health and the National Health andnational house for healthcare system. Then we have another measure to establish in these two institutions a level of a joint mechanism for monitoring and control of providers in the social health insurance system. And then we have a measure to strengthen the traceabilitymechanism for medicine on the Romanian market which is fully implemented and we know all medicines where they are at every single moment. Then we have another measure introduction in the management contract of public hospitals or evaluation indicators of which acts of corruptionincompatibilities abuses and conflicts of interests of subordinated staff are considered management failures. Then we have another measure on optimizing the implementation of standard methodology for assessing corruption risks within central public authorities and institutions within thepublic health system. Another measure, a final one under the strategy carrying out continuous activities of methodological guidance on topics related to transparency, ethics and integrity dedicated to staff from public health institutions. Well, all these measures are on track and thereare many data that can provide this. Shortly I have statistics from DNA. I was asked aboutstatistics and I also have statistics from the general prosecutor office. I asked also the DNA and the national integrity agency because there was also a question about the national integrity agency about the funding. Both institutions have responded to us that they have enough funds and every time they haverequested funds they have been receiving the funds from the government and this is very important to underline. In terms of staffing, the DNA now is operating at 86% of the staffing in terms of theprosecutors. Additional 90 positions have been allocated for support activities of the national anti-corruption directorate and they have been covered. Headquarters, relevant headquarters have beenprovided for them. In one, just the DNA statistic, I'm not going to the general prosecutor statistic that is larger. I will tell you the smaller one that's referring to the high corruption and corruption in the healthsector. DNA investigated 409 cases during 1st of July 2022 until 31st of December 2023. So in the lastsemester, 490 cases were investigated in the health sector. 119 decisions were not to prosecute and 91 havefollowed an indictment or plea bargaining agreement. The courts ruled in 20 cases involving 30 defendants and asgeneral corruption, the total cases that have been investigated by DNA are 5,235. I stop. I have many issues to say toadd. But if you think I can give you all the statistics because there is no time. Thank you very much. A very short time. I hope we will get an additional time just to refer shortly on the environment. It was an important, I would say, question with a lot ofimportant connotation and definitely how shall I spell spillover effects in other sectors. So definitely I will focus very shortly. I have a very large answer prepared but I will try to focus on very specific issues. On the strategy you mentioned, Madam, on reducing the greenhouse emissions, I would like to mention from the outset that this is only part and it's only one aspect of the neutral Romania'sscenario. We have a bigger scenario prepared for the neutral Romania for 250. That strategy is only one part and one element. Together with it we have foreseen both resources and policy objectives within the Romania national recovery and resilience plan approved in the European Union Council, national program for rural development, strategic plan for common agricultural policy, national long-term building renovation strategy, national integrated urbandevelopment strategy for resilient green and inclusive competitive cities, sustainable urban mobility law proposal and restructuring plan for the Oltenia energy complex. These are energy factories that they produce electrical energy out of coal. It means phasing out of the coal here. So definitely these are instruments that are working integrated in a synergic approach to try to provide A, for the climatechange, climate adaptation, climate mitigation and green transition of Romania for the incoming period. Just to I will not go into very much details, but because of the taxation and allocation budget I would like to say just a few figures, 40% of the national resilience and recovery plan is allocated to the green transition. This means 12 to 13 billion euros. 1.2 billion is for the transition for just the fundfor the just transition, 5 to 6 billions on the national fund for climate action and definitely the figures can continue. What I would like to say is that for this decarbonization strategyis allocated 2,069 million, so basically 2 billion, I think, 2,068 billion Euros. This is the amountfor providing a full, I would say, green transition of the national economy and total reductions of the green gas emission effects. Definitely it's a mix between energy and environment that arebeing allocated under these schemes and definitely here we have actually concrete plans, legislation and the administrative capacity for different ministries agency like environment ministry, climate, sorry, energy ministry, ministry of agriculture and sectoral ministries that have specific tasks ontransition and greening according to the scenario. So it's a synergic effect. We have foreseen strategic objectives for the building sector, for the industry sectors, for the agriculture, for theland use, land use change and forestry, other land and harvested wood products. So definitely it's a very important, I would say, synergic and strategic effort by the government line ministriesto make sure that this is provided in the support of the green transition. Definitely a specific aspect is the adaptation on the climate change and here what I would like to say is that there are specificsectoral tasks for different areas like water, forestry, biodiversity, population, public health and air quality education and awareness, municipalities, agriculture and rural development, transport,tourism industry, even insurance in terms of insurance support mechanisms are foreseen. Just to let you know that this environmental protection is also covered by measures having criminal means andthis is foreseen. I think my colleague forgot to mention about this environmental dimension of anti-corruption strategy is also foreseen in that aspect. So definitely general prosecutor office actually extended its cooperation also with the civil society organizations to make sure that through its dedicatedbureau for combating environmental criminality we have also this feedback from the national civil society in terms of how this whole package is being not only implemented but also monitorized. There arethis connection, logical connection between all this I would say documents and allocated tasks to each and every agency in terms of implementation agencies to make sure that this is being done in a verycohesive form with qualitative results. Now I will take the opportunity to give the floor to the Ministry of Local Works on the territorial inequalities to answer the work. Please be quite short. Two minutes and then we will have on income equality most probably Ministry of Labor and last on the work life balanceI will also ask the Ministry of Labor to refer on this very shortly and please dear colleagues to fit all of this in 2 min . Thank you. About regional disparities and territorial disparities on the longterm they are in decreasing trend following the implementation of cohesion policy in Romania as well as national policies that follow the principle of no place left behind including national programs which finance investments in local infrastructure. For example, the local development national programwhich has started multi annual financing since 2015 and also the investment program Angel Salini which started in 2021. Both of these total 23 billion Euro or at least 23 billion Euro. And these nationalprograms finance more than 95% of the local administrative units and bring basic infrastructure and services basically to the whole territory. And just as an example, the news program AngelSalini program finances more than 75% of the program finances rural administrative units. And there arealso the RF funded components such as the local fund component which had as a principle to preallocate funds to each administrative unit. So this also means that it deals with inequalities. Also in theprogramming period 2021/2027, the program for inclusion and the social dignity has been approved. It has a total allocation of 4.4 billion Euro. And it addresses the social needs of the less development regions in particular urban marginalized communities and rural marginalized communities and it bringsallocations for education for elderly, for children, for persons with disabilities and so on. And finally, concerning the follow-up question on the indicators of GDP, we have periodic reportspublished on our ministry's web page concerning the territorial status and territorial disparities which covers many aspects not just income and GDP but also demographic indicators, life expectancy, access to services of general interest, labor force occupation, economic activities such asturnover of companies and so on. So yeah, and we will come back with the statistic for GDP for lesstime. Thank you. I'm from the Ministry of Labor because I understand I have a few seconds. I will say just very shortly my intervention will be. So regarding the parental share, we have to say something aboutrecently we have adopted and implemented the proper legislation regarding the directive on work balancefor parents. So I want to say about that that to both of the parents can have the same rights. Actually,the parents I have shortly mentioned. So I will try to read. So regarding on this legislation, the parental have and the child raising indemnity, so the parents can have the same rights if they havemeet an eligibility condition. One of the most important eligibility condition is during the last two years prior to the childbirth, the parents can already realize 12 months income subject. So regardingon that, the parent, the man can have indemnity compensation who will be two years or for typical child or three years for a child with disability. We have established a minimum and a maximum indemnitysum. Also, the parents according to the law have the same duration of parental leave as the mothers. Socan they request the entire period of parental leave if they want to do so? That's it. I hope I make myclear. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency and to your Delegation. I know that there is a shortage of time and you have been mindful of it. So thank you for that. I will now give thefloor to Ms. Jo Young Lee who will now pose to the Delegation sets of questions under cluster 4 whichis Articles 6 to 9 of our covenant. You have the floor. Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you, YourExcellency, Distinguished Members of the Delegation. I'm going to address issues arising from Article 6 to Article 9. We acknowledge the efforts and progress made by the State Party on this front. However,we are going to focus on the areas of further improvement needed. First, on the right to work. The Committee knows that the State Party has taken various measures to promote employment programs for vulnerablegroups in the labor market such as young people, women, persons with disabilities, Roma minorities. However, we note that challenges persist. The share of young people not in education, employment or training, socalled need, remains among the highest in the EU. Persons with disabilities still face limited training and lasting job opportunities. According to the European Commission report, only 41% of the Romaminorities were engaged in any form of paid work. The gender employment gap is among the highest in the EU. In this regard, the Committee would like to ask the following questions. Could you please indicatewhether the share of needs among young people aged 15 to 29 has changed following the implementation ofthe measures to promote employment opportunities for young people? If so, please provide information how the share of needs has changed by age, sex and rural/urban areas. Please also provide detailed information onthe impact of the measures taken to promote access to decent work for individuals belonging to the Roma community, including statistical data disaggregated by sex and age. Could you please provide information on theshare of persons with disabilities employed in the open labor market, both in public and private sector, out of the total number of persons with disabilities of working age? Please also provide information on whetherand how the obligation of reasonable accommodation has been implemented. We heard from the Delegation that the National Agency of Gender Equality has implemented awareness raising programs to promotegender equality in employment. Apart from that, could you please provide further information on employment measures specifically to increase the women's access to decent work? In this respect, we would also liketo know whether the State Party has taken measures to expand early child care and education. Turning to the right to just and favorable working conditions, the 1st on minimum wage. We appreciate that youprovide information on the coverage and amount of minimum wage in your reply to the list of issues.Now we would be grateful if you could provide information on the methods and procedures for determiningthe minimum wage to ensure that it provides a decent living for workers and their families. Next on fair remuneration. According to the European Commission data, the rate of the working population at risk ofpoverty is one of the highest in Europe and it is closely related to nonstandard forms of work such as occasional or part-time work, platform work, self-employment and informality. In this regard, pleaseprovide information on measures taken to address the problem of in-work poverty and measures to ensure a fair remuneration for those in nonstandard forms of work including self-employed persons in agriculturalrural areas. Next is on safe and healthy working conditions. According to Eurostat data, the number of fatal accidents at work has been significantly high. In this regard, could you please provideinformation on the impact of the national strategy in the field of occupational safety and health in 2018, 2020 and other specific measures to reduce the high rate of fatal accidents at work. On trade unionrights, the ILO Committee of Experts requested the state party to review the minimum 15 foundingmember criteria for organizing a trade union considering that the majority of employees are working in small and medium-sized enterprise in Romania. Also, the ILO expressed concern that workers engaged in nonstandardforms and self-employed workers are excluded from exercising their trade union rights. What measures has the state party taken to review the restrictive minimum membership requirement for forming a tradeunion? Please also provide information on measures taken to ensure that workers engaged in nonstandard forms of work and self-employed persons can also exercise the right to organize and join trade union.We appreciate that the state party has provided information on the means of complaint and recourse in case of anti-union discrimination. Considering the observation from the ILO on this issue, could youplease provide information on measures taken to strengthen the existing sanctions in cases of anti-union discrimination in order to ensure their effectiveness and decisiveness? On the right tosocial security, despite the range of social protection mechanisms, the Committee is concerned at the limited impact of those programs on poverty reduction. The level of guaranteed minimum incomeand the minimum level of unemployment benefit remained constant since 2008. There has been little adjustmentof the reference social indicator to the changing value of real wages and inflation levels. While the reference social indicator should serve as a benchmark to determine the level of social protectionbenefits. In this regard, could you please provide information on measures taken to increase thecoverage and adequacy of the main social assistance programs such as the guaranteed minimum income and the newly envisaged minimum income, minimum inclusion income. Please provide information on the number ofregistered unemployed persons who received unemployment benefits in the last five years. Also please provide information on measures taken to increase the minimum level of unemployment benefit. We would also liketo have information on measures taken to establish a clear indexation procedure of the reference social indicator in order to ensure that it is regularly adjusted in relation to the threshold of monetarypoverty and the minimum net wage. State party stated in its reply to the list of issues that the government is planning to implement the minimum inclusion income in order to increase the coverage and adequacy of the socialbenefits. In this regard, please provide information on whether the government also plans to increasethe public expenditure on social benefits particularly for this purpose. Moving on to medical assistance,could you please provide information on who can access the medical assistance and whether it is confined to emergency care? Thank you very much. And I look forward to a constructive dialogue on these issues.Thank you, Ms. Lee, for your very comprehensive questions posed under cluster 2 of the covenant. Your excellency, I would now request the delegation, the state party delegation to respond to the questionsposed by Ms. Lee. You would have 30 minutes, your excellency, to respond. Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay. Thank you very much. Given the wide scope of these questions and the complexity of it, I wouldlike to pass the exercise of monitoring for the Madam Nika from the Ministry of Social Protection to indicate and to direct the colleagues that are going to respond to these questions. Madam, you have thefloor. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to ask my colleagues from the Ministry of Labor to answerthe questions we have at this moment in the order they want. I would like to start with the VMI becauseI think they are prepared with these questions. So all the policies and strategies that Ministry of Laboris implementing are in specific areas respecting the social inclusion. One of the most important measures from starting from this year is VMI, it is about the minimum inclusion. It is one of the most importantobjectives that Romanian Government assumed in our national program. Also this priority is included innational recovery and resilience plan. Concretely, this new social programs, the social protectionprograms include restructure the benefit system from previous years. So the recent minimum inclusionis have two components. The component is namely the inclusion aid and the aid for families with the children and the measures for vulnerable people with the energy consumer. So these programs have nowtwo new programs but in the same idea to protect people, single persons or families who are very vulnerable. So the inclusion have two different names but the same idea. These two elements is aboutinclusion and aid who replace minimum income and the 2nd aid is about aid for families who replace family support allowance. It depends also, it is very important because social protection is not about onedomain. It is a complementary domain with employment, education, health and so on. So it depends on the need of these persons. We have in legislative new framework complementary measures regarding employmentand education. Now, regarding the increase of the level of advocacy of the social assistance benefits was adopted a new law which changed annually starting with March of this year, the value of the social referenceindicator with the average annual inflation rate of the previous year. The main objective of this measure is to ensure a higher more adequate and more extensive level of social protection for people who are in avulnerable situation. Also increasing the value of this indicator each year will determine also changes in the amount of the different other social assistance benefits who are also linked with thisindicator. The next indexation will take place in the 1st March of the next year. So the main idea of the benefits policies, public policies have the aim to ensure an adequate, efficient and sustainablesocial assistance system and encouraging the social inclusion of families and vulnerable persons and to stimulate the participation of on the labour market and to address inequalities because we cannot discussabout social inclusion without education, proper education in rural and urban areas. Also we cannotdiscuss about proper social integration policies without a good employment system, especially in connection with the real need of those persons. So regarding this, our legislative frameworkunderlines very concrete this type of measures and all measures are linked with others' domain. Thankyou. So I would like to give the floor to the labour inspection to talk about safety working conditions.I'm from the labour inspection. In order to prevent situations that can lead to work accidents, the labour inspector gets out checks to verify working condition and complies with all safety and healthyregulation at work. As a result of the measures taken in this area, the number of fatality accidentsdecreased from 323 in 2013 to 99 last year, e.g. . And the number of accidents with disabilitydecreased from 89 to 63. In our competencies, we provide controls in labour relationship area and health andsafety also. In each year, we perform about 100 controls and result of all these controls and to the measures which aredisposed by labour inspectors, the labour conditions are improved. Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Carla, please give us a few words about the needs.Hello.

The unemployment were given the possibility to be members of a trade union and also the possibility of organizing trade unions was extended in smalland medium enterprises by reducing the number of members required to form a trade union from 15employees from the same unit according to law 62 in 2011 to 10 employees from the same unit and at thesame time the formation of a union was allowed from a number of 20 employees from district units of the same sector. The possibility of organizing strikes against the social and economic policy of the governmentwas introduced and the procedure was established for this. The obligation of collective bargaining was introduced for employers with at least 10 employees. The previous regulation setting the threshold at 20 employees. Fineswere introduced for the interference of employers and public authorities in the establishment of tradeunions, union organization. Any interference by employers, employees, employers or employers organization in the process of establishment of trade union organization or in the exercise of their right will attract the application offines in the amount of 20,000 from 20,000 to 25,000 lay. Also any interference by public authorities, employers and organization inthe process of selected employee representative or obstructing the elections will be sanctioned. The provision of the labor code and the social dialogue law are directly corroborated with the express provision of the special legislation thatregulates the application of the warranty of the constitution. The specific exercise rights and conditions for certain categories ofpersonnel from the state administration, military personnel, police, special services, judges and prosecutors. The new social dialogue law is in its subsequent amendments and the addition were adopted following the recommendation of the ILO inconsultation with the negotiation of the national social partners. So thank you for this. I would like to ask my colleague from thenational agency of disabilities to talk about their My name is Krina. I'm senior advisor at national authorityfor the protection of the right for persons with a disability regarding the employment of persons with a disability. According to theprovision of law 448 from 2006 regarding protection and promotion of rights of persons with a disability revised, public authorities andinstitutions, legal entities, public or private that have at least 50 employees have the obligation to hire persons with a disabilities in apercentage of the least 400 of the total number of employees. Public authority and institutions as well as legal entities, public or privatethat do not employ persons with a disability under the condition provided, they can opt for one of the following obligation. So or to pay monthly to the state budget an amount representing the gross minimum basic salary for the country guaranteed in payment multiplied by the number of jobs in which they did not employ persons with disabilities or employ persons with disabilities or topay monthly to the state budget the equivalent of the least 50% of the gross minimum basic salary multiplied by the number of jobs in which they did not employ persons with a disability and by the amount representing the difference up to the level of the amount provided or to purchase on a partnership basis products or services realized through the ownactivity of persons with disability employed in authorized protected units.

These units have the obligation to present the financial report at the beginning of each year from which it can be seen how the funds obtained through the commercial activity were used. Regarding theprotected units, I can give you some statistics data. Starting in 2019 we had 31 units with 80 persons and now in ago, 2300, 2023, there are 393 units with 1,639 persons working the bureau. routesamily, legal systems affected by the wholeness of human advantage and human rights639 persons hired. In terms of public policies dedicated to employment for persons with adisability, national strategy regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, affairRomania 2022 between 2022 and 2027 approved by governmental decision is the public policydocument which continues and develops the implementation of United Nations Convention in order to ensure the framework to the full exercise and under equal condition of all fundamental human rightsand freedoms by all persons with disabilities. The general objective of the national strategy is to ensure the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities based on freedomof decision in all areas of life in an accessible and resilient environment. The national strategy has eight priority areas closely related to priority areas of the European strategy onthe rights of persons with a disability, a union of equality. Among them there is a prioritydedicated to employment. I also had that the social inclusion and dignity operational program between 2021 and 2027 through the set of integrated measures that support the application and theimplementation of national and local strategies contributes directly to supporting the process of reducing the poverty and supporting vulnerable groups in order to overcome the situation ofsocial exclusion in the line with the principles of the European pillar regarding social rights.

These projects are focused on two categories of beneficiarieswithout excluding the others. Persons with a disability who are difficult to be employed have a program dedicated exclusively to them with the support package that includes workplace training, the granting of the insertion incentive, the inclusion of the employment of persons witha disability through the forms of social economy in order to increase the degree of employability on the market free and the development of entrepreneurship among persons with a disability who have or wantto acquire entrepreneurial skills in order to develop a protected unit system.

Also, I should add that following the implementation of the Thank you very much. We know that Romania has many programmes in what concerns personswith disabilities, but I think we don't have enough time. I will ask Mr. Paul Nicolescu to talk about minimum wage, a few words. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Paul Nicolescu. I'm fromthe Ministry of Labour. A few words for the minimum wage and decent living. As you may know, the minimum wage is provided as a protection measure for employees with the aim of satisfying their vital decent needs in terms of procuring food, clothing, the need for education and recreationof themselves and their families. If we analyze the evolution of the minimum wage in the lastten years, we notice that it has increased by 266% from 900 lay in 2014 to the 3300 lay inthis year. Also, if we take into consideration the reference value mentioned in the directiveon adequate minimum wages in the European Union of 50% of the average gross salary, currently in Romania, the weight of the minimum gross salary and the average gross salary is around44%. As it was also already negotiated with the social partners in December 2023, startingfrom July of this year, the minimum wage will be 3700 lay, which represents 48.9% from theaverage gross salary for 2024. I would like to mention also that the government also kept in 2024 the fiscal facility granted also last year of non-taxing the amount of 200 lay fromthe minimum wage. And the last comment, currently the government is working on a plan of measures that take into account both the reduction of taxation of the minimum wage and the grantingof the tax facilities for families with many children where both parents earn the minimum wage. As a conclusion, there is an increase of the share of the minimum gross salary and theaverage gross salary during the last five years from 41.6% to 44% this year in the present,and to 48.9% from July of 2024. Thank you. Thank you. A few words about social security and povertyreduction, please. Hello, Minister of Labor. Regarding the Ministry of Labor public policies on socialinclusion, together with social services, the benefits of social policies from benefits provide wants to provide minimal and decent work for decent life for persons who are in a vulnerable situation. Inthis regard, we have policies who have concrete measures, so people who are in vulnerable situationto access policies, benefits, even they are in rural or urban areas. In this regard, we havealso a national agency for inspection and payments who are one of the main important instruments whoprovide methodological and coordination in local and especially in rural areas.

Secretary of State, presidentof national agency for Roma. Concerning the question related to the Roma employability, the national strategy framework for Roma, 2020-2027, to increase the employment rate of the Romanian citizensbelonging to the Roma minority in accordance with market requirements, just to offer a few figures between May and December 2022, a special program was designed for communities with large numbersof Roma ethnic has been included in the national employment program of national employment agencyfor 2022. The program 140 focuses on tailored actions such as mediation and information services andprofessional counseling. The program envisions the employment of 1960 people, approximately 60% ofthe total number of Roma ethnic recommended to be employed in 2022. 1575 Romanian citizens belongingto the Roma minority were employed in 2022, out of which 1569 people hired through mediationservices, out of whom 1390 people hired for an indefinite period. For 2023, the program wantsto employ, has employed approximately 800 people, approximately 60% of the total number of Romaethnic recommended to be employed during the year. Until April in 2023, 611 Romanian citizens belonging to the Roma minority were employed, out of which 606 through mediation services, out of whom508 for an indefinite period. For implementing the measure 2.1.2, developing the active employmentprogram provided by the public employment service set out the strategy. 11,795 people were admittedin 2022 in the employment incentive programs run by national employment agency. So the cost for thelast year were almost 1 million Euros. Regarding to the statistic data collections disaggregated byethnicity, gender, age group, the action plans within the national Roma strategy have numerous measures with indicators when possible that can be disaggregated by gender and age group, Roma womenand girls and Roma youth. The responsible ministries are currently working to the project their targets,indicators and budgets for the remaining period 2024, 2027 with this particular request to reflect the gender and children, youth beneficiaries in their services they are delivering. Thank you.And from my side just a small addition on the right to medical assistance. The right to medical assistance is guaranteed by the Romanian constitution. So emergency medical assistance is actually providedto everyone. Also for the uninsured people they benefit from the minimum package of medical servicesand starting with 2023 they also benefit on the basic package on primary medical care. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Your Excellency and thank you to the Delegation for responding tothe questions posed. I will now open the floor and we will take follow-up questions to cluster 2.I have two questions from my side by the time colleagues indicate their requests. I already see that Ms. Zhu Yong Li has requested for the floor. But before that I thought 1st foremost I would liketo thank the Delegation, Madam, for clarifying the steps and measures taken on trade union rights, particularly the discrimination and the sanctions that they face. I just wanted to know from you hasan assessment been undertaken as to the efficacy, how efficient have these measures been? The legislative as well as other measures because we have continued to receive reports which is why it was raised as part of our cluster leader's questions that workers continue to face discrimination and sanctions.And so I just wanted to know whether the State Party has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the measures that you already indicated. That is my 1st question. The 2nd one relates to asylum, the right to work for asylum seekers. There is legislation which prevents them from really gettingwork permit, you know, not within a year. So really they are out of work for more than a year. Are any steps being taken to amend your legislation so that asylum seekers are able to obtain work permitsearlier? And also in terms of the allowances that are granted, are they sufficient to cover their basic needs? Those are my two questions. And Ms. Li, you have the floor for your follow-up questions. Please.Chair, and thank you, Distinguished Members of Delegation for providing a comprehensive range of answers to my questions. I would like to ask some follow-up questions. First as to the employmentprograms for young people, I appreciate that you provide the information that really the State Party has a range of measures and also you dedicated the resources for programs to promote employmentfor young people. But I ask the question, could you please indicate whether the share of needs among young people following the implementation of those impressive measures to promote employment opportunitiesfor young people? So could you please indicate the impact and results, please? And also as regards the employment of women, we appreciate that you already have certain programs to promote genderequality in employment, but can you provide more specific employment measures to increase women's access to decent work? And also I would like to know whether you have intention to expand early childcare and education. And regarding the high before that, on the fair remuneration, I think that I haven't heardabout work in poverty, the problem of work in poverty. So how do you analyze the causes of the high rate of in work poverty? We say the so-called working poor. So then based on the analysis, what arethe your measures to address these problems to ensure the fair remuneration for all workers? As regardsthe safe and healthy working conditions, I really appreciate that the number of cases of fatal accidents at work decreased. It is good news. But I just want to have a clarification because according to Eurostat data, thenumber of fatal accidents at work was 229 in 2016, 224 in 2017, 221 in 2018 and 215 in 2019. And as far as Irecall, you provided information that last year the figure was 99. So it is really a big change. So I just want to have aclarification and if it is correct, then what were the measures really improved this figure? And on the unemploymentbenefits, and I really appreciate that you have amended the law for social inclusion. And so you are now going torevise indexation annually in relation to inflation level and also the minimum wage. But I just want to have a clarificationwhether the unemployment benefits, the level of unemployment benefits will be also increased in relation to this indexation. Thank you very much.Thank you, Ms. Lee. Are there any other requests? Yes. Ms. Rossi, you have the floor. Thank you very much. I do have a question on thesocial security system for persons with disabilities. Might you provide additional information tied to the requirements needed to have accessto social security for those with disabilities? Also what is the scope of the services that they have access to? And this includes services orassistance. My question is whether this includes covering the costs for extra services they need as a person with a disability and how doesthis also affect access to health care? Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms. Rossi. At this stage I find that there are no other requests for the floor. So Your Excellency, I would request you to kindly respond to the questions that have been posed. You have about 10 minutes, 10 to 12 minutesto respond because I will definitely want to stop your responses to questions on cluster 3 at 12:45 because we will want to conclude our session by requestingour cluster leader for cluster 3 to pose questions and so you could reserve the rest of your responses for later. But at 12:45 we will pause to take questionson cluster 3. So please go ahead in the 10 minutes that you have. Mr. Education to go on the questions related to the what? On trade union 1st , Mr. President. Thank you. Regarding to your question about the effectiveness of the measures to increase the capacity of trade unions to protect themselves, to prevent and protect themselves againstdiscrimination, I can inform you that in the last six years in the partnership with NGOs, trade unions and public institutions, we organized trainings for trade unions' leaders to increase their capacity in managing discrimination cases in courts and in institutions andthe trade unions are protected and workers against discrimination, all kinds of discrimination, even against victimization and the best proof of the effectiveness of these measures are the case law and we provide statistics and updated statistics even for the last years, how many cases that we had at the national council for combating discriminationand even in the courts. The case law shows that the sanctions are high. We have sanctions with fines, 5,000, 10,000 Euros but also based on these decisions, the workers and trade unions obtain in the courts effective remedies, that means compensations and we can provide you other figures if it is necessary. Thank you very much.Now to the General Inspectorate on the right for the asylum seekers. Hello, my name is Alexander Necula from the General Inspectorate for Immigration from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Regarding to the question of Mrs. Chairperson related to the asylum seekers, we have to mention that access to the labour market under the condition provided by law for Romanian citizens after a period of three months, we have to mention that access to the labour market under the condition provided by law for Romanian citizens after a period of three months, we have to mention that access to the labour market under the condition provided by law for Romanian citizens after a period of three months, we have to mention that access to the labour market under the condition provided by law for Romanian citizens after a period of three months, we have to mention that access to the labour market under the condition provided by law for Romanian citizens after a period of threemonths from asylum application if the asylum seeker is still in the process of establishing formal protection. So there is no need to one-year period that asylum seekers to have the right to work in Romania. So it is three months. Related to the amounts, we have to mention that Romania in 2022 increased the amount of sums to ensure the material condition of reception like food, clothes and pocket money. Theamounts were determined by the national institute for quality of life research based on adults' daily needs, seasonal clothing needs and individual needs. If there is need to mention the exact amounts, we can provide this information. Thank you. Hello. My name is Ciprian Fartusinic. I'm working for the public research institute under the minister of education coordination. We just want 1 min to address the issue of early education and care. We are currently going through a very comprehensive reform on the whole education system based on educated Romania program and the new laws of education for both general education and theand higher education and early education is one of the priority, a top priority. It was includedwith a special chapter in this new law of general education and it is in this momentforeseen as a priority because we want to see it as a unified integrated and inclusive early education system increasing the quality of the services and also the enrollment of the childrenthat are part of this system. Also we know that education is not alone here. So since 2018 we have an integrated community services program trying to link various education and also social assistanceand health intervention as well to increase the enrollment of the children. Thank you.For the question related to work in poverty. Hello. I want to add a concrete intervention regarding thework in poverty situation. So I want to underline that regarding the benefit, policy benefit, public policy benefit, if a person works and still have a minimum income they can also benefit of minimumsocial inclusion income. I think it is very, very important to underline this measure that the personeven he works have less income and the state through public policies intervene and help them to increasethe monthly income. Thank you. The mortal accident in addition to the intensification of the controlsin the field of the application of the controls in the field of the health and safety and we increasedthe demands of the checks. Okay. In order to prevent the incidents of the accident at work in occupationaldisease every year the labor inspection develops an annual framework program comprising activities aimedat reducing the number of events. These activities are based on analysis as accidental genetic phenomenonfor all economic areas of activity and focus on the economic areas in which this phenomenon is high. Wehave a high level in construction, e.g. , agriculture, services providers. And we focused inthe last years we focused on this area with the high risk of accidents and also on the credit work andwe intensified the controls in this area. Maybe this is one of the this is why the number of mortal accidentsis decreasing. We intensified the controls in the area with high risk in this issue.Employment for women? No. A few more words. I would like to add Paul Nicolescu, Ministry of Labor.As I told you before Romania is in the process to transpose the directive on adequate minimum wages in the European Union into domestic legislation. As I mentioned before Romania has agreed to the reference value mentionedin the directive. 50% of the average gross salary of the minimum wage into the average gross salary andthis year we are about to have 48.9%. Also I would like to add that within the national recovery and resilience plan we have a reform regarding the minimum wage which consists in establishing the level ofthe minimum wage according to a mechanism on the new formula in an objective and systematic way in consultation with the social partners and in accordance with the provisions of the directive onadequate minimum wages in the European Union. And last information, the percentage of the persons tominimum wage has decreased this year compared to 2023 from 26 to 22%. Thank you.Thank you, Your Excellency. I know that there are remaining responses still left but I think you maynot be able to cover it in the 1 min that is there. We will just give you an opportunity to listen to our cluster leader for cluster 3 to pose the questions that he has so that you are able toprepare for it and have more time to respond to it tomorrow. So I will at the moment request my colleague Mr. Ludovic Hannibal to kindly pose the questions on cluster 3 which pertain to Articles 10,11 and 12 of the covenant. Mr. Hannibal, you have the floor.Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Vice Chair, thank you for having afforded me the floor. I would like in turn to thank the Delegation from Romania. Thank you very much for your participation in this dialogue.It is particularly important for the Committee as you know. It is one of the flagship activities that we undertake that allows us to work together on the implementation of the international covenant oneconomic, social and cultural rights. It is an opportunity for exchange par excellence andit allows us to welcome you and thank you also to thank you for having brought such a strong competent and expert Delegation that allows us to have additional and precise informationthat helps us to construct our concluding observations. You will have understood in step with our working methods with which you are now familiar that we divide up the Articles in the covenant into four categories that we call clusters. This dialogue is something that we really want to be constructive.It allows the state and civil society and the experts of the Committee to work hand in handto push forward the protection of human rights. That's our central goal. Our goal is not justto, the goal is not just to list formal laws that are on the books or and to protect laws but rather to really identify together the challenges that we face or that you are confronted with. Structuralproblems, other obstacles, that helps us to find solutions to those obstacles. Now the questions,other questions were asked already. That's part of the exercise. Rounds of questions because wedo have common concerns over different Articles. Just three things to introduce this cluster before delving straight into them. First, I would like to thank you or thank and hail my colleague,Mr. Mohamed Amartin. He is not able to be with us today. He was going to take on this clusterand discuss them with you. However, he had a logistical hitch. I thank him for his work.Secondly, by mode of introduction, I would also like to express a concern or maybe just a questionin regards to the almost worrisome discretion when it comes to NGOs and civil society in this dialogue.Where is the information from civil society and the NGOs? Where are they in the room? It's a question in to itself that perhaps is worth considering together. We would like to know what your thoughtsare on that. Perhaps a 3rd point before, again, I dive right in, this was also a question that had been asked earlier. As you know, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rightsis endowed with a protocol. That protocol brings together an individual petition mechanismthat is extremely precious when it comes to implementation in some states because it does allow for the entirety of right holders to bring their cases to the international front. My question is verydirect. Does your state envisage or not to ratify that optional protocol? If yes, in what timetable? If not, what are the obstacles that keep you from doing so? Is there a debate underway on the topic?On that point, we can circle back later. Now, generally when states have reticence about this, it's becauseit's really more of a lack of understanding of what type of protocol it is than an actual objectionon the policy level or on the regulatory level. So 1st , Article 10, we have worked essentially on the issue of the protection of the family and other issues. So what are the concrete measures that havebeen adopted by the state party to ensure an effective protection of the family from exploitation in all its forms? Might you give additional details on the sanctions taken to punish the exploitation ofchildren and adolescents and on the rate of investigated domestic violence on the perpetrators of violence that may have been convicted for this on the protection mechanisms, concrete protectionmechanisms that are available to the victims, also the frequency of reviews of custody placements and what mechanisms are in place to report, monitor and respond to cases of abuse. What methods are usedto bring remedy? Also what are the measures taken to raise public awareness of the harmful consequences of corporal punishment on children and to encourage them to cease the normalization of these harmfulpractices to children. Now also on this Article, might you or rather do you envisage awareness raising campaigns for the population in order to combat stereotypes of all kinds that have an impact on equalsharing of responsibilities between men and women? This is something that was mentioned already to some degree. Might the state party also indicate to us what statistics might be available on this topic?Further, do you plan to put on the agenda soon the revision or overhaul of law 21/1991 with a viewto granting nationality to children born in the state party who would otherwise have been stateless or would be stateless? If so, when is this planned for? There is another question, Article 11,this essentially looks at the right for adequate standard of living, statistics that were made availableto us, note relatively concerning levels of poverty and social exclusion, monetary poverty, other typesof poverty, there are a series of questions that are linked to this topic including beyond the general objectives of the national strategy for the protection and promotion of children's rights and socialinclusion and this is the question, could the Romanian Delegation provide the Committee with additional information and more precise information on the specific measures taken to implement the strategyand also to improve the standard of living of the most disadvantaged families and vulnerable children?Might you also share us what appropriate measures have been adopted by the state party over the last three years to progressively improve the living conditions of persons belonging to the poorestsocial strata and in particular with regard to access to food stuffs and decent housing as well?As part of the efforts to reduce poverty and in particular the implementation of the national strategy for social inclusion, what are the measures taken by the government to combat socioeconomic inequalities between different categories in your population, persons with disabilities,the elderly, people living on a pension, pensioners and people belonging to the Roma minority as wellas people living in rural areas? There are also some questions on the right to adequate housing,or rather employment, might you provide information regarding the criteria adopted that allow families to have access to housing, again this is housing and then forced expulsions, might you provide information,additional information on forced expulsions, it would seem that forced expulsions or evictions are not in and to themselves banned legislatively, what are the legal provisions that are in place and available,what measures have been taken to prevent forced evictions, specifically of the Roma population in order to ensure their right to due process, the evictions undertaken over recent yearsincluding statistics that we see broken down by region, that would be interesting for us to have,the Committee would be interested in having them now, as regards the improvement of the standard of living for the least favored people, what access, what services are available to this group, potable water,electricity, sanitation and public transportation, another question on wild plantings, again,might you tell us more about the sociology of demographic breakdown of this group, also under 12,Article 12, as regards the access of the least favored to healthcare, Rome, refugees, asylum seekers,do you have information on particularly women with disabilities, older women, pregnant women, migrant women, Roma women, when it comes to access to affordable and quality family planning, alsoquestions on mental health, might you tell us more about the budget that's available in your remarks for mental health, what measures are being taken to improve access tomental health care and also the establishment of psychiatric facilities, what's available along that line, also a question on sexual and reproductive health, in what way does the state intendto ensure that all women have adequate and unhindered access to legal abortion services and post-abortion care services, what concrete measures are in place to ensure that all women have access to these services,healthcare, particularly those women living in rural areas that are part of vulnerable groups. The reports submitted to the Committee indicate that women's access to safe and legal abortion is hamperedby the practice of conscientious objection among healthcare professionals and sometimes even by entire medical units, perhaps provide information on this as well, that would be helpful to have a dialogue onthis item. And one last question, Madam Vice Chair, if you would allow me, the crime of corruption, particularly in healthcare, do you have any information to share with us on this point and to what degree is the practice of corruption infringed on the right of access of the unprivileged to publichealthcare system, the interpreter would rectify that informal plantations was a reference to informal settlements, please provide information on the informal settlements and the reporter thanks you kindly in advance. Thank you, Mr. Hannibal and we have come to the close of this morning's session,we are nearing lunchtime. Your Excellency, just to remind you and to the Distinguished Delegation that you have now questions that have been posed in three clusters. You will have all of today to prepare for the response to the questions posed by Mr. Hannibal as well as the last response that you saidyou still had on cluster 2. So we will adjourn for today and we will resume our session tomorrow morningto we will begin with your response to cluster 2, cluster 3 and then we will go on to cluster 4.So meeting is adjourned and have a good lunch and a good day ahead. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "Yes. I will say welcome. Welcome to the 90th GOP session. And happy new year for all ofyou personally. And I hope also that the different wars we have in Ukraine and in the Gaza stroke will end this year and that we take care of our planet and the people that liveon it. I know that we cannot stop the war. But we can do our part for the planet and for the people's health to contribute that the vehicles will become cleaner and energy efficient. Andour GPE activities are not unnoticed because we are already on the top UN website and maybeFrancois can show this. This is information from the United Nations and on the top side it is informing that we here have the working party on pollution and energy this week dealingwith the topics which is important for the UN. So not acknowledged the important work what we do here. This GOP session, so early in the year, we have also some disadvantages wherethe informal working group participants already have noticed but we will come later on thattopic. But 1st if you allow me that we have a look on our agenda for this week. We have a lot oftopics on our agenda and hope that we can go through this. We have a couple of documents dealing with the agenda. We have, of course, our normal working document where the agenda is given but wehave also an unannotated agenda with the revision 2, that is the informal document 90.01, revision2. And we have also the informal document 90.02, revision 3 on the informal meetings which were in conjunctionwith the GOP beginning of this week. And now we are here, we have, of course, interpretation services for these three days for today, tomorrow and Friday and thank you for the interpreters to be there. Andhappy new year for you as well. And, of course, we have the running order. But before we go to the running order and to how we will go this three days, I will give the floor to Francois to update us aboutthe latest informal documents which were tabled maybe yesterday at the end of the day. So Francois, you have the floor. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Good morning to all of you and also happy new and healthy and wealthyyears from my side. Before we can adopt the agenda, I will go through it to introduce you to the latest documents that we have received. So as the Chair said, we have 17 working documents and to date I havereceived 34 informal documents. So as the Chair already introduced in agenda item 1, we have four informal documents from the Secretariat. We will go through them now. And the agenda item 2, we have also somehighlights of WP29 and also some free information about the next Inland Transport Committee session in February. And agenda item 3A, as usual, we have quite a lot of documents for amending UN regulation 83.This is working document 7 and 8, together with informal 8. For UN regulation 101, we have working document 9. Andthen for regulation 154, quite a lot of documents. Working documents 2 and 3, to amend the original and theO1 series of UN regulation 154. We have working document 10, together with informal document 21, to amend the O2series of UN regulation 154. And working document 11, together with informal document 22, to amend the O3 series of UN regulation154. Then we have a series of informal documents for discussion probably today. On UN regulation 83, we have informal 09. We have informal 10 and 23 for some elements and plans for amendments for UN regulation 154. We have a more detailed proposal and specific proposal from OICA, informal11, to amend supplement 2 to the 1st series, original and 1st series of UN regulation 154. Go down as well on the screen. And then finally, we have a proposal from Sweden to amend the O2 and O3 series of UN regulation 154. This is informal 19. And agenda item 15 and GTR 15, on theWATP, agenda item 3B, I don't know what I said. We have a working document 12, together with informal 12, to bring back some improvements that were in UN regulation 154 to bring them back into UN GTR 15. And also we just received an informal document from AAPC to also amend this proposal and working document 12. This is informal 34. So we will tackle all of that together.We were supposed to have a presentation from Korea under agenda item 3C. This was informal 7. This has been withdrawn. So you will no longer find it on the webpage. Next, under agenda item 4A, we have working documents 13 and 14 to amend UN regulation 49. And also some information about highhydrogen dual fuel engines from OICA. This is informal 18. No proposals yet under agenda item 4B and 4C. Next, agenda item 5, we have one proposal, working document 15 from OICA to amend UN regulation 85. Under agenda item 6, nonroad mobile machineries, we have two working documents, 16 and17, to amend UN regulation 96 and UN regulation 120. So along with the working documents, 16 and 17, we have two informals, 13 and 14, to provide some backgrounds and latest improvements. And also we have a proposal and a presentation from the Netherlands under this agenda item 6A. This is informal 24. Agenda item 7,now this has been split into 7A, B, C. So 1st under UN regulation 24, we have a working document for 1st amendment to UN regulation 24. This is working document 2024/4 together with informal 25 and its final status report informal 27. And we also have some background information on the improvement that were madeto GTR 24 in informal document 06 and 26. Then we will have a status report from the informal working group on PMP under agenda item 7B. This is informal 28. And also a presentation from the Netherlands on the health effects of brake wear particle emissions. This is informal 30. New agenda item, the activities of the tax force on tire abrasion. We have two informaldocuments, the status reports from the tire the tax force on tire abrasion. This is informal 29. We have now received a revision 1 which is online. And also we have a presentation from the experts of OICA of a study that was done for OICA. This is informal 20, revision 1. And the agenda item 8, motorcycle and mopeds, no proposals under agenda item 8A and 8 B. And we will receive the status reports from the informal working group on EPPR later this week. Still to be uploaded. Under agenda item 9, EVE, we have working documents to amend GTR 21. This is working document 5 together with informal 16 and 17 which is the final statusreport on the determination of electrified vehicle power. And also we have a new proposal for an amendment to you and GTR 22 on in-vehicle battery durability for light duty vehicles. This is working document 6 together with informal 32 and informal 33 which is the final status report for the GTR amendment development. And also we will receive status reports from the informal working group on EVE which also met yesterday in theyesterday. Under agenda item 10, we have no proposals at the moment. Under agenda item 11, I think the Ambassador will just make some oral report. We have no presentation at the moment. Under agenda item 12, we will get the status reports from the informal workinggroup on vehicle interior air quality later this week. No proposals under agenda item 13. Under agenda item 14, we will have the status reports from the informal working groupon the automotive life cycle assessment. This is informal 31 to be tackled this afternoon according to the running order. Priority topics later this week we will refresh and maybe updatethe latest list of priorities from our work. And then under AOB and the other business, wehave the status report and the latest activities from the task force on automated vehicle regulation screening. This is informal 15. And I think with that, that's all we have at the moment in termsof documents. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We can proceed with the adoption of the agenda. Yes. Thank you, Francois. I will check if there are some questions. I see a raised hand by OICA. Bill,I think. Yes, Bill, you have the floor. Yes, thank you. Good morning. Happy New Year, everyone. Regarding tire abrasion, we have got a working paper for GRBP next month which to my knowledgeshould be presented to GRPE for information at least. And it seems to me curious that it is not mentioned on the agenda and not uploaded to the Wiki. Would it be possible to do so?Or is there a reason for not doing that? Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Of course, we can do that because there is a reference to that. And I think the co-chair of the task force tire abrasionis the LOD raising the hand. So LOD, you have the floor. Good morning, everyone. And I wishyou all a very happy new year. Thank you to OICA for that question. We could indeed refer to the working document submitted to GRPE for next month's meeting in the status report referencesmade to it and with the co-chair of the task force we do intend to describe this document. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. So we can make the reference. So everyone can go to the websiteand see the document. I don't know if it is needed to put it also on our website, but because everything is public available, so we can take this into consideration maybe to notice. Maybeyou can as well the reference of the document is in your status report but maybe you can address it now that if you are ready, if you know the exact number of the document, that maybe helpas well the GPE to take note of that document when we have this on our agenda. LOD. Thankyou, Chair. GRBP 2024/10 and the reference is contained in the status report. Thank you.Okay. So it is the document from the GRBP 2024/10 you mentioned? Okay. So everyone can go to that document if needed then to have a look at it when we touch this during that agenda pointwhich will be in the afternoon on the agenda point 7. Yeah? Okay. Yeah, then directly cango to if there are no other questions to adopt the agenda? Yes? See no obstructions. Okay. Thenwe adopt the agenda. Then how we deal with these three days with the agenda points? We have some requests to put some topics on specific dates and there is the informal document, GPE/19/2and GPE/19/3 which gives the running order. And there we see that we have, of course, the normal agenda point 1, 2 and 3 and 3 is of the light duty vehicles but in the afternoon directlywe will start with the agenda point 7 on the GTR number 24 and the P and P group, the informal working group and, of course, the task force on tire abrasion and the update of that withthe document what we just mentioned. Then we have a request to also in the afternoon directly go to item 14 on the automotive life cycle assessment, the ALCA. So we will have an update from thisgroup as well in the afternoon. And if time is already still there in the afternoon, we can continue with agenda point 3 if needed. If we all have touched this in the morning, it is also okay butthis is what we predict. On Thursday we start in the morning with the agenda 4 and 5, heavy dutyand then the topics on the regulation 24/85 and then we have a request to directly start with agenda point 6 which is, of course, the normal order of the agenda but we have to bekeen that we keep the agenda item 6 on the Tuesday morning. That was the request. And then we goto 8 because 7 is already tackled today, will be tackled today. The ePPR is agenda point 8, it will be on Thursday in the morning as well. And the afternoon, we have also a request forthe EVE and formal working group to be tackled and we start with that directly. Even if we are not ready with the other topics, we will start with the EVE. And then 11 and 13 andon Friday we have the additional points of our agenda, 10, 12, 15 and 16. I want an agreementthat we go in this kind of running order through our agenda. Okay. Let's see, everyone is finewith that. So then we go to further with agenda point 1 still because we have some general informationon the from the GPE. So I give the floor to Francois with informal document 04. Thanks, Mr. Chair. And there is a revision 1 to 04 that I will upload later on. It is stillnot online. There is a few additions, especially for this session. So this 90th session is in person only. You have the listen live available. We don't know who is online but anybody canlisten, not hear us, not see us, but at least listen to us and they cannot take the floor. As you might have seen, the palace is quite empty this week because we had to extend the closureof the palace. So only me, I think, as UN staff is in the office this week. No, but mainly all the people who have to service the conference or the interpreters, the room services are working.Most of the staff who doesn't have a meeting this week are required to stay home because we are UN in Geneva is short of cash. Some of the countries haven't paid their contribution from last year. So we are struggling to pay our energy bills, it seems. So as a consequence, there will be no counting this week. There will be somelunch, warm lunch hopefully, snack options at the bar Serpent which will be open until 3:00 p.m. So afternoon coffee break I guess will have to be made through the vending machines. So my apologies about that. About the next sessions, so the 91st session will be held on 21st to 24th of May. We had requested later 2nd week of June, but again because there are a lotof conferences in June, we were asked to be moved and also because the room capacity will be short in this period, this building, this E building, the whole building will be closed starting July. So maybe there is some early preparatory work already for two years. So again for the next two years, I think we will be short on meeting rooms, large meeting rooms. But the older part of the building will reopen slightly. I think some of us alreadyhad meetings there. If we want informal Working Group meetings in conjunction with GRP in May, you can inform the Secretariat. I have checked the large hybrid meeting room that we have in our new building already booked for the 21st and 22nd of May. So we are left with very little options for hybrid informal Working Group meetings in May. We willmaybe count on some missions room as we did this week with the EU mission room. Thanks for that, the EU to host us yesterday for the EVE. The proper session of the GRP will start on the Wednesday 22nd of May and the deadline for submission of official working documents is therefore quite soon on the 27th of February, 2024. And this is scheduled as an in-person only meeting.So because of this very short deadline for the official document for the May session, the Chair is proposing to have an additional session of GRPE in October. We could secure a room in October from the 14th to the 16th of October. This is Monday to Wednesday. And so the corresponding deadline for this would be 22nd of July, 2024.So I guess this week we need to agree on priorities, agenda and what we want to do with those two sessions. I think there has already been a lot of expectations in informal Working Groups about this extra session in October. So I think now is the time to discuss it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Yes. Thank you. So I'll acknowledge that this is a new situation for you to have this year not only two but three GRPE sessions. And I know that could be I don't know if that's a burden for the Delegates to travel three times to Geneva. And the deadline, of course, for working documents on the26th or 27th of February is very, very short. So I already made my complaints during the WP29 session that this is already from January to May or June is already a short period for working documents. And now they put us much earlier in May for our session which isI think give complications for us to work on documents in for working documents for adoption in then May which is only more or less a month time for that after our session. So therefore I think it is opposed to have this October session. But then still what we do with the May and the October sessions, how we deal withour agenda. So we were thinking as the GRPE team for how could we tackle this because we have also many, many days, maybe too much days for our proper GRPE sessions. And if there is no possibility for informal working groups, maybe we have to deal with some others. So we had some ideas how to fill in this. And we will bring this here to the group. And we don't have to decide now. But we can explore a little bit and we will come back on Friday. But we willask Francois to put this on the screen, what we as GRPE, which ideas we have for the May session possibility to fill in that situation and the session in October. So the proper session of GRPE is one and a half day. I think that is enough for a proper session if we have short notice for the deadline, the 26th or 27th ofFebruary. So only the Tuesday and the Friday morning. Still struggling with the that we don't have hybrid situation because we can have a room here but we cannot have hybrid or Webex possibilities. So then we have a face-to-face meeting. We could have a kind of a kind ofworkshops on new topics. It is not that we have to tackle this topic but we were thinking about two of the possibilities to have some ideas to take a look at it. One is the sustainable battery standardization. There is a lot of activities going on the batteries, not only in the EVE group but the battery regulation. There are activities on the commoncommunication with the grid. We have the end of life and the reusability activities, maybe not only in Europe but worldwide. So to have a little bit of landscape and we have, of course, the I forgot the name, the agenda, the breakthrough agenda. Yeah, the breakthrough agenda. We have thebreakthrough agenda as well which also takes the communication between the electric vehicles and the grid. So to make a kind of an umbrella of what is going on on this kind of activities and how we deal with that. So that could be one of the topics for the workshop. I hope I said everything correctly. Maybe you have to add something, Francois? No? To the EVE? Yeah, okay.And the other topic, what was also not very much thought on but it was a white spot, what we discovered is that in practice we see a lot of rate of it from vehicles to electrifying. So taking out the combustion engine and electrifying it to put an electric engine. We have no, as well for hydrogen, we have no regulation at the moment but we see in practice that this is occurring and isthis something for the GEP as well. So maybe also safety issue are involved. So maybe we could have contact with the GRSP, passive safety which dealing with the EVS in the electric vehicles and safety. So this is also an idea. It is not that we have to do this but it is only an idea what could be a possibility. So 1st with this and maybe the 2ndone is then the October session where we have more time because the deadline is 22 of July for working documents to be tabled then in the October session which could then go to W29 in March. So we have then a better, the whole period to the summer break to prepare working documents. So I think this is then and I give that option was given by the W29 that I couldhave this additional session. So maybe focusing more on the October session than on the May session for adopting documents. If there are some directly reactions, you can say that. Otherwise we come back to let it land a little bit and to come back on Friday. But I see United States. Mike, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And speaking not so much from the U.S. but as the EVE Chairman in this regard. So a happynew year to everyone. It's good to see you all. So just to provide one data point with respect to the process right now and not necessarily to say that this is the answer. But for the EVE because we are a bit delayed in our heavy duty GTR process, we could use the extra time certainly. So it looks like for the EVE, the May 2024 session would not be so important. But the October 2024 session would actually beconvenient for the EVE to produce the GTR. That bit of a delay would help us out a lot. And so just that's one thing for your consideration. And I said that doesn't have to be the deciding factor but it certainly would work well for the EVE process as we stand right now. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. European Commission. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning to everybody. First of all, I have to say it'sgood to be back to GRP after quite a few years away from this room. And yeah, I think what this group is doing is very important and I'm glad to be part of it. To react a bit on the proposal for 3rd GRP for this year, I must say that as you said for the Delegates, it's quite difficult to travel here, to get the travel budget and to have it approved and to be able to come here. And we are not the ones coming from the furthest away. Of course, we have many colleagues here comingfrom other continents. But I think it would be very good to reopen the discussion on the possibility for hybrid meetings which would be very important to us. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Commission. That is indeed also one of our say proposals or which we brought to the ITC on the climate change mitigation to think about the possibility of hybrid sessions forthe reduced traveling because that's also reducing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. But indeed sometimes you have to come together because the coffee breaks and the lunches are very important to have discussions and to find solutions for the difficult topics what we have on our agenda. So it is a mix of both. So indeed. Yeah, maybe then we can also put the Option 2, what we think ofand that's a little bit maybe also what the reaction from the Commission is that we completely skip the May session. It is okay. Then we don't we keep it to two sessions and not use the May session and only the October session for our work. Then we have we started in the beginning of the week, I think, Francois, isn't it? We started already on Monday, the 14th of Octoberso the conjunction with informal Working Groups should be then before the weekend or so if you want to do something what you will deliver afterwards or to do directly after the proper GOP. I don't know if that works out the best but maybe Francois, you don't want to add something there? But we can also have some virtual workshops if needed. So the planning on that side is also possible. So these are thetwo options what we think of. Don't have to react now. Don't ask now because maybe it is a little bit new for you all. So we will come this week back to what will be the best outcome for all of you. But if there are some 1st reactions, of course, the floor is open. Japan, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chair and happy new year. About the workshops, I mentioned in the previous slide, thank you for the suggestion and Japan has interest in that activity but for further qualification and we are just wondering what is a purpose of the workshop and is it a kind of new activity? So yes, I wouldSo we are just wondering what is the goal and what is the purpose of that activity. Thank you.Yes. The workshop is, of course, a little bit open, but it is more linked also to our priorities from the GPE, from what are the things which is important to tackle and do we have an overview of what is happening andwhat could be the purpose. So it is information sharing, but also say is this an element of a topic what wecould taking on board. So it is a pre-work on activities what we can take on board. And but also informationsharing as well. So it could also be information sharing and not going to start an activity. It is not a necessity. But it can also be information sharing that everyone is at knowledge also for other groups which we maybe invite to seewhat kind of activities on the topic is going on. So the multi-purpose, I think. And, of course, we can also do that in October.So this workshop is not only linked to the May session. We can also organize something in October. So let us explore here in theGPE and we come back on Friday. Yeah. Okay. Francois, you want to add something? Is everything set about this? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good. Then we go to the highlights of the June and November session ofWIPO 29 and ITC. I give the floor back to Francois with the informal document. What is it? My list. Five. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Chair indeed. So we move to agenda item 2, informal 5. So the highlights of the last WIPO 29 sessions andsome pre-information about the next ITC and other relevant information. So for the June 2023 WIPO 29, all the proposals from GRP were adopted. You can find more information on the report. Main elements, so UNR168 on RDE was adopted in June, but the notification, so you know there is after the adoption the six months notification to all the countries to reactbut the start of the notification was delayed because the translation didn't provide the text in all the three working languages. So as a consequence the dated of entry into force is slightly delayed to 26 of March 2024. Apologies forfor that. Also with respect to the ITC climate change mitigation strategy, WP29 agreed back in June to task GRPE to coordinate and gather all of the inputs from all of the GRs on behalfof WP29 and to prepare some documents for the whole WP29 and all of the GRs on the inputs that was asked by the ITC on this topic. Also regarding the screening of UN regulations andGTRs regarding the fitness for automated driving systems and we have a document later in the week on this. WP29 requested the GRs to present the timeline for amending the relevant regulationsin March 2024, so the next session. So we will hear more from the task force, GRP task force on the topic later this week. For the November WP29 session, again all of the proposals fromGRPE were adopted. The Chair of GRVA introduced a proposal for a draft resolution with guidance on artificial intelligence in the context of road vehicle and the review by GRVA. You canfind the informal WP29 informal document reference here. Maybe we as GRPE could have a look at this document to maybe introduce and provide elements on the energy and environmental dimensionsto this. So up to you just for your information. I think maybe some input from GRP would be usefulhere. Still in the November 2023 session of WP29, WP29 endorsed then the proposal which was developedbetween June and November by dedicated task force and the GRP and WP29. So this is what we as WP29 family sent to ITC in terms of our contribution to the draft strategy and I will come back to thatlater on. So this is the symbol of what has been sent to ITC Secretariat. This is informal WP29/191/27revision 1. Also in November we had a presentation from the Secretariat of WP5. WP5 is the working party on trends and economics to introduce the latest activities related to EVs and charginginfrastructure. So WP29 has produced a publication to be released I think in the coming weeks on general trends and developments surrounding electric vehicle and the charging infrastructure. Sothis was split as you can see in five different documents because of word limits for working documents of WP5. Also WP5 in the session in September, usually they meet once a year inSeptember, they agreed to create an informal task force focusing on coordinating efforts related to EV development and the charging infrastructure both within ECE and across the different programsand not only transport but also energy divisions and in collaboration with other institutions. The draft terms or references of this task force are finalized and they will be considered by ITC in February. For those interested, I have the document symbol ready. It's not uploadedyet but it will be uploaded by the end of the week. And in terms of the contributions and inputs from WP29, the GRVS Secretariat is coordinating the inputs for WP29. Other topics of interest,the informal working group on ITS and the task force on vehicle communication and I think our Vice Chair is part of the leadership teams in both the informal working group on ITS and the task force on vehicle communication held a workshop dedicated to EV charging communicationsprotocol. I think that was at the end of August. And you have the links in this informal five about the meeting material and the meeting minutes from this workshop. And also this vehicle communicationtask force prepared some vehicle communication overview for the task force on vehicle communication. So basically this is kind of a bit equivalent to our mutual resolution on the power training definition. So it's a bit to qualify what do we mean by vehicle communication, the differentcases, et cetera. So it's a bit of a glossary, let's say, of what is vehicle communication in the view of the task force. So maybe we could also here as JPE add further inputs on theEV charging infrastructure communications protocol cases. And then this is my last slide on the next 86th ITC session to take place at the end of February this year from the 20 to 23rd. Therewill be a high level statement on taking ambitious climate actions moving towards the carbonized inland transport by 2050 with hopefully the adoption of the climate change mitigation strategy for inland transport. So there's quite a lot of documents related to this climate changetopic at the ITC. You have the documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. So document 1 is the concept note for the high level segment. It's already online. You have the hyperlink here. Document2 is the high level statement of support which we expect to be signed by the ministers attending ITC or supporting the ITC climate change mitigation strategy. This will be available early Februarytogether with the main strategy on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from inland transport. So those two documents are still in discussion with the ITC and the countries to make sure we have something acceptable with everyone. Then we have the document 4 and 5, the in-depth reportof inland transport. It's basically to draw a picture of where we are in terms of inland transport decarbonization plans and all the links that to the UNFCCC NDCs and the VNRs ofthe SDGs as well as the voluntary national reductions reviews. And last, document 6 for the ITC, that is the inland transport and climate change activities of the inland transport committee and its subsidiarybodies. And here, so the work that we have prepared for WP 29, this informal document from WP 29/27 revision 1 is then featuring in an annex and there we have all of this work and all the contributionsreceived from the different working parties below ITC that are compiled in this document to make sure we have listed all the information from all the working parties active in the fieldof climate change mitigation. And I think that's it on this for me, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Francois, for updating about the activities of WP 29 and ITC and you see also in the ITC,the inland transport committee, the climate change is now on the top of the agenda. Most of them this are the safety issues but now the climate change is really now on the top list and withthe high priority to discuss activities which are going on and we will also come back to maybe the GEP as well. And they already notice our activity on automotive life cycle assessmentis already known by the ITC and supported that we continue with that activity on the carbonfootprint of the whole vehicle chain. I see the floor ask for France. Thank you, Chair. I'mgrateful to the Secretariat also for that presentation. I have a question on the November WP 29, the November meeting, the GRVA introduced a document, I think it's the 19/16 on the updating of thesoftware of regulation 156 that needs to be taken into account by all the GRs. My question is should we start working on that now or should we wait for a mandate from WP 29 on that matterbefore we start acting? Thank you. Thank you, Elodie. I have not directly an answer for thisbut do you have an answer, Francois, for this? Indeed an interesting question. Maybe we shouldwait for what WP 29 decides to attribute to the GRs but I think at this stage I don't thinkGRP is ready to take any concrete actions on this topic, right? Yeah. But maybe they will. That willcome after the WP 29 session that are some activities launched to us. But indeed we have to see whatwill come maybe in the March session of WP 29. Okay. Other questions? Okay. If not, then we canfinish with Agenda Point 2 and go to Agenda Point 3 where our technical work will start now. And we start with light duty vehicles, 3A. And we have here a proposal from OICA proposing a newsupplement from the O5 series of the UN regulation 83 proposed to extend the option which already in 06/07 of regulation 83 and to allow the calculation of road load values which are alreadyin the GTR number 15. It is a working document 2024/7. I will give the floor to OICA to presentthe document. OICA, you have the floor. Yes, thanks, Andre. Apparently it is me. No, that'sfine. Yes, it is a relatively simple one. Basically the situation is that with the introduction of WLTP and all of the different methods of road load determination and calculating one road load fromanother and everything there, we transposed that into the 6 and 7 series of amendments. There'sconfusion always occurs with a number of test procedure elements when we get back to the 8305. And just to take a couple of minutes to explain the history of that, when we introduced thestricter particle measurement process, Chris Parkin, the Chair of PMP at the time came up with the idea of an unreferenced Annex. So we introduced in regulation 83 Annex 4 and Annex4A. And Annex 4A at the time was unreferenced. And we have since devolved to the situationthat basically Annex 4A is the current for any post series and is referenced, but it then becomes redundant effectively in the 05 series. And due to that confusion, there was certainlya misunderstanding in the transposition here. So all we are doing here is copying the text that was previously used for allowing these different derivations of road load backwardsinto the 05 series and then you see a little note right at the end of the technical set of amendments that just says delete Annex 4A, just then for clarity and to hopefully prevent anyconfusion in the future. So in summary, there are all changes that have already been adopted in other series of amendments by GRPE. So hopefully it will be a relatively simple adoption hereback in the 05 series. Thank you. Thank you, Bill, for this work. It is an old series, theold five, but still maybe good to bring this in line for some regions which are using the regulation 83 in the still in the 05 series. So it doesn't touch a lot of our main contractingparties, but some regions could make use of it. Not to do additional testing, additionalrequirements, which is a burden for them. Yeah? I see Germany, Helge Schmidt, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. So Germany, we supportthis proposal since it makes things much easier and we have a method which is already in useon the other amendment series of UNR 83. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Italy? Antonio? Thank you. Thank you,Andrea. Thank you, Chairman. Good morning to everybody. Happy New Year, all of you. We also support the proposal. Thank you. Yes,thanks. So I think if I think everyone could support this and don't ask every contracting party to take it around if there are some contracting parties in disagreement with adopting this document, then raise hands now. Otherwise we can take this as the 1st adopted document, working document from our GOP session this week.Yeah. I see no. So okay. Then we have adopt the document 2023/sorry, 2024/7 adopted. Thanks. Thanks, OICA. Then we go again to OICA because we have another document as well for them proposing a new supplementon Regulation 83 introducing some correction and clarifications and this is linked to the document which was already tabled in the 89th session of the GOP. So I will give the floor to OICA to present the working document 2024/8 and the informal document 90/08. So the floor is for OICA.Yes. So good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Also happy new year. I will start with the working document as you can see it on the screen. I think the contents pretty much are known already as they were also presented as an informal in the last meeting. Maybe to recap the goal of this working document is mainly to correct let's say some errors that were present in the currentversion or are present in the current version of the 8th series of amendments from the contents. I think the major change with this working document is with regards to the vehicle type definition which is proposed to align with the vehicle type definition of UNR154 to ensure that always vehicles which are covered by one UNR154 approval or vehicle type can also be part of the same or one vehicletype with regards to UNR 83/08. In the current situation, there could be rare cases with regards to the reference masses that this might not be the case. And then maybe to add on that,we could have a look at the informal document. The contents of the informal document, of course, are new to the group here. However, the informal document 08 also doesn't aimto introduce any changes from the contents, more to try to give a little bit more clarity on the requirements which are connected to the different emission characters. And we havedrafted, in fact, three different options how this could be done or achieved. And basically we would aim to go with the option that is seen as the best one in the GRPE here. The 1stoption would be to include some footnotes to the table that we see here which explains a little bit more which kind of requirements are connected to which kind of emission character or emission level. The 2nd option would be to include this kind of text and informationwithin the transitional provisions of 83/08 which at the moment is the current place where this kind of explanation of emission code and connected requirements is for 83/08. Andthe 3rd option, and that's also the option we received, let's say, the most positive feedback in the pre-discussions we had would be to adapt the table that we saw beforehand and to includeall of the information that were previously in Option 1 in the footnotes in this table.By doing Option 3, you would have one table in the regulation with the different emission codes and also the connected requirements per emission codes, meaning AES flag, e.g. , would be added and also which kind of utility factor should be used and so on. By doing that,of course, you can then make the transitional provisions maybe as a closing point on the last page a little bit leaner because then you don't need that kind of explanation in the transitional provisions. You can refer to the table and only include implementing dates in the transitionalprovisions. So that would be it from my side. I'm happy to answer any questions. Okay. Thank you, Oika. It's a little bit difficult for me to see you, but I think it was Fritz, isn'tit? Yeah. So you are behind all the so that's sometimes you have not a complete overview here.This was a little bit searchy, but okay. Thank you, Fritz, for this update of the document. Yeah, the floor is open. I see asking the floor from the UK. Thank you, Mr. Chair and happy new year,everyone. Thank you to Oika for making this proposal. We are very supportive of the working document and the informal document. Our preferred option as Fritz mentioned there is Option 3.Just one question. There is still a footnote 4 on the table there referring to the EU's review of the utility factors. I noticed it's in square brackets. I was wondering if Oika were willing to perhapsremove that footnote or what their options were there. Thank you. Yeah. Good question. Give the floor back to Oika. Yes. So the square brackets originated from the discussions we had previouslyI think from our point of view we would be fine with deleting this kind of footnote. It's just mentioning what is included in the EU WLTP Act that the last version, let's say, of the utility factor might besubject to a review and therefore, of course, might change. That's why we included the footnote here. But as I said, I put it in square brackets. So if I think GRP decides that this kind of remark is notnecessary in the UN regulation, we would be happy also to delete it, of course. Yeah. Thanks. It'sgood to mention it, but maybe we don't need it in the UN regulation to put in this footnote. But if this will be changed or adopted, there will be anyhow a new corrector and a new amendment. Soit does not change the value. I think there will be a new value and the other will disappear. Butlet's see how the transition provision in Europe will continue about that. But I think not too complicated here to have this kind of review. I think it may be better to delete, that's my suggestion, but I don'tknow if it's also the suggestion from the UK or to delete the part between the square brackets. Yeah.We can agree with that. Okay. Thank you. Do we also directly tackle the informal document or because it is a little bit linked with the transitional provisions, of course. So may introduce as wellbefore we adopt this the informal document 08. Give the floor again to Euka. In fact, I already presentedthe informal document and the working document. So the table that we just saw with the three options, this is part of the informal document 8 and the working document I presented quite quickly as it'sonly error corrections and contents-wise only the vehicle type definition change. Okay. Sorry about that. But we have to make a decision about which option we have to tackle then, 1, 2 or 3. I knowthat it was a kind of idea to take the option 3 but let it open for the floor to which option we takeon board with this amendment. The floor is open. France. Thank you, Chair. Just to confirm that Francesupports option 3 as well and is in agreement of deletion of footnote 4. Thank you. Italy. Thank you.We also support option 3. Thank you. Thanks. Germany. Helga. Thank you very much. So on the one hand concerning the working document we think it's quite important to have the same definition for the vehicle type inUNR 154 and UNR 8308 and for the informal document we prefer option 3. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We dosupport as well option 3. I think it's clarifying the situation. For what concerns the note under square bracket if my recollection is correct in the amendment to UNR 154 that we adopted last year we removed thereference to the review of the UF for the plug-in hybrid. So I think it makes sense as the UK suggested not to take this footnote into account. And I had one question to OICA because I reckon that thelanguage used in this informal document 98 is to a big extent inspired from European legislation, but there in European legislation in the definition of Euro 6 E, Euro 6 E, BIS, et cetera, we also specifythat there is for OBFCM applying for N2 vehicles and I wanted to understand why it's not present here in these notes. I did not have the opportunity to dig further, so I would really appreciate some insightfrom OICA on that one. Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the support, of course, for the option 3. So that is inline. I can react directly or see also the floor from Sweden. Okay. Go 1st to Sweden. You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chair, and happy New Year and good morning to all. I just want to say that we also support this proposal and the informal document and support option 3. And we can also remove this footnote.That's okay. Thank you. Okay. Could OICA reflect on the question from the Commission on the eventstopic? Yes. Fred, you have the floor. Yes. So if I understood the question correctly, I think theOBFCM requirements are included only in UNR 154 and UNR 154, e.g. , does not really know those kind of emission characters. They are not really included in there. And I would need to doublecheck, but I would guess that the specification that, e.g. , OBFCM would be required for N2 vehicles is present in UNR 154 and we did not try to reflect, let's say, all kind of different requirementswithin UNR 154 for different vehicle types within this table here only which is all the requirementswhich are, let's say, covered by 83/8. That's why it's not present. The Commission? Yes. Yes. Thankyou. And thanks, OICA, for the reply. If I could suggest, Mr. Chairman, maybe it's better if we can delay the adoption for after the coffee break so we can have a quick exchange with OICA during the coffeebreak on that and make sure that we do things right. Okay. Okay. That's, of course, a good suggestionto do that. Therefore, the coffee breaks are so important, huh? To clarify. Yeah. I thought as well that the VANS are included in Regulation 83 and 154, but okay. Maybe I misunderstood. But okay. Good. Thenso we take that then back after the coffee break and if we can go further, time for coffee break, we cantake now or yeah, we can take it now. Why not? We can take a coffee break now to 11:10. Is that okay?10 minutes past 11:00 and we come back here. Okay. We can continue, please. I was asked to have maybesolution on the scope and the VANS, but give you more time that you can do it also after the lunchtime andcome back then in the afternoon. So then we can have some more time to have the solution there. So then Iwant to go to the next proposal is Working Document 2024/9 from OICA on proposing a new supplement tothe 01 series of that regulation introducing some improvements on the measurement process which already is in 02. So I give the floor to OICA to introduce Working Document 9. Please, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to everyone. Happy New Year. This document is a very simple document.We already submitted during the June session of GRP. It is a proposal that is intended to align the requirementsso regulation 101 with those from regulation 154 with regard to the charter requirements and measurementmethods for hybrid electric power trains. Nothing really new because as I said, these requirements are all already inplace for regulation 154. And the current version of 101 can be interpreted that for COP vehicle preparation is needed, the procedure isstill needed, the procedure that is described in the current version of regulation 101. So it seems logical to amendthe regulation 101 in line with what has been already adopted for 154 regulation. And the text is simply modifying the current wordingof 101 in line with the regulation 154. What has been discovered after the submission of this document, thanks to UK for spotting a mistake, there is a smallmistake in point 32251, charging procedure. The item B, there is a lacking wording after the end of the sentence in the point B. Charging time exceeds maximum time defined in paragraph 5222 and it is neededto add the text in annex 7 because this paragraph is not correctly mentioned in this way and we need to make reference to annex 7 in the point B of this paragraph. For the rest, I don't have any particular things to be added. This is a simplification, a simple alignmentwith the procedure for preparation of vehicle and verification for COP for electric energy consumption and it is a simple alignment with what is already in place. So we don't expect issues and we are ready to answer questions. Thank you very much.So the amendment is shown here on the screen, what you mentioned. I ask you for the floor, comments. I see the UK. David, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for the proposal and for taking on board the comments. I just had a further look at this during the break. There is an alternative option to adding of annex 7 here. So there is an identical paragraph within annex 8and it is paragraph 3.2252, end of charge criteria. So it might make more sense to refer to simply paragraph 3.2252 rather than a paragraph in the other annex. Thank you. Okay. So if we could put that in writing so that we have the clear text when we adopt this and we can take that in the afternoon. So don't hurry it nowto be that we see everyone. But if there are some general remarks otherwise it is the only one and maybe look because now we have it on the table and, of course, we can directly see if there are some other comments or objections. I think we are in line with that. So everyone is happy with the proposal from OICA. I thank OICA for this and we correct this thanks also fromthe UK to find this small error and to improve the document. So that's good. Okay. So we come there back in the afternoon. Okay. I have said that. Then the next point on Agenda Point 3A we have an OICA proposal to go back to my overview. Yeah, we have anOICA proposal for a new supplement or the original 01 series of UN Regulation 154 which is the huge big one we know and here we have a consolidated version of it with some corrections, clarification and improvements on the introduced 02 and 03 series. We know this is a huge and thick document so we always know that there is somecorrections, clarifications needed. It is always a pity but, okay, that's when we have such a huge document. But we have two working documents, the 2024/2 and 2024/3. I give the floor to OICA to introduce these two documents. OICA. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And happy new year to everyone. Yeah, we have created revised UNR 154version of the original series by comparing it to the adopted version of the UNR 154 series 2. So all the changes made in this new supplement include some corrections and the already adopted procedures in the UNR 154 series 2 and this also appliesfor the UNR 154 series 1 which we compared to the adopted version of the 3rd series of UNR 154. After handing in the working documents we have also spotted some other editorial points and those issues are mentioned in theinformal document GRPE 90/10 and we also made a proposal for the transitional provisions. It is easier as it is a large document to say which points are not included in the new versions of the original version and the series 1 which are the PN for three cycle testtests which are not included. The OBFCM check of accuracy and COP, those changes are also not included in both supplements and changes to the utility factor have also not been takenover in those two proposed supplements. Yeah, that's it for now. I'm happy to answer yourquestions. Thank you. The floor is open. You, of course, know that there are a lot of otherdocuments related with amendments to the regulation 154. So I think we will take before we makedecisions to adopt 1st all the other documents as well into consideration and then make ourfinal vote for adopting the documents. I think this is the best to do. Okay. So I see thatin general we support your amendments and corrections. I don't see any response from the floor. Sothat is fine. So we oh, the European Commission. Okay. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chairmanand thanks a lot to OICA for all of that work and it takes quite a lot of time to keep up to date the former series of amendments of 154 and to ensure that they remain up to date andcan be potentially used if a contracting party was willing to implement this former series of amendments. Of course, for us in the EU we are not to this series of amendments. So it'ssomewhat less relevant to us at this point but yet we would be quite eager to still have the opportunity to review the content of this document and I must say that we could not find the resourcesup to now to do that. So if that would suit all contracting parties and also the experts from OICA we think it would be best to try and postpone the adoption for the next GRP. Thankyou. Yes. There are some other amendments in regulation 154. So maybe also these has to bea little bit taking on board and to elaborate a little bit. If there is no hurry, yeah, corrections should be done as early as possible. That is also what I want to urge everyone if we seea mistake that we should correct them and not wait. But if we want to be sure that it is in line with, say, regional requirements as it is in Europe and the linkage is there that wehave to be keen. So fine for us to take some action there but okay. I take that as notice and we go to also the other documents and see how we proceed. Yeah. So thank you. Thanks againfor OICA to introduce the two documents and then I go to the next document. It is the workingdocument 2024/10 with an informal document 21 on the 02 series of regulation 154 and the 2024/11with the informal document 22 with the correction on the 03 series of amendments dealing I think with the topic of Japan to make it fit with the regional requirements which are dealingin Japan. So we give the floor to Japan to introduce these two documents including the two informaldocuments. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and happy new year for everyone. SoI would like to explain summary of our proposal. Japan submitted two working documents, the documentnumber 10 and 11. It is an amendment for UNR 150/02 and 03 series to introduce assigned deteriorationfactors for diesel light vehicles that classified level 1B in the 02 series and level 2 in the03 series. And Japan also submitted two informal documents, the document number 21 and 22 tofulfill the square brackets in the value of their assigned deterioration factors on each workingdocument. And I apologize for right to submit the informal document. Actually I was in thesorry. I was in the very fruitful discussion with the German members until last December. Aboutthe background of our proposal, Japan has been considering to introduce assigned deterioration factors fordiesel light vehicle to our domestic regulation and intend to introduce it this year. So it is important to be aligned with UNR and ourJapanese domestic regulations in terms of harmonization. So Japan wishes that the proposals are adapted in this meeting. Onthe other hand, Japan also understands that the frequent amendments of this regulation is not efficient from the viewpointof UN ECE amendment process or homologation process in each region. Therefore, Japan follows GRP decision if this amendment will be voted atWP29 as a consolidated document including the other amendments yet to come in the near future. Thank you. Thank you, Japan. And thank you for these wise words and that's exactly what I wanted to stress, that we want to combine the things in this huge document and thanks to be flexiblefor you to take this on board when we are ready to make the complete consolidated document with all the amendments which are on the table and that there is not directly a stress of hurry that we have to do adopted now and that you are flexible that we take it when we are ready to do that. Of course, this year, I hope that we can do it then in May or in October, what we decide to have in the GRP session.Okay. The floor is open for any questions to you on this assigned additive iteration factor. So we have to look for myself. So we are normally in the correction factor which you have to correct but here it is an added value. So this is another way of looking at it. But it is possible in your legislation, I understand. TheUP Commission. I ask for the floor. You have it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks very much to the Japanese Delegation for preparing that. In principle, I can say that we support the content. It is not really impacting level 1A or the four phases WLTP. So we can support. On the last point that you raised, I think it is a very good point also to take in conjunction with your document 90/23 on the future plans for UNR 154 amendments and theI think it is good to discuss planning and with what frequency we intend to amend UNR 154 and how to proceed in the years to come because I assume these elements, they will keep coming and we really have to think what is best between doing more frequent amendments with less content or to wait, let's say, do an amendment every couple of years or something like that. So I'm happy if we can have at some point such a discussion.Thank you. Thank you, Asim. There is not one way. We already discussed this kind of things, every GOP to not to amend every time not only the GTR but specific also this huge document of regulation 154. It is also a struggle also for the Secretariat here to have the consolidated document translated in English, French and Russian otherwise it cannot be adopted. So to combine and to also formregular point of view in Europe and in other regions it is important that we not have too much every time corrections and amendments. But sometimes if you have to correct a mistake we have to do it as quickly. So there is always a balance. So we try to do the best of all the requests. But okay. Flexibility here is good and wise words. I will be taking that into consideration. So positive. Thank you.Japan for this proposal. Really good. Then if I'm correctly, then we want to go to the next proposal which is also linked with regulation 154. It is an informal document from OICA proposing to align the 05 and 06 series of the regulation 83.1with this UN regulation 154 because they are interlinked with each other and this is dealing with the elements on the type 4 EVAP test. So I give the floor to OICA to present theformal document 19/09. The floor is yours. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Andre. It is a relativelysimple one. Basically the text is around a process that is used mainly in conformity of production for checking that the vehicle's evaporative emission control system is workingwithout going through the burden of a full two day shed test. The text in Reg 83 is very old. I personally know it well because I drafted it in 1988 and it has become basically not fitfor purpose over the years. So when we wrote Reg 154 we brought it effectively as close as possible to the state of the art of the systems and it obviously makes sense because they arethe same evaporative emission control systems fundamentally across both regulations. So it makes sense to align, take the new changes in Reg 154 back into Reg 83. Since the documenthas been published we have had comments from France which highlights one I should say perhaps a discrepancy and that is that in drafting the document I tend to take the approach of the minimumchanges to give the same concept. So on Paragraph 735 the text that we propose here is not identicalto the text in Regulation 154. 154 I certainly accept is slightly clearer and so if any Contracting Party or if GRP as a whole wishes for full alignment I can prepare a document at very short noticeto supersede this one with the full text amendment from Reg 154. Thank you. Thank you Bill. Thankyou also for this willing to work on the consolidated document. On the content, the floor is open.France. Thank you, Chairman and thank you very much for that presentation. For the rest ofthe document France would support this proposed amendment and thank you to Bill for havingtaken on the work to make sure it is fully aligned with 154. Yes. Thank you. So Bill you get the realsupport here. Good work. One of the Contracting Party here. I think support Italy. Antonio. Thankyou. In principle we support this proposal by OIC. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So we take that in the package and we will come back at the end when we have all the 154 stuff whatwe are going to do. Okay. But disembraced the proposal. And then we go to the other proposalfrom OICA introducing a list of issues on all series of amendments for regulation 154, its informal 10. Give the floor back to OICA. Hello, everyone. I'm sitting here. I'm not at theOICA place but yeah, we as there are working documents for the 00, 01, 02 and 03 seriesof UNR154 we have taken the opportunity to collect all the points, editorial issues we have spottedto bring it here to the table like adjusting or adding references where not in adding subunitswhere missing. It is really just some kind of housekeeping I would say and yeah, we have not only yeah, as I said it is all covering all the working documents. So I don't want to goin each and all the details but e.g. here is yeah, kind of just making the wording a bit more smooth. It is just yeah, just an example which is I think very good as page number9. Let's go one slide more. Yeah, e.g. here we had this big restructuring of the CUPparts which are now in one annex or appendix and we have a table which is covering all the CUP final test results. It is covering not only yeah, plug-in hybrid is covering all kind ofCUP values but the paragraph 6.4 is under paragraph which is verification of CEP on charge of deleting of electric energy consumption of HGVs. So it is obvious that yeah, it is maybe not theright it is the content in this table and everything is correct but it might lead to confusion if it is under paragraph which is just linked to energy consumption of plug-in hybrids just asan example. On the next slide, e.g. , it is something which we did right in the O2series but in the O series or in the O1 series it is yeah, it is on the O3 series but alsoon the O1 series. Another point, next slide, e.g. , here is we have the special provisionfor specific values and here we have in one paragraph here the kind of the 1st sentence says this applies only for CO2 and then there is at the end for the application of both equations ofthis paragraph so it is contradicting in itself. So it is also obvious that the 2nd or this is what we strike through and the yellow underline is not required. Furthermore, it is just importantto note that the M E weighted which is also in this paragraph for 1.3.1 is not even interpolated so we are just having this provision when we are interpolating values and then that's justthe justification for that. We have on the next slide said that we had added this or we introducedthe EAR as a declared value. We have it in the report and the certificate but it is not in the information document. So there is also something which needs to be updated and we also would make acomment to the European Commission that to avoid maybe any different information documents in 11.51and UNR154 maybe it is important to delete from there is a error in the slide, it is 11.51, just make a referenceto 11.51, to UNR154. Then the next slide is just to ensure that the table and formulas are consistent. The next slide is adding a reference to the table which is A8/11 which is missing. The next slide is again the same. Then we are on the next slide having for the 01 and 03 series where we are having both for three phase and four phase to make separate tables to make it more clear that if you are performing this test according to this series that youare filling in the tables for three and four phase and then you already have the different tables to make that. Then on the next slide it is kind of also O and 02 series that we have at some places there defined that it is four, three, four, level 1A, level 1B but wemight need to add that we need different declared values for three and four phases. It is just something we see as a thing which might clarify that and support to make it right. The next slide is just the same for the 01 and 03 series. It is the same content but not level 1A, level 1B. It is three phase, four phase.Then the next slide is on the yeah, it is here on these tables regarding the rolling, it is our C values to adjust the footnote here. The justification is written so if there are any questionsplease let us know. Last but not least, the slide here is yeah, that we think that in 1422 there is level 1A only written and we think that this should be deleted because if you and that's a bit small in this picture butwhen you look at the shortened type 1 test procedure you have this dynamic segments, the constant speed segments and these are referencing to the paragraphs here regarding the cycle and the city cycle and for the shortened test procedure you have to drive the complete cycle and the city cycle but if you are referencing to 1422 then for level 1B you are referencing to yeah, it is notthere. So that's I think why it should be deleted and as yeah, city values are not applicable for level 1B, that's something which is already done in the calculations. It is done in the calculation chapter. So it is not necessary to limit it here to level 1A only as this is causing that confusion.And that's all and yeah, happy to receive your comments and thank you. Thank you, Matthias. Yeah, a lot of new topics indeed. Even though we have some amendments already in this document, this is in a presentation format so we have to take notion on it. The floor is open. Germany, Helga.So thank you very much to OICA to prepare this document and in principle we agree that there are improvements necessary to make sure that the calculations defined in UNR 154 are done properly. So I think it is really necessary to do these improvements and to look at these issues very carefully.Yeah, thank you.France. Thank you, Chair. Thank you to OICA for that presentation and for the proposal to improve 154. I would support what Germany said as to the need to clarify the regulation. I also support in particular the introduction the AER into the document. However, I have acomment on slide 12 and perhaps the comment to the European Commission, it might not be the right place to discuss this now, but today there is no equivalent between the INF documentsin 154 and the European regulations. So a direct reference from one to the other is not possible. And then a question on this document, what is the objective of it? Arewe going to adopt it as a package for 154 or is it for a future amendment in May or in theautumn? Thank you. Thank you, Elodie. Yeah, the last question is indeed also my question when we wrap up all the issues to see how we deal with the documents and when we want tohave a consolidated, I hope then a consolidated document to take for vote in the GOP, which I understand we cannot do it now. We see all the reactions now from also the Commission atthe earlier reports and also these new elements. We have to take some note on these new topics that it is good and in line. But I see the question for the floor for the Commission. You'll see.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks a lot to EICA for preparing this list. I can only agree with Germany and France that where we can improve 154, we should aim for it and proceed with it.From our side, we went through the list but we haven't had the time to properly and thoroughly scrutinize all of the elements. So coming back to the timeline question, for sure it wouldbe not for this GRP, I would say, but rather aim for the October GRP potentially because even the next one in May, if it does take place, it is still a very short time frame. But I thinkthat's more or less it. Thank you for your clear view on this, how to proceed. Thanks. I thinkthis is not only for you, but also for the other to have an in-depth view on the amendments which are made within this informal document. Yeah. So it is it was on short notice becauseit is informal 10, but still it was uploaded I think just before Christmas time or something.So indeed we need more time for this as well. Okay. So we have not all the topics of Regulation 154. So also did we park a little bit? We have frozen this a little bit and we come back toit. We want also to see the informal document from Japan on future amendments for Regulation 154, informal 23. Oh, sorry, Bill. It was still on the earlier informal, I suppose. SoBill, you have the floor. Sorry, I missed you. No, it is fine. That's what comes of sitting in the cheap seats, but that's where we are. Yeah, just a sort of procedural question. Just in case there was chance of adopting these documents, of course OICA would just like to see the adoptionas soon as possible, but fully respect the opinions of GRPE. Procedurally we have prepared an informal to include all of these points from the PowerPoint set. For whichever session, whetherit would be for May or October, what would be the preference of GRPE to see it as one single working document with all the points included or would members like to see a differentiationbetween the original points and the secondary points? Thank you. Yeah, explore this, how tobring at the end this kind of amendments to the table for adoption in one of the next sessions or May or in October. And I think that will be earlier October than May. I think May willbe not realistic. I don't know if there are some views in how to make some consolidateddocuments, maybe on the series of amendments split. I don't know if that is logic. But I look also a little bit to Francois, maybe is it logic if we consolidate it to the different seriesof amendments, I suppose. But what is your idea? Probably for such large documents, consolidated versions are better and then we can upload the track and the clean versions and then we adoptthe clean versions but at least for transparency we also have the track version where we can see what are the changes proposed because line by line, yeah, modifications is maybe difficultto track and to then consolidate. Series of amendments separately? Okay. Yeah, we already do, thereis already a document which is in that format to have a clean version and a track change version where we can, of course, adopt any track changes normally in formal documents. So that'sI think most of the logic things to do. And if we are split with the series of amendments, it depends on the topic, I think. I'll let it open for what is the most convenient thingto do. I think anyway for WP29, we need to split the series. So I think the earlier we do it, the better. There is no point in merging them here and then we have to split them forWP29 in any case. So probably better to split the different series in different documents as soon as we can. Thank you. Yes, that's what I was suggesting to do. Otherwise we have todo another transformation again for WP29. I think this is not wise to do so. Okay. So thanks again for the informal document and in the same line because this is a presentation now alsothe document from Japan on future amendments to regulation 154. So we touched a little bit on the issue. We have informal document 23. So let's give the floor to Japan to introducethis document. Japan. Thank you, Chairman. Happy New Year for everyone. This informal document is not intended to discuss but to share short information from Japan. Mr. Chairman, last timethe amendment of 154 is hard for the Secretariat because of the amount of the text and the many amendments. But Japan is considering several amendments to the UNR154 in the future, 2024to 2025. Please look at the document number 23. For example, regarding the 1st one, OBCM is currently applied only to level 1A. But Japan has decided to adopt OBCM in the domestic regulationsso Japan would like to apply it to the level 1B as well as that. And please refer to the table below for the other amendment. I think there are other CPs and we can also consider to amend the UNR154 in thefuture. So the purpose of this information is more efficient to amend the UNR154. So please referto this information for efficient amendment procedures. That's all my explanation. Thank you.Thank you, Japan. And to be here also, this is flexibility. But you said some are in end of this year and some in mid of this year. So mid of this year maybe that stands for the because of the workingdocuments is from, say, July this year. And the end of 2024, we have no, yeah, what then? Then we goto January here 2025. So I think it is important that what you can do, lift with, say, the amendments what we are now discussing for the maybe for the October session could be introduced by your timeplan. And otherwise we have to skip and do it in the next year or even one year later when we don't want to have too much amendments of the document every time. So I think once a year is already a tough. Sobut that is, I think, the maximum what we can do. Yeah. So thanks. Thanks for your willing to already give us an overview of what you are thinking in the future to make this kind of amendments. The flooris open if there are some questions. I see not a case. Okay. So then we take that into consideration.And then we have for informal document 11 from OICA proposing transitional provisions. I thinkthis is also the topic. It is informal 11. So OICA, the floor is yours. I think Fritz will ask for the floor. Yes, exactly. So thank you for giving me the time. The document that we have here, the informal11 is connected to the document we have seen beforehand regarding the carryover of amendments that were made for the 02 and 03 series and to include this kind of improvements also in the 00 and 01 series.However, yeah, exactly on that slide we can see it. There are some requirements, e.g. , in this case the measurement of the alternator current which you have to do during the type approval test, of course, if you didn't need that value or that measurement and you were not required to do so, youdon't have the data available as soon as you did the test and you didn't measure it. And what we saw is a potential issue with, e.g. , then carrying over this requirement from the 02 series to the 00 series would be that if you have a valid approval according to the 00 series and for whatever reasonyou have to do an extension of an approval, e.g. , because of change in part number or something like that but nothing with retesting, when doing that approval and extension, the new supplement version would be applied and, of course, then by having that new supplement version but having an older typeapproval test could be the interpretation that you have to do retesting because you don't have that alternator current measurement, e.g. . And that's why we as OICA proposed to include some kindof transitional provisions with the supplement that was proposed to clarify that the new requirements, e.g. , with regards to testing do not apply to already existing approvals which get an extensionto avoid unnecessary retesting from our point of view. We already got some comments on the wording from France and we are working to improve the wording. This, in fact, is the version 1 we see here. Therewas also a version 2 circulated to France, e.g. , and we will still improve that wordinghopefully until end of this week. And as said, as it's connected to the documents we have seen beforewhich might not be adopted in this session, I guess this document, of course, then would also not besubject to an adoption in this session. And, of course, this was it from my side. If there are anyquestions, I'm happy to answer them. Yes, thank you. So that is a good decision to see that there isno there is still some discussion on this document. I see from France there was some comments. So you have time to do that. But we can, of course, if you want to come back to the document in this week,this is also possible. But we can make at the end here now kind of a decision what we will do with this. And, of course, in the meantime, all kind of improvements in the end result of all the amendmentsfrom regulation 1.54 could be added. So then the document is then at this moment not yet completelyready. But we wait and see. I don't know if France will react now or in the next of the days on this document. Okay. Do it in the next of the day. So we keep the document. Otherwise you have to remind methat if you want to make your reaction and comments still this week. Then we have the last informationdocument is coming from Sweden on proposing a new supplement to the 02 and 03 series on regulation1.54 proposing to include the possibility of a driver robot during the pure electric vehicle range and electric energy consumption. So we give the floor to Per to introduce informal document 19.Thank you, Mr. Chair. And once again good morning to all. Yes, this proposal is to allow the possibility to use a driver robot as operator in the test procedure when we determine the pure electric range.The objective is that the robot will have to act as a human driver. And the request for acceleration and deceleration will have to come from an external source, an external device. This means that it should notbe allowed to use the vehicle, to drive the vehicle to the internal ECUs. The speed request should come from an external source outside of the vehicle. And the intention is to enable efficient and correcttests when determining the electric range. It should be possible to use both a mechanical robot and a virtual robot. However, the important thing is that this test should be performing, replicating a humandriver. The human driver is the golden driver, so to say. And we also think that it should be a correlation test between the human driver and the driver robot in question. And this should be demonstrated to theapproval authority. The justification for this is that the procedure to determine electric range for pure electric vehicles is very time consuming. It can take several hours. You can do it with the normal test procedurewith the consecutive type 1 cycles or the shortened test procedure, but still it's very time consuming. And with new technology we foresee that it will be even longer ranges and meaning even longer tests. And ifthe driver gets distracted and makes a mistake, the test will be invalid. Then you need to repeat the test and even the conditioning of the vehicle and the battery might be needed. This will take a lot ofresources from test facilities and they are already overloaded with a lot of work today. This will makethe we will believe that this will make the procedure more robust when we have this possibility. The proposal is also technology neutral. We are not proposing any special kind of driver robot technology orsomething. This should be presented by the manufacturer who developed these devices and the approval authorities will then decide depending on the documentation we have for this. As already said, the driver should be an externaldevice that replicates the human driver as far as possible. As also already said, it could be a mechanical robot and it could be virtual robots. Mechanical robot with a mechanical device activating the accelerator pedal andbrake pedal or you could have a virtual robot where you have an interface to these operators. I heard some saying that this is already possible in the regulation to use these kind of virtual drivers. However, we believethat it is not that clear. We propose this to make it more clear that it is a possibility to use this if accepted. I'm available for any questions now. Thank you very much for the possibility.Thank you, Per, to bring this topic to the GOP. The floor is open. Let's see the question from the UK 1st . Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Sweden, for the proposal. We are supportive of the concepts that was presented by Sweden but we think the proposal needs a little bit more refinement to bring further clarity and consistency about how authorities would appraise therobot drivers. This is something that our approval authorities have also been considering. We would be happy to exchange thoughts further on how we bring some more clarity in developing the document further. Thank you. Thank you, David, for the support. I give the floor to OICA. Bill. Yes, thanks again. Not really speaking for OICA but rather as a member of AVRS. I find it a very interesting concept and it obviously needs to be assessedthat it would be future compatible with automated and autonomous vehicles. It could perhaps introduce contradictions by not allowing the vehicle to be programmed to drive a cycle when it's an autonomous vehicle. It would have to be so. It's something that needs to be considered I believe. Yes, there's interlinked with this kind of task which we have taken on board on the automated vehicle and we have thethe vehicles as well so that it is not reflecting Germany. I will ask for Helga. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much, PAIR, for bringing up this subject. I'm not speakingfor Germany. It is more speaking for TÜV Nord since we are facing the situation, especially for long range battery electric vehicles, it is very hard to drive constant speed for human drivers and we think we should define a solution how to handle this. I think we alsohave to consider the conditions how to use such a robot. For example, we are really reluctant if we have a data connection between robot and vehicle. From my point of view, it might be helpfulto define that there should only be a mechanical connection between the robot and the vehicleand, yes, I agree we should look more into detail into this subject. Thank you, Helga. This is clearthat it is not that the vehicle is driving the cycle but it should be coming from an external source. It is also said by PAIR and how to arrange that, that is mechanical or electronic. Thatis a little bit the situation. I see the floor for Commission. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks a lot for the Swedish proposal. I can only echo what the previous speaker said that it is avery interesting concept and very interesting proposal that we are happy to assess further. If anybody has particular experience with these robots, whether they are physical or even virtual,we are happy to receive any kind of data or insight on their usage. Spain. Hello. Hello,everybody and happy new year to all of you. Thank you, Sweden, for the proposal. We also have sympathy for the proposal. We think it is a good idea but as the previous speakers has alreadysaid, we think that it should be fine-tuned when it comes to the demonstration of the equivalencybetween the human driver and the robot. Thank you very much. Yes. Specific when Sweden says it has the robot has to behave as a human being. It is an interesting question. I don't knowhow that will look like. How do we see that? Maybe France has an answer for this. Thank you,Chair. I can't answer that question unfortunately. But we would like to support Sweden's proposal in principle and also in what we can do to improve it and implement it. I do have a question thoughin a subsequent stage or phase could we potentially consider applying it to nonelectric vehicles on annex B6 of 1.54 is my question. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. That's a good one. I don't know ifthere is a reply. Thank you all for all the support. And to LOD, I think we are starting now with pure electric vehicles because there we have a very long test procedure. I'm fully open touse it for other categories of vehicles also. That's something that we could also talk about and discuss. Thank you. Yeah. It opens the door what we said. Yeah. Okay. See Japan askingfor the floor. Thank you, Chairman. I have two comments. One is as in Japan we are happy todiscuss this with other stakeholders to improve 1.54 in the short term. The 2nd comment isas the previous technical secretary of WTP, the problem comes from current short term testprocedure is not short. So we expect to shorten more short term test procedure and in nearfuture probably majority of the vehicle will be electric vehicle. And if it takes like five or 6 hfor every homologation test, it is going to be disaster. So I expect to work with more efficienttest procedure in long term, not long term, as the 2nd term. Yes. You are looking to thefuture, huh? Maybe then you are retired. I don't know. But you are still there. The vehicles are on the road.And maybe the electric vehicles and the autonomous vehicles will be you will show them and they are soyou will still be there. But indeed, after all, we have to have a holistic approach to that. So but we have to do step by step. But I'm happy with this proposal from Sweden to take this to discuss this item and the range driving is a challenge for drivers to do the WLTP.Tests and to drive this long distance. Okay. They have I think 10 min time to go to the toilet to drink something or to change drivers. I think the 10 min is still there. But still it is a used task. Matthias, you are driving this kind of vehicles yourself? Yes. But on road range test. Yes. Thejust to reflect on this, I think that's very interesting. Thanks for the proposal. It is on the 02 and 03 series. So as we are discussing today also working documents for 01 and 00 series, the question is if we should then also extend this to this. And as we also had a document on the 101 where we also have a range test, we should also think about that. So just a comment.And the 2nd point is to reflect on Nick's comments to work on a shortened test procedure. I think the shortened test procedure as we have in the WP at the moment is based on the MCT and from the SAE. Some kind of setup is similar or the same. And I think updated to SAE, there is already a shortened multiplied, which could be taken under consideration in the discussion that is ongoing on the SAE and afterdiscussion. But I think that's a discussion which is something which should be done. And yeah, so that's all from my side. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for this comments. Of coursewhen we do the kind of a range test we have to maybe we have to have a long test otherwise we don't know what the range is. But I don't know if there are possibilities to do it anotherway than the physical test. But okay. That's for maybe for others to reflect how that could be possible. Maybe for where we have a kind of not exceed limits for emissions you can doit. But if you do the range I don't know. But okay. I'm not maybe I go about my expertise and I don't want to do that. And now I think it is almost time for lunch. But maybe to wrapup also for the Secretariat for what we have adopted, what not, what we are going to do with the documents. Maybe it is clear should make it clear for everyone what we now have to do. We can also do it in the afternoon. But I think maybe a little bit to wrap up. Yeah. Is thatpossible? Yeah. It is in the afternoon? Yeah. Yeah. Now for the wrap up only for the documentsregulation 154, what we have set on this document and what we are going to do. That was my idea.Regulation 83. So we have the 1st was the working documents 2 and 3 from OICA. I thinkwe embraced the document and we will wait and maybe take that on board in October. But infact, that was positive. So that is fine. We have the proposal from Japan, informal documentof working document 10 and 11 with the amendments for the 02 and 03 series. Also that is in principleokay. And we can discuss that later. But that is also taking on board the informal document09 from OICA. And we have the presentation informal 10 with the list of new issues of all the issuesand this will then be C as well. But yeah, OICA say we don't adopt the document but we takeon board this with the new proposal which will come then for the October session. So we canembrace this as well. The future issues from Japan is also for information. So this is wedon't have to adopt this. The proposal 11 with some amendments which will come later. So wewill discuss that this week. So on the content and the robot discussion from Sweden, yeah,that takes more time I think. But we will see how that will go further now until say the Octobersession. So I will not take that now directly as on board. So this takes some more time. Sothis is I think the wrap-up. Do you know enough? No adoption. No. Okay. So if that is the situationthat's my wrap-up for the regulation 154. Everything is okay with that? I see no comments. Okay.Yeah, you are correct. This is in between. This is the regulation 83, the 09 series, the informal 09. Yeah. Okay. Make a mistake there. Sorry. But okay. If that is the case, then we don'thave any decision yet on the regulation 154. That's as clear. And 09, that's related then to regulation 83. And that we can or we do it in the afternoon because we have to wrap upas well. Yeah. Okay. Everyone then on the same page. Yeah. No. Only the point from France whichis the document 11 we will discuss in the other documents. We don't discuss in the GPE in todayof this week. Yeah. Japan. Not clear, I think. For me, you make I make a mistake. Maybe youunderstand what you I'm not going to drive anyone crazy. I just want to confirm regarding the workingdocument from Japan, 10 and 11 with amended informal document blah, blah, blah. It is no adoption.Adoption means it will not go to WP29. But it is approved in this GRP session. I'm sorry, I havedifficulty for terminology of wording. We, Japan, want approval during this GRP. This is yes. It will not goto WP29 in June session. It means no adoption. Yeah, we can take over lunch. My idea is that we adoptthe document in content. But the document itself will be redrafted in a consolidated document which we willsee before the 22nd of July for the adoption in October. So the documents that was my idea, that we have the that we don't have different documents, that we have one consolidated document with all the amendments from Japan and from OICA and they are included in a working document for October. And the content as it isis adopted. But we will work on one document. Otherwise we have different documents again in more different documents in October. But if that is complicated, we will keep the document as it is. We don't touch it. And we take the document directly again in October. That is also a possibility. And you have to guide me to say no, we don't want to touch the document like from Japan anymore. So it is thatdocument and we will transfer it to the document which we will then take in October as it is and don't change it anymore. So then we have more documents. Then we have the document from Japan and the document from other documents. So we have then not one consolidated document. It is for me also possible. I said that is too complicated to make it I thought that the OICA was asked or gave the idea to make one consolidated documentfor all the amendments, for all the series, that is also fine for me. But if they say no, we don't do that, then we keep the document as it is. Yeah? So think over and come to me with what you want to do for to have the possibility to have an adoption of the document in October and with the deadline of the working document on the 22nd of July. Okay? Give me advice.Give me advice to this. Okay. So then now lunch. See you back again on 2:30. Thanks."}
{"title": "", "text": "I hope you have, even that we have not, the canteen was open, but I hope you have a good lunch anyhow. So we continue with our running order for the agenda. So we are going furtherwith agenda point 7, afterwards 14 on the LCA and we come back on agenda point 3 onthe regulations 154 after that. So 1st agenda point 7 where we have the new global technicalregulation 24 on the light duty braking emissions and we have a lot of documents. We have the document, the working document 2024/4, what was the discussion, what we had last GOP whichnow the working document in the clean version and we have a couple of working documents dealing with amendments, check changes and final status report and some explanation documents in the2006 and the 26 informal documents. But everything is mentioned in the status report. So I will give the floor to the Chair of the informal working group PMP to guide us through all the amendmentsand the status and the report. So I think informal document 28 is I think the good to start with. So I give the floor to Makis and Theo, I don't know who is starting with this presentation, but youboth having the floor. Good afternoon, also from my side. So yes, with this presentation, I will startwith the general overview of the PMP activities in this period and then Theo will give all the detailsand the work behind the GTR 24. So the meetings that took place were 7/8 last year, most of them in Webex onlineformat. We had one hybrid and one actually yesterday where we started also having general presentations about the tires and brakes and the overview of ongoing projects. A reminder of the terms of referencethat were updated last year, they are renewed until 2025 and the main topic, of course, is non-exhaust emissionswhere, as you can see, we have monitoring mainly of tires, projects and activities, but we will also do the same for brakes as well. Regarding brakes, the main topics was the development of vehicle specificfriction brake efficiency, amendments of the GTR, small corrections if necessary and a round robin based on laboratorieswith the new GTR procedures. Regarding heavy duty, the main topics will be evaluation of test cycles that haveto be run, of course, the setup itself if it needs modifications and non-friction braking which is quite significantfor the heavy duty vehicles. Regarding exhaust emissions, we have just monitoring of the applied procedures, thedeveloped procedures and more specifically the ten nanometer for both laboratory and on road instrumentation. In the meantime, we are alsothinking to check also the brake equipment which is quite similar to the one used for exhaust emissions if we need to add or modify anything. Regardingthe exhaust topics, the main issue we still have is the calibration material since many years now, so we decided to do again a 2nd round robin with CPCs and as you can see at the table, we have two 23 nanometer CPCs and one 10 nanometer CPC that cannot change the cutoff size also to 23 nanometer andthey will be tested with at least three generators, which is diffusion flame combustion aerosol and silver particles and, of course, other generators like the spark discharge generator. We had some delays with the equipment but we started at the end of 2000 of this previous year in December. This laboratory will continue alsoin January and the next laboratories around ten laboratories are expected to finish around summer 2024. And, of course, aim will be to define material for either for exhaust or also for brake CPCs that also have the same specifications. Regarding the GTR on brakes,these are just links but the summary, as you know, the GTR, you can the existing GTR, you can find on the 1st link, which is the current text. In October we submitted the working document, which is the 2024 GRP document and the links here show the clean and the version with the track changes.And what you see at the informal documents of this GRP is the informal document amending this working document and they will go through all of these details. There are some accompanying documents, there are some tables with the main changes where you can see what has been modified and the last link is the technical report or theaccompanying final report where it justifies the decisions on the amendments and changes. So I think we will go in to more details now. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Yes, as Baruch said we have submitted in October a working documentto amend the GTR No. 24 and we submitted this week an informal document amending this working document which we hope that will be adopted today to become the amended GTR 24. This slidesummarizes here the most important changes that we have introduced in this amendment and most of them stem from the 87th GRPE session last year where it was clear that the GTR 24was well received but we were also asked to introduce some changes particularly regarding the development of a procedure for the determination of the vehicle specific friction braking coefficient.This is the 3rd point you can see in this slide. This is exactly what we did over the last year. Apart from this annex C we have defined the original and the replacement parts and we have also definedthe brake families for nonoriginal replacement parts. So practically now the GTR 24 provides specifications on how the aftermarket parts may be tested for their emissions. We have adjustedthe values of the fixed friction braking coefficient which represent the worst case scenario in each vehicle category. So the famous values of the X, table 5.1, the current table 5.3 you will see that they have been slightly amended. We have defined different temperature specificationsfor the cooling air adjustment of lighter than carbon ceramic lighter than cast iron discs, so-called carbon ceramic discs. And we have for the 1st time in this amendment definedactive and passive filtration systems. We have introduced a requirement for testing active filters. And I will explain later in the slide that we have agreed on the need to work on furtherspecifications for the next amendment of the GTR for the active filtration systems. Just to give some more details on these different five different important topics that we changedin the GTR. So the 1st of all was that we defined in the amendment all the original and replacement parts. So different definitions have been given for pads, discs, drum liningsand drums. And then in paragraph 5.2.1 we have grouped there the families for the original brake systems and parts and for the original replacement brake system and parts. Whereaswe introduced we developed a completely new paragraph, paragraph 5.2.2, to specify how nonoriginalreplacement brake parts and identical brake system and parts shall be tested in the regulation. These definitions as well as the text can be found, of course, in the documents and there is also the accompanying document with the tables explaining the rationale behind the selection and the categorizationof the different parts into these two paragraphs. Then there was a need for refining or better adjusting the fixed friction coefficient representing the worst case scenario in each vehicle category.As you remember last year we decided to tackle the regenerative braking by using some friction braking for the different vehicle categories. For this reason we have categorized mild hybridsinto two categories, category 1 and category 2. We had some discussions over the year and we realized that there are some mild hybrids in the market with battery capacities between 12 and 20 volts which were not covered in the 1st part of the regulation and this is thereason why we introduced a 3rd category in this category. So this is category 0 and this is now on the right-hand side of the table being introduced as a new vehicle category. At thesame time we had to recalculate the worst case scenario values to take into account the fact that the initial calculations were done whereas we did not take into account that during thedyno test we had removed the parasitic losses. So there is practically this correction of 13% to these values in order to reflect the correct calculations. Now the table looks as it is onthe right-hand side and it is the new table 5.3. I repeat, this is only for those testing facilities who select not to apply the newly introduced Annex C but who would like to justgo with the coefficient that comes with the worst case scenario in its vehicle category. The 3rd and maybe the most important addition to this GTR was the addition of Annex C whichdescribes the procedure for the determination of the vehicle specific friction braking coefficient. This is a test that is being done on the chassis dynamometer over the WLTP brake cycle or theWLTP brake cycle. We have submitted the initial proposal with the method in the PMP at the PMP level in April. There was some initial feedback. A 2nd version was submitted inthe June session. This document stayed online for consultation and feedback until September. Then some changes were applied and the Annex C was introduced in the working document in October.However, there were some changes until the last minute. For those who really paid attention during the course of the time, you will notice, for instance, that we don't have specifications for electromechanical brakes in Annex C as it is right now. The group considered that wedo not have enough maturity to introduce the method for these brakes but these topics will be covered in the next amendment of the regulation. However, if I stick only to what has been introduced and not what we missed to introduce in Annex C, you will see that we have an Annex wherewe describe the purpose, the scope and the application which is a paragraph providing details about the scope and how this shall be applied in the context of the GTR 24. We have a paragraph describing the reference method and how the calculations are done based on the referencemethod. So this gives the details and also describes the alternative methods. Then we have a paragraph with the testing setup and specifications where we provide details about the vehicle selection,the test preparation, data recording, the settings of the chassis dynamometer and the test sequence. Then we have a paragraph on the equivalency of methods. So there we prescribe the specificationswhen and how can an alternative method be considered equivalent to the reference method. Then we discuss about the cycles. As I mentioned before, we have two options introduced in Annex C forthis amendment. And then, of course, it is the test output. So discusses what provisions shall be followed when declaring the final test results of this method. So overall, we have repliedto the request of the GRP and we have introduced this method enabling the testing facilities to apply vehicle specific friction coefficients. Then we had another finding during the courseof the 1st test that some discs that are already available in the market could not follow the specifications that we had originally prescribed for the cooling adjustment and the reason wasthat the material that they were made from was entirely different from what we used for making the specifications in the 1st place. And I'm mainly referring to the carbon ceramic discs.So we had to figure out a solution for this type of disc. First of all, we defined for the 1st time in the amendment the carbon ceramic discs and then we tried to figure out a solutionin this case what we did is that we decided to relax the temperature provisions for the initial break temperature and the final break temperature in order to accommodate light workdiscs like the carbon ceramic discs. If in the future we see we have the chance to build a similar table like the one that has been made for grey cast iron discs, this would be the preferablesolution but at this point there was no enough data to have such a table constructed and introduced in the GTR for the carbon ceramic discs. Of course, this applies to possible future materialsthat may come in the market. So if in the future we see that there are other types of discs that cannot be covered by the existing values, then we will figure out how much relaxed conditionswould need to be introduced also to cover other solutions. But at this point, what really wasimportant was to cover market available solutions which in this case was carbon ceramic discs. Last but not least, we had the request to take into account filtration systems. By default, the filtrationsystems could be tested in the GTR 24 under the 1st under the 1st version of the GTR 24 as longas the technical specifications defined in the GTR are met. However, we had some discussion mostly about active filtration systems and there was an understanding at the PMP level that we needed specificrequirements to take into account active filtration systems. So for the time being, as I said, these systems are allowed to be tested according to the GTR for their emissions. Of course, as long asall specifications defined in the GTR are met and we are talking about cooling temperatures, the dimensions of the fitting in the enclosure, cooling airflow and all other parameters that stem out of theGTR 24, following the PMP discussions, the proposal for the 1st amendment has been to define the activation of the filtering devices through dedicated dino signals. In other words, when the dinogives a signal that we have a break event, then the active filtration system should be activated and then allow for some time for the pump to run after the end of the break event in order to take intoaccount possible particles that are emitted off breaking and these devices would have captured them in real life. This time in this version of the GTR has been set to 5 s . However, we have commonlyagreed at the PMP that we will need a more elaborated analysis on the technical specifications of the active filters and this is what we plan to do for the next year and have them introduced in a next amendment ofthe GTR. For the time being, we have a common agreement that this specification would be enough for taking into account the active filtration systems. With that, I think I have summarized the main changesthat have been introduced in the GTR. There are some other minor changes. I think that it does not make any sense to go to smaller details regarding the calibration or changing of wording and so on and so forth. I think that these are very well summarized in the all accompanying documents that we have submitted both inOctober and also in this January session. There is one more slide, I think, regarding the task force 3 and task force 5. I will say a couple of words of task force 3 because maybe it is relevant to the next amendmentwhenever this comes. As explained before, the PMP terms of reference require the execution of roundRobin, what we call it interlaboratory studies with GTR compliant labs and what is the status right now? Taskforce 3 that is currently managing the ILS has resumed meetings in December to support this task and the purpose is, of course, to organize the upcoming interlaboratory study. Big weekly meetings will follow. Wewill have a face-to-face workshop in February 2024 in Munich to fine-tune the exercise and in a nutshell I wouldsay that we would like to have two phases exercise, one pretest and one the main exercise. The pretest should be finished any time by June, by the 2nd quarter of this year with the aim of having the main exercise in the3rd quarter and get the results and make the analysis in the 4th quarter in order to be ready to have our conclusions submitted as a possible amendment for the January session of the GRP next year. So this is roughlythe plan for task force 3 and the upcoming interlaboratory study. Finally, I don't know if you would like toclose with the Tier 5, a couple of words. Yes, task force will also, task force 5 will also begin this from this Januarythis year. This group will deal with a heavy duty topic, so with a possible new GTR on heavy duty. So this, the topics we mentioned previously, but they will be dealt in more detail in this task force group. It will be sharedby OICA and JRC, like the task force 4, which deal with the light duty vehicles and brake coefficients. And they will alsovery often meetings, probably also every two weeks because there are many topics to be covered. So withthis, yes, hopefully there will be a draft in one year time, but because the plan was to have something in 2025 as a draft document. And Ithink with this, we can close the update on the PMP status. Yeah, thank you Marquis and Theo with this comprehensive presentation,all the work which you have done. And the floor is open for any questions or clarifications. I see Elodie from France, you have the floor.Thank you, Chair. Channel 2. Thank you, sir, for the very detailed presentation and for the work carried out by the informal PMP group. Myquestion is about particle emissions. Perhaps this is a question for you or for the EC directly, bearing in mind the progress in current discussions includingthe changes in particles of 10 nanometers. Will PMP open up the work again on RDE and PEMS or will this work be carried out directly under reg14/9 or others for light duty? Thank you. Thank you, Elodie. Yeah, interesting questions.Maybe I can start saying that the technical work has been finalized in the previous years and there are three main areas. One is the light duty, where we have theprocedure of 10 nanometer at the GTR 15. Then we have heavy duties where we have a technical resolution where we describe the changes, the text for 10 nanometer procedures.And regarding RDE, we had submitted to the RDE group at that time also the changes needed for the 23 nanometers. So for the PMP group, it would be moredigging these documents and implementing them in the appropriate one. So one would assume UNR 154, R49 or 168. But I think this has to be discussed with the contracting parties and if we are asked to, we can propose something if it has to come from us, from PMP. Thank you.Yes, thank you. CUP Commission. Yes, thank you, Chair, for the floor and good afternoon, colleagues. Just to compliment Marcus's reply to the question from France and thank you, France, for the question. As you know, back in December we hit an important milestone in Euro 7 where we reached a political agreement between the co-legislators. TheEuro 7 standard includes several novel elements. Perhaps the more important ones are in the non-exhaust part and they require they will require work in this forum and I'm sure we will have time to discuss those. But if we look at the exhaust part, one of the biggest developments is that indeed we propose to move from a PN23 to a PN10 measurement. And there isone recital in the text which I can if you send me an email, I can help you find it and navigate the URL site so you can all access it. And it says and I'm slightly paraphrasing that by setting limits for PN10 we will contribute to a dynamic towards global harmonization. So there is a strong hint to Geneva work. And it says also that the European Union should encourage the UN, WorldForum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations to align the relevant UNESCO vehicle regulations accordingly. So yeah, and again to emphasize what Maggie said, the technical work has been done to a very large extent. So we would like we will work towards this harmonization and we hope to do that in a timely manner so that everything is ready and according to the schedule ofEuro 7. Thank you. That's I think more an answer than expected, Elodie. But indeed, yes, because we have a lot of documents already on the table for light duty and heavy duty will come. So we will see when you are ready to come up with that kind of proposals for including this in the UNRs like 154. Okay. Having said that, we have now if there is no other point for the floor, questions, of course, open because we have to be ready for adoption of the Working Document 2024/4 which is amended by the GPE document that was said by Markisin formal document 90/25 which is the track changes which gives the track changes from the what's already in the document, the amendment for GTR 24 on the amendment in the Working Document 4 as well as the new added amendments which is colorized inspecific colors in that document, informal document 25. So it is the adoption of Working Document 4 amended by the informal document 25. I see a question from the Netherlands. Can you hear me? Yes. Good afternoon to everyone and also the best wishes for the new year. We would like tothank the P and P group for their work and effort to make those changes which are welcomed, especially the vehicle specific break share coefficient. Just one question just popped up with our colleague. So maybe you could answer the question to you in detail if allowed. It would be appreciated. Thank you. Yes, of course. I think Rob. Yes. Thankyou for giving me the opportunity and giving me the floor. It is a remark and a question triggered by the status report of the P and P group especially on it is on slide 11, a change to the temperatures and the temperature tolerances for the carbon ceramic disc breaks. It says that the initial or the start temperature will be lowered by 15 degreesCelsius and that the temperature regime of IBT and FPT will be further relaxed by 15 degrees Celsius and it was in the Delegation we had a discussion on how to what is the interpretation of further relaxed. Our request actually is to give slightly more guidance on what is meantby that. We have the impression that it is simply a lowering of the main temperature in the columns IBT and FPT by 15 degrees but as I said we are still puzzling what the precise intention is of this formulation. So thank you. Thank you very much for this question. You are absolutely right. My English was notaccurate in this case. Yes, we are not relaxing. Actually these breaks operate in lower temperatures so in reality it is kind of shifting the average temperatures lower by 15 degrees. However, we prefer not to do that. We just allowed for these discs to go lower by 15 degrees to the lower end only. So we do not relax by 15 degreesboth sides. We know that they operate at lower conditions so we allow them to go simply 15 degrees lower. So yes, you are absolutely right that this is the case here. Okay. Thank you. Yes, Rob? Yes, thank you, Chair. Thank you, Theo, for the explanation and clarification. But then again maybe we can take another coffee break orsome time after the meeting to look at the drafting of the texts to make it even more clearer what is meant here. Okay. So you have an idea of some clarified text otherwise it is difficult to discuss in the open if you have some need some clarification in the text. Yes.Mr. Chairman, I have put the text now on the slide. So the text it is in red how it is now written exactly in the amendment. And you will see that for carbon ceramic disc brakes the default temperature metrics apply. However, the ABT temperature metrics are lowered by 15 degrees and the tolerance to the low end of the temperature regimes for the IBT and FBT are further relaxed by 15 degrees.So practically the same table applies, however, these discs are allowed to go by 15 degrees lower for the IBT and the FBT as it is mentioned in the text. So I would like to understand if this is not okay for you. And, yes, if this is the case, then we can discuss it in the coffee break. Okay. So I wait after the coffee break for putting it in to action to see if it is necessary to put it in to action. And we can make sure that they are put in to action if they are not in the discussion process. So we can make sure the topic has been quite clear. We will make sure they are not in the discussion process. And if they are not in the discussion process then we can put the topic in the tomorrow's discussion. So I would like to address the examiners to discuss the framework. The framework if they arethis on the adoption, that's, I think, possible. If there is some clarification that does not understand why it is put there. I think Theo gives the clarification. Okay. The Netherlands.To make it clear that we have no objections against the intention of this wording and the clarification given by Theo, but we would prefer to have slightly more clear text in here. Okay. So in the merit it is okay but maybe you have found maybe some words which better reflect the intention of this additional widen or lower the temporary wording.Of widen or lower the temperature of 15 degrees. Okay. If you have some improvement of the text idea, we could see it in the coffee break and put it on the screen. Otherwise I think in the merit it is okay with the clarification from GRC but given the chance to find maybe better words for it. It is always therefore we have the discussion here. The floor is open for any other reflections.We are open for any other reflections on the proposal and amendments to GGR 24 which indeed the biggest purpose is, of course, the type specific regenerative breaking in what is it C? But also these kinds of improvements. Okay. So then we froze it a little bit after the coffee break, but I think it is quite logical to have the coffee break a little bit later in the coffee break. So then we have the floor open for any comments or suggestions.break for the adoption not only for the document itself but also for the report, so the final status report which is informal 27. Don't we have to go through that but also explainingthe reasoning for this amendment for the GTR which is a necessity to bring in if we aregoing to adopt in 29 in AC3. Yes, everything is set and so still thanks for your presentationon this huge work which I think is done in short notice again. So we are very pleased with your hard work which you have mostly every month or every week we have meetings. So it is reallyvery stressful to see how you do your work and good work. So thanks again. Then we go onthe same topic. We have a proposal from the experts from the Netherlands on the health effects on break where particulates and we have an informal 30. So I give the floor to the Netherlands.I think Niels, you have the floor. Thank you, Chair. Just give a small introduction. So my colleague will give the presentation regarding the topic which was also already presented in a longer version in the PMP group yesterday. And as you might remember in the June session of the GRPE, well, we asked for a change in theterms of reference if there was a possibility for the PMP group to also address the environmental and health effects of break particle emissions. During that time, well, after discussions, it didn't seem possible for the moment, for that moment, and we promised to do a presentation in this January session. So that's what we will do and Tomas will take it through the well, a short presentationon health effects of the break particle emissions. Yes, thank you, Chair, and thank you, Niels, for the kind introduction. If we could have the slides on screen maybe. Should I come there? Okay. Yes, sorry for the delay. Apparently this was easier. So good afternoon, everyone. I hope you had a nice lunch break. My name is Tomas fromTNO. And as already introduced by Niels, I will guide you through a shortened version of the presentation you got in the PMP group already from my colleague Quinn about the health effects of break particle emissions. So if we look at historical data of particle emissions in last years, we see a steady decline in the particle emissions of theor more conventional or exhaust gas emissions, which is, of course, good news, but this also means that the particle emissions from break and tire wear, so the nontailpipe emissions became more important over the years. And I would like to stress here that we are very happy about the progress which has been made up until now, especially with the GTR, and we do appreciate theeffort which is put in and the importance of this GTR also for things as Euro 7. But we would already like to look to future steps which could improve on this regulation to even have a better impact on environments and health aspects of the particle emissions. So there are a few things we observe from particle emissions which are calls for further study.And a few of these things are listed on the slide here. So 1st of all, we do find in literature that break temperature has a very high effect on the actual particle sizes which are being emitted from break emissions. And in literature we clearly see a critical temperature which is defined anywhere between 165 and 190 degrees Celsius, which calls ultra-fine particlesemissions, which means particles are emitted below a size of 100 nanometers. We also find that those higher temperature are not really found in the WLTP break cycle, which is there because it's better to enable reproducibility of this cycle. But we do find those higher break temperatures in real world testing. And this means that these real world conditions leading to higher ultra-fine particle emissions arenot or are actually overlooked in the current legislation. And as a final remark, we find that the legislation on the actual materials which can be used in breaks is not complete or not extensive. And this means that also the particles which are being generated are not legislated on what type of material can be in them. So why is this important? Both the particle matter size and theparticle matter material has an effect on the human health. And 1st of all, in literature we find that the ultra-fine particles cause greater inflammatory response than fine particles because they can penetrate the body deeper and therefore cause more damage. And we also find in literature that those ultra-fines impact the cardiovascular and the respiratory system much more. So to say that theparticle size is an important metric in health effects. But also we find that the actual material being emitted has a large influence on health. And one of the indicators which is found relevant to look at this aspect is the oxidative potential. And oxidative potential is a metric which shows the oxidative stress which can be caused by particles and oxidative stress is somethingyou apparently don't want in your body. And so based on the study we performed at TNO, we found that the oxidative potential of breakware particles is much higher than the oxidative potential of conventional sources. So diesel and petrol exhaust fumes. This is shown in the graph on the screen where you see that we tested on both essays. Did your titleand ascorbic acid if I don't butcher the names. And this is performed on a limited set of particle filters. So on a set of in total seven. So this is not extensive but it gives the 1st indication that those breakware particles are harmful for human health. So what we conclude from these findings is that in future steps it would be nice to look more into the actual health effects of particle emissions from breakware butalso tire wear in general from particle emissions. And we find the following topics could maybe be considered in those next steps. So 1st of all, it would be useful to include real world testing also in particle emission testing similar to RDE for the conventional exhaust gas emissions where we take conditions into consideration which are outside of the WLTP boundaries.We also would like to look into the broadening of PM and expected PM emission limits with size distribution criteria which would cover a wider range of indicators for health effects. For example, the ultra fine particles I talked about just a few minutes ago or seconds. And we would also like to look more into the actual material selection for brake lining by regulating the materials in the brakepads. We could also regulate the material which is entering our bodies through these ultra fine particles. And ideally we would like to classify breakware emissions and tire wear emissions in general particle emissions based on their total impact on human health and the environment. And this would mean we should look at the PM, the PN including a size distribution but also at the material orother health relevant indicators and we try to capture this last sentence also in a picture which shows that the polluting impact of particle emissions is a combination of all those aspects, not a single one of those aspects. So for the final slide I would like to hand back the word over to Nils from the Netherlands and he will tell you more about how we would like to implement this or what we would like to see in GRPE.Yes, thank you, Thomas, for the presentation. Just the last sheet, so of course we already had some discussion regarding this topic and in the past we asked for a mandate within the PMP group. Just to, well, stress that we are not, we are open for, well, a platform or requesting a platform to share this information with GRPE andwithin, with GRPE experts. So it doesn't have to be within the PMP group. If there is another platform where we can share this information and discuss on this topic, then that would be helpful. But the most important part is that we have the place to discuss it and that it will not be part of any other business within GRPE because we think it's an important aspect which need to be discussed also for longer term and in the future. And weunderstand that also other, yeah, participants can share their information on the topic and that we can start discussions. And maybe in the end it will move to PMP or not or any other place but that we have a platform to discuss the topic. Thank you. Thank you, Niels and thank you to Netherlands for bringing this information here to the GRPE. You already mentioned thatthat in June session last year you already indicated that you would come up with a presentation on this issue. So happy that you present this here. So it's good to be aware and to have knowledge on this topic. That's all what we are doing things about. You can do reducing emission but you do it for something. It's for our planet and for human health improvementsor not to have the negative effects, you can also say it that way, of transport. The floor is open for any reflections. I see you have been commissioned. GLC?I will speak with the PMP hat, the PMP Chair hat on this one. I would like to remind the group that the PMP group doesn't have health effect experts. So when we started even before 2003, there were already discussions about which metric is more important, PMPN, surface, black carbon or volatiles, and so on. AndAnd even today most studies at least show that PM is one very important metric for health effects as most studies show. Ultra fine, yes, indeed, there are many indications and so on, but still it is difficult to prove that the specific metal or component and soon has to be regulated at this level. Other, of course, as you mentioned, that raw materials, is included which sometimes there are some rules in such directives or regulations. Havingsaid that, I would like to add that it is difficult for us to have the mandate without invitingthe appropriate experts in discussing these topics from the right point of view. What we did so far and we can continue doing is invite experts and discuss topics like this as youpresented last time and follow such discussions and be informed in general. However, going intothe details it is a little bit difficult at least for now. I understand that it is something we could see for the future, but this would need some time and the appropriate experts definitelywhich would be more from the medical community and so on. And just a final note on the slides that you showed, so far exhaust emissions had the PM, they added PN which includes numbersor indirectly also surface and the importance of ultra fine particles. The brake GTR has also total PN, so it is even a step ahead that includes also volatile compounds that couldbe harmful and so on. So it even covers more. It doesn't have the chemical specification which is a little bit difficult, of course, but there could be ways through other regulations to beincluded maybe. And total where. So we have also total where, PM, PN and total PN. Thank you. Thank you, Marquis, for this answer. I see also yeah, you want to add something. Okay.European Commission 1st and then UK. Thank you, Chair. Just a very brief Euro 7 point to compliment the points raised by Marquis. In the Euro 7 compromised text we do have a placeholdertable for a PN limit for brake emissions for both heavy duty and light duty vehicles thatwould apply as of 2030. And this is following a review for which a report would be due from the Commission to the co-legislators by the end of 2027. So not in the 1st set of limits.PN would not be covered, but by 2030 we do have a placeholder table. Thank you. Thank you. This is important additional information. Thank you that you shared this already, Vicente, of theUnited Kingdom. Thank you. And thank you to the Netherlands for a really interesting presentation. So we agree that it's important to have a platform to be able to discuss the latest evidence on this and the research so that we don't lose sight of ultimately what we are trying to dois improve health outcomes through the standards that we do. I think it's probably too early to set out any sort of mandate on developing an assessment of health outcome. Certainly withinthe UK and the advice that we have from our medical effects board is that there is mixed evidence at the moment. There is likely to be some differences in the health impacts of different sources of particular matter, but at the moment the recommendation is not to attribute differenthealth impacts from different sources of PM 2.5. Nevertheless, I support the suggestion for having a platform somewhere underneath GRP where we can continue to receive the latest evidence on that so we can consider whether at what stage it is appropriate for us to look at regulationor standards. Thank you. Thank you, UK, for this support. Sorry about that. I think thatthere is well received that the topic on health effects and the relation with it is important also to bring it to the GOP, even though that we not all have all the expertise on this topic.Maybe we can continue with doing it the way as we do it now. So if there is some informationfrom contracting parties here that we share this not only in the PMP group but also here in the GOP so that we have both a view and as this is more specific on PN, then, of course, it may be morededicated to give some information and discuss it with the experts in the PMP group. But indeed,we have to elaborate a little bit what kind of platform or where we could lend this kind ofissues. And I have not at the moment not a few what and where to do this. But the signal is there andat this moment before we have anything more clear in our mind from where we can discuss this topics,we can table it here at the GOP. And we will also brief this in the W29 guide us about maybe goals also outside with the WHO or whatever. You see that we have a lot of contacts already with otherbodies within the UN. So we have to think about that. So at the moment, I cannot say anythingthen only that we take this notice and that information on health effects, yeah, please,please, not too in detail, but to have some information on this is very welcome. Vicente,you want to add something? Okay. No, no, your sign was up. So I thought maybe you still want to addsomething there. Yeah. Is that okay also? Yeah. Thank you, Thomas, for your very clear presentation andupdate us about your activities and maybe you continue with your activities on this issue. So if you have new information, please share it with us and in the PMP group. Thank you again. Then we go toif there are no other yeah, the Netherlands. Yes, thank you, Chair. I just want to thank the European Commission and UK for their comments and it is clear that it needs some further discussion. It is justthat we would like to see to have a platform where we can discuss the topic. So it is clear that further discussion is needed, but it is good to hear that there is at least interest and we can see in thefuture how we can deal with this and how we can bring this to PMP or GOP. Thank you. Yeah, what I said, without any platform presented here in the GOP, this is then I think the 1st to do it and if you wantto do it in the informal Working Group as well and more in detail with the experts, you have the possibility to do so. So that I think now already the opening to bring it there. Francois.Maybe remind everyone, good afternoon, everyone, maybe remind everyone that we have this GRPE emissions topic list, that we have our long list of things we might be interested to work on at some stage in the future. So this might be appropriate to include this topic there as well if GRP thinks it is a good idea.Indeed, it is a living document and some new topics or ideas, new ideas could be added to that list,even not to the priority but could be the list that we take on board in the future. Good to remind us on that. But we come back on the priority and then the activities of the GRP on the agenda point, what isit? 15. Okay. Then we have the activities of the task force for tire abrasion and I see Elodie alreadyshifting on the chairs. She is ready to present us and give us an update of all the activities of the task force where you see a lot of people are very interested in what you are doing in the task forceand also the GRP, of course, is very interested in what you are doing, not only the GRP but I think youcan come here and sit on the podium. So the floor is yours. Thank you very much, Chair, but I will switchto English. This is the official language of the task force. So this is the status report of the task force on tire abrasion. So some reminder of the aim of the task force. So it's a joint task force between GRBP,so noise and tire and GRPE group of reporters and the purpose is to work on the abrasion of the tire.It's co-chaired with the European Commission and France. Just as a reminder as well, even if it's a joint task force, the adoption scheme is held by the GRBP, but the purpose is also to have all theGRPE experts here and also the PMP, informal working group experts, that could contribute to this task force. So this is why we are doing the presentation also here and the working document that we aresubmitting is under the GRBP. So okay, we had lots of participants, lots of meetings as every task force informal working group. Just a reminder, so we are assessing now two methods. The 1st one is alaboratory method. So it's indoor drum method. I'm sorry, but the picture is not exactly the one that is used for abrasion. As you may see, the drum is completely not abrasive at all. So this is not agood picture, but at least it's open for right as requested by the UNECE. And the 2nd one, the 2nd method we are assessing is the convoy method. So it's on road and with several vehicles followingeach other. So where we are today, what we have done in 2023, so we have work on C1 tire. C1 tire are more or less, it's not exactly the case, but are more or less small tires, so the one that are fittedto light duty vehicles. So the purpose was to validate those two methods to also start to correlate it. So far, the campaign, the test campaign is finished. We are still some additional test campaign or additionaldata that we are still gathering. And the post processing is done now. So as I said, based on that, we submitted a working document at the GRBP. So the GRBP will be held beginning of February from the 6thto the 9th. And so we will introduce the two methods in the UN regulation 117, which is the regulationdedicated to the tire performances. And it will be amended by an informal document. The informal documentis still under preparation, because the task force will have at least two sessions before next GRBP.So I will present here, hereafter, the contents of the working document, plus some updates that will be included in the informal document. But as I said, the informal document is still under drafting and soon. So this is where we are today. The purpose is really to implement the two methods without any limits, just saying, okay, if we want to do some abrasion of tire, this is how we can do. So otherdrum methods, indoor or outdoor, so convoy method on road, only for C1 for the time being, but you will see we will work on other tires as well. And based on that, we will do a market assessment for C1. Andbased on the result of the market assessment, we will hopefully manage to finalize the correlation, fine tune the methods if needed, and to set the limits. So looking at the timeline, the next steps is, sotoday, so expected feedback from the GRPE expert after this presentation, your feedback would be welcome by the end of this month, because as I said, we are drafting an informal document for GRBP in the beginning ofFebruary. Then we expect to have an adoption of the new supplemental 117, UNR117 in February, GRBP. So asI say, in C1 tire market assessment, defining the limits, we also have in parallel work that has to be done in collaboration with ASTM standards, especially because we have reference tire to be referred in someASTM standards. And we will work on the other categories or classes of tires, so C2 tires. So it's TBC, because theterms of reference and the date are still under discussion, and as I said, we will have some sessions at the end of the month for the task force. We would normally have finalized terms of reference, so it should be a square bracket ratherthan brackets, but we will do the same approach for C2 tires, so having method or methods, probably also indoorconvoy on road, potentially in 2026 for the methods and 2027 for the limits, same approach, market review and so on. Wethink that some potentially some C2 tires could have behavior similar to C1 tires, so we could expect that from a cluster of C2 tire, we could have methods and limits a bit in advance, so one year in advance potentially, and we don't know aboutdesk clustering, but we could expect to have that. And on C3 tire, so C3 tire, it's clearly for heavy duty tracks, buses, coaches and so on, and herethe timeline is quite longer, so we are doing everything step by step, so potentially 2028 and 2029. So this is more or less where we are inthe task force, so if the GRPE allow me, I will go maybe in the detail of the technical content. So you will see some slides are in common for both methods, and some are dedicated toindoor or dedicated to on road. So as I say today, the proposal, the GRBP, 2024/10, only referred to C1 tire, it's excluding high-grip tire because we are expecting that thosetires will behave quite differently than snow tire and summer tire, and tire with rim diameter below 13. So this approach for both methods, we are comparing a candidate tire to a referencetire. This is really usual in the 117. This is not something we invent for the abrasion. And so far, so we are starting to address all the categories of tire, and we will then compare to other referencetire, which is SRTT, so I think it's standard reference, I always miss a letter, something tire. So summer for normal tire and winter for winter tire, snow tire, maybe special loose tire. So some items are still under discussion. Okay. So I will start by on road. So the principle is really to have a convoy and to drive 8,000 kilometers, plus or minus 300, byrepeating circuits. The circuit is minimum distance is 300 kilometers. And the purpose is to do the circuit. This circuit you will see is defined in terms of longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration and so on. And also within the convoy, we will do some change of the car, some change of the driver, but it will be explained afterwards. So for the circuits,we have some way to validate the circuit to be sure that everything goes well during the test. 8,000 kilometer test, you can imagine that we are wishing to have usable tests for type approval. And as I said, in the convoy, we will have reference tier fitted in one of the vehicle, because we will always compare to reference tier, and it will be a kind of index. So we I'm sorry. I lost you.I'm going really quickly to that, but we define lots of parameters to verify and also to set the circuit to be sure that everything goes well. So as I already introduced, we will change the driver. We will also change the position of the car in the convoy in orderto have something comparable among the cars themselves. Also some parameters on the car, so the purpose is to have the same number of position of driven wheels, okay? Front wheeldrive or rear, rear, rear, rear drive. Okay. I will not say everything. So same kind of powertrainin the convoy, also professional energy system, if it's ICE, then it's ICE. If it's NOVC, then NOVCPEV. So the same in the convoy to have the same behavior. So we do not have to haveexactly the same car, but to have something similar. Also to be confirmed or if available the air drag more or less indirectly via the F2 coefficient, you will know in this room. Andyeah, okay, we change the driver as already said. So for the time being, we also need to prepare the tire. We need to prepare the vehicle. So everything is defined in the methods. Soin terms of inflation, in terms of mass repartition and so on. So here are the what are the finalvalidation of the circuit and what we are looking at. So we will have urban, regional and highwayparts among the circuits to be representative of normal driving, let's say. We have a certainrange of longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration. We will check on the reference tire if the abrasion rate is within certain range, just to be sure that nothing completely unexpectedhappens. For instance, if you have a circuit that you well know but the asphalt has been rebuilt or something happened, this is also a good way to be sure that your circuit is still usable and even ifbecause it's an open road or with the asphalt, you may know it's changing. For instance, today I'm not sure it would be possible to do tire abrasion test due to the snow. Then as I'm not sure I said it, buttire abrasion is linked to the PMP. We are working with the PMP. We are really focusing on mass loss.So what we look at is really the mass loss of material of the tire. So far in the mandate of thetask force, we do not want to go in the composition, in the size of the particles and so on. At least for the step we have on the table now. So we need posture to verify the tire, to weigh it, to alsoverify the fitment of the tire on the vehicle. Everything goes well. We have lots of measurements to do, for instance, to calculate the longitudinal and lateral acceleration. Also to verify that nothingwrong happened to the tire. So pressure drop and so on. So we have intermediate step during the testto verify some things and to be sure that the tire is still relevant to be tested. And we also assess, because it will happen and it already happened during the test campaign, that we will have some problemwith the tire or some problem with the car. I'm not hoping having any accidents in the convoy, butyou know, sometimes that could happen. So we try also to address that and to be sure that it will not completely crash the test and we will be able to keep on the test or at least for part of the tire. Sowe tried some hypothesis of troubleshooting. Okay. So then validation of what happened to the tire,validation of the circuit and afterwards also validation of all the external conditions, so the weather, the temperature, if the asphalt was wet or not and with a certain acceptance of, okay, sometimesit's raining. So we cannot just stop everything when it's raining. So we also define here lots of parameters to be checked afterwards and to be sure that the test was performed well. Of course, testreports, calibration, tolerance, yearly verification of the measurement system. And we have then I switch to indoor methods. So the 2nd method, something similar for the indoor. For sure I will not talkabout vehicle preparation, but at least we have a definition for the indoor drum itself. So some tolerances on the diameter, also on the surface of the drum that has to have a certain abrasion. Itwill not be as a track or a road could be, but it needs to be within certain tolerance. And we will also have for this method a comparison with reference tire. So you see here again my two SRTT summer andwinter, 17 is for the 17 inch. And we will compare the tier, the candidate tier with the SRTT, so withthe reference tier. So we will have also longitudinal and lateral acceleration also to represent what will be the abrasion and the use of the tier in the real life, even if we are indoor. Some prevention hasto be done on the adhesion because we know that sometimes the rubber could be fixed on the drum, and this is something we need to avoid because then we have no more abrasion or less abrasion than expected. Sothere we have defined a cycle to be run, so cycle with force or torque as I say longitudinal and lateral. Herethe mileage is 500 kilometer or equivalent to 500 kilometer for the tier with some different speeds, soat 100 KPH and 600 KPH, especially when we have slopes, when we have lateral acceleration in the cycle. So this is more or less what we have. It has been based partially at least for longitudinal accelerationon the WLTP or WLTC data. Then during the procedure, so we have the same kind of approach, so it's indoor,so we can have an influence on the temperature, on the agrametry and so on. We will also have I don'thave it. Okay. I do have it. Do I have it? Okay. We will also have as in the convoy changing of the tier, so having the candidate tier, the reference tier, the drum, it could be like a mouse drum, soyou could have one tier here and one tier here, so if so, then we need to switch the tier. It dependson the drum. So we also try to assess that everything goes well and that it is representative of somethingthat would happen in real life for the abrasion of the tier. Okay. That was written, actually. My bad.Okay. Then coming to measurements, recording and so on, so we need to also measure everything, so the forces, the talk and so on, so it's maybe quite easier. We also have an approach for troubleshooting,what could we verify if everything goes well and what to do in something if something goes wrong.And that's all. So just to summarize, because this part was quite technical, so the purpose is really to put the methods into the 117, regulation 117. Today we do not have any limits. It's only twomethods. We have kind of transitional provisions, so those methods are available or will be available in the regulation. It will be applicable at least for measurement for the 1st step and when we willdefine the limits for measurement and comparing to a limit. What we still need to assess is how to correlate or how to find if any equivalency or correlation between the two methods. So there arelots of discussion on that. This is something we are taking on board to let you know also we are working on family approach and so on. But for the time being, really the purpose is for the GRBP to have an adoptionof the implementation of those two methods and also to keep on working to define the limits and to finalize everything. So this is for C1 and same thing will be done at a later stage to be confirmed bythe validation of the terms of reference normally for next GRBP as well for C2 and for C3. Thank you.Thank you, Erdi, for this comprehensive presentation. We have asked for more information from your task force and I'm happy that you did. There's a lot of things for hold and you will start with in the GRBP inFebruary for the document 2024/10 for I think for adoption. I see a question for the floor fromTheo from the European Commission. The question is just now talking as a culture in the task forceon the abrasion, I would like to inform that following the request from Moika we have now uploadedthe working document as an informal document to the GRP session. So it is already online as a GRP/90/40E.We would like to receive your comments, GRP comments by the end of January to this document to take theminto account. Thank you. So we have this whole week, so they will say Thursday, Friday, maybe the latestto reflect if there are some elements experts from the GRP want to bring up to you for your work in theGRBP. The floor is open. The Netherlands. Thank you, Chair, for giving me the floor and also thank you,well, LOD as co-chair of the task force on the abrasion for the presentation and the information.We from the Dutch Delegation were a bit surprised that there already were working documents withinthe GRBP and, of course, we had some discussions with our colleague who is dealing with the GRBP. And,yeah, we understood that the test methods were not ready yet and there was some still discussion going on. So that's why we were a bit surprised. But just to give some addition to the GRP, maybe that helpsso that we understood that further investigations are necessary to study the temperature dependency of tire abrasion and that the study is planned for spring 2024. And we have also understood there isa large spread in the absolute abrasion on the drum. So this could possibly be explained by the adhesion prevention system possibly changing the wear behavior depending on the implementation and the effect of the system needs to be further investigated also. And these topics will still need to be addressed bythe task force and these topics are not covered in the current proposal for the working documents within the GRBP. And good to inform the GRPE that the current working documents are a 1st start and further work is needed to improve the test methods. So, yeah, probably some additions will come in the nearfuture on the test methods itself. Thank you. Thank you. Netherlands. Thank you for this comment. Ithink there is no question. I will just confirm your understanding. So yes, so far we will we are implementing or willing to implement the methods. We know that there are still some what I call finetuning but maybe it is not only fine tuning. So the methods need to be improved and we have already seen via the test campaign that some items need to be also confirmed via what we call the market assessmentcampaign in 2024 where we plan to test around 200 tires. So yes, we will work on the temperaturedependency, sorry, repeatability and certainty and so on. This is in our scope. And as you well spotted, we will not have the time to address that by the 6th of February. So it will be done at a later stage andwe will improve the 117 based on the result of the next test campaign. I think Oika was asking for aswell. So Bill and then the German Delegation. Yes, thank you very much. As regards Oika, of course, our representatives in GRBP will be making formal responses. So again I would say I'm not speakingon behalf of Oika rather as a member of GRPE. I have a couple of questions or points for clarification that I think might help the group. The 1st one is regarding the use of reference tires. My understandingis that on the convoy method, the candidate tires will be or the results will be normalized against the reference tires to ensure or to try to take out climatic differences and road surface differencesfrom the testing. But I have not seen anywhere whether the reference tire measurements will be normalized against each other or against some sort of golden method to ensure that you can,e.g. , compare a 20 inch tire with a 17 inch tire because they are tested against different references. And a related point to that, I see this use of reference tires almost as a calibrationprocedure. And I wondered whether there is any concept of checking the abrasion of reference tires over time to on some sort of time cycle take a reference tire and check that the values arestable. So that's my 1st point. My 2nd point refers to the working document. I'm very thankful that it's been uploaded. I think it's a worthy read for all members. I'll just mention the paragraph number. Nobody needs to go shooting for it. It's a very short paragraph. But I thinkit's particularly significant to GRPE members. Paragraph 169 says vehicle driving mode. If several driving modes are available, the default driving mode as it is defined by the vehicle manufacturershall be selected. I got shivers down my spine as I read that. I remember some very long and very, very painful discussions in WLTP regarding driving modes. And to my knowledge, it is not mandatoryto have a default driving mode. So I think it's a significant point that the document also has to provide for vehicles that don't have a default. And it's not necessarily, of course, the one out ofReg. 154. And then the last one, I think I'm just clarifying an understanding. I picked up in aTFTA meeting that it's not planned to introduce a new series of amendments to Reg. 117. I was quite shocked by that. But I think I've now understood it's not planned for this working paper becausethere are no limits. Is my understanding correct that when we introduce limits, I see a thumb up from Elodie, but I'll complete the sentence. When we introduce limits, it will be a new series of amendments.Okay. Thank you very much for that. Thank you, Will. Elodie? Okay. So I will try to answer your three questions and Theo, if you want to complete, please. So on the reference tier, so no, we will not comparereference tier to itself, for sure, for the index. But there is a control of the reference tier because during the test, we will look at its abrasion and it has to be within a certain range, so within a certainvalues. And if it's not the case, then it means that we have a problem with the reference tier andthat the test is void. On the default mode, the point is taken, I think it could be part of the comments sent by the GRPE to our group. For sure, you will see also other reference like for the F2, which is moreGRPE topics than the entire industry one. So the point is taken, but if you could send it via writing, we would be pleased or any other comments are also welcome. And yes, I confirm your understanding,this is not a new series because there is no limit. And it will be a new series when we will introduce the limit. And if you look at the C1, C2, C3, potentially we will have new series for C1, new seriesfor C2 and new series for C3. So we are expecting to go from 04 series to 5, 6, 7. Difficult to press3. Sorry. Thank you. I adhere also replying to the Netherlands' concerns that GRC this year will carryout large scale study covering some of the points already raised by the Netherlands and also covering the reproducibility of the reference tires as Bill mentioned. So parts of your concerns will be coveredin a study that we will carry out this year. And my knowledge, according to my knowledge, GRC will notbe the only entity doing such tests this year. So in my point of view, we will close this gap of knowledge regarding the reference tires within 2024 and that's what we expect in the DFTA. Thank you. Thank you.Germany. Yeah. Thank you very much for this very interesting presentation. This is more a personal question. From exhaust emissions we know quite well that it's very difficult to find a correlation betweenRDE measured on the road to emissions measured in the lab. What about these two methods about theconvoy method and the drum method? Do you have a good correlation of these methods? Thanks. Thank you, Germany, for this question which is a good question and I have the same personal view,but so far for the entire region, I cannot answer to it because it's still ongoing. So we are hoping to find a correlation but we are also thinking about any other scenarios if it's not the case. So in anycase, we try to go to a correlation. This is really the target of the task force. But if it's not possible,then we need to think about other alternatives and this is something we have in mind. Yes, thanks. Thefloor is still open. A little bit thinking about how do we address now the remarks from the GAP for theGABP session. How do we those remarks and the answers, what was raised, how do youpoint it out in the GABP in February? How do we do that? Yes, good question indeed. So I would ask youto send an email to the co-chairs. So Theo and myself, so normally maybe I can update if Theo agrees that I put his email on the status report. So I can update the status report to explicitly put ouremails. So the purpose is to receive your feedback, if any. Then we will have the task force on the 24th of January. So also we will have then some feedback from the drafting, feedback from the post processing,from the test campaign and so on. And for the 6th of February where it's the GABP, we will then integrate all the comments. If needed, we can do a track change and highlight if it comes from GPE or if it comesfrom the task force or if it comes from GABP, I think this is something that we can handle by a track change revision. But this is why we ask you to send your feedback by the end of January to have the timeto integrate, answer or to try to clarify if it's questions by the 6th of February. So this is quite unusual because it means that we will send our informal document to GRBP on the 6th of January, so almostjust the 1st day of the GRBP. But I hope that the Chair of the GRBP will accept to review our informal document.Yeah, thanks. We see that even if the document could be adopted, there is still some work to do after that. So it is not, it is only the method and as a supplement and not as a series of amendments with thelimits including that some additional fine-tuning is needed after that. So it depends on if it is adopted or not. But we will be informed after that. Okay. So it is also good for the contracting parties to brief theexperts in the GRBP how they are thinking if some information from this GRBP is necessary for them for thediscussion in the GRBP. So we have different routes to do directly to you as an information to the Co-Chairs ofthe task force as well as the input from the Delegates in the GRBP. Yes. Thanks. Thank you, Elodie. And we are interestedhow they will continue that work there. We have a next informal document, 2020 revision 1 from the experts from OICA on the specific study done on thetire abrasion. So we give the floor to OICA. They can come here if they want to give the presentation or from the floor. It isdepending on what is coming here. Okay. Good. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So just to introduce myself, I'm from UTAC. So I'm going to present the tire abrasion study done by UTAC for ACER and I'm presenting on behalf of OICA. Okay. So that said,yeah, well, that's the same. So the study that we have done, we have done most of the study and there's some additional steps that we are planning to do to complete the study. So just the content of the presentation. So I'm going to give an overview of the study with the different working packages. Soquick word on the 1st one, that was literature review. And then I'm going to present in more detail the work package 3, which was real life testing, so vehicle testing. And the 4th work package, which was the statistical analysis. And then obviously I will finish with the conclusion and the next step, the next steps are planned. So thescope of the study, so that was a theoretical and experimental study of the influencing factors on the tire wear and abrasion, which is different. And so the objective was 1st to review the proposal from the task force tire abrasion in terms of test method and specifically for tire performanceinterdependency. And one aspect of the study was to try to quantify the difference in terms of tire wear and abrasion in relation to the vehicle type. When we say vehicle type, we mean ICE versus electric vehicle. And also we tried to quantify the possible difference in between the different typeof tyres, when we say type of tyre, we are talking about original equipment tyres, so the tyres that are fitted on the car when they are produced, and aftermarket tyres,and tyres with different label values. So in terms of label values, we are considering of, obviously, the EU label. So the work packages of the study, that was 1st the work, the literaturereview that we completed last June, and then the 2nd work package was an analysis of the April tyre database analysis, so that's the tyre label database, that this we completedthat in August, and the 3rd work package was the real life testing, so vehicle testing that we completed as well in August, and the 4th work package was the test results analysis thatwe completed in October 20, last October, and well, we have planned some additional testingand some additional analysis, so hopefully we will complete that this month or the next. And the 5th work package is why I'm here today, it's a presentation of the study results tothe GRBP and the GRP. So 1st a quick word on the literature review that we have done, sothe scope was looking at tyre abrasion and mileage information for C1, C2 and C3 tyres, as wellas summer and MSF tyres, and the aspects that were considered were the influence of the different factors on tyre wear and abrasion, which are driving behavior, vehicle design, tyre performanceinterdependency, and also all the aspects of tyre testing. And we also looked at tyre and road wear and particles emission. A note about that, obviously we covered all the studiesthat were presented until this point in the task force tyre abrasion, but we didn't limit the literature review to that, obviously. So here I'm just going to present the finding ofthe literature review related to the tyre performance interdependency, because that's in relation with the rest of the study in terms of regard to the tyre testing we have done and the analysis.So the findings regarding tyre performance interdependency was that we could get good tyres in terms oftyre wear and abrasion that are also good in terms of rolling resistance and rolling noise. That will depend basically on the tyre development choice and the type of tyre considered. When I say type oftyre, I'm talking about eco tyre, high performance tyre and so on. With regard to all the aspects ofthe safety related to tyre performance, which are basically dry grip, wet grip, handling and so on, theconclusion was it was quite it seems that it's challenging to find to achieve good level in terms of safety performance and tyre wear and abrasion at the same time. So to illustrate that, it's the graph isbasically an extract from a previous study that obviously we considered in the literature review done by UTAC for again. That shows basically the spider diagram which shows the different performance of thetyre and that's quite a good representation. So having said that, I'm going to present now the work package3, which was the testing that we have done. So we have done some vehicle testing, basically tyre wear and abrasiontesting. So the objective was to try to quantify within a test the difference in terms of tyre wear and abrasion in relationto the vehicle type and the tyre type. For that, we had to select 1st some vehicles to do the study. So in order to have tryto get a direct comparison between ABEV and ICE, we selected some electric vehicles and ICE vehicles that were from thesame model platform, namely the BMW X1 and IX1. The tyres that we selected to test were all C1 summer tyres, so the size was 245/45R19/102Y. Sothat's basically the main all-round fitment for the BMW IX1, so that was easier to manage for the test. And we select different tyre labels, sothat was representative of the labels of this size in the European market. Well, mainly French, but yes. So we had we tested AA tyre, which was a representative of an eco-tyre for EV and that was an aftermarket tyre, so the best label available. And we also tested twoOE homologated tyres, one that was more eco-tyre with a label AB and one that was more comfort tyre with a label BA. We also tested a CA tyre, which was representative of the best selling aftermarkettyres in France, which was marketed as a high performance tyre. And we also tested the worst label tyre that we found in the market, the French market, which was DB tyre. One thing to note is that this tyre, tyres before we did the vehicle testingwe checked the labels for wet grip and rolling noise by testing them. The other thing is that we tried to select the tyres with start of production date as recent as possible, so that was basically corresponding to the same kind of generation of tyres. And the dot of the tyre, the tyre that was tested werethe entire tested were between week 20 of 2022 and week 19 of 2023. In terms of definitionof the circuit and the test method that we used, so we tried to stick as much as possibleto the circuit definition and the test method proposed within the task force and that was presented and explained by LOD of France just a minute ago. The only difference was basically to take into account the specificity of the studies. So for instance, we chose a circuitalready, well, that we knew well around our site and that was compatible with an electric vehicle range and charging constraint. You may notice that the standard deviation for the acceleration are a bit different to the spec from the task force. So it is obviously that wewe use a circuit that we already know so that we don't we couldn't stick to the spec as we have wanted and also there is something that the standard deviation here are calculated using internal method and that's a bit differentto what is proposed in the task force. In terms of the test method itself, the main difference is that we used a double convoy, so three+3 vehicles mixing obviously ICE and BEV so that was to limit to one test and being able to compare directly ICE and BEV.Which is obviously different to the test methods in the test force. The reference in terms of reference, we don't choose a specific SRTT, we used one of the tiers that we tested as a reference. The total running distance was longer than what is proposed in the task force, that was to understand to see the impact of the runningin distance on the tire wear and abrasion rate. And we measured wear and abrasion. So that means we measured the tire tread depth loss and the mass loss. And we did some intermediatemeasurements every 2,000 kilometers so that to better understand the evolution of the abrasion and wear rate. The testing took place between July and August to benefit from themost climate weather condition. One thing to note is that during the test we had one punctureon the reference vehicles with the reference tires which was the left tire. And that meansfor that we applied what is described specified in the test method of the task force which iswhen we calculate the abrasion rate is that we count twice the remaining tire on the same axle. Sohere you see the weight loss rate per vehicles that we defined for the different tires tested. Onething to note is that here while we normalized the result by the vehicle load and what we can say is that before the normalization process we could see the vehicle weight influence on the weight loadrace, right? Especially between the 1st two tires, the same tire but one fitted on the electric vehicles andthe other one on the ICE vehicles. That's where we get the difference in vehicle weight. And so we noticethe change in the test results when we normalized the results by the vehicle weight. And for that we could seethat actually when we regard to the aspect of comparing ICE and BEV, when we test same tire on in the sameconvoy, so subjective to the same acceleration and we normalize the result by the vehicle weight, we have quite similar rate betweenthe ICE and the BEV. That is also something that we could observe when we considered the wear rate, which are the averagetread loss rate. The difference between the wear rate and the abrasion rate here is that you can see that the rates are not really stabilized bythe end of the test. So that's a line with some previous findings that yes, the wear rate stabilized, you need a longer distance to get stabilized wear rate compared to abrasion rate.Sorry to introduce a bit, but we have to go one item this afternoon which is tabled. So it is possible that you quickly go through the statistics and that's very short and then to the conclusion because this document is available for everyone. Can you do that? Sorry to bring that to you. I don't want to do that, but this may be good, otherwise we go in the next session.Okay. So the conclusion and if you have any questions about the details, you can ask later. So what we found is that there was some correlation between rolling noise and the loss rate. That was shown in the correlation analysis and the principle component analysis that was done.And we also saw some trends. Quieter tire could be associated with higher weight loss rate and higher rolling resistance label could be associated with higher weight loss rate. And what we couldn't find is correlation between wet grip and either weight loss rate and the tread depthloss rate. And so what we decided is to try to complement the study with trying to apply the statistical analysis to a bigger sample of tires rather than just a sample of six tires that we tested to confirm the results and also to actuallymeasure the tires that we tested in terms of rolling resistance and cornering stiffness to have a better picture of the difference between the different tires and understand and see if there is a better correlation, especially for rolling resistance. So hopefully we will update we will do this additional testing and update the analysis in the coming month.Thank you. Thank you for this interesting study. Of course, this is also needed to understand what is going on in the tire bracing. Sorry that I have a little bit interjected to you. But we have to close at 5:30 sharp. So we need another topic on our agenda. So but it is very interesting and thank you very much for all your effort in UTAG and in theresponse of the task coming from OICA that you are doing. So very good to have this kind of knowledge on your test. So thank you for being here and present this. Thanks a lot. Of course, if there is a question, it is still possible but I want to otherwise give you only 10 min break and then we go to the next speaker.Agenda point 14. So if you want to stretch legs, we can do that. But only max 10 min . It is 5 min before then we start. So we will continue. Time is running. So we have still an agenda point on our agenda, very important one. But before that, I willcome back what was discussed on the GTR number 24 where the Dutch Delegation had some remarks on improvement of the text. And they have done that in the immediate time. So I will give the floor to the Netherlands to give the amendments what they have drafted. Andwe put it on the screen. It is already on the screen. So the Netherlands, you have the floor. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back to everyone after the coffee break. Coffee break without coffee. And thanks to Theo GRC for the open discussion on the text. We tried to clarify the wording in this paragraph related to ceramicbreaks where it was stated that there would be a further relaxation of 15 degrees. We tried to make it more concrete to prevent for any further discussions or unclearity on the text. And the text now reads that the tolerance to the low end of the temperature regime are – theSorry, the tolerances to the low end of the temperature regime are extended to minus 40 degrees for IBT between square brackets A2 and to minus 50 degrees for the FBT betweensquare brackets A3. That's all that are all the changes we have made. So instead of having this 15 degrees, we have the absolute values of the lower end of the tolerance included.Okay. Thank you. And I think this is agreed by the informal Working Group, PMP. Thank youvery much. We agree with this wording. Okay. OICA. Sorry. Bill. Also OICA also checked the new text and it's okay. Thank you very much for the short notice change and clarification.Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Reinier. Also OICA is positive. So okay. Thanks to Netherlands for this improvement and then I think we can then take the vote for the adoption of thisdocument. I think this is important, of course, because then we are at that stage that we can adopt the Working Document 2024/4 which is then amended and approved and with informaldocument GOP/90/25, revision 1. Can we agree on this? We can adopt this. I see no remarks.I think this is again a milestone for the 1st amendment of this GTR and we bring it to 29/AC3.I think that will be in June, that will be feasible. So thank you very much for this toughwork. Congratulations about that. Very good. Having that, we have as set in our running order that we touch the other important topic on automotive life cycle assessment, Agenda Point14. Yeah, okay. I thought that was already done, but it is the report, you mean? Yeah, the report is, of course, added and also endorsed by the GOP. So for your notes, I thought that was alreadydone, but okay, to make it clear that that is added to it for the administrative provisions. So thank you, Francois, to remind me as well. So yeah, 27 is that informal document, 27 isalso adopted. It goes to 29 in June, AC3. Then back to Agenda Point 14, automotive life cycleassessment, and we have a status report from the Chairman of the informal Working Group,Hakuni, we have the formal document 31. Please, you have the floor if you are ready. Thank youvery much, Mr. Chair. So this is a report from the informal Working Group of automotive lifecycle assessment. So I feel the lack of energy, but please be patient for a while. But in anyway, so this page shows the progress on the schedule. So after the last session of GRP, and then untilnow, we had five meetings, including an in-person meeting in Brussels last October. Then outcomes, a successfullystarted subgroup activity with constructive contribution by member and with excellent leadership by leadersof subgroups. So intensive discussion on level concept. So as a reminder, level concept isto describe the kind of portion to be introduced, primary data. Primary data is actual measureddata, not statistics based value. So as level become higher, then many portion of primarydata will be used for the methodology. So this is a kind of brief explanation of leveling concept.And then also overarching aspect is the issues related to all subgroup activities. So theseare still ongoing. So this is the working structure of the informal Working Group. So the top lineshows the leading team and also other informal Working Group. And also we have two, three, four,five subgroups below. So subgroup 2 is responsible for material production. And this group wasled by Japan. And then our next one will be SG3 is responsible for production phase led byKorea and China, OICA and CREPA. And also SG4 is responsible for the CO2 emission for use phase,use stage. This group led by European Commission and OICA and AVERE. And the end of life will be SG5 and ledby China and Japan. And also we have SG6 related to fuel and energy. This group is kind of this group'stask is kind of horizontal issue. So the shape is like this. And then this group was until the last December,this group was led by only Robinson from AVERE as a leader. But we invited a new core leader for this groupfrom Japan. So this SG6 is led by Japan and AVERE. And also we are considering to have SG7 for drafting. Sothe leader is now under the discussion still. So this is the structure of the informal working group. So this is some notes. Thenthe left side of this figure is describing the items for informal working group itself. And we have agreement on the vehicle as a category, category 1-1. Andthen also we agreed with the species including, of course, carbon dioxide and also other species to be calculated. And also we see the kind of possibility of hydrogen. And then under the discussion we have several items here. So, of course, level concept and also indirect infrastructure and alsotransportation of product and also representative vehicle. Now we are discussing about this. One purpose to have the representative vehicle would be kind of a test of our methodology we will develop. But now we are discussing about this. And then right top shows theissue taken by SG2. SG2 is responsible for material production. So, of course, they are considering the level and they have a kind of general agreement with level to be achieved and also recycled materials, usage of recycled materials. And also regionalcarbon intensity which is related to a local energy mixture. And also energy mixture would be taken by SG6, of course. So SG2 work together with SG6 on this topic. And under the discussion, a calculation method and also they are working on intensively on batterymaterials. Now they are considering how they can lay out the boundary condition for battery production. Also SG3 would be the production of vehicle itself and apartment. And the agreement they have is the declared unit. So declared to calculate the carbon dioxide and emission and also LGamus when we have in 2019 we had LGMus from Indonesia and we're saying right now we have onecarbon dioxide emission. So a unit could be like one chassis system or maybe fuel tank assembledor something like whatever. So this is kind of a unit to calculate carbon dioxide. And then stillthey have kind of discussion point like primary data and also labeling concept. And also SG3 have manypoints related to other SGs. So they have kind of discussion on overlapping issue between SGs. So onthis page, left top would be SG4, which is responsible for use phase. They had agreement on scope, boundaries andmaintenance and regular consumption. And also they have some discussion items still, CO2 equivalent calculation includingfunctional unit. Of course, baseline would be carbon dioxide kilogram per kilometer, but still they have kind of discussion onthat. And also service or the kind of following activities also they are discussing now. And the right top would be SG5, which isresponsible for end of life. So agreement they have was development of recycling model. And then following discussion items, some would berelated to the recycling modeling. So these are still ongoing. And the bottom would be SG6. As I said, this group subject would be horizontal issue betweenSGs. And then agreement here is scope of emissions of species. But as I said, maybe I don't say, but so as a group, informal working group, we willtake species defined by IPCC here. And then also SG6 will follow the decision, of course. And also a functional unit of the subgroups. So the text is quite simply specified. But this meansthat we have kind of issue how the product of SG6 would be transformed to other subgroups. So this means the kind of issue of plugging to other subgroups. So they have a kind of general agreement of the unit to link with other subgroupshere. And also they have discussion like these species of specification, species of the labeling concept on inclusion of hydrogen and so on. So these are ongoing topics. And then next stepswill be like this. So we will have in-person meeting in April in Korea. That will be 18th and 19th. And then before that, we will have several web session as a preparation for the in-person meeting in Korea. And alsoto 20th of May. So in purple, we stated the kind of request to GRPE. But this was drafted before we see the plan of GRPE this morning. But in any case, we would like to have a half-daysession in conjunction with 91st GRPE session. But, of course, this will be discussed later on. Yes. And then this will be the sign of our progress here. So in general, I think we are doing well. But on overarching aspect, we have a kind of strategy behind the situation. So in the followingmeetings, we would like to catch up. So this is all. Thank you very much. So do you have any questions or comments? Thank you, Mikuni-San, for this information on your hard work in the informal Working Group, automotive LCA. The floor is open for any questions. United States. Mike. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thankyou for that very informative update. So I have a couple of comments along the way. And I think these are things that I tried to reflect during the LCA meeting. But I think it's worth saying also in the GRPE meeting as well. But 1st of all, I want to acknowledge the leadership team on the ALCA and all of the members. This is a very, very difficult task trying to pull together a lifecycle analysis process like this. So I do appreciate all of the input that's been goingon. So I think they're and my comments are not necessarily to mean that these things are not happening within the group. But I want to emphasize the importance of some of these things. So just the 1st one is that all I think that all of the subgroups should make sure they're getting the same level of attention along the way. So it feels like some of there's varying degrees of maturity within each one of those subgroups. And so we needto make sure we bring them all along at the same rate because of the importance of the, you know, what that means for the LCA. The leveling concept, I brought this up during the meeting as well. I don't think we heard a lot about the leveling concept this week. But when the leveling concept was 1st introduced, you know, we thought that all of the subgroups should be at the same level, that that would produce an LCAthat was valid. And so we need to make sure that we stay focused on that, that each subgroup is not working sort of on its own level and that we have sort of vertical alignment in that leveling process. I still think that that's important. And I think this came up also that making sure that all of the subgroups are working to a common set of assumptions. And I think that we talked a lot about SG6 this weekand the importance of having the identical assumptions with respect to infrastructure. And then we also spent a lot of time on what a representative vehicle definition is. And I know that there's work going on to make sure that we have a common set of assumptions on there. And I just want to emphasize how important I think that that representative vehicle could be in this process. In the end, we're trying to create something that can be usedpotentially by regulators to make decisions about future regulatory programs. And in that environment, we're going to naturally lend itself to an A to B comparison. This is the way things go. We're going to compare one set of technologies with another set of technologies and we're going to try to decide which one of those two technologies has a lower carbon footprint overall. And in the assumptions that we make about the vehiclelevel, the vehicles at that point, the energy consumption, the fuel consumption, the range of the battery, those will be really important to make sure that we have a valid A to B comparison in the end. So once again, I just want to thank the leadership team and the participants for this work and just to reiterate some of those observations from this week. Thank you. Thank you, Mike, for these wise observations. And you already addressed that to the leveling concept thatwe are really no if you compare that you compare the right vehicles with the right level and that there is no disharmonization on this. Otherwise, you cannot compare. So this is important, specific for political reason if you want to see some technology. But other reasons what I heard also in the informal working group that some manufacturers also need this kind of life cycle assessmentonly for internal reasons. So there are different reasons why you need the life cycle assessments I have learned in that group. But interesting, of course, from contracting parties to reflect that everything at every level in every subgroup is important, that they are on pace. So thank you, Mike, for this remarks. The floor is open for othersI don't hear about the drafting group. I think this is waiting for that you have finished all the other topics. But I know time is running. Do you have an idea when some goals are set for further activities also working on? I see the drafting is in the sheet on theslide. Some activities will take after June 2024. Do you have some ideas when you can start with that kind of activity?Thank you very much. So now actually already provided kind of rough image of how to proceed drafting work. So and then I think this already shared between subgroup leaders already. SoI think once we invite the view from each subgroup on the kind of plan, then we elaborate the following steps. So now this is just current status. So thank you very much.Okay. Thank you for that update. Also we have the terms of reference. We are going to 2025 very soon. You have also mentioned that there is a hybrid meeting in April. And it is a face-to-face meeting as well. It is more or less a face-to-face meeting.It is more or less a face-to-face meeting, but there is a hybrid possibility. Is that or is it only face-to-face? And I think it is a conjunction with EVE, but there is also that meeting in Seoul. Yeah.Now I'm informed by Kim Sun from Korea. Then we can have hybrid meeting system in Korea.Okay. But it is meant as a face-to-face, but you give the possibility for people to attend virtual. Okay. Good. Other remarks? Otherwise I think look to the clock. We have yeah. Thank you very much. A lot of success also in Seoul and in Korea in April. And our next session, yeah, we discuss you already mentioned that we will discussthat we will discuss what will be done in the May session of the GOP. I don't know if when to discuss this. Maybe tomorrow, I think. Yeah. Tomorrow. And the topic on item 3, what I said we come back with the item 3, we are now running a little bit over time. So if you allow me that we take that tomorrow morning. Is that okay? To wrap upand to make the decisions tomorrow. Yeah? Okay. Not to take one out so that we take that item tomorrow 1st time. So then I think we are finished for today. And I wish you a good evening, good dinner and fresh tomorrow here in Geneva at 9:30. So see you then.Thanks."}
{"title": "", "text": "Yes, good morning. Here as well. Second day of the GAP. So we start on the topic 3A andwhere we not finished yesterday. So we have said that we will come back to this item.what we have agreed on the 1st document 05 that was agreed. So this is a working document 7. And then there are still some documents from regulation 83 still pending. We have to make a decisionhere in the GPE what to do with that. We had some scrutiny reservations on some documents. Andsome new revisions. So it is the 08 series, that's the document 8 where the European Commission had scrutiny reservation and we had the informal 8 which was the transitional provisions wherewe have already agreed more or less that the option 3 was the most appropriate. And we havethe next item on regulation 83, that is the informal document 09 where we have now a new revision. And Francois will give us an overview on all the new documents of the revisions whichwas uploaded so that you are aware and that we can make our decisions what to do with these documents. So Francois, if you are ready, then you can update the GPE on the new publisheddocuments. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Good morning, everyone. Indeed, so we have received a few informal documents which I didn't introduce yesterday. So I will quickly update you on this. Informal 35 whichis the status report from the VIEQ, the vehicle interior air quality informal working group. Informal 37 which is a proposal from OICA on a workshop on system power determination andinformal 38 as well OICA an update on the fuel economy for heavy duty vehicle and maybe also an idea for a workshop. Informal 39 from the UK which is some proposal to amend the workingdocument 9 and informal 40 which we considered already yesterday which is a copy of the GRBP working document 10 on the tire abrasion task force. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Should I go directlythen to the 3A? Yes. Okay. So for those of you who have been here in the recent sessions,we have usually pulled up this adoption table we call it to make sure we are all on the same line on what we want to do with which documents, especially on the agenda item 3A, 3C and 5.So I have tried to synthesize what we have agreed so far on the documents you see on the left. So working document 7 we have adopted. We still have to consider working document 8as the Chair said with informal 8. We still have to consider informal 9 revision 1. We still have to consider working document 9 which was amended by informal 39. We agree to postponeand to request more time for scrutiny on the working documents 2 and 3, amending the original and O1 series of 154. Maybe we want to reconsider the proposals from Japan, the working document10 and 11 amended by informal 21 and 22 to amend the O2 and O3 series of 154 to align that with the original requirements in Japan. And I think we agreed also maybe to request more time forscrutiny of all the working documents 10, 23, 11 and 19. So it is just to bring everyone on the same page to make sure we align. And then so this morning we will just address the orangeand sorry for the color blind people, the orange bits that remains to be to find to have a decisionfrom us, from JRP on this. Everybody is okay with that conclusion so far? I see Bill. Thankyou and good morning, everyone. Yeah, it is even with double zoom it is completely unreadable from here. Would it be possible to upload a 1st version and then we update it at the endof the session as an informal or something so that we can read it? Thank you. Yes, I willdo that. But I will go through the documents itself. So you have your in the agenda the documents and we go on the agenda document for document. So that should then in line with what is inthe table. So otherwise Francois will correct me if I misunderstood the situation. But I havesaid that. So if you go to your normal document and you see on the agenda 3A, the 1st document from OICA on the O5 series, we have already adopted. So that was approved. The O8 series,what is said by Francois, the scrutiny reservation from the European Commission and the O8 on the transitional provision with the three options. This is now 1st what was on the table. Weshould take now decision what we do with this. So the floor is open for that document. Thankyou, Mr. Chairman and good morning, everybody. We had a discussion internally and also thanks to the support of France for the technical inputs we can say that we lift the scrutiny reservationthat we raised yesterday. Thank you. Okay. That is good news. So I think then we have therean agreement and we could adopt then this document which is a working document 2024/8 with amendedby the transitional provisions in informal document 19/08 including the option 3. So this adoption table is just uploaded. There is no symbol. It is just at the bottom of the informal documentslist. You will see it from the Secretariat draft adoption table. The next document concerningregulation 83. Just to make sure, I think it is to everybody, but on what we just adoptedwe are striking out what was under a square bracket in the footnote. Is that correct? And the option 3 of this informal 8, right? So option 3 without the footnote in square brackets. Yeah,good to make that so the option 3 already mentioned it, but indeed as well the footnote between square brackets we can delete that part. So it is not crucial for Geneva. Yeah. Okay. Sothat is adopted. Then we have the and before I say what we are going to do with it to send it to W29, I follow 1st all the 83 documents. So the next one is an informal document, therevision 1. We have now revision 1. And the question is the proposal from OICA was this to concerningthe type 4 test on the EVAP and I think the revision 1 was now is uploaded and we have aview and we can adopt this one as well. I see that that is the case. So even that we have and that is, of course, more administrative. We have not a working document dealing with 06 and07 series but I think we can deal with that. So if you agree we can adopt all the regulation83 documents and send it for approval to W29/AC/1 in the June session 2024. Yeah, I mentionedthe revision 1 from the 09 document. It can be introduced 1st if one should know what isin the revision 1 from OICA. Maybe it is good to show that 1st , yeah. Why not? Show the 09revision 1. It is on paragraph 7.35 in red. France. Thank you, Chair. Good morning, everybody. Thisdocument covers a comment from France on paragraph 7.35. This is just some wording change, a clarificationthat reflects the wording that we find in regulation 154. I would like to thank OICA for having taken that comment into consideration. I think the 2nd comment was from the Netherlands also on typeapproval authority rather than representative authority. So for France rev 1 is something we cansupport. Thank you. Okay. Good. So then we are all in the same situation that we know what was in therevision 1. So then state my question that all the documents from regulation 83 could be adopted andcan be sent to 29 AC1 at the June session from this year. Thank you very much. So we have the amendmentfor 05, 06, 07 and 08 series of amendments. Thank you very much. So this is good to have this decision. Youmake the calls directly, Francois? Okay. Good. Then we go to the next document, this 2024/9 on UN regulation 101, fuelconsumption. We have an informal document 39 with the UK correction. We can put it on the screen maybe.Yeah. It's the numbering. Yeah, we are all fine with it. See no obstructions. So then we can also adopt this document. So weadopt GPE document 2024/9 corrected by GPE informal document 90/39. I see it as approved. Go to .B29 AC1in the June session. Thank you very much, ROICA and the UK. Then we have the whole list of regulation 154 which is there are moredocuments but maybe start with the document no, can start with the 1st one. That's easy. We have discussed this document and wehave agreed what I understood that we take this on board in the next session in October so that we take some more time to scrutinize the workingdocuments 2024/2 and 2024/3 dealing with the 02 and 03 series. Is that also all of you the understanding? It is also in the table. Yeah. So we France.Thank you, Chair. I don't want to disagree with what you have said but I just want to comment that we have been working with OICA on 90/11 and we proposed a revision of Rev. 1 with the transitional provisions that will present at the next session. Thank you.Okay. So that revision 1 is online. Okay. So it is good that we continue with that and discuss that in the next session if it is in October or if it is in May. Then we have the proposal from Japan, what's specific on the requirements in their region which doesn't affect the other items which we alreadysaid that was approved, that was not a problem to approve these two documents. So it is the 2024/10 corrected by informal document 21 and working document 2024/11 which amended by informal document 22. It was already I think agreed but I want to be put itagain on the table that maybe this amendment for the regulation 15/4 on 02 and 03 series we could adopt and send this already to 29 in June. European Commission. Thank you, Chair. A question maybe to the Japanese Delegation because my understanding was that the desire was to have this adopted now butnot necessarily sent out to the next session of WP29. Is that correct? Yeah. That discussion was indeed there. We could, of course, adopt the document and then wait and then send it to WP29 at a later stage. But I don't see that there is a necessity to do that. So then you park the document which doesn't have any effect. So that possibility is there butit is not normally in the normal procedure that we adopt the documents and say we don't send it to P29 and wait and send it later. But I think for Japanese it was not a real problem to do that but I think if we can adopt this document now and we have it and if it is no problem then we can send it to WP29 in June. That was my understanding. So why should we wait on a document which already could be adopted and not affecting the other parts of the regulation rather then denying it. So that's my understanding.So why should we wait on a document which already could be adopted and not affecting the otherparts of the regulation 154? So with the Japanese Delegation, yeah? Okay. You have the floor.It is no problem to the Chairman's explanation. Okay. So my understanding is, yeah, we can wait and adopt it later. Why should we do that?So if we are already in the content, okay, then we could start this 1B part of regulation 154 and adopt it now and send it directly to W29. But if we have to adopt it and wait and send it at the latest moment, it can, of course. I think therefore Japanese is not a big issue. But 1st maybe Oika wants to come back to the Commission.Yes, thanks again. As we have heard over the last probably two years of GRPE, we have got an informal agreement that we will not amend UNRs twice within a 12-month period. Can we be assured that if this document is sent to WP29, that will not stand in the way of the Oika papers that amend the same series of the same regulation to be discussed in the next session? Thank you.I can say yes, but because that is the rule what we ourselves have said, that if we are saying every time a new correct amendment is a problem, it is specific for the rule makers in the region and here because it is a kind of a split because it doesn't affect one to the other. So I think it is not a big issue here. European Commission.Thank you, Chair. As expressed here yesterday, these points are not affecting us in a sense. We really support the content but just more in principle related to what Oika just said. Our preference as the European Commission would really be to keep UNR 154 as stable as possible for some period of time and then to amend it at once with all of the potential amendments that come at this point in time.So, again, if it is important to Japanese legislation that this comes into force rather quickly, obviously we won't object to this being sent out to WP 29 now, but if there is no huge time pressure related to that, maybe in term of process it is better to wait a bit and to amend at once UNR 154 in the WP 29 following the October session of GRPYes, but okay. I think the Japanese Delegation wants to have this document adopted in their internal process. We can make, of course, their specific note in the minutes that we adopt this document and we will send it to WP 29 at a later stage. But I don't know if that is okay for Japan. So I want to because itdoesn't, what I said against Bill, it is not a big problem that we take this document already for adoption in WP 29, but I also understand that we have an amendment for a series of amendments of this regulation, 154, even if it is only from the part of 1B. I look to the Japanese Delegation 1st and then I come backto France. I wait for the Japanese Delegation. Japan. Yes, yesterday Japan explained that it is okay to determine the amendment in this GRP. So Japan is okay whenever they submit to the NWP.Sorry. The judge is determined by the Chairman. Let me make it clear. Our minimum requirement is this document wants to be approved during thisGRP session. Once approved, we are very flexible. It will go to WP 29 with merging other proposal or stand alone. We are flexible. So if other proposal come later, then it is going to be merged, our proposal, we are okay. Soour minimum requirement is this document wants to be approved during this GRP session. Okay. That was also clear for me. But I try to do the normal, if we adopt, we go to WP 29, but we can also postpone a little bit when we send it to WP 29. We don't touch it anymore. We adopt thedocument. It will not be under discussion. It is there and we put it in a minute and we take this directly with us when the other amendments go to WP 29 AC3 when approved in the next session. That could be the situation. Everyone is happy with that. I'm happy as well. France. Thank you, Chair.Just to confirm, and perhaps the Secretariat can also confirm that, in other GRs we adopted documents and this was included in WP 29 or later. That's something that is possible even in the 58 process, even though it is not perhaps customary. Thank you.Yeah. Yeah, I know that this is possible, but it is not the normal procedure what we are following. But France. Normally for the recording and for the report, I need, we usually specify which session the document will go to of WP 29. So in this case, if we already say this will go to the October, the March 2025 session of WP 29, thenI mean, then we have to deliver on October on the other ones. If we don't deliver, then we are in the same situation and we have to postpone again. So maybe, yeah, in my view, that was maybe showing a bit of slowness of UN processes in that case because if we don't achieve anything in October, then what do we do? We postpone again the Japanese proposal. But okay, we can do it. But I need to know what I put in my report. We adopted the proposal in GRPE and then we commit to arelease, send it to the March 2025 session of WP 29 or we park it and wait for the next proposals to be agreed that I need to know still. Thank you.Yeah. Exactly. Bill. Yeah, thanks again. I mean, very much appreciate the flexibility shown from Japan. That is much appreciated. But I think it possibly worth just clarifying what could be a misunderstanding in thestatement in case anyone has been confused by it. The statement was made that the changes only affect level 1B. And in terms of technical demonstration of compliance, that is true. But, of course, those changes are also included in level 2. So in terms of type approval actions and transposition into regional or national legislation, it is significant. And I think from the OICA point of view, obtaining type approval is significant. But I don't think that we have the resources to make the changes to level 1B. I think the question is whether or not we have the material to make the changes to level 1B. I don't know if there is the technical demonstration of compliance that is true. But it is true. In the case of the typ approval, it is true. In the case of the typ approval, it is true. Inbut from everyone's point of view, I think the other side of the coin, the transposition burden was the significant thing, but as I say, very grateful that we appear to havecome to a sensible resolution. Thank you. Yes, yes, of course, the level 2 indeed isslightly affected. But I think we then take note of the flexibility of Japan with the remark how we put it in the notes, in the minutes. I think we should say that it is adopted andthat we will send it to the top 29 in March 2025. And if that is then so we have then a complete route. We face ourselves a little bit about the other documents, I think, but I thinkthis is that could be handled. But if we are not handle that, then we anyhow send this document to the 29 in the March 2025 session. So then I think it is clear also for the Japanese Delegationthat this document is adopted, will be sent to the 29, but if then the effort is then here in the group to make it in conjunction with all the other documents which are on the table.I think there is also hope also for the European Commission if that is yes. Okay. And also for Japan, it is okay? Okay. Good. Fine. Then is that the solution we have adopted then 2024/10and 2024/11 with the two informal documents. Congratulations, Japan. Then we have on regulation154, the informals, like the informal 10, it is the presentation from OICA, will be discussedat the next session. The future amendment plan will also come again in the next session. And then we have the informal Working Group GPE/10/11 which I understood also from Francois, thereis a revision 1 and there was a discussion at that time with OICA and France on the topics on that in the document. And I think this is reflected in revision 1. So who is able to introducethe okay. OICA, please, you have the floor. Can it be shown on the screen? Yes. So as said yesterday we had some discussions with France regarding the wording for the transitionalprovisions. So we updated the wording. You will see it in the revision 1 document. And the aim is that this transitional provisions are merged and included in the working documents2 and 3 that we had here regarding the let's say major updates for the 00 and 01 series with the new supplement and then including those transitional provisions for supplement 2. Andby having the transitional provisions it would allow the option or give the option if you go on slide 3 to still get extensions according to supplement 1 level to prevent, let's say, unnecessary retesting burden, e.g. , because of the reason of not having measuredthe alternate current during the type approval test which was for supplement 1 not mandatory and not necessary. And, of course, if you didn't measure the data you don't have it. You can't generate it. And then by doing an extension according to supplement 2 you could have theinterpretation that you would need to retest just because of that. This would be from myside, of course, if there are any questions, happy to answer. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Oika.Thanks, France, to work on this document. Other some questions? The floor is open. Okay. Thenwe can take this document also in the next session again to combine it with the others. So in principlewe are in line. European Commission. Thank you, Oika and thanks also to France for conductingthis discussion. I think in essence we can support the content that manufacturers would not be forced really to retest only for the purpose of measuring the current but in term of wordingand exact drafting maybe we will have some comments and happy to exchange as well with Oika and any other contracting party that would be interested. But I think as a concept we can support notthis exact wording necessarily. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. That's clear. So we will come back with the document in the next session and it is open for discussion again. So it is not that thecontent is a little bit already discussed but so but we will discuss it is open for commentsagain. Yeah. Okay. Then the next document is an informal document 19. That's the proposalfrom Sweden on the driver robots as well. There was some discussions yesterday and this document or new elements what will come will also be discussed at the next session. So everyone couldreflect on this and it is good to thank Sweden for bringing this topic here on board as well maybe also thinking of the relation with automated and connected vehicles. We do also the surveywith so there is some connection with that. But it is open for the next session. We comeback. And I think if we have done all the topics from 3A I think. Check also with Francois. Then the table you will send then the table as an informal document? Yeah. Okay. With the decisionwhat we have made. So everyone is then in the same line. Then to continue with Agenda Point3 we have 3B. It is the final table. Okay. Good. So less orange and that's correct. We can alsomake a decision there. Okay. Then go to Agenda Point 3B on the global technical regulation 15. We have a working document 2025/12 from OICA and an informal document 12. So I givethe floor to OICA to introduce these two documents. Bill, you have the floor. Yes, thank you. I think we may as well go straight to the informal document. It effectively replaces the workingdocument. Since circulation of the working document we have noticed some additional elements that needed to be included and we have had some limited feedback from other members of GRPE. And I thinkprobably it is fair to start with some of the background to this document. Back in October it was presented as a working document with a hope that it could be adopted. That wasn'ta strong hope but whatever there was hope there we decided to submit a working document. Probably the greatest formal hindrance to adoption is that we don't have a technical report for thisdocument. OICA have begun drafting a technical report but OICA cannot submit the technical report, cannot submit the document to AC3. So we are still looking for a contracting partyto do that. We were informed in a previous GRPE that the three candidates for potential contracting party are the EC who to date have been overwhelmed with work on Euro 7 and couldn't be approachedon this matter. Japan where we are still in discussions between OICA and Japan whether that would be a solution. And my particular favorite option would be the USA but I think it is relativelyinfeasible that U.S. proposes an amendment to GTR 15. So we still need to find a way forward. It is probably worth taking a little bit of time then to explain the content of the document.And there are two sides to that. One is that it is purely a formality. Somebody somewhere should keep the GTR up to date. And the GTR is getting considerably out of date. It is notterrible but there are significant elements of the GTR which are out of date particularly in comparison with regulation 154. And so as we have discussed in the last couple of dayshere, the content of 154 is still being updated, is being coordinated between the four series of amendments that we get. And that is another reason that it is fitting not to adopt changesto GTR 15 I believe in this session. We should make sure that everything is in a line between GTR 15 and the four series of amendments to Reg 154 and then we have that desired period of stability. So I think that's a good point. If anyone wishes to go into detail on any ofthe elements, as I say it is a working document that has been there for some time. We are prepared to have that discussion but I think it is probably not worth doing so in the plenary session of GRPE considering the background. The 2nd element of background here, what may be termedthe elephant in the room is in GTR 15 we have annex 13 which is the annex that addresses low temperature testing. Certainly my colleagues involved in the testing of electrified vehicleshave identified a number of elements where I suppose it would be fair to say the annex waswritten a little bit too quickly, was never really checked for the practicability of the test procedure and we have identified a number of elements that we and certainly some contracting parties ortheir technical services see a necessity to update that process. Our concept was that because inOctober the future of Euro 7 in the EU was still completely open we had really no concept of how low temperature testing, the future of low temperature testing would see in Europe. Since the adoption ofthe political act of Euro 7 back in December we now have a level of clarity of how low temperaturetesting in Europe should look. So another contributing factor, it would be sensible probably in the next session and probably after some sort of bilateral or more lateral discussions in Brussels we come with a consolidated amendment to GTR 15 including changes to annex 13 and then we can adopt the whole package in one shot. Hopefully I wouldsay particularly with the background of the time schedule of completing the legislative package of Euro 7 in the next session. So that's all from my side as I say. We are open to questions. If anyone wants to ask questions here I'm happy to address them otherwise approach me over the next two days here or contact me via e-mail. Thank you. Thank you Oika. Thank you Bill for this exercise and admire your work on this. I think you are completely right that we have the opportunity to participate in the Euro 7. We are open to questions, the questions are available on the website of the European Commission. If you have questions, please feel free to raise them here at the European Commission. We will do our best to answer them in the open session. Thank you. Thank you Oika. Thank you Bill for this exercise and admire your work on this. I think youhave to update and let GTR number 15 to the latest level and not that it will go behindwhat we already adopted and improved in the UN regulation 154. So by your activities and also the clearness to the cold test is one of a typical issue. So thanks for that, Bill,on your clear explanation on your task and the rationale with what you are doing. The floor is open. I see that the European Commission is asking for the floor. So, Jansin, you havethe floor. Thank you, Chair. And thanks, Bill. First of all, I would like to thank OICA a lot because I recognize that this is a lot of work to try and keep GTR 15 up to date and I thinkit's still very important even if for us as a contracting party since we have now UNR 154, of course, GTR 15 is somewhat less important but it's still a very good entrance door tothe WLTP world for any contracting party to the 1998 agreement and therefore I think it's important that we try and keep it up to date and usable for the foreseeable future. As youmentioned, Bill, this is not a lack of interest that we did not really have the possibility to scrutinize the document. It's really related to resources availability because 2023 was quiteeventful from our side but without committing to anything, we are happy to try and have a look at what OICA has prepared and potentially come back to you if we have questions and seehow in the short to midterm we could really do that exercise to ensure that GTR 15 is up to date. Now for what concerns Annex 13, of course, it is very important, especially forwhat you said regarding Euro 7 and European intentions for what concerns low temperature testing. I must say that up to now we have heard, it's not the 1st time we hear criticism from OICA on this procedure but we haven't seen any clear proposal or clear evidence onwhat might be an issue except that there might be issues in this Annex and I would say that we are indeed eager to listen from you to have some detailed explanation of what you think is wrong and should be corrected and you know where to reach out to come back to us but at thispoint in time I must say looking at my colleagues around but at least personally I'm not sure I havereceived any substantiated complaints about the elements of Annex 13. Thank you, Janssen. Ithink this is clear also to work together and to that the importance is that GTR 15 is up to date for all the other regions which will use the WLTP in their regional regulation. Thereforeit is important that GTR number 15 is indeed up to date. So it is good that this process is now starting and that we take time for improvements for the next session. So I hope that we havean improvement document for the GTR in the next one, in the next GOP session, one of the GOP sessions.I cannot say why that will be in the 1st one. Okay. If that is the case, then we can closeI think item 3B and then we have 3C on our agenda. I think we have no documents and no discussionson the GTR development for real driving emissions. So I think this is oh, I see AAPC. You have the floor. Thank you, Chairman. I know it was only one document but in the grand scheme ofthings this is just a drop in the ocean, the document 34, revision 1 that was tabled late. For us from AAPC perspective and Oike is there, it is very important for the GTR to be harmonizedwith the 154 and there is a lot of changes occurring in 154 and the GTR process is a very robust process. So it takes its time. This is just a simple amendment and as I said it is a dropin the ocean for basic reason at the 191st WP 29 session they adopted the GRP proposal for supplement 1 to 03 series of amendments to 154. This is the additional of the SAE standard inthe OBED. So in annex 11, appendix 1, paragraph 6532 we just wanted to align the GTR with regulation 154 by the additional of the SAE standard and so creating harmonization and this is for ourmembers in the U.S. under the 98 agreement is very important for this harmonization. As I said it is a drop in the ocean considering what Oike and the rest of the GTR has to gothrough. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you. Sorry that I missed your document. So I had it noton my list. It is my mistake. Should take this, of course, on my agenda. But even that I think this could be working and that's also the document you worked together with Oike with it as well.So also this SAE standard update is essential for the finalized update of the complete GTRnumber 15. So thank you for this document. Sorry about it. It is a little bit of cold, I think.And I think we have finished with oh, still a request for the floor. Didn't look up. Niels. Yes, good morning, everyone. Thank you, Chair. Just a remark to this proposal. So we supportthe change and yeah, that's we call it well, support the change. But we were looking at the F item and when we looked at the reference document, so the WP/29/2023/128, the referenceto the ISO 14229 well, 2013 is not there. So it doesn't seem to be yeah, it does not seem to be present. So we are wondering if it is correct like this. So if the well, maybe F shouldbe deleted and then well, it comes instead of the G, but just our eye fell on it and justthe question how this should be dealt with. Thank you. Yes, AAPC. Thank you, Netherlands, forthe question. Yes, indeed. The 2013 document has been overtaken by the 2020. And this is something that we note that it is not present in the 154 regulation because there are manyparts to it and this needs to be reviewed again. This is used in the U.S. But I think this is something that we need to revisit. But yes, 2013 is missing but this has been overtakenby the 2020 version of it which has a number of parts, up to seven parts have been created and this needs to be revisited. Whether it should be deleted, not at this precise moment.But we should revisit it with the rest of the documents under the GTR 15. Thank you. Okay.So anyhow, we will take notice when we discuss the new proposal from the amendment from GTR number 15. So this will then be included and see if everything is then still and correctupdated. So the remarks from the Netherlands is valid. So we have to take that good in considerationthat we are not making a mistake there again. Okay. So thanks again. Then I can now concludethat we are finished with agenda point 3. I think so. So best is to have now a coffee breakuntil 10:50 I will say. Coffee break until 10:50. If you are ready. So before we go to the heavyduty regulations on our agenda, agenda point 4, we want to bring to your attention the discussionwhat we had in the beginning yesterday before to let you know already now what our thoughtsare for the schedule for this year's GOP sessions, you know, January, May, October, but also thinkingabout the year after that, 2025. So we have said that we will come back to that on Friday, but there are some additional elements that also I think is important now to take into considerationabout the calendar schedules for also 2025. So I give the floor to Francois, because you know that we have also some restrictions about construction work here as well in the building.So everything is attached together. So I give the floor to Francois to update us about all these activities also in the Palais and what that is for affecting us in the schedule ofplanning our GPE sessions in the coming period. Indeed, yes, thanks, Mr. Chair. I think we want to bring that up with you now so there is a little bit of time to reflect and maybe we can decide later on. We don't have to decide now, but at least to bring that to your attentions thatwhat we do this year might have longer-term consequences. So we need to anticipate a bit that and try to plan as much as we can. So maybe 1st some conclusions from this year and lastyear's calendar. I think now it is quite important to notice that getting a slot for GPE in June will be complicated. I mean, we have been moved this year. I think last year there was already someissues. Probably next year will be the same. We have already been warned that the May, June, we will have very restricted as UNCE meeting room capacities during that period. So until the renovation of the Palais is completed, I think that would be very difficult for GPE toget good room and good slot in June. So, yes, you have the WHO, the World Health Organization Assembly, Labor Assembly, Human Rights Assemblies in May, June and usually until now they havehad priorities to get large rooms. And with the renovation, there will be a shortage of large room meetings. Also the early January meeting slot as we have seen this year can bringsome unexpected outcomes with the limited services that we have this week. I just show here the work planning, the renovation planning. So, yes, this building E, I don't know if you can see it. So the closure will start in July. Of course, the dates are all provisional and probablybe moved, extended a bit more. But basically, yes, the work will continue until I think the end of 2026 at least. So if we have a session in October 2024, which now seems likely, thiswould have an impact on the January 2025 session because, of course, then the deadline for January 2025 would be 15 of October 2024. So even before the October session. So that means potentially we would not have a lot of working documents to consider in January 2025 and I think we haveto also start anticipating that. So, yes, we have discussed with the leadership here, I think we have maybe two options again to offer you and to maybe start the discussions. We can have more options but those are the two that we think might be a good starting point for the discussion.Option A is the current proposal from the WP 29 Secretariat for the 2025 calendar. So right now what they are proposing is 7/10 January. So a week similar to this one where we would be maybe probably quite lonely in the ballet with the deadline as I said 15 of October 2024and the 2nd session is expected 3 to 6 of June and I think maybe the 2nd of June is a bank holiday in some countries with the deadline on the 11 of March 2025. With the caveat thatthis June slot again might be moved without our us being consulted. So that's why maybewe would maybe like to propose an option B, to shift a bit the calendar of GRP meetings. I mean, for the last I think as far as Andre could have remembered, GRP has always been January and June. So this would be quite a change for the GRP and its stakeholders. But maybe to move it a bit aroundat least during the time of the renovation with maybe so we have worked already with the 2025 calendar of WP29 and WP1 and WP11 families, so everything that is under Walter's responsibilities to makesure we don't have overlap. So we have identified potentially the 25 to 28 of March 2025 as a potential 1st session for GRP in 2025 with the deadline end of December, so just beforethe New Year's Eve. And the 2nd session potentially 30 September to 3rd of October 2025 with the deadline just before the summer break. So we want to put that on the table right now and maybe I'lllet the Chair start the discussions. Thank you. Yeah, what Francois said, I'm already here atGRP sessions almost 30 years. The 1st one was in 1994. So it was always that we have the meetings in January and in June. So indeed if we change that, that's a revolution. But we can also do it as atemporary activity. So it's not needed that we will stick with an Option B. But it is not a necessityto change. But I will bring this to the GPE as an option to shift a little bit later because we are a little bit struggling with the facilities and maybe as well next year we have to move from June to May and we are inthe same situation as this year which I think is not convenient for everyone. Yeah, we can have a discussion now but I think this is new. Maybe you have a little bit to reflect. It is not a necessity that we havefinalized it now. But I will that's already discussed on the May and October session for this year. What we all discussed we will come back to on Friday. So let it a little bit lend by you and to see what isyour advice for us to go forward. We don't want to take our decisions on our own. We will takethat together as a GPE team. So I see the hand from Bill, OICA. Yeah, thanks, Andre. Just for thoseconsiderations, I noticed that the in the Option 1 there, the submission date for January session would be before the planned October session of GRPE which would make it impossible to react to decisions inthe October session with papers for the January session. Is there a level of or could we have alevel of flexibility there or is that a hard and fast rule, the date there? What I think to be able toadopt working documents, they need to be translated in the free UN languages ideally and to do that we need to submit them times in advance, 12 weeks in advance more or less with very little flexibilityaround this. But yeah, I think there is not much around this 12 weeks deadline that we have if we want documents to be adopted. There has been exceptions for the very large documents but usuallythere is a world limit but because we are a treaty body at WP29, we can and this is regulatory work,the world limit is lifted. But usually, yes, there is very little flexibility around this 12 weeks'deadline. So take a thought. We will do oh, France. Thank you, Chair. I would have two questions onthese options. On Option B, this would mean that we wouldn't aim for the June 2025 WP29 but the Novemberone, is that right? Second question. With these dates in Option B would be assured that we are pursuing the rule of not having two GRs at the same time so that Delegates can attend both. Thank you.So indeed, yeah, for the 1st session in Option B, the documents that would be adopted there would go to the November session of WP29 and then for the 2nd session they would go to the March of the following year. And indeed, yeah, we would make sure that there is no overlap of GRs but there would bethen consecutive GRs weeks. Normally we try to leave one week blank between two GRs but in that case that would not be possible anymore. Yeah. So we have not much flexibility for the dates because that isalso in the schedule with all the other GRs, the other groups. So we cannot shift there a lot. Sothese are the two possibilities to take on our list, to keep it or to make this opportunity to shiftour meetings. And indeed, yeah, we have to follow the time when we can submit the documents to WP29and indeed, when we have March, end of March, we go to November, WP29. Okay. If there are no directlyconsiderations now, we will discuss it on Friday and make there a final I hope a final decision what todo. Okay. Then go to agenda point 4, heavy duty. And we have two working documents from regulation 49for proposals from OICA on the 0506 series for permitting to use hydrogen in the internal combustionengine as well as an amendment for the 06 series with some including the measurement method forammonia. So we have the document 2024/13 and 2024/14. The 13 is on the 05 series and the 14 is of 07series. And I give the floor to OICA to introduce the two working documents. OICA, you have the floor.Who is taking the mic? Okay. Good morning, everybody and thank you, Chair. So I would like to explain aboutthe two working documents. So the 2024/13 and 2024/14. And so basically the last year, so the 1st emission measurement for hydrogen internal combustion engine was adopted. And it was an amendment of R49. But so it was coveredonly 07 series. It is the latest version of E06. So the two working documents today is to extend this emission measurement method for hydrogen engine to 05 series and 06 series.series. And how to extend this, so at 1st I explained about so 06 series is very easybecause it is the old version of 06, structure is the same, just copy the 07 series to the A06 series. And for 05 series contains several level of emission regulation, therefore it isa little bit more complicated, but so which part should be how we can modify is already explained in the last GRP in detail. So I think today I think it is not necessary to go in detailabout this. And so by the amendment, so basically the emission measurement method for hydrogen internalcombustion engine, so it could cover not only Euro 6 but also Euro 5 and Euro 4 and Euro 3 levels. Andwe think it is beneficial for the country which is adopting such a level of emission regulation. Sothis is my explanation. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, OICA. The floor is open.Thank you, Chair. From the European Commission side, the exercise done with thepure hydrogen engines was focused on Euro 6 stage for those engines and validated on the methodologiesand requirements for that stage of approval. So now going back to previous levels, good needfor the assessment from our perspective. So we welcome the proposal and we are eager to look into it. However,the acceptance would contradict the philosophy that we have followed until now. Thank you. Does it meanthat the Commission is thinking that the document is controversial for what is done previously? So maybe can you clarify a little bit what you are thinking then on the proposal for the future? Thank you again, Chair. Yes,just to be more clear, it needs further scrutiny before we can accept the document as it is. OICA.Good morning to everyone. Thanks for the floor. It is my opinion that at least for 49.06, we don't see particular reasonsfor postponing the adoption of the proposal due to the fact that as my colleague explained before, the proposal is a copy and paste of what has been already done for 49.07. So I think that could be adopted in this session.As far as the proposal relating to 49.05, given the fact that we are speaking about an old series of amendments and all the requirements that are not in place anymore for Europe, yes, it could be worth to have some validation phase, I don't know, as Ricardo proposed, but yes, we can discuss this. But I really don'tknow if it is really needed. But we are open to discuss this. Anyway, for 49.06, I think that could be adopted in this session. This is my opinion. Thank you. Thank you again, Chair. Thank you, OICA. Yes, I think we can discuss it over the coffee break and come back to you with a reply on this. But it makes a lot of sense what OICA is saying. Yes, indeed. Itis only the amendment from the '05 and '06 series and we are already of the '07. So it is only copy/paste more or less into the correct format for these old series of amendments. But okay. Take over the lunch in depth if there are some consequences for the European Commission. Otherwise, I hope that we can adopt it. ButI see the floor from Germany. Hello, everybody. I just want to point out as well the same direction as OICA explained, that the 49.06 is not such an old emission stage. It is also covering Euro 6 level with the Euro 6 stagestages A, B, C and D while the '07 of our 49 covers Euro 6 stage E and emission limit wise in the test procedure on the test bench we are speaking about the same limits to be applied and the difference between 6D and 6E only attributed to the way how a PEMS testing is evaluated and how Aand B has to be described but anything else is more or less equal just for information for further discussion during the coffee break, hopefully with coffee. Yes. Okay. That's a good remark that the '06 series is very close to the existing requirements. Okay. Otherreflections from Italy. Antonio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, all of you. In line with the previous speakers Italy would like to support these proposals at least the one on the '06 series of amendments and we are talking about alternative fuels. We are talking about the possibility to improve the environmental footprint and I think that technically speaking at leastthe '06 series of amendments would perfectly suit also with this amendment. So if I may suggest we should I think follow the suggestion by OIC and Germany and try to at least include the '06 series of amendments. Thank you. Thank you, Antonio. It is important that these kind of alternative fuels could come into the market and indeed essential also that the '05 and '06 series andspecific O6 series is also amended and to make possible to test an internal combustion engine driven with the fuel hydrogen. Okay. What we do is to postpone a little bit theadoption to give it some food for thought and that after the lunch break we come backto this document. Then we have an informal document 18 from OICA on the latest activityspecific related to dual fuel. So I give the floor to OICA to present informal document 18.So thank you, Chair, for the possibility to have this presentation here. Informal doc about the R49 change sorry. I need to switch to the 1st page. Okay. For dual fuel. So similartopic we discussed in the past two documents. And as you remember last year in January weadopted the mono fuel for the R49 series 7 and there it was clearly requested to include alsoin the next step the dual fuel content into this regulation. And in OICA we discussed onhow to do that and what would be the next step and I want to introduce that to you how we areplanning to do that and what are the next possible steps. So dual fuel actually exists alreadyin the R49 regulation. Diesel and natural gas. So this is already included. Now we want toinclude also a dual fuel type for H2IS for H2 and for that we are proposing to go for stepor type 1A which is makes the most sense and where we actually have the 1st technologiesavailable on a prototype level that we can also test that. On vector side this technologycan be also included with the next amendments so that we have the possibility to have thisalso included as a zero emission vehicle. We did not include the type 2 and type 3 variants as there is currently no technology available and was not requested on OICA level. So thiscan be done if needed but then we would need to have also the technology to test in the work with JSC and commission to validate on how this is working and if this is properly working.In our proposal we want to come up with, we want to update also from a wet measurement to a dry measurement and we would need to have also the inclusion of the technologies to measurethat, what would mean FTIR and so on. Okay. So more or less the adoptions which need tobe made would be in the Annex 15 to adopt the equations, the verification of this technologyand would be made or would be needed to make on lab level and probably also on vehicle level. From OICA point of view we would need, we would not need to have a further vehicle measurementas the water content would be lower but this would need to be discussed with JSC and the commission. Ricardo, we can have a discussion on that. But on the current status, data isalready available on this technology at JSC and is undergoing evaluation currently. So we need to discuss the next steps on that and what would be the requirements to have this includedinto the regulation. For the next steps, we thought the next session in May will take placebut a working document would be planned for October if that is possible. We need to discuss that also with JSC on how to do that and if that would be possible. But that is what wasplanned in the last year, end of last year and we need to negotiate that. So these are the next steps. I think the support for hydrogen dual fuel is very strong and required also fromthe Member States and representatives here. So important step also to include further technologiesto be more technology open in the R49 and just if there are some questions, we can discussthis also in the break later on and see what are the next steps more or less. Okay. Thankyou very much. Thank you. The floor is open for any questions. European Commission. Thankyou, Chair and thank you, OICA, for the presentation. More a comment than a question from our side. So we acknowledge the work that OICA is carrying out in this sense and indeed we are alreadyworking with them along the same lines we did with the pure hydrogen engines before. The processis ongoing. Being able to produce a working document for the October session I think is a little bitprecipitated or ambitious I would say because we need to introduce new methods for measurement of water, for instance. Still we are working towards that end. So it looks promising as Fredrick wassuggesting the elements that we can take on board already from previous work. We are glad to read that OICA had an internal agreement on which engines have to be covered. So for us this is new. So it is important that we have the scope and also it would be important that we have the agreement hereat the GRP that there is agreement on following this path so that we have still a lean approach where certain type of engines are not included within the scope for this revision that we are trying to dofrom our side. Our side from the Commission side we would agree with this approach though. Thank you very much, Ricardo. So good to know and good to hear and we will see how we proceed and define the nextsteps in the next month. Yes, so it is promising that there is some support towork also on the dual fuel technology and also the okay you restrict it to one technology which is nowcrucial for the industry and you can go further if needed if this kind of technology is also needed but maybe that's a good approach to start with the most requested technology and which is already inthe place so we have some information on that. I don't know if it is a zero emission vehicle because the diesel is injected I think for sparking but okay that's another discussion what should be done on the European level with that kind of definitions but indeed the technology how to test these vehiclesis important and good to take these on board. Maybe you know that I was very active in working on the dual fuel LPG and network gas proposals even also for the rate of fit but it is also good to see nowthat also this technology is now coming up for hydrogen as well so the injectors now are feasible for this technical for working also with hydrogen so pleased to see that. Okay, thank you Oika forpresenting this and okay we follow you in the next steps and see when you come with informal documents in the GOP on this topic. Thank you very much. Thank you very much Chair for that and we will come up andinform you. So look around if there are some other issues not then we can finish I think agenda item 4Aand we can continue with 4B but I see there we have no documents, 4C on the provision for fueleconomy. We have nothing there. Do we miss something? There is one, not on my list but38. Okay, so give the floor to Oika to introduce informal document 38, I don't know, what they wish.I would like to explain the information of Oika activity for heavy duty fuel economy harmonization.Okay. Next slide, please. So far, so the harmonized activity or the regulation for emission of fuelconsumption, so already completed in light duty. So heavy duty we have such a regulation for emissionbut the very important, so the regulation like the fuel consumption is not so started yet. And sohowever, so fuel efficiency regulation or greenhouse gas regulation is already initiated in several countries but the measurement method is different from the country to country. So this place, the big burden forthe manufacturers, so for the vehicle development and Oika has started the promotion of this harmonizationand so held at the workshop in GRP and so they propose the development of harmonization, so activityin GRP. But so due to the impact of the COVID or some other higher priority issues in each country, sowe couldn't find the 1st sponsor, so which initiated the harmonized activity in GRP. But so now the UnitedNations activity returned to the situation before the COVID, so Oika would like to propose activity to promotethe harmonization of fuel efficiency again. So now Oika considering two activities, one is the organized meeting,so by the expert again, so more than five years ago we had the investigation of regulation, fuel efficiencyin each area and how different and what's the subject to have a harmonization. So we would like to update basedon the recent situation in each area. It is the 1st one that we would like to organize the expert meeting.And the 2nd , so based on this, so we would like to organize the workshop again in GRP to discuss aboutso how do we proceed the harmonization in the future. Next slide, please. So for the expert meeting, we areconsidering the timings around, say, March and April of this year and by web meeting and the member, so considering the industry, the research center, the Governmental Research Center and the related stakeholders.And so basically that's by the expert, but always it is very welcome to the participation by the Governmental People. And the items are like so sharing the recent situation on the regulations. And we would like to investigate and summarize the current situation. And sofor workshop, so we are considering the timing of the 2nd , 3rd and the GRP this year. But so as we had information from our Secretariat, so it depends on the GRP situation. We would like to talk with the Secretariat Chairman as to which GRP is appropriate for this. And the members, the Governmental stakeholders, and 1st we would like to report theresult of the expert meeting. Also we would like to discuss about how do we proceed with the harmonization process. Thank you for your attention and thank you to give us the opportunity to explain this. So this is my explanation. Thank you.Thank you, Oika. And thank you to come back with this topic which is important. Indeed we are struggling a little bit with this topic, specific after COVID. But good to bring this again to our attention and that you are willing to start the harmonization process on the heavy duty fuel efficiency.Which is at the moment not harmonized. And this is one of our topics here in the GRP to try to harmonize as much as possible. But it is, yeah, indeed a little bit difficult. A difficult situation if everyone is set and you are going to harmonize afterwards. But it is good to start with the workshop to see what is going on now in the globe, in the differentregions. So I'm very pleased that you take the opportunity to start with such a workshop after you have this kind of expert meeting. So for me it is positive that this is put again on the table. I have some 1st responses already. United Kingdom.Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Oika, for proposing the meeting and workshop. Just a quick question. Would the plan also be to explore energy consumption and range determination, harmonization of heavy duty vehicles as well as fuel economy? Thank you.Are you asking about what kind of vehicle is covered? No. Apologies if I wasn't clear. So the question was whether you would also be considering range determination for electrified heavy dutyvehicles and energy consumption within the scope of this work or would it be solely related to fuel consumption of combustion engine vehicles? Okay. Thank you. That's thank you for your very good question. It is a very important point. So in past we consider internal combustion engine. But now there's the vehicle becomes more and more important. It should bediscussed. We are very happy to discuss about that in the expert meeting also workshop. Thank you. The floor is open for any reflections. Of course, we have to organize a little bit depending on what we do with the GOP and the possibility for workshops in conjunction with the GOP. So we can take that on board maybe on Friday as well. European Commission. Thank you, Chair. And thanks,for this informal document. We take note of the request from OICA and we will see how and if we can support the workshop. I must say it was just uploaded yesterday. I think as an informal document it was a bit difficult to prepare but I take it back and can come back to the group when this is next discussed. Yeah, thanks for the positive reply. Yeah, this is not the 1st time that we have this on the agenda and at that time it was a little bit strugglingbecause of the different activities in the region, specifically also in Europe that doesn't fit at that time. But good to bring this again and to see what's going on and what we can harmonize as much as possible in the methodology for measuring the fuel efficiency of heavy duty trucks and buses. I know it is not an easy topic.Therefore, a workshop to give the landscape of it is very helpful and to see where we can attribute to harmonization because that is one of our main topics, even in maybe not now but in the future. So step by step. Yeah, okay. Thank you, OICA, for bringing this again on our list because it is already in our priority or was in our list. I think that this topic was a white spot. Andso, this should be filled in when possible. Then if I'm correct, we are done with agenda point 4 if I'm not mistaken. Sorry about that. And then look to the yep, next is agenda point 5, I don'tif we have a lot of oh, yeah, we have a working document, for sure, for a proposed amendment for the regulation 85 on net power. It is the working document 2024/15. I give the floorto OICA to introduce this working document. Thank you, Chair. As members will know, regulation 85 covers internal combustion engines but also the electric motors used in the powertrain whena powertrain has a single electric motor. And it is effectively what we have got is a historical situation. When the measurement of electric motors was brought in, a lot of the text from the regulationwas copied from that for combustion engines. And this proposed amendment just covers the table of auxiliaries to be fitted when determining net power, maximum 30 minute power of electricdrive trains. And we see in footnote 1 to the table the original text for combustion engines that the radiator, the fan, the water pump and the thermostat shall be located on the testbench in the same relative position as on the vehicle. And cooling liquid circulation shall be activated by the drive train water pump only. That is, of course, totally logical becausethe auxiliaries have a contribution to the power that is delivered by the powertrain, not by the engine in isolation of the auxiliaries but by the engine in context of its element inthe powertrain. When we come to electric motors, however, of course it is common practice that a component such as a liquid cooling pump is electrically driven. And when it is electricallydriven it doesn't have any influence on the power that is delivered by the electric motor. And in that case it is quite pointless and obviously disruptive to installation on thetest bed to have to have that cooling pump in exactly the same place as it would have been positioned on the vehicle. So we propose to introduce this text in the case that a liquid cooling pump is electrically driven, an external circuit including pump, radiator and thermostatin relative positions which differ from those in the vehicle can be used provided the pressure loss of the circuit and/or the volume flow of the pump remains substantially the same as those of the drive train cooling system. So the cooling influence remains the same. It justbasically says it doesn't matter where the components are positioned and effectively how they are powered also. So that's the full content of the proposed amendment in our opinion fullytotally technically justified and a good reduction of burden to future testing. Thank you. Thankyou, Bill. I'm just taking over briefly. So thank you for that explanation. I'll open the floor for any comments and any points of clarification or questions. It sounds a sensible approachto me. I guess providing that ensuring pressure loss and volume flow of the pump remains substantiallythe same, that should ensure comparable, that the results are comparable. But any commentsfrom contracting parties or others? Everyone clear on that? I can't see any requests forthe floor. Okay. And I think I'm right in saying that this was an informal, the previous session?Yes, it certainly was. So we can move to adopt that? Yes? Okay. Thank you. And so I just needto I think that was the only item under agenda I have France, please. Thank you, Chairman. Francewould just like to address a question on this agenda item and that's on regulation 143 onthe fuel retrofit. Just for information, dear GRP experts, we have a great demand for a retrofit ofvehicles to dual fuel use but not as described here as we have it in the scope of the regulation 143.But rather, this is for light vehicles. So for the time being, we have adopted a national frameworkbut if other contracting parties also face this kind of demand for a retrofit of the LQ for light vehicles, then France would be pleased to be able to hold an exchange and see whether we can have somesort of harmonized approach to these issues. Thank you. Thank you, France. Thank you, LOD. That's auseful suggestion, I think. Sweden. Thank you, LOD and France. We also have requests for these kind ofvehicles. So I would be interested to have an exchange on this, to have a harmonized approach for this.Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else being requested for similar approaches? I think I was going to sayI can't see the UK but anyone else would be interested in an exchange on that topic? Italy, I can see.Yes, thank you very much to France for bringing this item on the table. Yes, in the past we have received some requests. Of course, the answer has been negative because the regulation is limited in scope. AndI would be interested indeed to have at least an exchange of views on how to make this regulation evolvingand maybe to cover also LOD vehicles. Thank you. Thank you, Italy. Did I see Spain requesting the floor?Thank you, Chair and thank you, France, for bringing up this issue. So we would also be interested in having an exchange on this topic. Thank you. Thank you. It seems to be growing interest. SoFrance, do we have a suggestion or do you want to take some time and reflect and maybe get intouch with those who have expressed an interest and organize? Thank you for the suggestion and I wouldlike to thank those contracting parties who have shown an interest in this and I do think indeedthat the idea of getting in touch with each other to exchange on what we have in our different countries and what we might do at the UN would be a useful one. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Well,hopefully we can organize a meeting to discuss that. It would be a useful initiative, I think, andensure that we have a harmonized approach that allows for those sort of retrofits. Okay. That's I think unless there is any other points. Oika, please take the floor. Yes, thank you, Duncan. We have aninformal paper, paper 37, which is predominantly related to Reg 85 but it is listed as agenda item 15. Is that a conscious decision that we discuss it under agenda item 15? We as Oika can take it atany time. Paper 37, informal 37, yes. Power determination, yeah. No, that would seem to fitwell with the current discussion. So can we take that now? Happy for you to introduce that. Yeah,certainly then. I should do just that. If we have it on the screen. I can start with the presentation.It is fairly simple textual thing. We already go to slide 2 exactly, yeah. So in several sessions of GRPE over the last few years, we have raised a number of questions regarding the sort of the sense andsensibility, I could say, of regulation 85 itself, but also the future of Reg 85 and a number of other associated regulations. Perhaps I should say at the beginning of this, what I'm presenting here is verydominated by light duty vehicle considerations and members, but it is I think people will understanda complete cross-segment issue. So we have also got, as we have mentioned a couple of times in the last couple of days, that the EU has adopted its 1st legal act for EU7. In that, whereas Euro 6 refersto engine power, the wording used in EU7 is power determination. It has always been relatively clear from statements of the commission that there is an intention to integrate GTR 21 or at least itscontents into European legislation and probably with the timing of EU7. So what we have thought really since the June session is that it would probably be a good idea to get people together for a reallyopen almost a brainstorming session to get the actual experts on such issues to sit around and actually talk about what is necessary, what are the failings of the current situation, and to coin a Brusselsterm, how to make better regulation. So just for a couple of examples of what we identify if we go on to the next slide, please, we have got an issue where we have got regulation 85 which covers light duty andheavy duty vehicles and it covers pure electric vehicles that have got a single electric motor andHEVs. Whereas GTR 21 which is light duty only covers PEVs that have multiple electric motors and it covers HEVs. So we have got a sort of mismatch of scope. We have got bits where you could expect an overlap anddon't have it. You have got bits where there is probably no overlap necessary and we do have it.The next point which is massively insignificant but it leaps out as a difference is that regulation 85 which covers light duty and heavy duty determines an entire power curve for internal combustion engines but onlya peak power for electric power trains. You might even consider that if for an electric power train you only need a peak power, perhaps you only need a peak power in the future for combustion engines. It isone of the ideas that could be discussed. And when we have got differences between the scopes of reg 85 and GTR 21 in the vehicles and the technical differences between vehicle categories. So anotherthing that we believe is worthy of discussion. And then a point that we have made in a couple of GRPEs,I guess it is particularly internal combustion engine but there is no reason why it shouldn't affect electric power trains. There are a number of issues and there are effectively two sides of it. There is what you may term as a general terminology, power on demand, where you can offer to the customer eitherunder certain conditions or with an additional price, either permanently or temporarily a different engine power. And what came out in the discussions towards Euro 7 in Brussels was the concept that certainlyunder some exhaust emission regimes for internal combustion engines you may have to restrict the power output of the engine under certain conditions, typically, e.g. , cold to temperature conditions but there are other high load conditions in order to ensure that you meet the emissions conditions.And because Reg 85 has very or at least relatively strict static conditions for measurement of power,it doesn't necessarily allow approval of such issues. And I think it is worth discussing between industry and authority whether we need to be able to allow such approvals or on the other side of that coin ifthere is no need to make it clear in the legislation that the vehicle is still legally approved even though such elements have not been tested. So as I say, another example of something for discussion.We have had a think and again this is very light duty centric but thinking of the alternatives that we could see for the future and from the light duty side we see three alternatives. We retainregulation 85, sorry, I'm on the next slide. One option would be to retain Reg 85 and then transposethe GTR 21 into either a UNR or what recent discussions have brought up amongst manufacturers. Possibly we don't need a UNR for it. We could transpose it in Brussels and then wait until othercontracting parties see the need for harmonization. The next option would be to integrate GTR 21 into Reg 85 which obviously opens the door for harmonization of scope and other testing requirements andelimination of inconsistencies. And then the 3rd option we saw was to create a new UNR which covers both the contents of Reg 85 so we start effectively with a clean piece of paper on power determinationand include in that new UNR the contents of GTR 21. I say they are the basics from the light duty point of view. We know from years of experience in GRPE there are massive similarities between test proceduresin regulation 85 and regulation 24. So although it's not a power determination for the majority of vehicles in Reg 24, it could be a consideration to consider that. And then of course we have got our heavy dutycolleagues within OICA and to some extent outside of OICA, the nonroad and other related industries,perhaps agricultural vehicle industries where we could consider I believe elements such as regulation 120 but there are certainly other regulations that could be considered. So yeah, that's the backgroundto it all. And so OICA believes that particularly if we have a May session because from our point of view we believe the May session that we have discussed would have almost perfect timing for coordinatingthis discussion with the development of the technical acts for Euro 7. If it were to happen, it would present some time for such issues and if it was a UN-centric event, then we would have the best chanceof getting the right technical experts around the table to have this discussion. But by whatever means and respecting all the views of GRPE, we think it is worthwhile as soon as possible really to have a half day workshop to get the relevant experts together and talk about the future of power determination sothat we can harmonize and as I said before, create better regulation. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, OICA, for that proposal. Certainly sounds like a very fertile ground for betterregulation which I think we are all here to achieve. Any comments from the floor? Any questions,thoughts? Do people think that would be a good thing for GRPE to tackle? There was a reference tothe EU's stated intention of integrating GTR 21. Commission, please. Thank you, Vice Chair and thankyou, OICA, for this document and for the presentation. I start maybe with a nitpicking point. It is not entirely correct to say that Euro 7 has been adopted. We are still in the process and I take the opportunity to announce that today there was a vote at the MVP Committee in the European Parliament. It was afavorable vote. We are one step closer to adoption but we are not there yet. We still need a couple more votes in the Council and in the Parliament but in any case, we do have quite a precise idea of whatEuro 7 is going to look like. What was presented is essentially correct. We do welcome this activityand I'm thankful for the examples that were presented. Some of these discussions we had already in Brussels.We agree that it is important to cover new concepts. Particularly for me it is interesting this power on demand element which is a good example of the kind of new technologies that we could expectand it is important that our regulation is future proof. In that sense, we can support and we welcome the organization of such a workshop which would be helpful for Euro 7 purposes and perhaps the Maydate would be the most advantageous if we are looking at the planning of Euro 7 implementation work whichis really it is coming very fast and October might be already too late. So thanks again to OICA and supportto have such a workshop with a strong preference for May and also a strong preference for the virtualformat. It needs to be or at least hybrid. It doesn't necessarily have to beeven hosted in Geneva. We could think of hosting it in Brussels potentially even but the hybrid, thepossibility to have a hybrid participation is essential. Thank you. Thank you. That's very clear and goodthat it is supported as a proposal. Anyone else? Japan? Yes, please. Thank you for the introduction. InJapan, the correlation between the UNR 585 and the GTR 21 is investing. It cannot be determined at thistime whether it can be incorporated into the UNR 585. Therefore, it is difficult now to reach a conclusionto May and discuss it at the workshop at the next GRP in Japanese circumstances, I think.Sorry. So just so I'm clear on that comment, you are saying it would be difficult to hold a workshop in May? I think the idea of the workshop would be just to come together and discuss ideaspossible way forwards. We wouldn't need to have a clear position. Would you be happy for a May workshop?Yes. It is difficult to determine just now to hold the next GRP workshop in Japan's position. Yes. Okay.Thank you. Commission? We understand the concerns of Japan but maybe they could be mitigated if weemphasize the brainstorming nature of the workshop as proposed by OICA. Really there would be nocommitments coming out of such a workshop but still we think it would be a useful discussion to have.Also, again, we emphasize the hybrid nature of the meeting is important. It needs to work for severaltime zones and to avoid unnecessary travel. But, of course, for Japan and the other contracting partiesto consider. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I think the proposal is very much just to come together andbrainstorm as a good word. Just have a think about ideas and possible ways forward. OICA has mentioned some three options but I'm sure there are other thoughts that could come out of that discussion.But it sounds to me certainly that it is an area which is ripe for discussion. So hopefully we couldarrange something along those lines. I can't remember the hybrid option but, yes, if we can do a hybridoption, then that would certainly be the preference so we get the maximum participation. So any othercomments? I think we are Germany. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much to OICA for bringing this issue up on the table. And we think there are several issues to be discussed and to think aboutas well on ICEs as on electric motors. So we would welcome to have such a workshop. And I think we do not expect any solution already to be ready on this workshop. It is just a way to have some ideas. Sothank you very much. Thank you, Germany. So I think we are due to discuss plans for later sessionstomorrow. And so I guess I would urge everyone just to maybe over dinner tonight have a think aboutwhat your preferences would be for workshops. We have got a few suggestions now and timings and we will have hopefully a fruitful discussion about that tomorrow, tomorrow morning and try and finalizesome plans. Okay. So we will move to agenda item 6, I think. So agricultural and forestry tractors, nonroadmobile machinery. And here we have two formal documents, 2024/16 and 2024/17. And two informals,90, GRP, 90/13 and 90/14. So Euromot, I think we are expecting to be presenting these. Did you wantto come up to the podium? Aha, you are already here. Thank you. Excellent. I will hand over to you to present these. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, today I would like to give you a quick presentation on Euromot'swork to amend R96/9/120 following on from the informal documents that we brought to the previous session.Just to recap the guiding principles of the work that we have been doing, the main objective is that we are trying to achieve is to allow the type approval of hydrogen internal combustion engines for nonroad mobile machinery, agricultural and forestry tractors. And whilst we are doing this, one of thekey objectives for us was to preserve the outcome of the EU and OICA amendments to R49. So this is maintaining a lean approach to the proposal with minimum necessary changes and also only including technical concepts that had been accepted in the R49 amendment. But whilst we are doing this, we alsoneeded to respect the differences between R96 and R49 in terms of the scope of machinery that they coverand how their formats are laid out and also being conscious of international developments that are ongoing in nonroad mobile machinery emission calculations for alternative carbon free and low carbon fuels. So these are happening at ISO as well as in the U.S. Just to provide a quick bit oforientation with the documents that we have submitted, I won't go through the previous sessions in formal documents but for today we have got document 2024/16 which is a consolidation of two previous informal documents, both the technical amendments and the administrative amendments. In this document we havegot some small additional modifications in there to address some comments we received in the previous session. We have then got document 2024/17 which consolidates again administrative and technicalamendments to the R120 document and then GRP90/13 which is an informal document that we have submitted for today that updates the R120 proposal. In this we caught a small error that we had made in theprevious submission. So we have brought this informal document to correct that. Okay. So on to the R96topic. So between the previous session and today we have had some meetings with contracting parties.There were some comments raised at the previous session that we wanted to address. The two mainchanges that came out of that discussion were to annex 3 under the fuel type codes. So where our original proposal had all hydrogen engines coded as T after discussion we have modified that to align fullywith our 49s that we have separate codes for SI engines and CI engines with either gaseous or liquified fuel. But just to point out that in the context of R96 that the distinction betweengaseous and liquified fuels is really fairly irrelevant as it is based, the definition is based on the state of the fuel as it is injected to the cylinder rather than the storage format. But the codes are in therefor alignment anyway. I think that's the correct way to proceed. The other main change was in annex 4with some of the text describing the zirconia sensor for measurement of FR. It was an omission in the Euromark document in the 1st place. We have added the text shown here to fully align with R49 and ISO8178 which just states that the sensor manufacturer can give you some calibration guidance. The onlyother change was some general paragraph numbering. Sorry, not the only other change. There is one other minor amendment that we made to the R96 proposal in that the table for the reference fuel hydrogen wasmodified slightly. The original table in the informal document came from ISO 8178 and we have changed that to align with R49 purely in the formatting and in some of the footnotes. So all of those changeshave been incorporated in 24/16. So moving on to R120, the change that we have made here is to align better with R85. So in paragraph 5, the power correction factor, we have added the option forturbo charged engines that can allow compensation for ambient temperature and altitude, the correction factor alpha A and also alpha delta, which is a small typo in this presentation, can be set to a valueof 1. So allowing a manufacturer not to double correct for temperature and altitude in a system that is already doing so on the dyno. The other modification in R120 was again similar to R96,the alignment of the hydrogen reference fuel specification table in the formatting and the footnotes. So on to further actions, EUROMOT is committed and is continuing to engage with otherstakeholders on developing a globally harmonized universal solution to facilitate testing for nonroad, rail, marine and stationary applications using hydrogen as well as other low and net zerocarbon fuels. We will in due course bring further proposals to GRP when these developments mature. So we are actively working in ISO 8178 to develop these. We are watching the developments that are happeningin the U.S. for the zero carbon fuels and we are following OICA's development of dual fuel hydrogenmethodologies with interest. So yeah, that's the end of the presentation. Thank you.Thank you. There's a huge amount of work being done there over I'm not sure how long it's been actually. I know it's a lot of work and it's really welcometo enable us to have this option of zero carbon hydrogen power to be introduced. So thank you for that and thank you for your clear presentation of these two informal sorry, formal proposals. I willopen the floor for any comments. I know there's been a you know, it's been discussed at the previous session andthat you've worked closely to address Contractor Party comments and concerns. United Kingdom, I can seewanted to take the floor. David. Thank you. Thank you very much for leading this work. We are supportive of this amendment. We see this is quite an important change. Already in the U.K. we have hydrogencombustion engines operating in on road mobile machinery and we think it would be very useful to have a harmonized approach available for approval of those to ensure we are sufficiently controllingthe emissions. So we are supportive of adoption at this session. Thank you. Thank you, U.K. Did I seeItaly? Antonio. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and thank you to Euromot for submitting this proposal and also for their presentation about the content of them. Also Italy supports the process whichtraditionally is let's say started by Euromot to amend Regulations 96 and 120 and we believe that theintroduction of the use of hydrogen is to be taken on board. Therefore, full support from our side. Thankyou. Thank you, Italy. France. Thank you, Chairman. France would like to join the U.K. and Italy tosupport this proposal for amendment. Thank you for all of this work. Euromot, it's a great deal of work and we have had exchanges with you and the contracting parties. So we would like to express our supportfor the amendments. Thank you. Thank you. Netherlands. Yes, thank you, Vice Chair, for giving me the floor.Thank you, Euromot, for the documents, working documents and also the informal documents and also to well, for the open discussions we had in the previous month for the and to improve the workingdocuments and to have well, the meetings together in order to, yeah, improve the documents. So thanks a lot for the for your hard work and also the other contracting parties and participants who gave someinput to the documents in order to improve everything. And we are also looking forward to well, dual field applications and the work that can be done in this regard. Thanks a lot.Thank you, Netherlands. Yes. Any other comments from the floor? Sweden. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Chair and alsothank you to Euromot for this work and this proposal. We also think this is an important step to harmonizethe regulations for enabling dual fuel or enabling engines with hydrogen as fuel. Thank you. Thank you.Spain, please, take the floor. Full support from Spain as well. Excellent. Thank you. So with a clear expression ofsupport, Germany. So it sounds like that everybody has to say everything again and, yeah, we think as well forthis piece of work and support it. Good. Thank you. Yeah. I think it's clear that everyone is very grateful forthis. Sorry. European Commission, please. Very briefly also to express our gratitude to Euromot and our support to the initiative. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. So I think Euromot, everyone is very grateful for theimmense amount of work that has been put into creating these two amendments and it's clear that you have done a thorough job of addressing any concerns that were raised during that time and it looks like we are now in a position wherewe can adopt it unless I see anyone wanting to take the floor. No. Can't see any. Going on. Do I get to use theSo counting one, two, three. Adopted. Congratulations. So I was just thinking we only have 5 min left so it's probablynot necessary to open another agenda item or take on a new document. So on the happy note of adopting those twoformats, I think we should take a lunch break. So back at 2:30. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "So good to be back. I hope you have a good lunch, even with restricted possibilities, but I think it's still possible to eat something.Before we go to the important item 9 on the EVE, we want to finish, if you allow me, agenda item 6. So on the non-road, and we have an informal document from the Netherlands on the proposed for amend UN regulation 96/3.Proposed for amend UN regulation 96 covering some other vehicle categories, specific below the 19 kilowatt hours and cooling units. So I give the floor to Theodor Sovring from the Netherlands. If he is ready, you can present.Yeah, before we start, sorry, I think the list of participants is circulating somewhere there. France has it now. So if you haven't signed it, please make sure you sign the list of participants this afternoon. Thank you. Sorry, Theodor.At the last GRPE, I showed you data that indicate that cooling units under 19 kilowatts have excessive PM and NOx emissions compared to new diesel trucks. They have 5 to 10 times more the PM emissions and 1.5 times the NOx emissions. And the total PM emissions of the cooling units are about the same as the PM emissions of all trucks together. You can see that in thisgraph. I also showed that the last time. The emissions of the cooling units are highly concentrated, often with exposure in city centers and I asked whether other parties recognized the problem and if they could share data with me, I would like to thank those who did. There was a suggestion to broaden the scope to all nonroad mobile machines under 19 kilowatts and not only thenot only the cooling units and we think it is a good idea and that's what I want to talk about today. So today I'm going to present more data on the emissions of nonroad mobile machinery, specifically focusing on their power loader lowerthan 19 kilowatts. We think that regulation 96 should be updated and we suggest to work out an adjustment with the focus on two main topics. The 1st one, more stringent emission limits and the 2nd one, better coverage of emissions duringidle and low load operation. Real world emissions are namely strong dependent on the use cases of machines and regulation 96 does not take that into account. But 1st the emission limits,let's dive into the data. So these graphs show the total emissions of nonroad mobile machines and road traffic over theyears in the Netherlands, both for NOX on the left side and PM on the right side. And it is clear to see that the orange line for road traffic in both cases decreases more rapidly than theblue line for nonroad, with as a result that both categories now produce emissions in the same order of magnitude. An important side note here is that the amount of road vehicles is stillincreasing, currently 11.2 million in the Netherlands and the amount of nonroad mobile machines has been slightly decreasing over time, 253,000 currently. So you can see the better on this slide withthe number of machines registered in the Netherlands sorted by power category over the years. So, yeah, currently about around 253,000machines are registered versus 11.2 million road vehicles, both producing emissions around the same order of magnitude and only because and not only because the mobile machines are used for morefrequently than road vehicles. I highlighted the share of transport refrigeration units in the lowest power category under 19kilowatts, but they are part of the whole red section. And the TRUs only produce about 20 to 25% of the total nonroad mobile machine PM and NOx emissions, but in the category under 19kilowatts are alsofor instance lawn mowers, gensets and small tractors. And together they produce a large share of the emissions and that has to do withthe emission limits. So in this graph you can see the emission limits for hydrocarbons and NOx. Every line represents a power category. Andover the years progress has been made for several mostly higher power classes. You can see that in the blue line, the yellow line, and to some extent also the gray, orange and the green line. For reference,the dotted line is the emission limit for heavy duty vehicles. Nonroad mobile machines with a power between 56 and 560kilowatts have limitscomparable to HDPs currently. And those categories also make use ofselective catalytic reduction and the limit for nonroad mobile machines with a power under 19kilowatts, the purple line, is currentlycomparable with the limit for trucks in the 90s. And no SCR is needed for this category. We can see something comparable for PM emissionlimits. Over the years, progress has been made for the higher power classes with big steps around 2012 and 2019. But PM emissions for machines under 19kilowatts are still high and do not require a dieselparticulate filter. That's the purple line. So good to note thatnonroad mobile machinery testing procedure is different from HDP testing procedure. Low load and idle operation is not sufficiently covered in the non NRMM testing procedure. And the NRMM type approval does notinclude in service conformity PAMs testing, only in service monitoring. And as a result, NRMM limits may be exceeded. I will show that laterthat this has to do with the specific use cases. But there is another statistic that indicates that the limits for PM and NOx emissions forpower category under 19kilowatts are not strict enough. And that's this graph. You see here the newly registered nonroad mobile machinesin the Netherlands for 2023. And there are some high peaks visible. This one is the highest peak for just for power just under 19kilowatts. A lotof them, those registrations are the TRUs, the transport refrigeration units. And I call this power bin hopping. So in the past, there hadbeen more dispersion in the registrations, but nowadays we hardly find any TRUs on the market from power category between 19 and 37kilowatts. And there is some more power bin hopping visible at the transition to otherpower bins. Let's get back to the historical data. Over the years, the total NOx emissions for NRMM have been reduced as I showed before. Butthis is mainly due to the higher power classes which are equipped with an SCR. Total NOx emissions of nonroad mobile machines under 19kilowatts have slightly increased. You can see it here that the yellow and the bluecategory, the gray one, they mainly reduced. And the red one is slightly getting higher. Looking ahead to 2030, about 44% of the total NOx emissionsoriginate from mobile machines that are not equipped with an SCR system. And this will be dominated by the latest generation of mobile machines in Europe stage 5. And there is up to 90% reduction potential for the share when usingan SCR. And again, something comparable visible for PM emissions, reduction over the years is mainly due to the higher power classes which are equipped with a DPF. So the yellow one, the blue one, the gray one. And looking aheadto 2030, about 48% of PM emissions originate from mobile machines that are not equipped with a DPF. So there is up to 99% reduction potential for theshare. And therefore, we think there should be more stringent limits for nonroad mobile machines with a power under 19kilowatts. Next to that, weadvocate for a better coverage of emissions during idle and low load operation. This is not just a problem for machines under with a power under 19kilowatts. I will explain why. We tested machines of several power classesand several use cases on the work specific NOx emissions. In this slide, we see the results. You can see in seven use cases, the average NOx emissions are lower or around the cycle limit. In two use cases, the NOx emissions areclearly higher. And in four use cases, the NOx emissions are much higher. I want to take out the example of the excavator, one of them on wheels and oneof them on tracks. In these graphs, we can see a comparison with theexcavators. On the X axis of these graphs, you find the NOx bins in which they operate. And that means that if you are on the left side, you have lowemissions. You are in the low emission bin. And on the Y axis, you see the frequency of operating in a certain NOx bin. Notice the scale difference infrequency on the Y axis. And both excavators have exactly the same engine. And the only difference are the wheels and the tracks. And we evaluated the emissions over moving average windows following the in-service monitoringrequirements in nonroad mobile machinery legislation. And both machines have the same limit value and are approved. But it turns out that the real world emissions are different. The excavator on tracks operates in much lower NOx binsthan compared to the wheeled excavator. And the difference in result is factor 12. And the reason is that the wheeled excavator doesn't heat up enough becausethe engine load is kept low. And when we take into account the moving average windows that are included for in-service monitoring, one of them are some of themare dropped, mainly the high NOx emission bins because that's the low load. We conclude that this moving average window method is not suitable as a basis forfuture PAMs in service conformity testing as high emission bins are excluded. We have tested more nonroad mobile machines and we see that the excluded data can besignificant for some of the investigated applications. The orange parts are invalid and have to be dropped. And there is only an in-service monitoring reportingrequirement for variable engines with a power between 56 and 560 kilowatt. The valid windows shall at least be 50% of the total. Similar to the excavator, alsoother machines are observed to have high emissions during idle operation. So for each machine we have tested what the reduction potential is for emissions whenmaking use of a simple start/stop system, turned on directly after directly or after one or two, three, five or 30 minutes. The results can be seen here. Forsome machines, up to 65% of the emissions can be reduced by using a start/stop system that directly switches off in idle operation. But even switching off automaticallyafter 30 minutes of idle operation can have a measurable effect. So emission reduction can be reached by affordable technology such as start/stop system in allpower categories. So to conclude, we think regulation 96 needs more stringent emission limits for the power for machines with power under 19 kilowatts. These limits canbe reached by using an SCR and DPF. And, of course, we should take costs and sizes of those technologies into account. But we should prevent the power bin hopping thatwe observe. And regulation 96 also needs better coverage of emissions during idle and low load operation. So start/stop system has potential to significantly reduce emissions in those situations. Lifetime compliance can be improved by improvingin-service compliance BEMS testing. Let's take road vehicles as an example here in which emissions have been successfully reduced over the years. I would like to askparties to contact me if you want to join us preparing a proposal for an adjustment of regulation 96. The idea is to prepare concrete objectives and a plan and presentit in May or in October depending on when we are getting back. And come with an informal document with the adjustments of regulation 96 in January next year. Andthe Netherlands will take initiative in this. You can just let me know here or send me an email. I'm happy to add you to my list and work together on this. Thank you.Thank you, Theodor, for this comprehensive presentation. I think this is very clear whereyou are standing and what are the topic you raised and what are the improvements you are proposing to make and to invite the experts here from the GOP to join you to workon a good proposal for an amendment in the nonroad model machinery regulation 96. Ithink this is very welcome. But the floor is open for any comments, questions or willingnessto come and work with you together. I see a question, a remark from the European Commission. Thank you, Chair. And thanks to the Netherlands for tabling this document and of course to Theodorfor the very clear presentation. Due to the short time between the publication and the discussion of this paper we were not able to prepare a full technical evaluation but nonetheless we hadenough time to make a preliminary assessment and to recognize the value and the timeliness of the analysis. So thank you very much for that. We know that NRMM are a very significantcontributor to overall emissions, maybe increasingly in the future as other sources are better and better controlled and they can be very significant contributors to local and hyper local air pollution.So this is something that we should continue to keep an eye on and, of course, a discussion about next steps for NRMM is therefore necessary in our view. I would like to just give the groupa little bit of context of future developments in the European Union. We do have a review of the NRMM Stage 5 regulation coming up in 2025. That's regulation 2016/16/28. And forthis exercise, JRC is going to be able to access data from the mandated Stage 5 in service monitoring program. We expect this to produce a very large dataset and we also want to point out thatthis is going to include the raw data produced by manufacturers which will enable us to rerun and reprocess the data to run different scenarios, much in the way that was presented today by the Netherlands. So thank you for leading the way with that analysis and with that, I leaveit there and thank you again and much appreciated. Thank you. Some activities going on there by GRC so that we can directly work on that part together, if the Netherlands can work togetherwith GRC. United Kingdom. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Netherlands, for the interesting presentation. I think I mentioned this at the previous GRP but the UK is running some research also onemissions from auxiliary engines for transport refrigeration units. We would be happy to discuss further as you have suggested on that research. I'm not sure exactly when it will be availableand publicly available and whether that will meet your timeframes of May but we would be happy to discuss further on what we can help with. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe also a question forme from the European Commission. Will the European Commission come here as well with some information on the tasks they are doing within the GRC on their activities and inform the GRP with thatso that it is not only in Europe, so that we have a broader view, one way when the Commissionis ready to share some information with us? Yes. I think the answer, the very short answeris yes in which terms and in which date is to be seen. Of course, we can do this gladly. Thankyou. Maybe one addition from the GRC side. On two points, the 1st one is as the colleague here pointed out before, this is the stage where we have the monitoring. The natural stage lateron for this is to move towards an service conformity as it was done for the heavy duty part. So even though this is and what we are presenting is how we are moving forward on this regard. Comingback to this point on quick reaction on the technical part and for the 2nd point here in the conclusion. So we have to keep in mind that both the monitoring and the service conformity part are related to the type of approval of engines. So back again to the usual discussionswe have on heavy duties. So even though there could be improvements with regards to the load of where these engines are operating, we are linked to the type of approval of those enginesthere. So this is not RD as such. So that's why there are certain requirements on that regard. So the analysis and the presentation would be in that way. So we keep the moving average windows.We keep the kind of thresholds that are applied there. It doesn't mean that eventually we can look at that as we did for the Euro 7 part. But at the time being this is the kind of approachthat is being followed. And it doesn't make it wrong. It is the way it is. If I correctly understood that, that's also a kind of way of control of the performance ofthe vehicles in relation with the type approval requirements other than also an improvement of the primary type approval limit values and what also was one of the points what was raisedby the Netherlands. So there are two things. So maybe that can help each other. But the one is a control existing and one is an improvement of the limits as well. But okay. That is allin the I think that is open for further debate in what is possible in the technology. Of course, I will expect that Euromot will also reply. So please, you have the floor.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good afternoon to everybody. Appreciate the presentation from Netherlands and to bring the subject forward. Of course, we have long expected that therewill be a need for discussion of where non-road regulation goes next. From Euromot's perspective, we have been and will be preparing for the review that European Commission is to undertake during2025. And that was the timeline to which we were preparing ourselves for this discussion. And to please put into context that the in service monitoring program to which has beenreferred here also by European Commission, this program is extensive. It is costing manufacturers a lot of money to conduct. And we fully expected it to be the outcome of that to be used tomold or influence the next stage of legislation. So it is certainly very important to us to make sure that the timelines involved here are such that the results from that program can be takeninto consideration in relation to deciding whatever comes next. We have probably got one or two technical comments along the way as well. But perhaps we can take those comments mostlyoffline. There are two items that perhaps I will comment on now if I may. One was in respect to the exclusions that you referred to. Please just bear in mind even with the current monitoringprogram, the manufacturers are required to report the results with and without exclusions. So that data, even as summary level is, will be produced from the program even without reprocessingneeded. And the 2nd is in relation to the so-called power hopping that you mentioned. Please bear in mind there is other factors involved here, not just emission limits. Because if youtake, e.g. , the boundary between 56 to 130 kilowatts and 130 to 560 kilowatts as an example, in that particular case there is no difference in the emission limits above andbelow. But what you will find predominantly is above they are six cylinder engines and below they are four cylinder engines. So they take up significantly different space in the machine.And so therefore at 129 kilowatts you have the most heavily loaded engines or those engines which have got the highest power density, incidentally which is also best for the SCR conversion efficiency.So there are other factors in play here also. That's it from our side. But thank you for thepresentations. Thank you to Euromot and also to JRC for the comments. I appreciate it. I wouldlike to take the discussion further with you guys. Yep. Very well. Italy, Antonio. Thankyou. Good afternoon, all of you. And thanks to the Netherlands for their presentation. As I was saying this morning when tackling this item, traditionally the European Union is oneof the contributors together with the Euromot and other parties. We understand that in 2025 from the European Commission we will get some interesting, let's say, information regardingthe evolution of this regulation. Being in Geneva it would be equally important to know from other parties, non-EU contracting parties whether they plan to do something at the national, regionallevel on this item which would be helpful to set, let's say, technical condition which can be recognized worldwide. And final point, when talking about the reduction of limits, yes,indeed, in principle we could fix also the limit here in Geneva but as we know normally we rely on the initiative taken at the regional level. So it would be important also to receive inputsfrom regional and contracting parties about the reduction of limits they expect to propose in their jurisdiction. This would then be taken into account here and in order to fix the properlimit in Geneva. Thank you. Thank you, Antonio. Of course, that is all in the game. It is goodto have this kind of exercise to see what we see in reality and to have your full understanding and discussions with the experts and also with the industry, what are the possibilitiesor the possibilities of putting technologies on these small engines. But indeed, to be toshow what is happening is very important for us to and as well what you mentioned, Antonio, also to not only from the Commission side but also from other regions to know how they willimplement or see their task for improvements, specifically if we are dealing with the lowengines, the engines with low power where you see that the more bin hopping is occurringthan in the other and we have seen from maybe he will, of course, in discussion with the Netherlands on also the reasoning behind it. So it is not only there are more elements added to this butit is good to have an open discussion, not only the way of a better control of in service conformityand in service conformity and COP. But okay, I think we have opened this discussion and Ithink I'm happy the Netherlands to start with this and we will you see that there is a lot of interest in this activity and we will continue that and see in the next GPE if we have new information and you will come with new information as well as come from the Commission. So we arevery pleased to do that for the next sessions. Thank you again, Theodore. Okay, having said that, going back to the agenda because I think we have 6B, we have nothingI think in 6B. So now I think if we can say that we are finished with agenda point 6. ThenI think we can go to agenda point 9. I think Mike is waiting so long for presenting all ofhis hard work in the sorry, wait a moment. Sorry, Mike. I should be corrected that one elementwas still pending about a check from the European Commission of course on the regulation 96 with hydrogen and it was some check if the proposal what was brought by EUROMOD was in the correctway. So I will give the floor to the Commission, GRC, to inform us about the results of thesediscussions. Yeah, to be clear, we are finished of course with agenda point 6. That was thedocument was adopted of course but it was some on the hydrogen from regulation 49. So checkby the Commission on the hydrogen content. Thank you, Chair. Just for confirmation with OICA,the documents we are discussing are the working documents 13 and 14, right? Yeah. Okay. So just we are looking to the documents discussed with OICA. The concerns were clarified. Just one smalltypo for everyone to address. Small thing but can bring to misunderstandings on the copy/pastefrom the ammonia section on the new instrument, page number 14, I think, otherwise I look for. Sowhile looking for it, as OICA was saying, so this is the amendment for the O6 series and O5 series. In the O6 series it includes as well the measurement of ammonia as this is included in Euro 6. Here weare. And this is the typo that I think we would need to address because it says shall be heated to between these two temperatures. So I think we have to get rid of the two because otherwise it would suggest tothese two temperatures even though we have the range. Someone else brought this concern to me before. So if you all agree we get rid of the two and we left it with the between and the range, it should be okay.And once this is covered from our side, we don't have any other concern to have this accepted. This is only in this document, if that's okay for the other ones. And maybe the English speakers in the room can say they agree on the wording. So the scope is, the meaning is that we can work within those temperatures. So between two, thedoesn't work. I imagine that the right word is going to be this one. Otherwise we would suggest that you can have either this or this. Right? Good. Awesome. That was it from our side. As I said, in principle, it should have been fast. Thank you for the proposal from OICA.I see some discussion, but is it okay? Okay. So we can take this. You can see it also from behind in the room. You strike out the two. Yeah? Or not? Okay. Yeah. Why not? Help us. Thank you, Chair.I just want to, so the proposal is to delete the two and just say heated between 383 and 464. But I would say as an English speaker that we should keep the two. I'm always conscious that there are lots of English speakers here. I'm always, but I would keep the two. Yeah.So okay. No. Heated to between. Yeah. So you heat it up to and then you give a range that it must be between. So I would recommend that. Okay. Then we take the knowledge and thewise advice from my Vice Chair to take this into consideration that the two will stay and that it will be heated to a level between 300 maybe levels should be added, but okay. My view as a Dutch okay. But okay. This is good.Yeah. Then, of course, then we can take now this opportunity, of course, to adopt this, these documents because also now there is no restrictions anymore from the European Commission to adopt this. The other were already in agreement. So then we can adopt the 05 series of regulation 49, that is the Working Document 2024/13. Andthe 06 series which is the 2024/14. We can adopt this. If yes, then I do the same as my Co-Chair and say once, saying twice, saying 3rd adopted. Thank you very much for OICA for this hard work and to make it possible for the other series as wellto use hydrogen in their internal commission engines. So this is really a good way to take that in our legislation and to help a lot of industries about this. Then, Mike, you are ready. You are a long time ready. No, you get 1st . So you have requested for your topic at the afternoon. Soit is highlighted in red. So my colleague will wait, should wait. Unfortunately, he is always waiting on me. So I am always late. He is used to me. Okay. We are ready to go then. So good afternoon, everyone. And once again, happy new year to all. I am honored as always to be able to present the status of the EVE in formalworking group and the results of a very large group effort. I will be greatly assisted today by the Co-Chair and also one of the drafting coordinators. I will present basically a high level summary of where the EVE program is at right now and then we will have a more in depth look into the two documents that have been submitted for GTR number 21 and GTR number 22.So as traditional, we would like to summarize the meetings that we have had over the last period, since the last GRPE and there are five meetings that are noted here, three of which were virtual in July, September and then also in December and then two face-to-face meetings, one in Ottawa in October and then yesterday we did have was it yesterday or the day before? I can't remember. It was Tuesday.I'm losing track of the week. We did have a face-to-face meeting here in Geneva and thank you to Environment Canada and the European Commission for being willing to host those meetings. This slide will probably not be news to anyone in this room but we really have three major areas of work that we are focused on. Of course, the hybrid power determination, GTR number 21, we have made some updates to that and I will try to summarize those but Mike'swill go into more detail on that particular document. We have the in-vehicle battery durability GTR which is GTR number 22 for light duties and we have made some refinements to that as well and Eleanor will guide us through the discussion of that document and then we are currently working on this new GTR for in-vehicle battery durability for heavy duties, heavy duty vehicles and trying to leverage our experience on GTR number22 to apply to heavy duty vehicles. So far, this was sort of our goal for GTR number 21. It is quite a laundry list of items so I will just hit the highlights here. So things like consideration of the CAN signals in place of direct measurements were some of the things that we took into consideration, the appropriate accuracy requirementsfor some of the values, measurement alternatives for highly integrated systems, bench system bench testing, family concepts, candidate methods and then the continued consideration for power determination for heavy duty and fuel cell vehicles. So not all of these things were addressed in this updated GTR number 21 but we continue to have this list of items for consideration in future revisions.In this slide here, these are really the exact specifics of the revisions in GTR number 21 that you now have available to you in the submitted document. Mike Sifutin will go through these in more detail but I thought this was important to have this level of detail within this presentation as sort of a reference so you can see that we did address the family concept. So some of theaccommodations for highly integrated power trains, use of system bench testing and then a list of revisions to the accuracy requirements which should make the procedure a little bit more to improve the execution of the procedure for the stakeholders and then also we deleted Annex 3 for the candidate and equivalency method for now. So for GTR number 22, we didadd durability requirements for electrified vehicles of category, for category 2 for we put in place some accounting for energy consumption not related to mobility in the calculation and not related to propulsion. Part C, verification of the virtual distance was modified slightly. We update some of the specific metrics and requirements in Annex 2 which was the values to be read from vehicles and that wasand some minor revisions to Annex 3 in the determination of the performance parameters for Part A testing. And, of course, we continue to gain experience with the GTR including theimplementation of Euro 7 and the proposal that the US EPA made to adopt GTR in their notice of proposed rule making last year. I think I'm going to try to circumvent oneof the questions that we may receive after this and that is the fact that we were informed recently that Euro 7 has adopted or is thinking of adopting potentially because it is not complete.So there is a potential for Euro 7 to adopt slightly different NPRs than what is reflected in the GTR at this time. And when Elena has the floor you could ask her questions about that. One of the questions that came up during the EVE meeting was how EVE might address thosechanges and all I can say at this point in time is that we have had no opportunity to discuss that. So we suspect that as more and more regions start to adopt GTR No. 22 there will be a continuousdevelopment for that process. So the US did propose exactly the same minimum performancerequirements. Okay. So then as I stated in one of the earlier slides, the majority of our work now is on the heavy duty, the in vehicle battery durability for heavy duty vehicles. Weare trying to use the overall framework from GTR No. 22 and it is helpful in a lot of regards. In this slide we have presented before the light duty world is a lot more mature than theheavy duty world as far as the prolific nature of electric vehicles in heavy duty. We enjoyed a much more homogenous set of activities within light duty, largely hauling people and cargo.The heavy duty world, the activity and the energy demands can vary quite a bit. So it makes the job of coming up with a harmonized test procedure that is broadly applicable a bit harder. But we do believe that the framework of the GTR No. 22 can be appropriate for heavy duty includingthe inclusion of a state of health monitor and a test procedure for verifying that monitor,assessing the initial battery condition and then in use assessments of the battery and setting minimum performance requirements. So we do believe that that framework is appropriate even if thelevel of effort is higher. Unfortunately because of the level of effort and trying to come up with some of these really significantly different things for light duty we are requesting a slightdelay. We have put six months in here into this document. I know this conversation around whether there will be a May GRPE or an October GRPE sort of plays into this. We are fairlyconfident at this point in time that we can support the October 2024 GRPE with a working document and so but I think this sort of describes the state of play right now. We can make some adjustments to this timeline as required after we have had the conversations tomorrow aboutwhat the firm plans are. So as I said earlier, you know, we the framework between GTR No. 22 and the heavy duty GTR are very much the same. We look at this as really sort of three distinctphases in the process for the GTR, the information gathering phase, the performance definition and then the performance verification. And in the information gathering phase, you know, wewant to make sure that we are putting in place the state of health monitor and that we have the ability to read that state of health monitor and then trying to gather data for trying to inform the minimum performance requirements. And for the light duty world, we had this modelingdone by JRC, the TEMA model that helped inform the minimum performance requirements. We had other 3rd party data sources that we could pull from and we even tried to leverage to the greatest degree the warranty requirements that the vehicle manufacturers had implemented tohelp inform that process. And all of that was used to develop a minimum performance requirement or an NPR which was placed into GTR No. 22. So and I should point out one thing here thatin this particular slide, those solid red circles are sort of the primary work that we are doing within the EVE at this particular time. So you can see that the minimum performance requirements,the NPRs are certainly a big question for us in the as we develop this GTR. But just as important in going hand in hand with that is the performance verification. So the test methodologyis another it's equally it demands an equal amount of our attention. In the light duty world, we had very, very mature and robust test measurements that were broadly applied to light duty vehicles.And so being able to determine the usable battery energy and to be able to require a state of health monitor based on the certified the state of certified energy in retrospect now seemsit was a very straightforward concept. But for heavy duty, we are actively trying to come up with a common test cycle and then once again recognizing not only the variation in vehicledesign and characteristics well, not only the variation in vehicle characteristics and use but also variation in vehicle design that impacts the test procedure. And I'll get into a littlebit more of that on the next slide. And so this sort of summarizes where we are at from that test procedure standpoint. Maybe I'll just go back one slide and say I'm focusing on thatcircle in the lower left-hand corner to the test UBE against SCSOCE reading. So these are the methods that we are currently considering for documentation or requirements in the GTRfor checking durability, for establishing those baseline usable battery energy and then being able to go back and verify through the life of the vehicle how much of that usable battery energy is retained. And so we have divided up the vehicles into two different significantsets of technology. On the left are heavy duty vehicles with no bidirectional charging system. So basically the vehicle can be charged and the only means of discharging the battery is to operate the vehicle. The 2nd category are heavy duty vehicles with bidirectional chargingcapability. So on those vehicles the electric system will allow not only charging of the vehicles but discharging of the vehicles through that bidirectional system and that does offer a little bit more flexibility. For those vehicles without bidirectional charging we have developed weare considering two methods which we refer to as method 1A and method 1B. And method 1A being basically driving the vehicle with a standard average speed on a test track to dischargethe battery. Method B being an opportunity or an option to be able to operate the vehicle on public roads with other speed and speed tolerance characteristics. So both method 1A and1B, the vehicle is charged and then discharged through operation. Method 2 recognizes that those vehicles with bidirectional charging have the ability to we can in sort of a stationarysetting charge the vehicle and discharge the vehicle using EVC, electric vehicle support equipment type of an environment. And then in addition to that there is the possibilityto operate these vehicles on heavy duty roles, heavy duty chassis and to be able to do each one of these methods potentially also on a heavy duty dyno. We do believe that the dyno methodcould be very, very robust for establishing the UBE and the state of certified energy similarto the processes that we use for light duty vehicles. However, what we are finding is that the availability of heavy duty dynos is very limited. They are not they are not nearly as prolific as the dynamometersthat are used for light duty testing. But we do believe that that is a valid methodology and sort of underpins the other methods that we are considering. So this slide I do not expecteveryone to be able to read this from the back of the room. But I think the important things here or the one important thing that I wanted to include on this slide is that when you look at the graphic on the left and when you for those of you that have seen that graphic before, youmay recall it was sort of a cartoon. It was a picture, a concept several months ago, maybe probably going back to the last GRPE. And now we have really started to put some detail aroundwhat that what that cycle testing would look like. This would include methods 1A and 1B for driving on the test track or on road. We have made decisions around the speed characteristicsand recognizing that the speed characteristics can be regionally representative. But really having a very similar methodology and test procedures between 1A and 1B. Further recognitionof regional requirements for payload, understanding that this is going to be that speed and payload characteristics will differ by region or could potentially differ by region. And then also having checks in place regarding the C rates to make sure that we don't operate the vehiclein a way that's not representative of what we might see in the field. We, of course, always want to be able to tie back to how these vehicles are used in the in the real world. And then a guideline for harmonization on the characteristics of the speed. And I won't try to read throughall of those characteristics. I do encourage everyone to that is interested in a high level summary of where we are at right now to read through this briefing in detail. But as I said, the it is impressive to me as well that we have gone through and from this sort of pictograph,this cartoon, to a very, very developed test procedure for cycling the battery. So that is the summary of the heavy duty GTR. And before we get to questions, I want to just cover someof the logistics around where the EVE is at right now. So we do have an updated terms of reference. And we just sent that to Francois earlier today. So that should be posted onthe Wiki. Many things are staying about the same. We do need to request a renewal. And we think that going out to June 2027 is appropriate. The leadership group is staying much the same as it has with the European Commission and the United States co-chairing and having vice chairmanshiprepresentation from both China and Japan. And Canada continues to supply exemplary Secretaries in that role. So we are very much appreciative of that, too. And then we would continue to work on, of course, the heavy duty GTR being the most important thing. We know or we expectthat there will be further conversations around GTR number 21 and 22, especially as more and more experience is had on these two GTRs and the implementation. There are additional thingsthat we know that some of the stakeholders have wanted us to look at, including things like swappable batteries. So we know that we are going to continue to receive there will bean information sharing aspect of our work. And then, of course, the coordination of environmental performance, the work that we are doing within the EVE and other IWGs. So this representswhat we think is our current timeline in recognition that we are going to have a conversation tomorrow morning as well. We are now firmly in January of 2024. We have the renewal of our Terms of Reference which I have just very briefly reviewed. We have a working document on GTR number 21which Mike will present. We have a working document on GTR number 22 that Elena will present. And then we also have an update on the heavy duty battery during GTR. In June of this year,we had expected to submit working documents for GTR number 21 and 22 to WP29 and AC3 for a vote. So that seems like that's fairly clear. And then we have identified October as sortof our preference at this particular point to submit a working document on the heavy duty GTR recognizing that we need to have that document by July 22nd of this year. And then with theintention that that working document would go to WP29 and AC3 for a vote next spring in March of 2025. And some of the feedback that we have gotten from at least one stakeholder, specificallyJapan, that this revised timing meets their needs. Very quickly, then, proposed future EVE meetings. So we will have a virtual meeting next month in February towards the end of next month. Andthen we are planning a face-to-face meeting in Seoul, South Korea. Thank you to Korea for hosting us. I am certain that we will have some interim virtual meetings between that meetingand the next face-to-face meeting. But our face-to-face meeting after Korea will take place in Japan. And whenever we have another GRPE, it would be good to have a half day meeting for the EVE.So we will leave that open for now. So thank you all so much for your attention this afternoon.And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you, Mike, for this complete overviewof your activities in the informal Working Group, EVE. And with the future activities, look around if there are some questions for you at the moment. Korea. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good afternoonto everyone. It is just about the 69th EVE meeting. It will take place in Korea. And hybrid meetingsystem will be prepared. But the specific venue has not been finalized yet. So now finding out the appropriateplace. So we will inform it to leadership group after deciding. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Sothe information on the meeting in April will be shared. Mike. Just a real quick comment on that, that I very much appreciate the two or the effort to harmonize the lifecycle analysistiming and also the EVE and having both of those meetings in the same week. That was very much appreciated that that timing worked out. Thank you. Yeah, that's indeed good for thetraveling that both informal Working Groups work jointly and have the same meetings in the same locations. So this is very helpful. Okay. We will go further with presenting the workingdocuments. Japan. Thank you for the explanation and good afternoon, everyone. Japan also consideredto hold the EVE meeting in the hybrids, same to Korea. Yes. So I plan to have the hybridmeeting. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, that's the hybrid meeting in Tokyo in the fall. Yeah. Okay. Good.Thank you. So good that Japan is hosting this meeting. You are welcome. So the other bike, if you are ready, you can start. You are exciting.Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I was the drafting coordinator for GTR 21, the 1st iteration. Now we havecompleted a 2nd iteration of GTR 21. So I just wanted to present 1st very briefly just to make everybody aware that we have as an informal document a new tech report for GTR 21. And it outlines some of the same things that you saw in Mike's presentation, just showing summarizing the changes that are proposed for this 2nd iteration.So we worked on GTR 21 primarily up until 2020. And it was during the pandemic when we actually finally got this done. So a lot of us were working from home. And then after we were done with GTR 21, we spent almost all of our time with GTR 22 and also thinking about heavy duty GTR 22 as well. So we spent about a year without doing very much new additionalwork while people got some experience perhaps with GTR 21, although that was probably limited due to the pandemic. But nonetheless, by the time 2022 came around, there were a number of suggested revisions and improvements from contracting parties and also stakeholders. And so finally we did in 2023 reach consensus on a number of somewhat significant and somewhat smallactually in some cases revisions. So we had considered developing a candidate method. That was part of our original mandate. And at some point we decided that there was not any particular demand for a candidate method, which should also be known as a method equivalency. We had an annex at the end of GTR 21 that was empty, but we had it as a place holder just to signal that we intended to develop a candidate method. At some point, though, it was agreed that we would not proceed immediately.And it was proposed that we simply delete the annex for now just to avoid any confusion. Another major interest of the 2nd iteration of the GTR was to add a family concept so that we could distinguish which vehicles are similar enough that they don't need to be tested individually. And so we developed we added section 7, which describes the family concept. It was alsoanticipated all during this process that some powertrains may be too highly integrated to instrument in an appropriate way or in a simple and easy way. So it was proposed that GTR 21 could also include an additional TP1 method definition that would allow two branches of an electric powertrain to be essentially instead of being instrumented, we could look at the canned datathat describes the torque distribution to the two branches because it would be very difficult in some cases to actually instrument physically a vehicle such as that. And so you can see an additional method D under TP1. We also added some definitions of a system bench because it was anticipated that some vehicles may be too powerful to be tested on a chassis dynamometer and if you wanted to use this method, you would have a problem with that. So we defined what was meantby a system bench and we added text that if the system bench was properly defined and it was validated, you could use the system bench in place of a vehicle on a dynamometer to determine the power. And then there were a number of relatively small changes that were done primarily to make the test procedure more practicable in many situations. So we changed the soak area temperature definition to a moretypical definition where we specify a temperature set point at a tolerance around the set point instead of a specific temperature alone. And also there was an advantage that it would accommodate type 1 soak area target temperatures at the request of the manufacturer. Also we provided an option to allow some of the simpler metrics to be read from the onboard signal where we felt that thesethese types of signals were usually quite accurate and quite reliable for other purposes in the power train. So engine speed, fuel flow rate and atmospheric pressure now optionally can be read from the onboard signal. The intake manifold pressure accuracy was revised similarly to better match the requirements of R85 which everybody would already be instrumented for. Dynamometer speed accuracy was revised to allowa 2nd option to just have a tolerance of 1% around the full scale of the device. So in other words, we used to have just a single tolerance in kilometers per hour but in the case of very high speeds that could actually exceed the capability of a dynamometer and so we just added some text and you will see that in a moment. The time accuracy was revised to 100 milliseconds. I suspect this was probably atypo when we had it as 10 milliseconds. What we really meant was 10 hertz and we found that was sufficient in the development testing. So we saw no reason to correct that. And the accelerator pedal command is a very important signal for the test procedure. It has to be 100% all the way down. But it came to our attention that there was no established standard for the accuracy of such a signal. We had just almost arbitrarily said it should beplus or minus 1%. But essentially since it always has to be full scale and there are some complexities about how you would define the accuracy of an accelerator pedal position, we got some technical advice that indicated that the CANBUS signal should be sufficient for this purpose. And then finally we revised some of the calculations for TP1 where we had specified a 2% tolerance around the fuel flow rate and manifold pressure. But it was brought to our attention that COPrequires 5% and it was felt after discussion in the group and after looking at some carefully anonymized data from some stakeholders that the 5% tolerance probably represents the test condition better than the 2% from R85 and provides similar results. So that is all of the changes to the technical document. Now I'll switch over to the very few changes that are not reflected in the workdocument. So since October, I suppose, when we submitted the working document, that document has been available for inspection to show the actual changes that were made to the document in order to implement all of the things that I just listed. There were a few things that did not get agreed upon in time for the working document and those are the only things that I intend to go through today. Thankfully there are only a very few of them. So I'mjust going to go through the very few of them that we have. So on page 29, you will notice that we still had some uncertainty about the plus or minus 2% on intake manifold pressure. We had that in square brackets. So we eliminated the square brackets to accept it. Dynamometer speed, we added a little bit of text here just to indicate plus or minus .1% of full scale vehicle speed as an alternative to the .2 kilometers per hour toleranceand because we added actually I'm not going to explain the actual thing here. I'll just show it to you. We added an option D where we can have a distribution ratio of torque between two branches of an electric power system that cannot be instrumented. I mentioned that earlier and that added an option D. So we just had to it's almost too trivial to describe but we added that. So that was not in the working document just to includethe D. And then the final change was to remove the square brackets from the .05 tolerance which used to be .02. And so those are really the only changes that were not reflected in the working document. So I guess I'd just like to say 1st of all, thanks to everybody who contributed to the ongoing process over the last approximately two years to identifypotential changes that could be made to this GTR. And also the presentations that were made regarding the data that supported the proposed changes. Also China did a good amount of testing. Korea, Japan did a good amount of testing of vehicles to corroborate the comparative accuracy of TP1 and TP2 and the results were always quite good. So we feel pretty confident about this new iteration of theGTR. We are continuing to keep our eyes open for other opportunities to improve upon the GTR, either improve upon the way in which it is implemented in real world test labs including ways to think about how different types of vehicles, different types of hybrid systems might possibly pose challenges to this method. But we feel pretty confident now that after looking at it for a long time that this set ofrevisions will result in a significantly improved test procedure and, of course, we are always open to any suggestions from people out in the field who are actually implementing this test procedure in the real world. So with that, I think that's about all I have to present on this. Again, the working document and I believe in track changes as well is also up on the site. So if you want some more details on the specific wording of any of the changes, feel free to look at that. And, of course, we arealways available to answer your questions. Thank you, Mike, for this comprehensive presentation of your hard work on the GTR 21 and with the document 2025/5 available with the corrections and the informal document 16, revision 1 which you explained. So this is one of the huge work you have done and this is open nowfor the GFE to consider if we are happy with this. And I have heard also that you have contributed a lot with the other regions, so with the EU, with Japan, with Korea, with China. So I think this is a good example of worldwide harmonization, I think. So we are very pleased that this activity is brought worldwide and that we have this kind of conversation andthat we have this kind of proposal now here on the table which is a very good job from high quality, I think. So the floor is open. Are we ready to adopt this document? Yes. I think we are in the good position to do that. So then we will adopt 2024/5which will then be updated with informal 16, revision 1. We can adopt. One, same, twice. Adopted. And congratulations of all your hard work. Yeah, I know. So this is the document. And we have also because it is a GTR, we have to have the technical report which is added to this. It is aninformal 17, which is an amendment to the W29 document, 2020/126, also with track changes. And I think we have to adopt this as well. So it gives the explanation of all the work and how we came to this amendment that is all in the work from the GTR. Sowe can adopt the technical report as well? I see no obstructions. Okay. So we endorse and adopted the technical report as well which will then be added to the proposals and sent to W29/AC3 in the June session this year. So it is really quick on time. So Elena, you will get the floor now for the GTR number 22.I suppose the floor is yours. So good afternoon, everybody. I will introduce the changes and the amendment of the GTR 22, particularly in the same way as also Mike did. We thought it was more effective to show you just the track changes or what we have changed. I would like to show you all the track changes. So we are all on the same page. So what we have submitted in the working document, you can see what we have amended now.Because something we thought it was better to be improved. Okay. So the 1st changes and the bigger thing that we discussed was the category 2 as Mike also introduced. And for the category 2, we now have introduced the minimum performance requirement. So you can see here in the rational explanation what we discuss, how we reach the consensus for this minimum performance requirement proposal. But wealso thought to improve the concept of the virtual mileage because for this category, we don't have only the driving mode. But we have also extra possibility, no tractional proposed application and so on. So we revised this concept. You will see in the next pages I will show you what we have introduced. But also what was lacking was the verification of this virtual distance. So I will also show thisone. I left this to show to you. Okay. In the working document we submitted, we were thinking to remove all this part related to the matrix that we discussed in the phase 1 of the GTR 22. But then thinking a bit, we thought it was better to have it back because we want to have trace of everything we discuss. This was supposed to be tackled in phase 2. We did not. So we decided to put itback with the consensus for all the group. That's why you see that it is deleted here but then it is appearing again here below. And we just put it a little remark that was not addressed both in the 1st but also in the 2nd phase. So we take note of all the discussion in the group. Okay. Then the big part that I said was the part C. So how to verify the virtual mileage concept. Here is the rationale where we explain a bitto all the discussion. I go down so you can see. This was all the part explaining because we were thinking introducing a test and then how to understand the pass and fail, only one vehicle to be tested, up to three vehicle with the pass decision and now we arrive to a consensus with the statistical approach as we have in part A with one up to four vehicle with a rate of pass of 50%. And this was agreed and we put it in thenew version. Okay. Now I go down because this was the rationale of the number changing. So it is not so critical. We have removed this part. You saw already in the working document because it was not considered. At the beginning there was an idea to address but now we move with other idea in the development of the GTR. And then, of course, we have to amend all the text wherewe were referring that we were develop an NPR for category 2, state of certified energy. Since now it is there, we delete all the reference to this. Okay. Now next. We introduce the definition, the odometer, the energy throughput and then also all non-tractional proposed energy with the unit because this is something new and we have to define it. And then as I said any timewe refer to state of certified energy and range, we have to improve it. And so we also look that maybe it was better to improve the resolution of the monitor of this indicator also based on the suggestion from SBIRT from the standard committee. Here is the table of NPR. So you can see now in the exchanges the NPR that we introduce for category 2. Maybe a slight comment as beforewe were saying are slightly different from Euro 7 and I think that is the time now to since I have this table, what has been agreed in the trial was to increase the 2nd step check, meaning at 8 years and 160,000 kilometers. I hope that you can see my mouse. Instead of 72%. So increase of 2%. And the same is valid also for category 2. Instead of 65, 67percent. So this is the difference that we were referring before in my presentation. This is the virtual distance that I was referring to. Before we were only considering the vehicle to X application but then for this commercial vehicle it is important to consider also not the actual purpose. We amend the equation and then we introduce how to verify it. I go to all the changes. So we are as I saidover the line. This is because as I said we are now introducing the statistic for the state of certified energy verification, the monitor. We did not introduce yet the state of certified range monitor. So we introduce this sentence highlighting that when this will be defined we have to keep an eye on the statistic and check if it is valid or if we have to revise it. So we improve it a bit, the text inrespect to the 1st version in this respect. Same thing here. This is because we still miss the state of certified range. Okay. I think that the big part to show you is the part C. Here we are. Okay. Part C as I said title is indicated is the verification on the reported distance. What we submitted in the working document we were just introducing a very simpletest on one vehicle without defining the text. In between we decided to be more specific. So we have now defined a test to be carried out. So we operate the vehicle to X on all the proposed application. We monitor the value of the energy to put while the system is operating. So we read at the beginning of the test. We read after having operated the system and we know the counter variation. And then we go to checkthese again some measurement to see if the monitor and the counter of the energy to put is working correctly. To do so we introduce a statistical approach. Go down so you can see that. Here is the table. Okay. So we select the vehicle from 1 up to 4. And then we perform the test. The ratio of pass is 50%. So if we have one car is the tolerance between what we measure and what we read is5%, okay. We pass. If it is fail, we go to select another car, another vehicle. Sorry because we have a commercial vehicle. The same is there. If we have a fail, a pass of 50% is passing. Otherwise no. Up to 4 vehicles. So you have the text. You can read in detail. I don't want to bother you with all the equation. But in a nutshell is what I said. We need to check what is displayed on the counter in respectto some measurement and see if they are in agreement in between a certain tolerance. So this is the big part that you don't have in the working document but is now there. Let's go down then to see yes, the corrective measure. We revise it a bit the text. So if it is failing, the manufacturer has to fix this counter, meaning the algorithm, not only the monitor, so all the packets for thisvirtual distance or not driving application. And then the test has to be done again to have a pass. Because otherwise we cannot go to the step after. That would be the part B with the minimum performance requirement. I think that then there are just more typo here in the survey. Just improving a bit the explanation. Okay. I go down faster. And thenwe have okay. The Annex 2, just to recall, all the value that can be read from the vehicle in relation to this GTR. We reorganized the value as you can see here in different groups. So it is clear. It is more clear but also we introduced something new related to the application of that we introduced for category 2. We specified theunit. It is very important for the reading from the vehicle for the digit. And this is the last version aside some revision in the wording we decided to use distance instead of mileage or something like that. So these are the amendments that we introduce. Andthen we introduce also the energy throughput for regional requirements. And then I see if we have still I think we have still a little thing, a little and then I'm done. You know, we have to introduce the calculation of the UBE especially when we have to derivethe certified one that at the moment is not declared value. And we had this methodology already in the GTR 22. We have spotted a little error and we decided to improve it a bit. Andso you can see here the last amendment that we did to this document. So the same description I go just down to check but I think that this is all. Okay. We have prepared also a statusreport with all the same changes. So it is brief and it is not so long. It is this one. And youcan see also here some track changes. Yes, it is the good one. I want to show you the amendment. Okay. Here it is not in blue. So that's why I cannot see. It is the same that I just showedyou before reflecting here. So we have the two documents that are well updated. Here you can see the big part I guess. Yes, it is evident now. Yeah. For the category 2. So the document are aligned, are posted. And I would like also as Mike to thank everybody for the support andthe nice discussion in the group. Not only for this document. I take the chance also to thank everybody also for the heavy duty vehicle GTR because I'm the drafting coordinator and the discussion are very nice and very technical and I like it very much. So thanks for all thecontribution around the world. So now if somebody has some question. Yeah, the floor isopen. From my understanding the informal document 32 is not an amending the 2024/6. It is onlythe document describes the amendments or is it It is an amendment for 2004/6. Yes. Okay. Sothat I'm 100% clear that this is an amendment of the working document. Okay. And they areboth available in the clean and track change format with the same number on the website. So this is 100% clear. They are huge documents. So they are not small. Let's see that thereis also a lot of work behind this improvement of GTR No. 22. The floor is open. I don't seeany questions from the floor. And you also mentioned the status report, the final status reports, the informal document 33. Also both in clean version and track changes. So we have here moreor less three documents which we can adopt for today and send it to W29. We are ready forthat. Also here we see good work from the regions. You did a tough job with all the work in allthe informal Working Group meetings every month. I heard from Mike this is a tough job. So ifI use the hammer, then I can say once, saying twice, adopted. So congratulations. So we willbring the 2024/6 amended by informal document 32 to W29/AC3 in June with the status reportmentioned in informal document 30 sorry, 1933. So thank you very much again. So this is a veryimportant moment that we have the amendment for the two GTRs. Then we have one document stillwhat we have to adopt from the EVE group and that's the terms of reference. We can do this 1st and terms of reference, it is a new document. Should we give the GPE time to look at the coffeebreak to that and that we amend this after the coffee break? It is okay? Mike, you will introduceit. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So certainly that seems fine. It is a good idea. People can read through it because we are a little bit late in getting it to everyone to review. But I can say that the document really is asking for that extension and it is realigning the timing withwhich what we think is appropriate for where we are at in the process right now. So thank you. Should we take after the coffee break the document on the screen so that everyone cansee it and that we then adopt the document? Yeah? Okay. We will do that. So coffee breaknow until let's say 4:40. Yeah? And what was before we take the coffee break, we said toask Mike to brief us, inform us about the update of the terms of reference from the EVE groupand it is informal document GPE30/42 sorry, 90/42. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And so I hopeeveryone took the coffee break all the time to read through this document during the coffee break. So I'm seeing a lot of nodding in the room. That's good. So thank you for taking the time to read through this. I did try to make a small high level summary of this priorto the coffee break. So I will just cover this really quickly. It is six pages. So we will move through this. Much of this is the same as our previous terms of reference includingthe procedural background and the introduction. And it does go into some detail with respect to some of the work, the specific work that we have already done within the informal workinggroup including the reference to GGR number 21 for the determination of electric power and the information that we received along the way informing that process. Summarizing the workthat we did on GTR number 22 which is the in vehicle battery durability for electric vehicles and the fact that we concluded that work in March of 2023. And then also referencing thework that we are doing on the heavy duty in vehicle GTR that has been started. So as more vehicle performance and component level data becomes available, ongoing research will becritical in continuing the development and refinement of these two UN GTRs. Therefore the ongoing assessment and developments in EV technology will be used to determine whether future policy may be necessary in the event that the informal working group identifies a need to develop newGTRs will obviously come back to this organization for approval. But those are the three things that we are working on right now, GTR 21, 22 and also the heavy duty GTR. So section 3 isa summary of the terms of reference. 3.1 being the heavy duty GTR outlining the phasesas described here. Phase 1, initial draft and development, working document for GRPE and AC3 and during my summary of the EVE work we talked about the timing associated to that. And then we also included the consideration of an alternative test method which in this case is that chassisdynamometer testing that sort of on that graphic underlined or was supporting method 1A, 1B and 2. And then allowing space for continuing development of an alternative test method if in fact we arenot able to completely get the chassis dynamometer testing outlined for the 1st revision and then any future amendments as new data and continued research it becomes available. Sothat roughly describes phase 1 and phase 2 for this upcoming heavy duty GTR. Section 3.2 outlinesthe potential amendments for GTR number 22, the in vehicle battery durability. Phase 2 is what we are in right now and what we have adopted today, amending the regulation to reflect applicabilityto light duty vehicles, account for energy assumption. So that is where we are at right now. And then section 3.2 offers a phase 3 which would incorporate necessary amendments based on lessons learnedfrom the implementation experience of the European Union 7 regulation as well as the United States EPA proposed rule making to adopt GTR number 22. I would say that that does not necessarilymean that our intention is to absolutely go ahead and adopt changes that certain contracting parties make but more to consider those within the context of the GTR and further developmentsfor the GTR. So I would not please do not read that as an absolute that we will automatically adopt those lessons learned but more we will consider those lessons learned as we think aboutfuture revisions. And then section 3.3 describes the phases for GTR number 21. Phase 2 is wherewe are at now and what we have adopted today which was concepts such as the accuracy requirements, family concept, bench testing alternatives. You have all heard quite a bit about the phase2 today. So I won't recap all of that. And then phase 3 for the GTR number 21 could incorporate additional scope for the system bench testing consideration of what GTR 21 applicabilityfor heavy duty vehicles might look like, continued measurement alternatives for highly integrated systems that continues to be concerned in that area, potential for fuel cell vehicles and thenof course anything else that comes up as new data and research continues to be communicated. Section 3.4 is once again to make sure we continue to have information sharing that's always beena very big part of the EVE mandate. So ongoing review and analysis of relevant literature policies and developing technologies, e.g. , swappable batteries including expert presentations. Ithink this has been one of the strongest points of the EVE is the continuing influx of expert information and sharing. And then potential investigation of the adoption and implementationof GTRs and then considering regulatory amendments based on lessons learned. I think that is also part of our has been and continues to be part of our mandate. And then review and coordination of considerations concerning EVE environmental performance and associated technology in thecontext of existing mandates of other active IWGs ensuring EVE IWG activities remain unique and complimentary. So it's a very complex way of saying that we are going to make sure wecontinue to cooperate, collaborate and coordinate with other informal working groups. So that sort of forms the core of the work that we will continue to do. The rules and proceduresare very much the same. We continue to have co-Chairmanship between the European Commission and the United States looking out through the period from now until June of 2027. To the bestof our knowledge we continue to enjoy Vice Chairmanship support from both China and Japan in that same time frame and also the Technical Secretary will continue to be maintained fromCanada from 2024 to June of 2027. The official language continues to be English. Let's seehere the documentation. Most all of this remains very much the same as it has been up to 4.13and 4.14 including report outs to the GRPE as appropriate. So I will focus on the timeline. The timeline that you see here in this terms of reference is identical to what I presentedin the report out for the EVE. Maybe with just a little bit more detail here. So we are in January of 2024 right now and I think that we have successfully met these four bullet points with the submission of the terms of reference that we are reviewing right now for consideration,the submission of GTR No. 21 which has been adopted, 22 which has been adopted and then also providing an update on the heavy duty GTR. So now we are firmly on the path to June 2024in the consideration by these two documents, both GTR No. 21 and the associated report and GTR No. 22 and associated report by WP29. And we have been bold in assuming that this October2024 GRPE will most likely become direction and so our intention is to submit a new UN GTRas a working document for that GRPE. So we have roughly six months to complete our work on the in battery durability for heavy duty vehicles. And assuming that we are successfulin our GRPE submission in October, that document would go up for approval at WP29 in March of2025. We have included some rough estimates of phase 3 for GTR No. 21 and No. 22 and we are roughly saying that that's about two years in the making. So we are currently in Januaryof 2024 right now and we would have a phase 3 document for GTRs No. 21 and 22 in January of 2026. And then looking all the way out three years in the future, a potential phase 2 forthe heavy duty vehicles in January of 2027 with a subsequent WP29 approval in that same year. So that summarizes our request for the continuing of our mandate from now, 2024 out through 2027and it also provides additional detail on the change in timing with respect to the heavy duty in vehicle battery durability, GTR. So with that I'll turn the floor back over to you, André.Thank you, Mike, for this information you give on your terms of reference, the update which is very clear also with the timeline is interesting with all the milestones you want to say so thatthere's a good trigger and have a pace in your activity. So that's good to have a kind of good reference on that. So the floor is open if there are some questions or remarks or otherwisewe can endorse this terms of reference. So it is a task for us for the GOP to adopt and endorsethis terms of reference. I think everyone is in agreement to take this route and with yourupcoming activities already for three years. So it is very in detail. So thank you very much. So this is a good reference of your work. So a lot of success in your team. Thank you. Thenwe go back to our agenda. And we have finalized item 9. And we can go to the next one. We goto what is left from the morning session. It is agenda point 8 if that is possible. I look to my colleague from the Netherlands if it is possible to give us the update on agendapoint 8. We have 8A, the regulation 40 and 47. We have nothing there. We have the GTR developmentdone within the EPPR. And I think that the informal document from the EPPR, which numberis it? I have to check. 41. So we are interested about your activities in the EPPR. You havethe floor, Niels. Yes, co-chair of this informal Working Group. Yes. Thank you, Chair. Forgive me the floor. I will give you the status report of the informal Working Group on EPPR, whichis the Working Group on Environmental and Propulsion Performance Requirements of All Category Vehicles, in short EPPR. On behalf of the EPPR Working Group, with the leadership team from myselffrom the Netherlands and Joseph from South Africa and Edwin from Emma as the secretary. Withthis I would like to thank the EPPR Working Group for their input and information and continued cooperation within the group. I want to give a short update on the work that has been doneand the meetings that we held. So the content of the presentation is quite short. It is the meetings since the GRP 89, outlook on the future activities, the progress on the priority itemswhich were addressed in terms of reference and then the meetings planned for now in 2024. Recent meetings since the GRP 89 session were in September and December, which were virtually, and thenthe 9th of January, so that was Tuesday, which was a hybrid meeting. The priority items which were agreed in terms of reference in GRP 87, there are four. So the 1st one is the maximumpower and torque determination for internal combustion engines, pure EVs and hybrid EVs. The 2nd one is the battery electric vehicles and the range determination of those vehicles.The 3rd is the deterioration factors in the new GTR durability, which is the GTR 23. And the 4th is the transposition of UN GTR number 2 into a UNR regulation. Last year, some updateswere provided, but no concrete proposals so far on those priority items. And the informal Working Group leadership continues to invite all participants for proposals on those topics.There are, of course, some progress on the priority items. So if you look at the maximum power and torque determination, Japan continues with the internal discussions to what possibleproposal for this topic. At the 59th EPPR meeting, the expert from South Korea indicated a focus on establishing power measurement rules for electric motorcycles. And if you remember inthe 61st session of the sorry, in the last GPE meeting, so the 89th meeting, the co-chair of the EVE made a comment on this topic and the link with the EVE meeting and that we shouldhave a discussion on possible links between the two Working Groups and if we work together and that there were no double well, work performed. During the 61st EPPR meeting, so that was theDecember meeting, there was an exchange with the secretary of the EVE meeting which was available during that meeting. And due to well, the December month and the coming GRPE, we decided to takeup this item and look at this from the EPPR 63 session onwards to discuss together if there's well, if we can have some exchange between the leadership teams of the informal Working Groups.Then the progress on the battery electric vehicles, range determination, so CARB tested EVE motorcycles on different test cycles with the SAE J2982 test procedure to support the development ofa credit program to accelerate towards zero emission motorcycles and China introduced a test method with GB standard 24.157/2017 to measure the electric range, the electric energy consumptionand the indication for the state of charge of the vehicle in one test. Further revision of the standard is expected and possibly considering the WMTC and associated vehicle subclassificationsin this revision. Now we have the 3rd item, the deterioration factors in GTR 23 on durability. It should remain to the contracting parties to provide input, in particular to China, U.S.,for sharing data and experience on durability factors since they are already working in this field and have some probably some information available and will be shared on a later stage.And then a 4th item which is the transposition of UN GTR 2 into UN regulation. Currently the delegates within the ePPR group could not provide any inputs in this discussion since the UNGTR 2 has been mostly already implemented in their domestic legislation. However, there remain many relevant markets not represented by authorities present in the informal working group on ePPRand that's why the informal working group requests some guidance from the GRPE to help identify some interests from contracting parties with regard to the transposition of the UN GTR 2into a UN regulation. Between brackets it is 3, 4 and 5. So it is not clear what we how to follow and how to update the current legislation or maybe make some new regulation in order toaddress those topics but that's open for discussion and depending on input from the contracting parties. The ePPR meetings in 2024 which are planned, so we have a March session which isa virtual session. We have some dates between brackets since the April session we have an in-person/hybrid meeting and depending on the GRPE well, discussion and also in the end ifit is final, if we have a May session, we will or could have a May ePPR meeting together with the GRPE '91. Thank you. Are there any questions and specifically in relation to alsoitem number 4, so the transposition of the GTR number 2 in the UNR regulation, we are very much interested. Thank you. Thank you, Niels, for your presentation or activities in theformal group ePPR on the two and three wheelers and specific on the yeah, the question you raised here in your presentation on the progress on the priority items and the transposition ofthe UN GTR number 2 into UN regulations and requests for some guidance. So we know thatthere is a good signal that the GTR number 2 was used in relevant markets, but we have notyet transposed the GTR number 2 into the UN regulations which is I think 40 and 47 if I'm correct.So we these are really lagging behind and are not updated and not in line with the GTRdevelopment which you have established already. So this is a question here if we have to takethis also as a priority in our GAP to start with this transposition. I see at the moment not so many people asking for this to do that because the thinking in the national legislationis already done within the GTR, but I think we should one day take this activities on boardto update GTR UNR 40 and UNR 47. Not yet that there is some starting with this activity. Dowe have some idea in the informal working group? You have noticed that the transposition is needed or could be needed. Do you have some ideas to give as well possibilities to start withthis, Niels? Thank you, Chair, for the question. Well, there should be some interest from a contracting party to have this transposition. So that's the main question. So the group in the GRP isbigger than the group in the EPPR. So maybe there are contracting parties which are present in the GRP which are maybe not yet part of the EPPR but would be interested in the transpositionof the UN GTR No. 2 into UNR regulation. So that's the request. Yes, the question is there.I think they can handle with the GTR and they implemented in their region. So I don't seeat the moment a reaction from the floor to do it. I don't know if in the informal workinggroup EPPR maybe some contracting parties who are involved there starting maybe this activitybut they said that is not the case now. So at the moment not. I think everyone is happywith the GTR and not to transpose the GTR in the UNR. I see that there is no reaction here in the cannot force the situation at the moment. Also the regions outside the EU. But if theneed is there, then, of course, you have to come within the EPPR group or here in the GPE to say, okay, we want to have an update of these regulations 40 and 47 to bring it in line with the GTR's development. But the GTR developers do their job. So that is already very good.But the transposition regulation is not there at the moment. Niels. Yes, thank you, Chair. Just because we uploaded the presentation also quite late. So sorry for that since we had themeeting on Tuesday. Just to inform you, if you will have an interest, it can also be on the later date, but please inform the group, the leadership team that we can start discussion if we can do the transposition or start the transposition or someone is interested in thetransposition. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Because specific in a UNR, you have also the type approval procedure dealing with the levels which you have in the GTR which is not in the GTR itself.So this is one of the positive elements and the harmonization issue when you have the GTRintroduced in the UNR. So okay. We keep it on the table. And if there is a request from the regions to say, okay, this is helpful for us to implement the development in the EPPR, inthe GTR in our region, we have benefit within the UNR, then please raise this issue and canstart the activity. But now I think it is not needed, I suppose. But thank you, Niels, for your update in the EPPR and the progress of your activity specific interesting about theelectrification in the two and three wheels and also the relation and the contact you have already with the EPPR, sorry, with the EVE group. This is very promising. So thank you very muchfor updating us on your work in the EPPR group. Then we have in the afternoon, we can startwith agenda point 11, international whole vehicle type approval, the IWTA and the data for our ambassador. I think it will be an oral information sharing with us how we stand. No documents,but Bill can briefly hear us on where we are. Bill, you have the floor. Yes, thank you, Chair. Yes, the main point that I have reported on over the last few years as I have been attendingin my role not only IWTA but also informal working group data was the subject of universal identifier you will probably remember. There was over the last few meetings some quite heated discussionson this. As you will know, it came back to GRPE. In fact, all of the GRs on a number of occasions questions about what we are going to do with each of the regs and everything there. We formed at the last meeting an opinion in GRPE that at least for the time being we don't supportUI in any of our regs. I reported that to informal working group data and they confirmed that all but one GR has come back with exactly the same opinion. It pretty much looks and I'msaying sort of from a bit of opinion and a bit of expectation which is why I didn't particularly want to put it in writing, but it pretty much looks like UI will die as a concept. I'm sure there are people in the room who would be very happy about that. To me, it was irrelevant.I personally saw a very, very slight advantage to a couple of GR regs if it was there. I was totally convinced that the burden to at least approval authorities was considerable and faroutweighed the benefit to industry of having it. That's the status on UI. The only other thing really to report is the status on IWVTA itself. Again, it's something that's more ofa sort of a very informal status report than anything that can be formally said. Of course, we have regulation 0. It's a regulation and as we all know once a regulation exists it neverceases to exist. Within GRPE we still have regulation 15 as one of our regulations that's still on the books of the 58 agreement, the predecessor to reg 83 that is only in use outsideof the major regions today. So that's where we are and regulation 0 will continue to exist. That said, we had a standing agenda point in IWG, IWVTA to report the number of approvalsthat had been issued to regulation 0. And with great pride a couple of years ago Japan reported that an approval had been issued. Since then my understanding is that Japan has issued a 2nd approval and I believe KBA has issued an approval and that's been it now for a periodof time. If you try to look on the positive side it's a chicken and egg situation. Manufacturers will not apply for reg 0 approvals until there is a clear acceptance and usage of reg 0 approvalsand probably contracting parties will not put a lot of effort into making a clear acceptance and usage until there are approvals there to be accepted and used. So the feeling that Itook from the group was that really the activities of IWVTA, on occasion this week when talking informally to people used a phrase of riding a dead horse to the graveyard. That's perhapsunfair but I would very much say it appears to be a situation that's on ice. I'm happy to be corrected by anyone with any involvement to the thing but I thought it was fair to givemy viewpoint as Ambassador to the group and that's where it stands. So thank you very much.Thank you, Bill. If that's the situation, then it is the situation. It's good to reflect what'sgoing on in the IWVTA as well as in the data in the unique identifier. I agree that the uniqueidentifier for our activities on emission has no additional value. There was, of course, in the lighting, there was the rationale in the beginning of starting with the unique identifierand there was an essential need to start with that. But it was a little bit taking over the all that could be taken to all approvals which now after these years, that's not the case.I have not reflected on what is the IWVTA issue because it gives a framework of the package where you see where we have the type approval issues, all the type approval issues dealingwith. So there was the two levels but I'm not involved in that activities so I cannot saytoo much and say the wrong words. But your message is clear that there is not very much enthusiasm on this. So we will follow the activities and I'm happy that you will do that and reporthere in GOP on how we stand there in the two informal Working Groups. And the floor is openfor any reflection other than what I do here to you because you are the linking pin to that group. So if someone is giving some ideas to you which you can forward in that group, thenthe floor is open. I don't see that is not the case. So okay. Thank you, Francois, of course.Unfortunately, I cannot do a GRP oral report. So Bill, can you please provide a few written notes of what I should how I should reflect your oral report to the written report of GRP?Thank you. I shall do that and I shall try not to refer to dead horses in graveyards. Yes.I think it is wise to do. Okay. So then we have taken all the topics for today. And we comeback tomorrow specific also on the schedule of the meetings for the GRP for this year and 2025 as well. So I hope that you have kind of a reflection that we can make a decision tomorrowhow we will fill in our activities for the following after this GRP session. We have, of course, stillsome work to do tomorrow. We have the informal Working Group status report on the VAQ, vehicleinterior air quality and we have the activities on the task force on the automated vehicles regulation screening activities, the task force AVRS which will be done by the Netherlands. We havethere an informal document. And we come back to our GRP priorities on this and we have therealso an informal 37 from OICA for oh, we did that. Yeah. Sorry. No. Sorry. Make a mistake.We already handled that. So this is, I think, other points would pop up by you what you want to tackle tomorrow. So we can now already put that on our agenda. If not, then we keep itthat way. So we will say good evening, good dinner and we will see each other tomorrow morning, 9:30. Thank you."}
{"title": "", "text": "open the 2758th meeting of the 95th session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. I welcome the Delegation of the Republic of Congo. They are here in Geneva for the review of their 5th and6th combined periodic reports under the convention. I would like to give the floor to the head ofDelegation, Her Excellency, Madame Minister Mbuku Kimbatsa. The floor is yours, Madame. MadameChair, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, please allow me at the outset on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Congo and the Delegation thatI have the honor of leading here to address my warmest greetings to you and thank you most sincerely for having invited us to this honorable forum for a constructive dialogue on the protectionof the promotion of the rights of children in my country. Madame Chair, despite the general context characterized by the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the number of conflicts around the world, Congo has pursued its efforts to fulfill its obligations with a view to improvingchildren's well-being. When it comes to the issue of the rights of the child, this attention is reflected by a number of activities undertaken and strengthening of the legal institutionalframework for promoting and protecting the rights of the child. Please allow me at this juncture to provide you with additional useful information above and beyond our two reports concerningthe situation of the rights of the child in our country. Madame Chair, the legal institutional framework for protecting the rights of the child in Congo has been strengthened by a numberof legal and regulatory texts that already enforce. For example, we have law 10 of 2022, establishingthe prisons code. Law 29 of 2023, establishing protection and assistance for internally displaced persons in the Republic of Congo. In Article 4 there is a list of vulnerable persons concerned.The Mubara law of the 4th of May, 2022 on combating violence against women in the Republic of Congo.Law 41 of 2021, establishing the right of asylum and the status of refugees. Law 22 of 2019 oncombating trafficking in persons. Decree 2022/1301 on the establishment mandate organization andfunctioning of the national committee to eradicate statelessness in the Republic of Congo. Decree 20/19/199, establishing special measures for issuing civil status documents to indigenouspersons. Decree 2021/169 on the creation mandate organization and functioning of the national coordinating committee for civil registration. And decree 2021/503, establishing the higherstatistics committee and decree 2022/308 adopting the national policy for reforming and modernizing civil registration in the Republic of Congo. And lastly, the decree of 23rd of January, 2023on the creation, organization, makeup and functioning of the children's parliament in Congo. In view of the implementation of this last decree from the 26th of May to the 5th of June of last year,a general meeting to elect the parliament of children was held throughout the country. This led to 328 junior members of parliament being elected at national, departmental and communal level.The aim is to promote and disseminate the rights of the child and encourage childrento express themselves and to outline solutions for the problems that affect them and help them discover the rules and basic principles of democracy and to disseminate civic and moral values. The parliamentheld its inaugural session on the 19th of November, 2023. Madam Chair, it is worth noting that on the international day of the rights of the child on 20th of November, the children's parliament in Congoheld a congress and called upon the government and the prime minister, the head of government along with the ministers of social affairs, justice, education and health as well as the minister of youth torespond to their questions. I would like to say quite clearly that this meeting was held with theexcellent cooperation of our permanent and faithful partner UNICEF. We would like to extend our sincere thanks to UNICEF. Madam Chair, I would also like to come back to the progress reflected in the Mubara lawconcerning the rights of the child. In fact, the law foresees that girls are covered and that thestatute of limitations will only start counting when they reach adulthood. Furthermore, support froma psychologist or social worker is requested when a girl is heard having been a victim of sexual violence and lastly, those associations fighting against violence committed against women while they arestill minors can also support victims by becoming parties to civil proceedings. In addition to these examples of texts in force, a number of others have been drawn up and are currently being adopted,notably draft codes and a law establishing special procedure for declaring and registering births and texts to apply law 4 of 2010 which establishes the child protection code in Congo. There is a draftdecree setting out the number of jobs which are prohibited as well as the kind of companies whichcannot employ children and the age limit on that prohibition. There is also a draft decreeto set up a children's observatory as well as an early warning system against the violation of children's rights. Madam Chair, in addition to these texts, the Republic of Congo is also paying special attention to protecting children's rights through a number of measures taken during this period. Thus, when itcomes to violence against children, we have had UNICEF support in two studies conducted in 2022 on children in street situations and on the move including children victims of trafficking and those victims of gender-based violence. November of last year we worked with UNICEF and a consultantto draw up a national strategy for preventing and responding to violence against children. This strategy will be backed up by an action plan. Furthermore, a pilot project has been rolled out for the integrated child protection system in the Lokumu Department and in the Mongali Bar in Brazzaville.This means that 2,421 children victims of violence have been taken into carethrough the community committees for protecting children. This experiment is currently being assessed by an independent expert so we can identify good practices which we can use for gradually extending the holistic child protection system throughout the country. When it comes to civilrights and fundamental freedoms, in line with the child protection code in Congo, particularly Articles 30, 31 and 32, we have undertaken a number of activities. These include creating outreach clubs,reading clubs as well as theater groups involving children in school councils, having children participate in community level child protection committees. When it comes to family environmentand alternative care, practice in Congo is in line with its international commitments. So responsibility is often shared between the mother and the father. When it comes to situations in whicha child's safety, health, education or morals are undermined because of parents' failure to fulfill their responsibilities, the children's court can intervene to take the appropriate measures,notably through providing foster care. In the 118 social welfare constituencies around Congo,family education workshops have been organized for families and also there have been awareness-raising sessions on basic family practices. These have been organized by the Lissunge System of Social Networksproject. When it comes to child adoption, Congo is aligning its laws with international legal instruments in this area. That is why we are integrating the aforementioned the following text, I should say,into domestic law, notably the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on Children's Rights and Wellbeing, the Hague Convention on Child Protection and Cooperation in Intercountry Adoption.In the area of health, we want to strengthen the quality of health services and bring them up to the same level in rural and urban areas and this is why cost-free treatment is available to childrenhas been since 2013. Notably, care for malaria is free in integrated health centers for children up to the age of 15. There is free vaccination for children up to 11. There is free deworming forchildren up to the age of 5. There is free Vitamin A supplements for children up to the age of 15 andthere is free HIV treatment as well. When it comes to education, leisure and cultural activities, a number of efforts have been deployed, notably promote inclusive schools and ensure the physical accessibilityof school buildings for children living with a disability. When it comes to cultural and leisure centers, we have the national leisure policy and the implementing strategy is just awaiting a validationnow. We would also like to point out that more and more private stakeholders are interested in opening up leisure centers. When it comes to data collection, the government has signed a memorandum of understandingwith both ends believing an American NGO with a view to setting up software for collecting data on children living outside the family setting in the Republic of Congo. Currently we are collecting data in privatechildren's shelters in Prazerville, Pontenoir and Dolly Z. When it comes to Indigenous Children and Children with Disabilities, on the 9th of August every year when we commemorate the International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous Peoples, particular emphasis is placed on raising the awareness of localauthorities, sectoral state services, local communities and the Indigenous Peoples themselves on their rights. A national action plan 2022/2025 for improving the quality of life of IndigenousPersons is currently being implemented. The problem of accessibility for children with disabilitiesto infrastructure and services has been taken into consideration by a number of measures including one, the enactment of law 6 of 2019 establishing the building and architecture code. There are specialprovisions therein on accessibility for people with disabilities so that they can access public buildings. We have also organized a survey of education. One of the major objectives of this isto solve the problem of children with disabilities and their access to school buildings. Madam Chair,we have disseminated the Convention on the Rights of the Child in our country through key messages on this legal instrument through the mass media and thanks to media being involved in the commemorationof the 20th of November and this was in conjunction with UNICEF and civil society. Despitethis considerable progress we face a number of challenges including setting up an efficientdata collection system and a centralized national database on child protection and children's rights.It is increasing the budget for the noncontributory social protection sector to enable the country toredistribute income and reduce poverty, vulnerability and social inequalities and setting up free education which has been greatly constrained by the economic crisis. Nevertheless, these difficulties do notundermine the government's determination to protect children's rights. This is reflected through the implementation of recommendations and observations which you will be able to take stock of during this dialogue. So that is the summary, Madam Chair, of the useful and recent informationon the situation of children's rights and the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Congo. Before I conclude I would like to introduce my Delegation comprising His Excellency Mr. Emma Clovis Guillaume, Ambassador and Congress permanent representativein Geneva here on my left. Mr. Rock Guislan Edson, advisor on social affairs in the ministry. Mr. Patrick Elvis Sibengobo, administrative and legal advisor to the women's empowerment ministry. ChristianRockmabiala, director general of social affairs and also on my left Evelyn Bertemuto who is the director of the family in the ministry. Then in front of me we have Ms. Jacqueline Enzelancazi, director of cooperation ministry of health and population. Mr. Gerardo Nongo, advisor to thepermanent mission. Mr. Nick Anderson-Ikama, also an advisor to the permanent mission. Mr. Jean-Arsene Bouta, head of service for the children's rights protection in the ministry of social affairs.Ms. Gertrude Olga Musitu, head of office for the minister for preschool, primary, secondary, education and literacy. Ms. Liz Kummel-Benge, assistant to the minister. Serge Bruno Mianata who is a press officerfor the minister and Alan Beccali who is one of the members of the minister's office. I thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. Now we are moving on to the 1st round of questionsand that will take us 30 minutes. After that there will be a break so that you can organize yourself before you begin with your responses. So I will now hand over to the coordinator of the country task force,Mr. Benoit Fankerspilk. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to begin by bidding a warm welcome to theCongolese Delegation. I see that we have high level representation and many representatives,ministers and permanent representatives of Congo here in Geneva. I do hope that we will have a constructive dialogue with you for everybody's benefit. The aim is to allow us in the committeeto better understand the situation of children in the Republic of Congo and how your governmentimplements its commitments. We have carefully studied your 2019 report. It is already four years old. Lots has happened since then. You have pointed a lot of that out as well. Since then we submitted a list ofissues to you and we would like to thank you for the honesty in your report because you do tell us about both the progress and the difficulties faced. You have a number of projects in hand. We have a lot ofquestions about them to see how much progress has been made and what the sticking points we are. Thatwill help us to make the most pertinent recommendations possible. Perhaps I can introduce my colleagues on the task force here on my left, Ms. Valina Todorova, opposite me, Suzanne Ajo and also opposite me butfurther down the table is Ms. Rosaria Correa. They will all take the floor during the course of this dialogue as well as the other Committee members who will want to take the floor at any given momentthey choose. So we will try to cover the 1st three clusters in this 1st stage. The 1st concerns legislation. I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that my 1st question concerns the implementationof the 2010 law on child protection. It is now 14 years old, this law. In your opening remarks, youreferred to a number of implementing regulations which are still being discussed. You have drafts,draft decrees, draft regulations. I would like to know what is holding things up. This is a very generous law which explicitly finds its basis in the Convention because it reflects a number of theConvention's articles but it is still not being implemented 14 years later. Why is it taking so long? I think that we can say the same thing about law 12 of 2014 and others. So what is holdingthings up and what is the time frame for their full implementation? We need not only the implementingdecrees but also a budget staff for the implementation. That all takes time. But we need 1st of all, the political will to drive this forward and constantly follow up on it. When it comes tosigning and ratifying international instruments, we have seen that Congo has deployed efforts to ratify a number of instruments in recent years and that is a very positive sign. Nevertheless,I can't see any plans to ratify the optional protocol to the Convention against torturewhich includes setting up a national preventive mechanism on torture and gives a mandate to the United Nations Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture to visit places of detention where childrenmay be held. Obviously, all places of detention may be visited but we are particularly concerned with those where children may be held. Secondly, coordination. We know that there is a nationalcoordinating committee for child protection which has been set up but we would like to know a bit more about its makeup and mandate and we can say the same thing about the pilot project forthe pilot project for child protection. We haven't found a great deal of information about the number of meetings and so on and so forth. We do believe that coordination is a vital issue for implementingthis convention, particularly because there are a number of different levels of government and different sectors that are involved. Also, implementation of the convention requires a strategy. In your report,you have referred to the national strategy for children and this comes back to the 2014 concludingobservations issued by our committee. So we would like to know have you adopted and monitored a national strategy for implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child because this was a recommendationthat was made to you. Also, when it comes to global strategies, we would like to know what is the mandate and makeup and organization of the village and community committees and what kind of servicesdo they provide. We have also heard about a number of different pilot projects at local level. Youreflected on these in Sibiti to see whether or not you would extend the child protection services. So we would like to know what were the results of that follow-up to the pilot project. The issue ofresources is also a crucial one. I would like to point out that in the report there are figures that are quite surprising for some years. When I look at the funds for children and the social sectors and thetotal of two budgets, I don't find that the budgets stack up. So perhaps there are issues there. But for the budget line for children between 2021 and 2022, we have a drop of 1,300,000 to 800,000CFA francs. And I can't quite find an explanation for that decrease. Could you perhaps shed some light on that? That would be interesting. Similarly, what does this budget actually cover? What departments arecovered by the budget? And is there a budget devoted to children? Is it part of another budget? And perhaps it's not as visible as that. We would like to have more information about the percentages of the budget granted to the healthcare, education sector, the social protection sector for those who are vulnerableor for the displaced. We would like to have a more detailed budget that would allow us to more carefully keep an eye on the specific implementation of that budget. Also looking at the budget still, we havenoted that quite regularly there is a particularly low percentage of the budget is in fact dispersed. And that's quite startling because the budget seems to be there. It's been adopted. But it hasn't beendispersed. And these are very low percentages that I'm referring to. Of course, we would have questionsaround that. With respect to data collection now in the replies to the list of questions provided are quite insightful because when it comes to each question related to statistics, further information,disaggregated information, the response is that there is no data available. You have said that there are projects underway. But I have more of a general question. What specific plans are in placeto have a data collection system based on clear-cut indicators involving budgets to guide policies? Without these data, how can you provide for policies and implement them with the necessary budgets?And I would like to move to independent oversight. That's also an issue of paramount importance. You talked about the national commission for human rights. It seems to cover children as well based on your report. But we haven't seen a single report making reference to children. We haven't seena report either. Perhaps it hasn't yet been published. But we would be delighted if there is such a report. But we would like to have a better understanding of who is responsible for the independent oversight of the implementation of the Convention and who can receive complaints, give follow-up to these complaintsand issue recommendations independently to the state. Here I would underscore that the national commission does not hold a status in line with the Paris principles. I need to speed up a little because I have a very long list of issues and questions. And I'm running out of time. I would like to have moreinformation now on initiatives taken when it comes to disseminating the Convention systematically because you pointed to a number of specific initiatives. But I would like to know systematically what you are doing in terms of providing information, training and dissemination of the CRC Convention amongst children.The issue of cooperation with civil society, I have noted that civil society is requested to be involved in the follow-up and in particular to care and support for children who are placed in institutions andtaken away from their families. It would appear, however, that there is no budget for this and I would like to know about the monitoring and oversight undertaken by the state party. It is not down todelegating responsibility to civil society organizations but this is responsibility down to the state and it needs to be appropriate. Furthermore, civil society has a very significant role to playin terms of analysis, criticism and putting forward proposals to the state. What role is entrusted to civil society and to what extent is civil society recognized as a fundamental stakeholder to implementthe rights of the child in the country? Now, the issue of the rights of the child and the business sector,the implementation of law 8/2010 appears to be quite low. This sets the list of jobs which are permittedfor children to undertake. So I would like to know what drafts or what plans are in the pipeline andand the environmental assessment impact when it comes to companies, the child rights impact assessment. I would like to have information about that. How is this assessment undertaken based on the rolesof companies? Is there a centralization body to receive complaints, particularly for children who have been subject to harm and as a result of the actions of businesses and companies? Now, I wouldlike to conclude, even though I have many other questions to ask, I would like to raise the question of non-discrimination. Generally speaking, what overall actions have been implemented to guaranteea non-discrimination based on one's gender and belonging to an ethnic group? I will revert to follow-up questions on other aspects which I feel to be important. Thank you.Thank you, Madame Chair. Thank you also to the Minister. You have provided us with the wealth ofinformation, particularly on the legal aspects, the legislation decrees, et cetera. I would like to deal with the issue of birth registration and you discussed that. Very often if we look at decreesstating that birth registration is free of charge, how can the population understand that the birth certificate is actually free of charge? Very often decrees are in place but people are not aware ofthem. This means that there are parallel costs that need to be incurred. The civil registries make up costs. I don't know what Congo is doing to combat these parallel costs and against racketeering ofthe population. Now, on the civil status, we have I feel that the procedure is somewhat difficultto understand for the population because one needs to address the prosecutor and the courts who as aparent can actually follow through with the procedure if they are not accompanied and supported. Now,those living in far-flung areas, children living in camps and children born out of wedlock, I thinkthat there is a distinction to be drawn here and I would like to know how these children gain identity. How are they actually declared? Now, the rate of birth registration, I would like to have information on that in the country. And you promised to set up civil registration centers. Will they coverthe entire country? And I would like to know how the population can have access to them.And how will these registration centers also be equipped with registers withcivil, with those working in the civil registry, will they receive regular training so as to inform the population? I'm still on issues related to civil registration. You talked about the nationality codeand I would like to know whether an assessment has been carried out to identify the number of stateless children and what are you doing to enable these children to gain nationality, particularlywhen they are born of stateless parents. This really is a situation which runs counter to the rights of the child. I would like to know whether the Republic of Congo will undertake measuresso as to guarantee nationality to those stateless children. You also discussed the children's Parliament. In the country, are children authorized to form associations so that they can freely expressthemselves? How do these children express themselves? Do these children express themselves? And how is their freedom of expression put into practice? Those are the questions I have for the time being. Thankyou. Thank you, Ms. Aho. Rosario Correa. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you very much indeed and goodafternoon to all of those present and those who are following us on the webcam and in particular the children of the Republic of Congo. I would like to extend a welcome to the Delegation and thank you very much for the very sincere inputs provided to us. You have informed us about a whole raft of lawswhich means that you have a solid legislative corpus. But I would like to ask two clusters of questions on violence against children and on the family environment and alternative care. I would like you to tell usmore about the measures that the state has taken to combat in society corporal punishment and to what extent you have attained results in terms of percentages. We have been told that corporal punishment is prohibited by law 4 of 2010. We are concerned that in addition to not defining whatcorporal punishment actually is, it isn't quite clear in which environment it takes place. Similarly, in the report it is not clear to us about the strategies that have been devised so that in an educationalfashion, the mindset or the culture of corporal punishment is changed. We also see that in 93 and 94, paragraph 93 and 94, the percentages of cases brought to the minor's court and they refer to alltypes of violence. However, based on the statistics, there is a contrast here in terms of children who are victims of violence. Generally speaking, the situation, the true situation of children who arevictims of abuse and the cases that are being brought. So if you could perhaps clear up the issue here of the discrepancy in figures, perhaps you have a national database so that we can have a comparison as tothe reality of the abuse that is taking place and how it is being judged in the courts. You say that there is a national action plan which makes reference to setting up an observatory which is an excellentthing. Could you tell us what unit this would fall under and how will you guarantee its sustainability and independence? Similarly, it has been flagged and you have just repeated that UNICEF collaborates withyou actively and you mentioned a comprehensive national strategy to prevent types of violence such as corporal punishment. Here I would like to know whether that strategy takes into account the situation ofchildren of minors and whether you are considering diversity and gender. So generally who takes part in building up and devising this strategy which you have with UNICEF? Another important question I haveis regardless of the fact that this strategy is being adopted, what measures are being taken right now in terms of national coordination to address protection of children against all types of violence includingcorporal punishment? You have made reference to the law. I would like to know whether it is beingimplemented and incorporated in educational programmes which have a direct link with minors, children, in particular girls, young girls. We understand that there are many other activities undertaken withUNICEF in terms of training officials, et cetera, but could you tell us about the final outcome of these measures and actions and the scope in terms of protection and prevention and punishment meted outin the Republic of Congo? What actions has the state undertaken to truly implement within a public policycapacity these capacities? I'm not I'm a little unclear about how the state or what the protocol of the state is when addressing abuse and neglect on the one hand and torture and corporal punishment on theother. How do you identify this? How do you differentiate it and how do you deal with it both in law and in practice? We would like you to explain the different types of exploitation because it would be veryinteresting for us if you could clarify that point. In the state party report there are no disaggregated data. There is simply a very short list of the cases reported. And these are cases that apparently arestill pending. There is some information when it comes to the number of children placed in securitycenters, safety centers or other environments. And could you please clarify whether this information is still up to date? And could you supply more information about this type of complaints? How does the stateguarantee access to ensure that there is protection of victims so that the child victims have access to the justice system? I would also like you to provide more information about the reported cases againstthe military. I would like to know whether the officials have meted out the law and whetherthere have been sentences handed down. There is also a worrying issue here on gender violence. In addition to the study that you make reference to in the report on which UNICEF collaborated in 2021,has the Republic of Congo drawn up another report? And if so, could you compare it with us, share it with us? And if not, could you tell us why not? There is a whole issue here with harmful practices. We knowthat there are legal prohibitions in place, but in practice, how are you eradicating it and what are the results and outcomes? If you have any statistics, it would be important to have a comparison so thatwe can look at the headway made. Another important aspect in terms of the protection of children in a street situation, we know that we need to distinguish in the Republic of Congo between children living inthe street alone and those who are accompanied. Now, we would like to know whether the state has conducteda study which could shed greater light into the magnitude of the problem or if you are thinking about conducting a study to look at the magnitude of the problem of children living in the street.The so-called which children, I would like to know how you are grappling with this perverse situation.In terms of the national policy of the state and social actions to combat the scourge of street children, could you tell us a little bit more about that? When it comes to issues of torture and cruelinhuman or degrading treatment, could you also provide an explanation about the cases wherethe perpetrators have been duly tried and the sanctions handed down? Could you tell us about the number of children who are victims of cyber bullying grooming online? You made referenceto a reform that the state is undertaking in the judicial field. In terms of access to justice, could you tell us about the status of that reform and whether you are considering the rights ofvictims who are children and also the issue of therapeutic participation and criminal investigations? We would like to know whether there is participation there and are you adopting a multidisciplinaryapproach for children and victims and is this being considered as part of this reform so that there is a friendly environment in terms of the justice system for children? Now, when it comesto the hotline, you said that there is a phenomenon in terms of family breakdown and I would like toknow about the sustainability of this hotline amongst administrative and governmental bodies.I understand that there is external governmental cooperation but I would really like to know how you are going to maintain this program or this hotline over time. Now, the family environment,I would like to know about the status of the draft bill on the person's code and the progress madeor have you already adopted this code? And I'm referring to the shortcomings in the family environment. So what is the state doing to ensure that Article 37 of the family code is being implemented?Do you have any statistics on the situation in which children placed in institutions? What are the reasons for being placed? And how are the standards of the convention being incorporated into the draftbills of foster families? And my final question now, the child-rearing programs that you have could you tell us about these to have further information about them? Thank you very much, Madam Chair.Thank you very much. That brings us to the end of the 1st round of questions. So we now will have a 15 minute break. So if you can please be back here at about 5 past 4. There is a room next door thatyou can use just to organize your answers and then when you come back you will have from the time that we start again until 5:30 and then we are going to take the 2nd round of questions which you willanswer tomorrow together with anything that you don't manage to finish this afternoon. So now it is 15minutes break and we will see you back. Okay, colleagues, as soon as everyone has taken theirseats we will recommence. Now Your Excellency, I'm going to hand over the floor to you now and you canorganize how you would like to give the answers to the questions that have been put to you and you have until 5:30 as I mentioned. If you haven't finished answering all the questions by then we will simply pause, take the 2nd round of questions so that you have until tomorrow to prepare and then we willcontinue at 10:00 tomorrow. Over to you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you for giving us backthe floor. I would like to thank the task force for their questions on the national report of Congo. Sotask force leader, I would like to thank you for all the questions you asked about laws and regulations.What I can tell you is that it is a pleasure for us to work with such a dynamic task force as yours andin fact you have asked a number of relevant questions but I think many of them have already been answered in the report. But we have a chance for this interactive discussion with this large Delegationnow. So we are happy to try and provide answers for you now but if we are unable to, we can provide you with additional information tomorrow or even send it to you from Congo because I think that's all part andparcel of the exercise. The aim here is to make improvements and to ensure better implementation of children's rights in our country. It is for everyone's good. It is for the good of the nation.The country belongs to the children because children are our future leaders and if they are not properly supported, if their rights are not promoted and protected, then they won't become the leaders wewant. Now with regards to the 2010 law, I have to say that I agree with you. The law was adopted a very long time ago. So what's holding it up? Why have we not got the implementing regulations? Well,what I can tell you is that we haven't just got decrees. We have got a commission which has been setup whose sole purpose is to implement the 2010 Act. We will always come back to this text when we meetwith the United Nations or the African Union and tell you that all the implementing regulations will be enforced by the end of this year. That's our commitment because this has taken far too long.So we have the draft decrees setting out the prohibited areas of labour, the various categoriesand so on and so forth. Now with regard to the ratification of the optional protocol to theConvention Against Torture and its effect on children, well, I think that everything is in place. We haveratified the Convention and it is the Minister of Justice which is dealing with this and I believe that over the next few days you will be able to get information and everything is in place for children.Now with regard to the functioning coordination now, we recognize that there are shortcomings.We need to better organize this coordination so that we follow the highest possible standards. Now I would like to give the floor to members of the Delegation who will be able to provide you withgreater insight into the areas left pending. Data collection. We have raised your awareness aboutour shortcomings in data and statistical collection. We are trying to improve the system in our country so that we can obtain all possible statistics on children or different categories. We have justvalidated the report on the general population and household survey. That was just two weeks ago.Then the Statistics Office will pursue its work on all areas of data collection but we are aware ofthe serious shortcoming in statistics. We are unfortunately unable to provide you with exactnumbers. Now with regard to implementing the pilot project, you were quite right to refer to ourexperience in Sibeti in 2023 and the Mongali district in Brazzaville. A study is being conducted and if you wish we will send you in the report in due course so that you personally will be able to takestock of it. So I would like to give the floor to members of the Delegation in due course but beforeI do just a word on the relationship between the Government and civil society. I think you are aware of the network of actors working on children and family breakdown situations. They work with theministry and the president of the association, the association has held meetings. So the door is open. We also have other NGOs that we work with. There is an association called Albinos do Congoworking for persons with albinism. They have an excellent relationship with the ministry and it is true to say that there is no specific budget line for NGOs in the ministry's budget. We are aware ofthat. But when the NGOs organize activities as far as possible, we provide them with support so that they can go about their activities. Obviously, this requires a framework, well, structured legalframework. We are working on this so that we are able to raise state resources to support the NGOswho have an excellent relationship with us. Repair set up a toll free number for children victims of violence and their staff are able to provide support. Also in this network, the repair network,we have our social workers working alongside them because they need this kind of support for the children they work with. I imagine that there are some members of the Delegation who will be ableto provide further answers for the task force coordinator. We have the Minister of Social Affairsand then I will come back to Ms. Ajo's questions. Thank you, Minister. This is the Director General.I would like to come back to Ms. Correa's questions about children living in street situations. With UNICEF support, we have conducted two studies, children on the move and children in street situations.There is also a study on children victims of gender based violence. We will be able to submit the reports directly to you. Now, when it comes to the Telem project, I am the coordinator of the project.It started in January 2021 and we will finish in 2024 and we have got ministerial authorizationfor extending the project to 2026. The aim is to support vulnerable populations, including childrenand we finance projects which support children. I would also like to come back to the children's parliament. It is very important. We wanted to set this up as long as it was 2003 but it was set up in2023. Just to add to what the Minister was saying, we now have a national office with seven members andin each department we have three member offices. So the inaugural session was finally held at the end oflast year. So this means to say we have 328 deputies in our country and you will see how they help disseminate the message and we had the inaugural session in Brazzaville and this wasthanks to the offices in the capital and the departments. So there are children who were invited also to the parliament to hear the budgetary debate and we make sure that children's voices are heard bythe authorities so that we can make progress in the affairs that concern them. So that's what I wanted to say to you with regard to those three questions. Thank you very much, Director General. The advisornow may have something to add to the task force coordinator's questions. So we have the head ofservices now, child protection services. Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Minister. I would liketo refer to the questions raised by the task force coordinator with regard to our laws. When it comesto implementing law 4 of 2010 on child protection in Congo, I can tell you that as the minister has saidthat we have been working on the adoption of the implementing regulations for a long time but they have not yet been published. In October 2023, there was a joint decree issued by the ministries of justice and social affairswhich established a commission to work on the implementing regulations. The commission has met,it met on the 22nd and 23rd of December to work through the text which are up for approval again. Wehave carried forward three out of the five texts which were revised and so I think that there is a draft decreewhich will change the nature and scope of the work and there is a draft decree for establishing the child'sobservatory. So the commission has not finished its work yet but it has pushed forward these three textsfor adoption and as soon as the commission has finished the review, they will be up for adoption. So originally there were five implementing decrees. There are now three which will be used for implementinglaw 4 of 2010. So I just wanted to say that that's what we have been doing. We have been revising theprevious versions of these texts. If you are not happy with all those answers, the task force coordinatorwill come back to them. I would just like to point out that we are not the DRC. We are the Republic ofCongo. Now on birth certificates throughout the Republic of Congo, there are town halls, subprefectureswhere births can be declared. But parents don't get there speedily enough and in the proper way. Sothere are social structures to support families who are too late in declaring births. So we are issuingbirth certificates for indigenous families who are illiterate now and we have been working with the social affairs districts to record and register children from vulnerable families from indigenousfamilies and from remote regions so that birth certificates can be issued for those children. Now for children born to stateless parents, there is no prohibition of stateless parents declaringthe birth of their child. It is the parent who is stateless. It is not the child. If the child is born in Congolese territory, that child is Congolese. It is up to the parents though to go through theprocedures. Now children from unmarried couples, fathers can recognize the child so that the childhas access to a birth certificate. Sometimes the fathers fail to recognize the child and so the pregnant woman is left alone. But she can turn to a brother, a cousin or her father who can alsoattest to the child and declare the birth of the child. So all the conditions are in place so thatwhenever a child is born on Congolese territory, it will have access to a birth certificate. If it's done too late, then you go to one of the 118 social affairs districts so that a birth certificate canbe established. But there are parents who don't carry out their duties, who don't worry about this and that's where social workers step in. They carry out an important role. They go visit thefamilies who have a child without a birth certificate. But it is not just because you have birth certificatethat you can't go to school. It doesn't mean to say that you won't be taken care of by the socialnetworks. So it's up to parents to ensure there's a birth certificate. Schooling is compulsory up tothe age of 15 or 16. So everything is in place for birth certificates to be issued. Now, how childrenmake their views heard. This occurs in school. There are parents' offices in schools at all levels.Children can go there as well. And there are children who have become members of Parliament. Wherever they are, local authorities, the prefectures, the town halls, they have been instructed to ensurethat when they organize activities at municipal or departmental levels in school holidays, thenchildren are to be involved. We are starting the school year now and we can't stop children from going to school. But what we do is we do raise awareness to ensure that the members of thechildren's Parliament can take care of other children and be in touch with them. If there are childrenwho are in difficult family situation, if they face violence, if they are being bullied, if they can't go to school because they haven't got the right equipment, then the member of Parliament in thelocal area should inform the highest authorities so that the appropriate measures can be taken. Sothat's the information that I can provide you on birth registration in Congo, in the Republic of Congo and not the DRC. Now, I don't know if there is anyone in the Delegation who would like to add anything.They are welcome to take the floor now. Thank you, Minister. On birth registration, how are wefacilitating the issuing of birth certificates then? Well, there is a joint decree from the Ministriesof Health and Home Affairs, a decree from the 13th of November 2020 which sets up birth registrationcenters in health facilities, public sector health facilities. The government has taken a number of measures to ensure that registers and other supplies are provided to those birth registration centers inthe health facilities. This is thanks to UNHCR and there are regular awareness raising workshops forthe authorities dealing with the issuance of birth certificates and there are also judgments for thelate registration of births. So we were asked about birth certificates in remote areas. Well, we haveset up ancillary birth registration centers and we are gradually opening up birth registration offices in maternity wards that can issue birth certificates. We are also trying to ensure that there are enoughbirth registration offices and we have the integrated civil registration system project which is to strengthen the current civil registration system so it is more modern and performs better so that we canprovide civil status documents and have high quality statistics in line with international standards.There was also a question about the rate of birth registration. According to the multi indicator survey in 2015, birth registration is around 95% in Congo. Those are the questions that I would liketo answer on the subject of birth registration. So we will now work on Rosalia's questions on corporal punishment and violence against children, the real statistics, the problem of getting accuratestatistics. Perhaps I can reiterate that this is a shortcoming which we are fully aware of but when itcomes to corporal punishment, in schools there at least we can tell you that there is no corporalpunishment any more anywhere in the country. Teachers can no longer strike children. That wasn't the case when I was at school. There was a little cane which was used for hands or feet, but that is no longerthe case in schools. Now in the family setting, in families' homes, I have to confess that I haven'tgot any cameras to see what goes on, but it is only when you can see the visible consequences, the wounds,the cuts, that social workers can take action and see how they can remove a child from the family because things are not going well. What I can tell you is that a complaint has been brought against a motherin Brazzaville. I beg your pardon, this is an assistant mayor who was violent towards his wife's daughter.He tried to flee, but he was caught in the department further north and he was arrested. So times have changed and there are things which are no longer acceptable. We do have shortcomings in reports andin statistics, but we are committed to making the change. There are things happening in the field which are perhaps not written down, which are happening through the state, through NGOs. Soofficially, nationally, there is no more corporal punishment in schools when it comes to families.I can't guarantee what goes on behind closed doors, but on the other hand, officially it is banned.Turning now to which children, as far as I'm aware, these children may be located in far-flung areas.We have 349,000 square kilometers. We have forests, coastlines and there may be child, which children living there, but I don't want to accuse my next door neighbor, let's say, but when it comes to whichchildren in Congo, Brazil, I haven't yet seen a child who has been tortured because they are considered to be which children. Perhaps this happens in the remote areas, perhaps thousands of kilometers awayin one part of the country, this occurs, but in any event, I'm not aware of it. Sexual harassment online.In any event, quite recently, the ministry tasked with digital affairs has drafted a law to monitorthe national networks and to ensure that children are not victims of sexual harassmentonline. Parents, of course, parents give phones to their children and we need to monitor that.Turning to the family environment, we are keeping a close eye on it, as I said previously, to ensure that it isn't a nightmare environment. We wish to guarantee that it is an environment in which childrencan grow up in serenity. I would now like to give the floor to the representative of the ministry ofhealth. Perhaps you could take the floor. Thank you very much indeed, Minister, for giving me the floor.Indeed, there was a question raised about the budget in the ministry of health and whether there are any budgetary lines dedicated to children. Earlier when the minister gave her introductorystatement, she told you about the number of actions taken to protect children. In particular, the fact that healthcare is free of charge for malaria between the ages of 0 to 15, free of charge vaccinationsfor children between 0 and 3, a systematic warming which is free of charge of children between the ages of 0 and 5 and the free provision of vitamin A for children aged between 0 to 5. Of course, I wouldalso mention the HIV AIDS program with retroenter viral drugs which is also administered to children with HIV AIDS. All of this happens through programs which the government has set up to follow up on andcare for children. When I refer to vaccinations, this is the extended vaccination program which does in fact have a budget which is allocated to cover those vaccinations. Together with UNICEF, we have aVIA program which promotes the procurement of vaccinations for children. Now, we don't have any specifically budgetary line for children, but it is rather through these programs which have been setup to care and support for children, the budgetary lines are indeed earmarked for vaccination for the vitamins which are provided to children and to provide care for malaria. So through these programs,we do have a budget granted to care for children. I hope that this satisfies your question with my answer. Thank you very much, Madam. Thank you, Minister. I wanted to add some additional information andreplies to the question raised on corporal punishment. Law No. 4/2010 of the 14th of June 2010 on the protection of children in the street in the Republic of Congo criminalizes in Article 53,corporal punishment. This incurs an imprisonment ranging from three months to one year and a finefor corporal punishment. Corporal punishment, therefore, is indeed prohibited within the family at school and in all settings in the Republic of Congo. When it comes to setting up the nationalpolicy for children protection in line with its powers carries out awareness raising activities with families and in schools to stamp out corporal punishment and to promote positive nonviolentprograms when it comes to educating children. Thank you, Madam. Thank you very much indeed.There was another concern, a question raised by Madam Rosario and this related to the situation ofthe abuse of some children by the security forces. The police force behind such events were removed fromthe civil service. Perhaps we would need legislation in place to confirmthis but once we have this legislation we will be able to make it available to you. There have beenpunishment and they have been removed from as agents of the civil service. There was a question aboutthe punishment to meet it out to those involved, the prison staff. I think the representative fromthe women's ministry could perhaps give you some information about taking into account the younggirls in the Mubara. Thank you, Minister. I would like to add some comments to corporal punishment andviolence in school settings. We have a legal arsenal which is made up of three pieces of legislation, the criminal code to criminalize perpetrators and specifically we have the law of 2010 which is inforce in Congo. Some of the provisions have not yet entered into force because we are awaiting implementing regulations. We have the Mubara law which covers violence, in particular physical violence andpunishment is provided for against perpetrators. A hotline has just been created to enable victimsto call the authorities to report acts of violence to the authorities so thatsanctions are handed down. That's the information I can give you about violence. Thank you very much,indeed, from the representative of the ministry. I would like to come back to the coordinator's question. The percentage of the budget devoted to children in the various ministries, I think that was a concernraised by the coordinator. The representative of the ministry of health has just mentionedthe budgetary lines allocated to children. When it comes to the ministry of social affairs, there is also a budgetary line devoted to children and that budgetary line enables us to carry outactivities, for instance, holding celebration of the African children, the year of the African children or also at the international level. Budgetary lines have also been set up in other ministries.It is true that it seems to be quite there seem to be discrepancies. The budget earmarked to children in the Republic of Congo can be set out in those terms. We are going to address this, Madam Chair,so that we can have more additional information. I think in the report that we have sent in to youthere is information on these budgets for children. Thank you very much, indeed, Madam Head of Delegation. I would like to add some information as to the budget allocated to children. Earlier I talked about theextended vaccination program and we talked about the programs in place against malaria. So there is a program that we have. It is the national program to combat malaria which also allocates fundingto combat malaria for children. This is free of charge. We also have the HIV/AIDS program. It is the national program to combat HIV/AIDS. There again with support from the global fund we receive fundingto care for children in these various areas to combat these diseases. That's what I can tell you. Above and beyond these programs we have many other programs which have been set up by the governmentto provide care for these diseases with the dedicated funds. Thank you very much, Madam.The Director General of Social Affairs, you have the floor. Thank you, Minister. I would like to come back to the issue of the dissemination of the convention. The coordinator said it was quitespecific in nature. Above and beyond the specific nature of the global day for children on the 20th of November we also conduct activities through our social action districts. You will see that messagesare conveyed every Monday so that each children's right is well known. When it comes to civil society,civil society is a partner. They work with us and they support the government's action. We have the RIPO and others as mentioned by the Chair. We have UNICEF which provides us with a great deal of support.There is complimentary work underway here. We are not delegating work to NGOs. We want to work hand in hand to share responsibilities and ensure that what we are doing is well known so that we can work insymbiosis together. We wish to ensure that the best interests of the child are highlighted to assist these children and enable them to enjoy their rights. Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Director General. Wouldyou like to take the floor? I would like to call upon the representative of the ministry for preschool,primary and secondary education. Thank you very much, Minister. Thank you, Minister, for giving me thefloor. I would like to come back to a question about creating children's associations. Let me saythat children are indeed entitled to establish groups or associations within certain bodies at the countrylevel. I'm saying this because children are entitled to create associations and to meet with others as long as no harm is done to anyone. So children are allowed to form groups and associations so thatthey can flourish and develop. Thank you very much, Madam Minister. Thank you to the representative of the ministry of preschool, primary, secondary and literacy education. The adviser now for socialaffairs, please. I would like to give you some figures about the budgetary allocations, specificallyaimed at children. In our report, we provided you with figures. You will see these on page 5. This is the additional report. You will see the budgetary lines for children for 2020. We have 350 million.And for 2021, 1 billion 300,000. For 2022, 800 million. Thank you.Thank you very much, indeed. I think that we have now gone through all of the questions asked. Weremain at your disposal, of course. Madam, would you like to add something? With respect to associations, as the Director General has said, but also the Ministry of Health, we also have associations and NGOswho support and compliment the ministry's actions so as to follow up and care for children. For example, children who come with a cleft palate, let's say, who come to undergo certain operations, we do haveassociations to help them to have healthcare. This is an additional action in addition to the associations work done together with the government. So the work really is complimentary in nature.Thank you. Thank you very much. I think we will perhaps close this round now and give the floor back to the Chair. Well, I think we can now take some follow-up questions then and we can use thetime that way. I already see there is a question from Hind Ayubi Idrisi and then Susanna Ho,Ben Marfan Kerspilk and Valina Todorova. Okay. Hind Ayubi Idrisi.Thank you very much, Madam Chair and welcome to the Delegation for the Republic of Congo. I'm delighted to take part in this dialogue and I would like to commend the State Party on the legislation in forceand the measures taken since the submission of the last report before this Committee. I would like to receive further clarification on a number of points, in particular when it comes to the definitionof the child. The child in the Republic of Congo is under the age of 18. However, the family code clearlystipulates that it's possible to empower children before the age to engage in work, studies, marriage by taking into account their best interests. Could you please explain what these criteria are?How does this take into account the best interests of the child? Why emancipation or independence for study purposes or labor purposes? Still along the lines of the best interests of the child,obviously you are aware that it's not very easy to envisage but what is being done to ensure a broad dissemination of the general comment which the CRC adopted, that's number 14 on the best interests ofthe child to all of those who are working with or for children so that they are well versed in the notion of the best interests of the child as rights, principles and procedures. This leads me on to another question now, Minister. You talked about the Children's Parliament, the junior members ofParliament who are called upon to deal with questions related to other children, e.g. , children with problems in the family. Now for these children to be able to tackle those problems, what resourcesare made available to them so that they can carry out their work properly? I also have another questionand it pertains to children's participation. It's recognized in law that there are members of Parliamentand that there is children's representation who directly ask questions of ministries, the various ministries but I would like to know whether there are any very clear legal provisions which provide forchildren's participation in cases related to them at the legal level but also in an administrative procedure. Thank you very much in advance for any answers you can provide.Thank you very much, Madam Minister from the Republic of Congo for all of the responses provided but Istill have some questions about birth registration. In your report, you have tried to delimit thebirth registration and costs incurred for giving birth in hospitals. So what measures are being taken to ensure that this is being done? Very often it's not only in your country. Birth certificatesare confiscated because maternity costs haven't been paid. So what measures are you taking in your country to avoid that situation? Another question now. What measures have been taken to expeditecivil status in health training? There again, it seems to be a problem. Collaboration and cooperation in this regard tends to be quite difficult and I'm well aware of what I'm referring to. Another questionnow. What is the timeline set for children to declare a child's birth? If it's one month, don't you think that's a very short period of time? It doesn't give parents a lot of time to be aware that they needto declare the birth of the child. One month seems to be fairly short. Now, there has been a committee set up by the decree. I would like to know whether they will tackle the time frame for the declarationof births. Turning now to appropriate information given to children, are measures in place to enablechildren to have access to the Internet and measures to protect them in the digital sphere? You havestarted a study and this was the social affairs ministry on video clubs. What is the state of play of this initiative? Have these video clubs been set up in practice and have they been assessed? Thank you.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the Delegation for the answers provided hither to.In fact, I do have a number of follow-up questions for you. The Children's Parliament, we have spoken quite a lot about this. It has finally been set after 20 years waiting. We are delighted at that. If I haveunderstood correctly, the members have been elected and they have been elected in schools. How can weensure that children who are not attending school who are living in street situations are also representedso that the Parliament is fully representative? And when it comes to the Parliament's mission, does it really have a mission to propose laws and policies which directly affect children? Having read the text,I'm left with the impression that it's more a forum for citizenship training rather than active participationin society. But perhaps I'm wrong. I would like to come back once again to law 4 of 2010 which is thekey and pivotal instrument. I have heard that the commission is working on the text, there are three rather than five. What is going to happen to the other two? Does it mean that only part of the law willbe implemented? It seems somewhat vague. I would like to know if there is an exact time frame, if there are aims and how does it take so long for a law to be implemented? I haven't heard the answer. What isholding up the adoption of the implementing decrees for this law? What are we waiting for? And whilst we are waiting for the law to be implemented, I would like to come back to other issues. I will come backto juvenile justice in the last cluster. But I would like to know exactly what laws are applicable ifthe child protection law isn't in force. Now, generally speaking, we have heard thatcombating violence and respect for children's rights are of concern, but we have also heard that children can fall victim often to abuse or violence. So I would like to know that other than thetoll-free number that you have referred to which is a private initiative because it hasn't got any state funding, perhaps in cooperation with the state, but it is not the state which is directly funding the initiative. So other than that, I would like to know where do children go if they consider they have beenthe victims of violence or abuse in the family or school setting? How do they complain? You have told us that there is no more violence in schools, but we have heard differently. We have heardtestimonies from children attesting to the prevalence of violence still in schools. Now,the 2010 law refers to corporal punishment, but I have got Article 53 here which says that it is forbidden to use corporal punishment to punish children. It is quite vague. We have heard aboutphysical and sexual abuse and violence, but there is a whole mix of concepts here. Physical punishment is different to sexual abuse. We have heard about the different contexts in which this is applicable,such as the streets, police station, homes, schools, leisure centers, and I have also heard that there are other provisions under the criminal code on this subject, but I would like to know what is being done to inform children, parents, and to clarify that it is not just corporal punishmentwhich is prohibited, but all forms of violence including physical and psychological and verbal violence and there is also the issue of implementing that legislation. So now I would like to move onto budgetary issues. I have read the figures. We have heard that the budget has been scaled back between2021 and 2022, but we have not heard any explanations. We do not know why in the report you have given us totals which do not correspond to the sum of the budget lines. I would also like to know whythere is such low execution of budgets which have been adopted and I have not heard an explanation as to that. I would also like to know what are the safeguards put in place by the state to ensurethat when there is an economic crisis because of the global context, to ensure that budgeting forchildren is protecting against any cutbacks. Let us not forget that children account for over half the population of the country, but the budget is tiny compared to their presence and if it is scaledback during an economic crisis, then there is nothing left. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.I have two follow-up questions and two more related to my colleagues that spoke just before me.Correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that the birth certificate of the child could bemade could be established only after a man declares the birth of the child. Either the father or the brother of the mother or something like that. I would say that the birth certificate should not depend onthe parentage, on the affiliation. The birth certificate should simply confirm the birth of thechild, the appearance of a new legal person, subject. Correct me if I am wrong. Then, you said there was a declaration that although there is a ban on corporal punishment, but the state cannotguarantee what happens behind the closed doors of families. I would rather disagree with such statement because this is the whole point of protection of children against corporal punishment and violence.There should be a system to detect, to notify the authorities about corporal punishment taking place at home and the state and the authorities should react and there should be also a system of awarenessraising campaigns targeting families, parents about the corporal punishment and its negative impact on children. So I would like to hear more about this type of engagement of the state to protect childrenbehind the doors of the family. Several structural issues appeared from the start of our dialogue.I'm sorry to repeat, but because my clusters, disabilities and education are very much dependent on the budgets, I would like to support my colleague Mr. Van Kelsberg expressing my concern and curiosityabout this very, very low shares in the budget for children. As he said, children are half of thepopulation of the Congo. They cannot really receive 1 or 2% of the budget. Please correct us if we arewrong. And the World Bank report tells us that the Congo's economy is returning to growth. It isrecovering after 2022 following a multiyear economic contraction or crisis. Please tell us how thisrecovery and growth in economy is reflected in the budgets for children. We don't see any improvement.Please explain the huge discrepancy in the budgets of two strategies adopted in Congo during the last years. I'm speaking about the integrated early childhood development policy and action plan,which is budgeted for 41 and something in plus billion francs, which is good, but the educationsector strategy for the period 2022/2030 longer period will cost to the state budget only 600,000million. Why? Such a low budget for education while the budget for early childhood policy, childhood development policy is huge, is big, which is good. Capacity to disburse budgets, my colleague told,it is very much obvious and illustrated in your report related to budgets for children with disabilitiesand education. You said in your report in paragraph 156 that an average of 30% of the allocated resourceswhich were already insufficient, you admit this, very good, was used between 2016 and 2018. We have thesame similar situation with education. Only 15% of the budget allocated for education has been utilized.Please clarify, is this a matter of insufficient or lack of administrative capacity, capacity of administration to utilize, to disburse the already allocated money for education for children withdisabilities? We have another structural problem. My last issue is again linked to this problem of hugetime gaps between the adoption and enforcement of laws because we find this in the sector ofdisabilities, again, for 10 or 12 years, the life changes and you will perhaps need a new law, but you are still dealing in these years, ten years for regulation, implementing regulations. This is I havebeen in this committee for seven years already or eight years already and this is my 1st case to see suchtype of problem. It also could be a problem of rule of law, democracy, the Parliament says something andthen the executive takes ten, 15 years to enforce the law adopted by the Parliament. Please try to explain us more this issue. Thank you, Chair. Thank you. So we would now like to hand back to you, YourExcellency, if you are in a position to answer any of the questions that have just been put to you, we wouldgreatly appreciate it. Well, Madam Chair, thank you very much for giving us back the floor. Well, wehaven't had a chance to get organized ourselves, but we will try and give you some explanations in any case. If there are questions which are left pending, we will come back to them tomorrow. I will give thefloor now to the Director General for Social Affairs who will tell us about the definition of the childand then we will see if we have anything further to add to that. Director General, you have the floor.Thank you, Madam Minister. In order to clarify the definition of the child, we can refer to Article 1of Law 4 of 2010 on child protection. I can add something. Having listened to your questions,I'm left with the impression you think that the law is not being implemented. No, it has been implemented since 2010. It doesn't need the implementing regulations in order to be implemented. There areother provisions which are automatically applicable. There are provisions on Article 61 and 68 which arebeing discussed by the Commission. They are looking at what provisions need to be regulated and what wefound in the Commission was that it was only Article 61 and 68 that are concerned. Article 61 refers to the early warning system and setting up the child observatory. That's why two decrees need to beadopted by the Minister. This is set out in Article 61.3. And there is also the reference to the bannedprofessions for children as well which the Commission has to regulate. So under the current law, childrenare all those people who are under the age of 18 and who have not been emancipated through a special provision. Furthermore, there is the African charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Ifyou line them up against each other, they could have a problem. But according to our law, it's up to theage of 18 that someone is a child or by special emancipation. So there is no problem because whenlawmakers adopted this decision, they foresaw that the state could take a decision to give exceptional emancipation to a child so that children could benefit for some things which are normally reserved foradults because normally children would be considered to be all those under the age of 18. Now, with regard to the children's parliament and the resources which are made available to it, what I can tell you isthat in the ministry we have a line for the children's parliament and I think that they lobbied the national office and the speaker of the parliament claiming that they had insufficient means and they saidthat you must listen to us. In order to work properly, we need greater budgetary resources and this waslobbying that they carried out with the parliament speakers. He agreed to increase the budget. So that was the effect of the lobbying by children to the speakers, the parliament speaker and the primeminister. And so the children went to all the departments, all the prefectures and they explainedthat we have had an inaugural session and we have our national office and now what children are doing is that they are carrying out these lobbying in order to ensure that they have a proper budget for theiractivities. Now with regard to the dissemination of the best interest of the child, I think thateverything we do including the minister's visit here to Geneva is to try and promote children's welfare.We have had major floods in the country and when we had that, she said that I have got to drop everythingelse, I must defend children. And she is under pressure and will have to get back to Brazzavillevery quickly in order to manage the humanitarian situation caused by these floods. So we haveheard that we have produced our 5th and 6th report and obviously it is not everyone that has the timeto do this but to do all their reports but what we do is we focus on children's rights reports in order to improve the situation. There are shortcomings but we are always doing our utmost to ensure that we make progress on children's rights. Thank you, Minister. That's what I had to add. Thank you, Director General.So you wanted to understand the scope of child emancipation. I think that when the family code wasadopted at that time, I will give you a simple example. My mother fell pregnant when she was 14 or 15.She got married. My father was much older than my mother. That was normal at that time. But when she got pregnant, she couldn't be accepted in the maternity ward. So what she had to do is she hadto be emancipated at 16. That was when so that she could have a child in a maternity ward. So when the family code was adopted, we thought about these examples. So let's imagine that there is a girlwho legally speaking cannot be admitted for childbirth in a hospital. But what do you do about that? The same thing happened with schools. We had to make sure that a girl could continue her studieseven if she was pregnant. She would have to have family support to help her. But when the code wasdrawn up, all these situations had to be considered. Obviously text need to evolve as society evolves.That's something that we accept. And we are going to take a look as to how we can modernize the family code by integrating all the developments in society around the world, the conventions that we havesigned and adopted. Now, the costs of childbirth, I'll give the floor to the representative of theMinistry of Health to tell us about why maternity fees have to be paid before birth certificate andalso there is questions about other birth certificate parallel costs. But if we think aboutthe time it takes for some people to declare their child six months, then you will see how this createsred tape. Let's imagine that a parent has a whole year to declare a birth, then they will never do iton the same day. It is normal to have a month in order for the birth of a child to be declared. Sowhy would birth certificate not be issued until maternity ward fees have been paid? Well, it is to do with the functioning of health centers. They don't always have a huge budget and they may needto cover small costs and that's why fees are charged for delivery. Caesarian sections may be free ofcharge. It may be difficult to pay the cost of a caesarian but there are other small costs which can be passed on to the patients. But I will give the floor to the representative from the Ministry ofHealth to answer that. But before I do, all too often people don't follow what they are told.We have the social affairs districts which provide support to families who in dire straits. We have got the LISUNGI projects with the social security networks. It will run up until February but whichwill be replaced. It was a pilot project across three departments, Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire and Paul. That will be renewed. Even though the current project is going to finish in February, we willhave the national social networks project which is going to take over the role of LISUNGI. We don't know exactly when it is going to be launched but I'm sure it will be in March because LISUNGI will finish on the 29th of February. It could be on the 1st of March and then we will have the national socialsecurity networks project which will provide cash transfers to the most vulnerable members of society and will take care of children from the most vulnerable families in order to ensure they attend school, canhave access to health care and hospitals. So these families go to the social affairs districts when they face difficulties and what we do is we provide with support for funeral expenses for people whoare taking in to hospital and haven't got any resources. So these are the kind of people who are supported by the Ministry of Social Affairs. We now have the representative from the Ministry of Health to add something. Continue. We are almost at 5:30 and as I have mentioned a couple of times, we do have a2nd round of questions. But if you can give a response in two or 3 min and if necessary elaborate tomorrow, that's fine. But if you need a longer time, then it would be better to hold it overto tomorrow. Thank you very much, Minister. We have already referred to a report on this subject and I'mlooking at the measures which is to disassociate the payment of maternity ward fees to the issuing ofbirth certificates. So a birth is declared and then the birth certificate is issued without waiting for the maternity ward fees to be paid. We have actually dissociated the two. So you can be discharged fromthe maternity ward and you can have your birth certificate without necessarily having paid the fees. So two different subjects. Thank you. Okay. So perhaps if there are any other issues relatingto birth certificates and the issue of fathers or males having to issue them, you can pick up on that again tomorrow. I'm now going to ask Vanina Todorova to take the floor and ask the 1st set of questions.Thank you, Madam Chair. And at this time, I would like to welcome the Delegation of the Republic of Congo. It's my time to ask questions and I will be dealing with clusters related to children withdisabilities, education and environmental degradation and climate change impact on children's rights.Children with disabilities, the Committee comments the Congo for the ratification of CRPD, but having saidthat, I would like to admit that I was not able to find any information if that ratification of 2014 has been followed by new national policies that affect the rights of children with disabilities. Please correctme if I'm wrong. The Government report actually informs us that there is a law number 10 of 2012 by which thestate party instituted the regime for families and children facing difficulties and that law was revisedin 2014 following the CRPD ratification. But no more information. Please inform us about this regime and whetherthis law is actually enforced because the Government report in Paragraph 157 says differently. There isstill process of enforcement after 12 years following after the revision. Next question is about again aboutfunding. Please inform us whether the economy revival after 2022 will be beneficial for children withdisabilities. What measures are taken or will be taken to strengthen the social inclusion of children, particularly of ones with mental disabilities in terms of investments in training of staff, facilities,building facilities and special assistance for parents to care for children with disabilities. Another big concern is the stigma, discrimination and violence against children with disabilities. Children in the Republicof Congo are often considered as a disgrace to the family as they are perceived as the result of curse, a spell or divine punishment. This is what the information to the Committee informed, reached out. To avoid thestrong social pressure over families, children are segregated, locked away while some families try to get rid of them by any means. Ritualized killings of these children continue. Please inform the Committeeabout the measures taken to change the public culture over disability and to protect children.Education. Although the Congolese legislation guarantees the rights of all children to education,free of charge and their equal access to instruction and training without discrimination,there are still many issues that need to be discussed here. The information received demonstratesthat the previous concerns and recommendations made by this Committee in 2014, almost 10 years ago, remain valid today. And some of the problems have got even worse regretfully. You have adopted education sectorstrategy 2022/2030. And I very much hope that it provides solutions to these problems. Education is bylaw cost free for all students. It looks, however, that the parents were loaded with the whole burden of the economic crisis that has impacted the education sector some time ago. Parents were supposedto pay enrollment rates, salaries for teachers, uniforms and textbooks. The school fees are higher for secondary schools and vocational training of children. What are the plans of the governmentto restore free education in the Congo? The government reports for high enrollment rates of primary school age students, however, dropout rates and great retention in the primary level of education areworrisome and contribute to the growth of the number of children excluded from the education system. For example, one-third of children drop out of secondary education. The education is far from being inclusivefor all children. Okay. There are results and you report for measures taken for physical accessibility of the buildings of schools, et cetera. However, great disparities exist in enrollment among theindigenous population between urban and rural areas, girls and children with disabilities. It is really alarming that 65% of indigenous children of primary school age are not in school. Children in rural areashave to travel kilometers to access a public school. Pregnant girls drop out of school. A very low share of children with disabilities, 0.3 or 0.5% in 2015 are in secondary and high schools, mainstream schools.Inclusive policies and measures are benefiting only children with sensory and physical impairments but not children with mental disabilities. Please inform us what measures are taken to strengthen the educationalinclusion of indigenous children, children in rural areas and children with disabilities in terms of investments in schools, qualified staff and special assistance for parents. With regard to the projectthat is implemented currently in five departments to provide grants for pregnant girls and teenage mothers to ensure that they stay in school, we would like more information about the number of girls benefitingfrom this project and how the receiving grants actually support their school attendance. How effective isthis project? Do actually girls graduate from school? Is there such a statistic and do you plan to mainstream this project into the governmental policy? Quality of education, the quality of education is affected byalarming lack of appropriate learning infrastructure and teachers and you are aware of this. In 2015/2025 governmental education sector strategy, the strategy reflects shortcomings such as insufficient number ofqualified teachers, a high pupil teacher ratio as well as the lack of classrooms and teaching materials among other gaps. Actually you speak about, you admit these shortcomings in your report in the strategy. Other sources,however, confirm that the situation is even worse, that 50% of public schools are liaised and some are housed inbuildings built in the 1930s, last century, long time ago. Classrooms are too small and overcrowded. Benches and tables are insufficient and therefore some pupils study on the ground. School children do not have access to electricity, drinkingwater and sanitation. Please explain the plans to urgently allocate and utilize budget funding to improve the school infrastructure, particularly in the context of current economy recovery. Please explain the rationale behind keepingtwo types of teachers, civil service teachers and community teachers and how it is beneficial for students. Explain the urgent measures to address the severe shortage of teachers and the quality of their qualifications. A national policy for integrateddevelopment of early childhood, I mentioned that was adopted. Please explain whether the one year of implementation ofthis policy has been evaluated and what are the outcomes? Children's rights and the environment, we appreciate the adoption of a national disaster prevention and risk reduction strategy in Congo in 2021. We would like to know more how these documents reflect children's rights affected by the environmental degradation and climate change, e.g. , what are theplans for adaptation to climate shocks of education, health and child protection systems? Do you foresee appropriate prevention systems? Do you foresee appropriate preventive measures to protect children against reasonably foreseeable environmental harm coming from floods, e.g. ? And having considered the building of theconsidered the building of safe schools environment, housing for affected families and children, building an early warning system and investments in clean, clean water and to control mosquitoes. Actually, the problem with mosquitoes and malaria is really worsening after the floods in Congo. And how do you plan changes in the curricula with aim to provide child friendlyinformation about climate change and environmental problems and to train children to survive disasters? I end here. Chair. Thank you, Ms. Todorova. And just for clarity for me, those are all the questions that you are going to put during this cluster? Yes, thank you. So you included your environmental question together? Yes. Yes. Thank you. The next speaker is Benoit van Kersbeek.Thank you, Madam Chair. It is my task now to cover special protection measures, cluster10, as we call it in our own jargon. This is a cluster which covers a whole raft of various situations. So apologies ahead of time, but I will have to ask you very manyquestions on those aspects. Just to interrupt you, Ms. Aho is going to ask the questions in the cluster before yours. I'm sorry, slight confusion due to Berlina's name appearing twiceon the list. I apologize. Yes. Susanna, please go ahead and ask your questions. Apologies. Thank you, Madam Chair. My questions relate to health. Given that we were discussing healthearlier, I think I had asked you a question about the budget. In 2011, the budget earmarked to healthcare stood at 4%. I would like to know as things stand today what is the genuine budgetwhich is earmarked for healthcare? With respect to infrastructure, you talked about very serious flooding and that there was a problem with water and healthcare. I don't know if you were ableto displace that population, but how do they actually gain access to healthcare and the other healthcare infrastructure destroyed during conflict? What is being done in that respect? Because there are healthcare institutions which are extremely dilapidated and in very remoteareas. You said that the population can travel to healthcare centers because healthcare isfree of charge, but it appears that they don't do so. They desert these healthcare centers. I don't know if it is the costs involved, but I would really like to know what is going on here. Is there an adapted technical electronic platform? Do you have enough beds availablein those hospitals? I would like to ask about the qualified healthcare staff. Could you tell us about them, particularly in rural remote areas? It would appear that when it comes tothe provision of medicines, there are problems faced there as well. So I would like to know about the state party's response when it comes to providing the population with medical supplies.What measures are being taken to gain access to healthcare areas in rural areas? I mentionedthat earlier. With respect to deaths of women after giving birth, partly 12% of women passaway following childbirth. What is being done to reduce those rates? There is immediate death following childbirth. Now, on vaccination coverage, could you give us the percentage rates there?I know that there is a scarcity, a lack of antigen tests. Have you overcome that problem when it comes to a lack of tests? So what is the coverage rate for vaccinations? And whenit comes to far-flung areas, what about the cold chain? Could you please provide information about malaria? Because many deaths still occur as a result of malaria. Now, I don't know ifyou have any campaigns on insecticide-treated mosquito nets. And I would like to ask you how do you ensure that families use those insecticide mosquito nets to reduce the deaths of childrenas a result of malaria? Madam, earlier you talked about the global fund. My question is as follows. It seems to me that the government and the state of the Republic of Congo has undertakena commitment to co-finance the global fund to the tune of $6 million. I would like to know if this has actually happened. Has this budget been reduced? What is the state of play whenit comes to the global fund? I also have another question now on tuberculosis. Are measurestaken to support children in terms of the tuberculosis that they suffer? With respect to childbirth,you had mentioned that cesarean births are covered. But could you tell us about blood transfusions for women during cesarean births? Is this a service which is free of charge? Now, you area member of the African Union. And I would like to know how this blood transfusion is actually covered. On HIV/AIDS in your report you talked about the PMED. But I would like to have furtherclarification there. I don't think the mother undergoes any test. How do you actually ensurethat mothers have access to tests so that zero positive children can be detected and also detectionof mothers for PTME, mother to child transmission? Turning now to malnutrition, do you have a programregulating child malnutrition? There are children who die as a result of malnutrition. On adolescenthealth, what is being done to inform children of HIV/AIDS and STIs? Why are there so many earlypregnancies amongst women? Could you tell us about covering cases of abortion? Does the lawauthorize abortion? Those are my questions. And the major issues I wanted to raise on healthI could add further information at a later stage. Thank you very much. Now Mr. Van Kerspilk. Thankyou, Madam Chair. As I said a moment ago, I have a very long list of questions falling under cluster 10, special measures of protection. Now, my 1st question, the issue of childrenwho are refugees and migrant children. Clearly there are major discrepancies in access to essential care between urban and rural areas for asylum seeking and refugee children. What is being putinto place and how does the state ensure that it grapples with that discrimination? Are there any specific programs aimed at unaccompanied minors, unaccompanied children who migrate without theirfamilies? And now we found information with respect to asylum seeking children, but those who are not asylum seeking children, what type of protection is afforded to them? These arechildren who migrate without requesting asylum or international protection explicitly. On childreninvolved in labor and we had a list of prohibited work which hasn't yet been adopted, but it would appear that the labor code is still awaiting adoption. I would like to know whether it has been adopted or when will the adoption take place. Once the labor code is adopted, obviouslyit is vital and even in advance to ensure that it is upheld and respected. So my question therefore is how many labor inspectors are there in the country? Is their task to ensurethat legislation for protection of children against the worst forms of labor is respected? And what specific training do they avail of? Turning now to children in a street situation, thisis a situation of particular importance and concern to us, it must be said. We have been made aware of a very high number of children who are subject to violence, particularly policeviolence, violence also from other authorities. What is being put in place so that the children are respected and that support for reintegration programs are respected, also prevention programsbecause it is better for a child not to be in the street in the 1st place rather than acting afterwards. Now, as far as you are concerned, the issue of which children isn't prevalent,I'm sorry, I need to contradict you, but we do have information that is quite contrary in that a high number of children end up in the streets because they have been labeled as which children as a result of family problems and other problems. So I would like to know whetherthe police force is trained to deal with that type of situation. I don't think you have anyspecific brigades or officers trained in managing the situation of those children. Turning now to trafficking, sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, there again this is an extremely sensitiveand imminently problematic issue. What type of awareness raising campaigns have been rolled out against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse? And what resources are in place to assistvictims? How are the victims treated by the justice system? Can they be heard by persons who have been properly trained? You said that the law aims to provide a response to the situation.Are psychologists on the ground supporting children? Is there filmed video recordings? Are childrenalso supported by a lawyer? Regrettably, I need to talk about unwanted pregnancies and accessto abortion. My colleague mentioned abortion, particularly for victims of sexual violence. I think it is important to underscore that particular point and also access to contraception. We havebeen made aware of many situations whereby there is a lack of resources and a lack of contraceptionand this has led to accessibility on the street. This is completely inappropriate and sometimes quite dangerous. On the issue of child trafficking and the sale of children, you have a decreeto set up the composition functioning organization of the national commission to combat human trafficking. I would like to know about its makeup, its mandate. Is it up and running? And are there any campaignsthat have been conducted on human trafficking, particularly when it comes to the practice of confiage which appear to be quite prevalent in Congo. I would also like to ask about theresources in place to combat external international trafficking. There are questions now relatedto child justice. The administration of juvenile justice we feel is also a very important point. This is the implementation of the 2010 law and you have told us that most of it has been implemented.I believe that Article 75 and 78 are key in terms of administration of juvenile justice and they have not yet been subject to implementing decrees. Do you have legislation that's beingprepared or have they fallen off the radar? I would like to know about those. These pieces of legislation are vital because they allow for the exercise of defense, the presence ofa lawyer, the fact that the lawyer is working free of charge to support the child, arbitrary detention as well as other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment. Are you thinking aboutsetting up specific units within the police force to have juvenile justice, administration of juvenile justice at all stages of the procedure? We know that some child judges have been placedin certain courts in Brazzaville and Pointe-du-Noir. When will these judges be present and operational in all areas so that you don't just have one judge appointed to one child when they are facedwith this type of situation? Child justice, juvenile justice requires specialized staff at all levels of the procedure. Now, I know from a statistical standpoint you have repeated this, that youdo have shortcomings and gaps, but I would like to have a very specific question, answer to this question, how many children are held, detained today in the Republic of Congo? How is it that there are some children who are still held with adults in prison? Whereas this is formallyprohibited by international law but it is also prohibited by Congolese laws. When will reeducation centers or other forms of care be up and running so as they can host these children? I know thatyou are thinking of setting up departments for minors within prisons rather than mixing minors with adults. Shouldn't you perhaps make resources available to cover other types of care and support which are more appropriate to children? The minimum age of criminal responsibilityin Congo stands at the age of 13 and you know that our general comment 24 recommends 14 as the minimum age for judicial intervention for children who are in conflict with the law. Couldyou think about raising that age? Another question that I would like to come back to which is important, the right to a lawyer is guaranteed but given lawyers don't want to work free of charge, weunderstand this. So what is being done to guarantee access to a lawyer in that context? We have also been informed of cases of infanticide, deaths in detention centers. I would like toknow what is being done in terms of investigation, prosecution of perpetrators and the protection of victims in all of those contexts. I have to speed up a little but perhaps I will come back to some questions afterwards in the follow-up question section. I would like to concludewith questions to do with children in armed conflict. Regrettably despite the ratification of the two optional protocols on children in armed conflict and the sale of children childprostitution to which the Congolese party is not yet is a party rather, we haven't yet received your initial reports. What is holding you back in that respect? Can we expect an additionalreport on these two optional protocols quickly? What measures have been taken to support children who are involved in armed conflict in their countries of origin or have been involved inconflict in one way or another? Are there any support, rehabilitation and reintegration procedures? What measures have been taken to incorporate a declaration on safety at school within thepolicy of the country? It is something that has been signed by Congo. But has there been any effect following signature? Now Article 49 which prohibits the enlistment of children inarmed conflict but at the same time enables children to volunteer before the age of 18, I see a contradiction there. Let me finish with another extremely important question. Congohas participated in UN peacekeeping missions and that is quite noteworthy and this needs to be highlighted. However we have been made aware of a number of cases, particularly 21children who have been victims of sexual abuse, rape by military, by soldiers or others involved in peacekeeping operations particularly in the Central African Republic between 2013 and 2018. Some cases have clearly been identified. So what is being done to prosecute the perpetrators,protect the victims, provide them with reparation, compensation and ensure that they can benefit from a fair trial and have their rights respected? And I would like to just recall one of the questions which I didn't get a reply to, the National Human Rights Commission. I would like to knowabout its role and functioning when it comes to children's rights. I don't think you provideda response to that question. Thank you. Thank you very much. So that brings us to the end of the questions. I know it is a lot. But you have the whole evening. So sorry for you. But we look forward to seeing you tomorrow and to hear your answers to these questions. Thank you verymuch and we will see you at 10:00. Thank you to the panelists for the extra minutes as well."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good morning. Good morning, everybody. I declare open the 2759th meeting of the 95th sessionof the Committee on the Rights of the Child. This is the 2nd meeting dedicated to the review of the 5th and 6th report under the Convention of the Republic of Congo. Welcome back to the Delegation of the Republic of Congo. We hope that you got some rest last night andthat you are now ready to answer the questions that you heard yesterday. You could perhaps start with answering the questions, any questions that were left over from the 1st round andthen move forward on to those from the 2nd round. Madam, Excellency, I hand over to you. Thank you very much and good morning to this august meeting once again. Thank you for joiningus again this morning to tell us what we need to do in order to improve the living conditionsand respect for the rights of our children. So thank you once again. We now move on to the answers to the concerns raised by the Committee members. Thank you, task force coordinator and also mythanks to Ms. Todarova for your questions and to Ms. Correa and to Suzanne Ajo for all the concernsthat you have raised. Obviously we are concerned with these issues as well back home in our country. We need to share our problems so that we can find the best possible solutions and this dialogue is notto accuse anyone but rather to improve the situation for our children. That's our concern and that's what we have been working on ever since we took up the post in our department and we are workingwith the government's team in order to find the best possible conditions. I'm sure you are aware of the various crises that we have lived through. The fragile countries like ours, they have an impact.Sometimes we set off with good intentions but on our journey in a country like ours we can fall downbecause we fall every time the price of the barrel of oil falls. We also face the pandemic just as you did here in Switzerland but you can imagine that the impact was three or four times as great in a countrylike ours. Everything shut down. Then we face an economic crisis and there are a number of projects which we had wanted to get started on but we were unable to. But this won't hold us back. We havegot our commitments through the conventions we have signed which we are going to honour and we are trying to bring our laws into line with these conventions. As soon as a convention is signed byour country we have to bring our laws into line with it. So I know that the task force coordinator is worriedabout law 4 of 2010 and the articles which need to be adjusted. We are doing that. Yesterday we weretold that we would have an additional 48 hours to send in answers in writing if necessary and so we are going to work on that. So we will move on to the 2nd round of questions and also there were somefollow-up questions as well but we will come on to them later. Firstly, we will deal with some of the questions from the 2nd round. Ms. Todorova was asking about the effects of climate change on children.Yes, it is true that we have concerns in this area and concerns about children living with disabilities.I can reassure you that we have drawn up a strategy on disabilities for Congo following a contract signedwith the consultant but why did we need a strategy for disabilities? First of all, because we need to make sure that disabilities are accepted in the family setting and that's why we are about to organize aforum on the subject, perhaps Ms. Todorova if you are available, we would be happy to send you an invitation to the forum so that also you can help us organize it. What is the purpose of this forum? The title ofthe forum will be accepting disabilities in the family. Young or older parents who have a child withdisabilities in their home, are they prepared to accept a child with disabilities? No. What are thetools they have at their disposal? So that's why we see children with disabilities being put away in a corner of the house or a corner of the courtyard until the parents come home again. That's becausedisabilities are not accepted but I don't think Congo stands alone, even in Europe and even in developed countries it continues to be an acute problem. It is difficult for a child with disabilitiesto be accepted because it upsets your whole life. So we have been thinking about this, it is vital that moms and dads accept all sorts of disabilities and the whole family needs to accept the disabilities.It needs to be the siblings accepting disability if they are living at home but also the extended familyas we understand it in our context but also the neighborhood and the community. It is only when we havethis acceptance of disabilities that society will be able to provide the resources for the whole community to benefit from. So that's why we are going to organize this forum perhaps in March on acceptance ofdisabilities in Congo. You also asked us this question then about climate change and the floodsthat we face at the moment. Nine out of our 12 departments have faced disasters. Almost all the northern half of the country is under water at the moment and there are entire villages which havebeen evacuated. You have got districts where people have left their villages and sought refuge elsewhere.So humanitarian aid needs to be deployed there and it will but we cannot leave children with disabilities behind. They must come with us. Obviously we have great respect for UN institutions and forthe task force. So that's why I had to come here. But prior to coming I was given this document which I will pass on to you which is the multisectoral response to floods in Congo. This was somethingthat we drew up before I came here. I just wanted you to read through that so you can see that holistic care is being provided to children and adults with disabilities in the context of climate change. Butit's a huge problem for us. But I would like here to advocate for the following. We are not preparedfor these natural disasters and these climate catastrophes. So in order to provide care we needa plan like this one. It provides for 16 billion CFA francs of support but we need to find them somewhere.So we need to use the resources from other budget lines so that we can provide the care for thosepeople who are affected by disasters. I beg your pardon? Was there a comment? Okay. So I'm not goingto hog the floor so to speak. I will give the floor to the other members of the Delegation so that theycan also contribute. Inclusion of indigenous children. Our schools are open and accessible to all Congolesechildren. And I will explain things that you haven't heard about yet. Sometimes there are stakeholdersthat come here and have discussions with you but they never go out into the field. So what I say to partners isthat they must go beyond Brazzaville and Pont Noir and Dolizy, our major cities. They need to go out intothe country. They need to get their walking shoes on and go out into the rural areas so that they see whatthe situation is like on the ground. Our country is heavily forested. At least four of our 12 departmentshave a significant indigenous population. The department of Likawala has the highest indigenous population and the nextone is the far northern province bordering Central African Republic. That's Likawala province. That's the top one. And then we havethe province in the far southwest, Cuvette, which has a significant indigenous population. Then if you go back north to Songa department, you will find other indigenous peoples. There are also indigenous populations inpool and other departments but the major ones are in the far north, southwest and in Songa. So what about their lifestyles? What about the laws on indigenous peoples? Well, all Bantu and indigenous populationshave the right to go to school. What about the indigenous culture then? Well, you need to go out andbring those indigenous children into schools. How do they sustain themselves then? Ithink that you already know because you have heard from the NGOs that these people live in the forests and they gather honeyand they also gather caterpillars but we need to make sure that children start school. But when there is the honey and caterpillarharvests and when they tap the resin from the trees, then the children go back to the forest withtheir parents. So what do we do? They stop studying. Should we close the schools down for everybody? Well,I have discussed this with our UNDP partners. We need to consider having a special school year for indigenous children becauseit is difficult to tie them down to the same school calendar as other Congolese children. It is something that we need to think about together. What are we going to do to provide the necessary support forthese indigenous children? There are some that manage to go further. There is a woman on the Executive Council for promoting women,Ms. Mitata. She is a young indigenous woman, trained in law and we rely on her to a great extent so that she can provide us with her experienceand have that experience benefit other children. In the Likumu department, we have been working with an NGOthat supports young indigenous girls so that they complete their studies. They have opened up a residentialschool for young girls who have completed their secondary education so that they can go further.We have been working with the president of the NGO to provide the NGO with the resources it needs to support those children, make sure that they continue their schooling. We call these the aura schools but theidea really is just to make sure that these children enter the education circuit. School dropout thenfrom secondary school. Well, there was a time I would say when Congo had boarding schools and that was wherewe educated children from vulnerable families. They have been closed down. It is now parents' responsibilityto support children schooling. You know that during crises when you are under pressure, what do you do?You have to look for support from your friends and neighbors so that you have the support for childrento continue their schooling. There is a subsidy from the state but that discourages parents from continuingto support the children. It was because of that subsidy that the IMF has given us the opportunityto recruit more teachers for the public sector and it is those teachers who are replacing the privatetutors that parents had employed in rural areas. That situation occurred because we didn't have enoughteachers but we got an authorization last year to recruit 1200 teachers and 1300 this year preprimary, primary and secondary school levels. When it comes to technical education we recruited 800 teachers lastyear and this year we will recruit the same number. This is in the Ministry of Social Affairs. In orderto boost society we just had 50 extra staff last year. It wasn't a lot but this year we have the opportunityto recruit 200 and we have the National Institute of Social Work which trains social workers and thesepeople will graduate from the National Institute and then they will work in the social sector. We have 118 social affairs districts throughout the country. Obviously we need to improve our awareness raisingand go beyond it. The social affairs districts are the point of contact for all those Congolese who have problems with birth registration, nonpayment of maternity fees and other hospital costs. They go tothe social affairs districts for support. Now pregnant girls, our society is different from Europeansocieties. Ours is an African society. Children stay with their families. If a girl falls pregnantwell, she could hide her pregnancy and the mother may not know. She might not know herself. It is onlywhen it becomes visible that she realizes she is pregnant so she tries to hide it from her parents.She could be tempted to undergo a back street abortion which would be harmful to her and her family.As soon as the parents know, they will support their daughter and they will take care of the baby intheir home. Sometimes children run away from home. But as soon as social workers know about the situationthat some support is given, it is not automatic wherever you may be, but you won't find 10,000 pregnant girls wandering the streets of Brazzaville or any other town in Congo. There is support from families.There is an aunt, a mother, a stepmother. As soon as a member of the family knows about it, then they willtake care of the child. Perhaps I can hand over to the representative from the Ministry of Health now.Perhaps you could shed some further light on our partners here about the health sector.Thank you, Minister. There was a recurrent question yesterday on the health budget. So that's whereI will start. You claimed that the health budget had suffered cuts, but I would say that the oppositeis true. It has gone from 9% to 12%. We have education and health as priority sectors of our national development plan. So they are the priorities for our support. That's why the budget was increased.This means that there is better care available in certain departments. You referred to infrastructure as well. I think that the Minister has given you a response. Everything is contained in the contingencyplan. But when you are underwater, you can't talk about infrastructure. It is only when the watersubsides. So we have got the recovery plan for the post-flood period which takes stock of everything.Now, staff for health in rural areas in particular. Congo has traineddoctors and we have also received Cuban doctors and paramedics. The last group came last month.This helps increase our numbers of health professionals. When these young people arrive, we send them outto the provinces to support the local structures. So we are strengthening our capacity thanks to the new groups of health professionals arriving from Cuba, but also when we train health professionals inBrazzaville and when they are trained abroad, they are sent to the provinces for their internships. Sowe make sure that we send out these people to the provinces. The other question that was raisedin addition to staff were the facilities. This is also covered in the government program.If I take a look at the infrastructures and the facilities, you will see that we are buildinggeneral hospitals. We have built two and hospitals will be built this year so that we can increase thecapacity for the entire country. Soon we will be purchasing mobile clinics because we needto bring health services closer to people so we will have these mobile clinics for those people whocannot gain access to their departmental health facilities. So we are trying to bring healthservices closer. Now, vaccination rates, it is true that we went through a very difficult timeduring the pandemic. So it is true to say that some vaccinations were neglected during the emergencyperiod but we are recovering thanks to routine vaccination campaigns in the major cities andrural areas and we have over 60% vaccination coverage but the campaigns haven't yet been completed. Now, with regard to malaria, you were asking us if the mosquito nets are insecticide treated. Yes,they are. We buy them using global fund, using the global fund. We raise awareness before wedistribute them because we need to teach people that they have to use these mosquito nets. Wedistribute a 1st load, then we assess the situation. We will see if the families have actually used them and that assessment is made before we distribute the next lot and the mosquito nets aredistributed in all departments of the country. Tuberculosis among children, this falls underthe 3rd global fund programme. Care is given to children suffering from tuberculosis and HIV.So how do we prevent mother to child transmission? I'm a member of the supervisory team along with the UNDP and we look at what prevention methods are used in health facilities and hospitals and we alsoprovide nutritional support. We ensure that these children are properly fed. So we work togetherwith the UNDP and health facilities. How can we ensure that people use mosquito nets, I have covered all of those aspects. I think I have replied to the questions raised but if there are any pending questionsI remain at your disposal to reply to them. So those are the answers I can give you and, of course, I'm willing to add any additional information which may be required. Thank you very much to the representativeof the health sector. There was a question about refugees, adult refugees. You say that these people are adults. They have reached adulthood and they need to be able to care for themselves.The UNHCR accompanies them as well as the relevant ministry. We have the SENA who looks after refugees.There was another question about the number of labor inspectors in Congo. We have 225 labor inspectors in the country. That was the question raised by the moderator. Children in the street situation who faceviolence and which children I will try to seek out these which children moderator because you are confirming to me that these children do exist in Congo. I will carry out some research with thesocial action districts. I will try to identify those children and to see what type of response we canprovide in that respect. I haven't yet come across any which children. So I will try to find out about them to do more research with my ministry with the social action districts. I will try to pinpointthese children who are described as which children. That's true. We don't have any specialized brigadesto afford child protection. But we have taken good note of that recommendation. We will work togetherwith the ministry of the interior to set up such a brigade. I, in fact, was in Cuba two months ago. Andwe visited these brigades, these units which take care for children who face violence in the home and elsewhere. This is something which is very dear to us. And we have set up an exchange with the ministryof the interior so that we can think about establishing a brigade for children's protection. Now, before that, children aren't left to their own devices. I would like to call upon one of the members of theDelegation who will provide you with some information about the justice system and what is being done for children who face various types of violence. Thank you, Madam Minister, for giving me the floor.Let me provide you with some information related to two issues. Firstly, a lack of children's judges inother courts at the national level. Madam Minister, let me say that in the towns where there are noa child judges, the president of the court of the 1st court of 1st instance acts as a child judge. Now, in the criminal sphere, in line with Article 697 of the code of criminal procedure, I have the code herebefore me. Let me'in all courts of high courts and in the sections covering one or two magistrates,the child judge is appointed by the minister of justice, the guardian of the seals based on the aptitudes and interests in children's issues. It is also acknowledged that the president of the highcourt, that once the judge is appointed by the minister of justice, if that person cannot act as ajudge, it is then down to a decree appointing another member to act as the child judge. This cannot gohand in hand with other judicial functions or duties. Now, there was another question as to whether thechildren's judge participates in proceedings until the very end. Let me say here yes and no. There is alegal principle stating that the president of the prosecutor alone at 1st glance is versed with allcases, whether they be criminal or not. Then when it comes to minors, when the prosecutor of the republicdeals with a crime or an offense as set out in Article 75 of the law of the 14th of June 2010,the Pacino law, it is in line with that Article that the prosecutor and, indeed, the judicial policeofficers have an opportunity to find an extra judicial decision. I believe that one of my colleagues has the contents of Article 75 which provides an opportunity to the prosecutor and the judicialpolice officers to settle the problem on a discretionary basis. Let me just give you an example.Let's say there are children, minors, a girl. There is a case of incest in the family. Perhaps one childcomes from the father and the other from the mother. A rape occurs. What is done in our society? We cannot expose the case because it would tear the family apart. We need to reach a compromise,therefore, so that the minor is not exposed to the legal authorities so that we have this opportunityin place and this can be checked against Article 75. The children's judge, therefore, is not aware of thecase. But if there is an emergency and the prosecutor believes that a judicial case may be opened,the prosecutor turns to the children's judge and makes a request. That is why the children's judge cannot be made aware of the case. But if the children's judge is made aware of a case, theyplay, they act the role of an investigating judge because a case file needs to be opened.They take on the role of the president of the children's court and it is this individual alonewho is a judge before the criminal court. The children's judge, therefore, is always present duringthe proceedings involving the child because he is the person who is aware of how to deal with the information. Madam Minister, that is the information I wanted to give you on as respect to the twoquestions raised. Thank you very much indeed. Let's move on. Director General, please. Perhaps you have some additional information to add. Thank you, Madam Minister, for giving me the floor. I would liketo come back to disability and I would like to tie this in with the principle of nondiscrimination and the best interests of the child. They are enshrined in the constitution of the Republic of Congo.And even within national policies on social action, we take these two principles into consideration.Now, what is the state doing to support and accompany children with disabilities? We have measures in place for schooling, screening also and we also provide medical care and support to children witha disability. In Brazil, we have schools, we have the national institute for the blind and we have apsychological educational support system. We also have an institute for auditory impairments. So we haveidentified that there are 525 children attaining these schools. Now, this is specialized education and it is therefore free of charge and this is to enable those children to attend school. The stateitself provides means of transport. The minister mentioned that there were two schools. We have two school buses to guarantee transport because as we are dealing with disability, as the minister said, if we don't take these children from their homes and bring them to school, very often they stay at home.So as I say, transport is guaranteed. The minister also mentioned nutrition and we cover canteen costs.The children who come to school need to be able to eat otherwise they won't come back the next day.So we guarantee a school canteen to ensure that they have enough food to eat. We also cover educational material as well as technical and mobility aids when it comes to walking sticks, crutches,and tricycles, if you will, to enable those children to move around and come to school for those who cannot take the bus. There is also another very important aspect here and that is school support. We have anational institute for the blind in Congo. The children attend this resource center so that they cancontinue their studies and obtain a certificate. And following the certificate, they need to be able to move to inclusive mainstream schools instead of staying in these specialized schools. They needto be able to attend so-called ordinary mainstream schools. And there we need to be able to supportthem in doing so. And to do that, we make available those who have a knowledge of sign language, canread Braille, assistants, if you will, so that they can understand these children. And the minister had said that she is determined to recruit these volunteers, these assistants. They work with theministry of social affairs and they are appointed to the schools. Now, above and beyond secondary school,we have seen that there are a number of blind children who obtained the secondary school certificate known as the back. And these children are going to be able to be enrolled in the judiciary school in Marawambiand also within the national institute for labor affairs so that they can continue and pursue their studies. For the 1st time, we have had a child who obtained a master's who was blind and today isworking with the ministry of social affairs and other ministries as well. There are children who have been enrolled in the national schools and five have just concluded. They have become teachers and theyare now volunteers and the minister wishes to recruit them so that they become officials. In terms ofsupport and care, the government has undertaken specific actions and activities and these are aimedat being sustainable over the life, over the school studies of these children. We want to ensure that they can take transport, that they can purchase school books and that they can eat at the schoolcanteen. We want to be able to make resources available to them so that they can enroll in school and thatthey can receive a grant. Together with the ministry of social affairs, we are trying to assist thesechildren on a quarterly basis so that we can relieve costs and pressure on the parents. Thus, the Congolese state is taking measures, whether they be included in plans and policies and we are striving to implementthem to ensure that so-called free education becomes a reality. We are trying to provide resources to these children so that they can pursue their studies. So as to deal with school dropout, includingchildren with disabilities, we talked about inclusion measures and these are in place for children with a physical disability but we also have children who are autistic and we provide educational support for 50children. These are children with, as I say, not a physical disability but are living with autism and they attend school. Once they come to school, they have everything. They can eat. There is a structurein place for them. We have been able to renovate these schools so that this group of children can becared for. We celebrated the international day for persons with disabilities and children with disabilities. In terms of medical support and care, we have an agreement with a foundation on an equalfooting. It is a Dutch foundation which provides us with support and 400 children have regained mobility.However, things became difficult with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have started this program again this year and last year, 2023, the minister attended the surgical operations of 100 children who regainedmobility. I'm talking about children with clubfoot disabilities and other types of disabilities. We have been able then to celebrate the international day of persons with disabilities with 100 children. Itwas an opportunity to raise awareness amongst the media, in the press, and to show people that these children can regain mobility. This is thanks to efforts by the ministry of social affairs. We providethese grants to children with disabilities and we are trying to support them in pursuing long-term studies because we have attained good results for children who are blind or with a physical disability. Theyhave been able to obtain a master's degree. And with the support of everyone, we want to ensure that a disability isn't a hindrance to one's development. We need to be able to accept disability. It isn't onlysomething that's incumbent upon the state but it is also incumbent upon the parents to deal with a disability. We have a physical disability and disabilities that cannot be seen, that aren'tvisible. So the government and the ministries are undertaking major efforts to ensure that children with disabilities are not abandoned. And this is an effort that we all need to undertake together to provide support to these children with disabilities. Thank you very much, Minister. I could perhaps addfurther information at a later stage. Thank you very much, indeed. Before moving on to the various members, let me just say on disability, children with disabilities, we are making efforts. Much remainsto be done because the schools and structures we have discussed are not nationwide. It would be ideal that in each major town and district that we have such structures in place. We will get there with agreat deal of desire and will. A lot of these structures are concentrated in Brazzaville. We have some in Pointe-Noire but we do encounter major difficulties in providing support to childrenelsewhere. That is why we rely a great deal on partners, on you, UNICEF, UNDP and the various bodies in our countryto support us in this major desire. We have given you specific examples. You can verify and see that there are children with disabilities who have been operated on. We have children with disabilitieswho today become teachers at the national structure for the blind, social affairs. We do have blindpeople who have joined the civil service. So we do have this major desire to provide support to children with disabilities. I would like to give the floor now to the advisor. Thank you, Minister. I would liketo add the statement made by the general director of social affairs and tell you a little bit about schooling on children with disabilities. The Director General gave you a great deal of information as regards support for children with disabilities in terms of provision of adapted educational material.I would like to stress the issue of accessibility of children with a disability. Congo has always undertaken significant efforts to promote inclusive schools and to ensure physical accessibility in schools forchildren with a disability. Law 6 of 2019 of the 5th of March 2019 in Article 15 has set out measureson accessibility of persons with reduced mobility and the architectural provisions and the development and adaptation of buildings including public buildings, including schools and universities.This measure is being implemented and it is based on that access ramps have been built in public buildingsin Brazzaville and in the west, in the pool and elsewhere. As regards Indigenous children, the Congolese state together with its partners have set up a specific educational program, a system forthe aura schools for Indigenous children. It means think and respect and act. So the aim is to include these children into the formal educational school and the national action plan 2022/2025 for childrenwith disabilities provides for the training of Indigenous staff to adapt education to their way of living and the inclusion of aura schools. I would like to come back to what the minister said aboutlabour inspectors. You were told that we have 225 inspectors and there is an important aspect that needs to be highlighted here, which is the training of these labour inspectors. We impart this trainingin two separate sections, the training for new labour inspectors and we reach out to the youngpersons in particular. We aim to requalify young people and 35 young people have been retrainedthanks to the ILO and other bodies. We focus on technical aspects linked to monitoring and oversightwhen it comes to child labour, domestic work, et cetera. A training plan is currently being drawn upfor that purpose. Thank you, Madam Minister. Thank you to the adviser, Madam, please, from the Ministry of Health. Thank you, Minister. There is one point that I overlooked earlier and that was to do withthe cold chain in far-flung areas and the provision of medicines. With support from UNICEF, the Ministryof Health has been able to purchase equipment to increase the ability of the cold chain. Mechanisms have therefore been put in place to ensure that vaccinations and medicines can be transportedthat through this cold chain. The building has been inaugurated in Congo and the aim is to increasethe medical supply and provision in all departments of Congo. I should also add that with support from the UNDP, ten warehouses will be set up in various departments to ensure the medical distribution indepartments. So when it comes to supply and provision, it has been increased. It will continue to do so and we will also then reach out to the rural areas. That's what I wanted to say, Minister. Thank youvery much indeed. There was a question about the military officials in the CAR. They have alreadybeen expatriated and sanctioned. We have no peacekeeping operations therefore in the CAR.The last set of individuals were those who were repatriated and they were found guilty andpunished. They were repatriated and removed from the forces. There are some outstanding issues when itcomes to a child who is 16 years of age and enlisted in the army. We are going to review those articles to ensure that a child cannot be enlisted in the army at the age of 16. We have taken due note ofthat point and I would like to thank the task force coordinator for raising it. We are going to work on the articles which are problematic in terms of the conventions that we have signed up to.I believe that we have gone through all of the questions which were raised yesterday. Madam Chair,if there are any questions that have not been answered, we will look at our list once again and if you deem that we haven't given you convincing answers, we will take note of them so that we canprepare a response to them. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. We can now take some follow-up. I see that Madam Aho has already asked for the floor. I see Hind Ayubi Idrisi,Zara Ratu, Berlina Todorova, Benoit van Kerspilk, Bragy Gudbrandson. Am I missing anyone? Okay. Letus begin with Susanna Aho. Thank you, Madam Minister of the Republic of Congo. Thank you for all theanswers that you have provided. With regard to health, though, there was also the issue of theprogramme for accelerated maternal health programme. It is to reduce maternal mortality andthe mortality of young children. There is also the issue of obstetric fistula because of early pregnancies.When it comes to early pregnancies in general, thank you for the answers that you have provided, Minister, but what I was really concerned about is what are you doing to reduce the rate of early pregnancy. I would like to know if there are sexual and reproductive health education programmes inschools and what are you doing to tackle HIV/AIDS amongst teenagers? Is there access to information, condoms? What is being done for these children? We have also spoken about nutrition, in particularmalnutrition. What programmes are available? In your report, you mentioned that pregnant women are taken care of, but I would like to get some more details about these programmes for pregnant womenand for children. Nutrition now, breastfeeding, it is often assumed that all children are best fedin African countries, so why are we asking about it? But it is not the case. Not all children areexclusively breastfed. So what is going on? Also, what is being done about the marketing code of breast milk substitutes? I would like to know if you are doing anything to combat these harmful advertisementsbecause in these advertisements, you see a very healthy, chubby looking baby and you think that's the magic solution. So that's what I have to say about breastfeeding. Now, drug addiction. I have heardthat there is poly drug addiction amongst young people living in the streets or even at home.But I would like to know what prevention programmes are there to deter drug addiction and alcohol addiction? What are you doing to stop the sale of alcoholic beverages to young people?Now on mental health. I have carefully listened to the Minister of Health's speech on the 9th of October2023 in the context of the international day to combat mental health problems. He referred to around 20%of young people affected, but there is no reference to care. And what about all the health professionalscoming from Cuba? Can you give us some more details? Are they specialist staff for providing mental healthcare? I'm very pleased to hear the honest remarks made by the Minister, but what's actually being done?Now, with regard to the floods, we have heard a description of all the problems. We have heardthat local people are in part responsible for soil degradation and environmental problems. But why aren't local people informed about the effects of plastic bags because we have seen so much plasticwaste in the river? Now on malaria. I listened to what you said, but I would like to know what youare doing in the Republic of Congo to ensure that people actually sleep under these mosquito nets. If I look at other African countries, then we see that sometimes the mosquito nets are being used in thefields or by fishermen. But I would like to know what you are doing to ensure they are properly used.You have referred to the assessments that you carry out following distribution, but what are you doing to really ensure that these mosquito nets provided free of charge are being properly used? Thank youfor your answer on the technical capacity in health centers. But when it comes to universal healthinsurance, you have undertaken a stock-taking exercise in the government and you have beentrying to identify the hospitals which will be open to the general public and where they can use this universal health insurance. I would like to know what is the state of play on this program. When isit going to be launched? When are we going to have the cards? And when are we going to know exactly how you set the fee schedules for the medical acts in hospitals? Thank you very much, Madam Chair.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the Delegation from the Republic of Congo for all the answers provided. I would just like to get some more accurate information on diversion. In whatsituations is it applied? We have tackled this issue in our general comment 24, but diversion should bein accordance with certain conditions. There must be the agreement of the victim, e.g. , becausethe example that you gave in your answer was not a very good one. It was a case of sexual violence. It was a case of incest. If the public prosecutor office has the prerogative to dismiss the case or to filethe case without it being brought before a court, then I think that that has a very serious impact on the rights of the victim of sexual violence. It is not just the issue of acknowledging the offense, butalso the punishment, the reparations and remedies. It is not a very good example. I want to have a clear conscience here. I want to make sure that in cases of sexual violence and incest, you are not justgoing to dismiss the case and leave it up to the families to reach an agreement, because in thosesituations, there is just one loser, that is the child victim of such violence. Thank you.Thank you, Chair. Thank you to the Delegation about the answers, about the additional information, particularly with regard to teachers' training, recruitment of teachers. If we had had this informationin the written report, it would have been better, but thank you for this information. Let me start with this issue about sexual violence at home. My colleague just mentioned that. I am wondering whyshould you give priority to the family in this case? This is just a comment. I don't need an answer. Just a comment. Why you prefer to preserve, to keep the family from falling apart when the family abuseschildren? What is the value of keeping this family if the girls are suffering from rape and this type of so just think about that. This is a very long message to the society and to children. Thenthere was this comment that African society is different from European society with regard to girl pregnancy. I totally disagree. I have never heard about European family or parents or societies orstates to be happy with child pregnancy. Quite the opposite. The issue here is how to prevent childpregnancy and here we have this sexual and health reproductive education in schools that is a very good instrument to prevent early pregnancies. Other instruments that my colleague Susanna mentionedand if we fail with preventing pregnancies, if we have a girl pregnant, the issue now is how to help, how to support the girl not to drop out from education because education gives increases her lifechances, gives her chances to succeed in her adult life. This is the issue with girls and keeping themat school. You have this grant project giving grants to girls, pregnant girls to keep them to stay in schools. I did not get any answer to my questions regarding this grant project. How many girls doconsider it as a good project, successful? Yes, the last issue, last issue, last comment is regarding indigenous children's education. You are right. It is a difficult issue. We don't say it is an easy issue.Many societies have these difficulties with the provision of education of indigenous children oror travelers in Europe, but the good practices that we have been heard and we have been discussing inthis Committee is to adapt the school schedule, the school timing with actually the lifestyles of thefamilies of indigenous children. You mentioned that. This is one of the good practices that produces good results. These were my comments, not questions. Thank you, Chair. Back to you.Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the Congolese Delegation for all the efforts it has madeto answer our questions. I have got some follow-up questions on the health and education clusters.Teenagers undergo back street abortions putting their lives in danger. I wonder if we could have someinformation about a possible education program, health education program. I would like to know ifthere is a sexual and reproductive health education program in schools. Is it part of the curriculum?Now, with regard to education, the government continues to deploy efforts to improve accessto and the quality of education, but will you be extending the coverage of pre-primary schooling?What are the strategies you are using to develop preschool education through a holistic earlychildhood care and development program? I have finished, Madam Chair. Thank you. No microphone for the Chair. The next speaker will be Bragi Gudbrandson and I also recognize Sophie Kiladze.Thank you, Madam Chair and welcome to the Delegation. I appreciate the information that you have alreadyshared with us. They are very valuable. Like my colleagues, Madam Todarova and Adyapi, I was a bitconcerned about the reply on sexual abuse in the family. Now, we need and it is our responsibilityaccording to convention to establish a clear mechanism for the protection of children from sexualviolence including in the home. Now, the information that was revealed sort of indicated that you do not have a procedure, work procedure in dealing with child sexual abuse, e.g. , in the home.One of the basic elements of such procedure has to be to remove the offender in the circle of trust. If the offender is in the circle of trust, the perpetrator, whether that be in the family, he needsto be removed or alternatively if that is not a possibility, then you would need to remove the child. Why? Because we know from science, we know from experience, from research and so on, that thechild is at higher risk of being re-victimized if the child continues to live with the perpetrator.Secondly, you need to have a system in which you document the narrative of the child to apply that narrative for the medical evaluation which is also necessary for the judicial procedure, of course.I want to ask you, do you have procedures in place in this relation? Do you have trained people in eliciting the child's narrative in this situation? Do you have trained medical people who can do themedical evaluation in child sexual abuse cases? Do you have procedures in place to ensure that this isreferred to the judicial system for the appropriate dealings? The information you have given to us sortof suggests that nothing of this is in place and it is highly important that you bring together all the different sectors that are involved in this. I'm here referring to the social service or social workersyou have, the medical professions, the psychologists or those who provide psychosocial services and, ofcourse, the legal professionals, the police, the judges to work collaboratively on this cases. Thank you very much. The next speaker is Sophie Kiladze and then I recognize Mary Beloff and then I will comefinally to Mr. Van Keersbilk before we will take a break. So Sophie Kiladze. Thank you, Chair. Good morning and I would like to join my colleagues and also thank you for the information you have providedyesterday and today to the Committee. My question refers to social workers. Madam Head of Delegation has mentioned today earlier that you have the specialized institution where you train social workers but myquestion is whether you think that there is the space of improvement to ensure the quality social work in your country. This is one direction. Another direction is whether you think you need to increasethe number of social workers and also it is very important that the social workers are working alsoin municipalities on the ground in different regions in remote areas and the social workers are also insured with appropriate social protection safeguards. So these are my questions regarding social work. Thankyou very much. Mary Beloff. Good morning. I would like to thank the Delegation for the accurate informationand your country's commitment. We have seen this through the high quality Delegation and thepainstaking efforts you have made to show how you honour your commitments under the Convention. I would just like to add a comment and a question to the remarks already made by colleagues, particularlyand Hind on the subject of sexual violence linked to traditional and community practices but I have aslightly different perspective to that of my colleagues. On several occasions yesterday andtoday the Delegation has shown its concern to try and amicably resolve tensions between culturalpractices and the commitments the country has made through signing up to international instruments.In addition to the colleagues' concerns, I would also like to ask you the following: These amicablesolutions which allow children to stay in the family setting as Bragi mentioned, are they endorsedthrough a higher court, e.g. ? Is there any legal instance which validates that solution? Why am I asking this? Because traditionally even in the framework of the Convention, the best interests ofthe child has been used to give precedence to traditional practices which actually undermine the rights of the child. In some countries this interpretation in favor of traditional practiceson the basis of the best interests of the child actually violates the interests of that child.So to sum up, my concern is the following: Minister and members of the Delegation, can you tell us ifthere is an endorsement by a higher judicial authority in your country of such decisions? Is it just somethingwhich on the contrary just happens? But is there really a proper way of solving these tensions betweenthe different practices? Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I would also like to thank theDelegation for all the information provided. It is very useful. I would like to come back to some questions that I asked yesterday which I haven't yet heard an answer to unless I'm much mistaken.And then I have also got some additional questions which have occurred to me in the wake of the discussion so far. Now, juvenile justice, I asked yesterday how many children are in detention.Even if we haven't got any statistics or figures, you should be able to provide that kind of dataimmediately. I would like to know how many children are in detention. Where are they detained? I would like to know if they are held in prisons where adults are present as well. And I would also like to knowif this because mixing adult and young offenders is very deleterious to a child's development. They arevery often held in inhuman and degrading conditions as well. And prisons are a place of tension in anycase. Rather than talking about alternatives to prison, we talk about noncustodial sentences becausethe best solution for a child is to keep them in their normal setting and detention or imprisonment should be the last resort. You refer to the idea of creating youth wings or child wings in prisons. Isthat really the right approach? I would like to refer you back to general comment 24 from our committee which provides states with guidelines as to how to establish a juvenile justice system which meets thestandards under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I also asked you about the minimum measure of criminal responsibility. It is set at 13 at the moment. Do you plan to increase it? I also asked you about the role of the National Human Rights Commission with regard to children. I don't thinkI have heard an answer to that yet. Then there is a question of child marriage. I will be more specific.Article 37 of the 2010 law is something which I don't really understand. It states there the right topremarriage and marriage refusal is available to children and they can refuse a marriage made underconstraint. I would like to know under what conditions can a child marry? Is it with the parents' authorization?Is it with a judge's authorization? We know it is a source of abuse, particularly when there is a huge age gap between one spouse and the other. If there is a spouse who has an important positional power insociety, it may be difficult to refuse for a child. I asked about the activities of the children's parliament, particularly the involvement of out of school children. I have got additional concerns.We have talked about intercountry adoption. But it is increasingly relevant. It is becoming more andmore visible because of unlawful adoptions which occurred for a large number of years. Have therebeen a large number of intercountry adoptions from Congo in recent years? Were they lawful adoptions? And what happens when a Congolese child who was adopted in the past wants to track down his or herbiological parents and wants to know all about the conditions of adoption? Will that child be supported?We talked about children of imprisoned parents. I don't know how many inmates you have in Congo, butwe do know that if a parent is in detention, that has an impact on a child, particularly when children are living with their mothers in prison. I would like to know have you got many such cases? What conditionsdo they live in? Do you plan to find alternatives? We referred to the aura school's initiative, veryinteresting picture you have painted, a worthwhile project, but there is no state funding. It is normally associations or parents that provide the funding. So I would like to know if you plan toincorporate them into the public sector. A number of my colleagues have referred to child victims.I would like to refer in particular to child victims of international peace keepers. You have referred to legal proceedings. I would like to know if child victims were legally represented. Were they paiddamages as a result of those proceedings? I have heard about disciplinary procedures against these soldiers, but that doesn't go far enough. I think it is the wrong message. If you say thatit is not tolerated, you may be decommissioned, but that's not enough and I would welcome any additional clarification you can give me as we reach the end of the dialogue. Thank you. Right. So Your Excellency,this is now an opportunity for us to have a short break, a coffee break so that you can also confer as to how you would like to proceed after the break for the final part of the dialogue. So let's take abreak for 15 minutes and be back at quarter to 12:00. Thank you. Welcome back, Your Excellency. I handthe floor over to you now for this last stretch of our dialogue together. Thank you very much, Madam Chair,for giving us the floor once again. I would like to thank this very dynamic team for their coordinationand the interest placed in us. We will now turn rapidly to the responses that my Delegation wishesto provide. Before giving the floor to the representative of the Ministry of Health who willshed light on issues of concern to Madam AO related to early pregnancies and the measures in place,I would like to talk about myself. School programmes when it comes to preventing pregnancy. This is part and parcel of the school programme. Children as of the 6th year learn how to avoid a pregnancy. Thisis part of the programme, how to avoid STDs. I was able to calculate my own menstrual cycle as of the 6th year. I knew when I was going to have my period, at what time of the month it would happen, andwhat day of my cycle I could fall pregnant. This has allowed a lot of children, a lot of girls to pursue their studies. Along the path, some of them did fall pregnant. They gave birth but continued theirstudies. It wasn't a hindrance to them. A young girl who attends school falls pregnant. Pregnancy has never been a hindrance. I was able to calculate my menstrual cycle as of the 6th year. This enabled me to conclude my doctoral studies and to take the post-op. Today I had a child when I wanted to, whenit was planned. After my final secondary back certificate, I had a child. I was sure that I was going to fall pregnant on the 13th day. I was able to calculate my menstrual cycle. We have providedresources in the school programme. Boys and girls learn about menstrual cycles and how to avoidfalling pregnant. There are awareness raising programmes which are rolled out to avoid AIDS andsexually transmissible diseases. If you go to a school, a secondary school in Congo, you are going to hear about condoms. Children will learn about them. They will learn about their uses. Even thoughchildren are not at an age to engage in sexual relations, they are already aware of what a condom is. My daughter during the 1st year of secondary school came back with a condom. Shetold us that we had to talk about these and had to talk about preventing AIDS. At least once a year,the educational team visits schools. They talk about sexual reproductive health. They talk about AIDS,early pregnancy and STDs. This is being done. As regards to obstetric fistula,for quite some time we had a governmental programme. Gynecologists and Congolese doctors were trained in how to repair obstetric fistulas. Whether this happens in the military hospital or inpoint more, the doctors have been trained. You can contact a specific dr. who performs an operation. We have the CISPAC organization who provides training to young persons in the INSA and in the nursingschools. I will now give the floor to the representative of the Ministry of Health to provide further explanation and also information on nutrition, malnutrition, how mothers and girls are cared forand how they receive information. For example, a mother with a baby, we look at whether the mother already has HIV and how to test the child so that the child can also be cared for. You have the floor,Madam. Thank you very much, Minister. To provide some additional information, I will start out on nutrition.At the General Directorate for Health and the Promotion of Health, we have a specially dedicated service to following up on nutritional problems. This is a department following under the Directorateof Health and this then is referred to the Directorate of Population because they follow up on issues related to nutrition. On nutrition, we have devised and implemented strategies to supportyoung girls' nutritional needs. I would like to revert to a question raised by Madam Aru and this relatedto the Global Fund. Indeed, yesterday we discussed the problems that Congo has faced. We have been in acrisis and we have experienced a recovery. Now we can make pledges when the optimum conditions are in place. But the Minister also talked about an urgent problem today. We are faced with urgent flooding.So what was in the pipeline to deal with things means that now we need to focus on the emergency. Wehaven't forgotten the original problem. Now that's what happened as regards our pledge. We have a sovereign government. If we have made a pledge, a promise, we are going to follow through on it.Let me now turn to mental health. This is truly a concern of the Ministry of Health. And the Ministry of Health benefited from the International Day of Mental Health to alert the population as to thedangers as to how mental health problems can be dealt with because it affects a large number of the Congolese population. The program is at its early stages and we are looking at structuring it furtherto cover for mental health needs. This is, of course, a public health problem. I discussed earlier breastfeeding, care for HIV/AIDS amongst children. The program in place to provide support and care forchildren with HIV/AIDS. It has an action plan and it cares for children with AIDS. For the year 2022,we have been able to identify over 1500 children with HIV/AIDS. They are undergoing antiretroviral treatment. We have a follow-up procedure in place through a program financed by the global fund.And perhaps let me just talk about mother-to-child transmission. There again, we do have a follow-up in place to raise awareness amongst women about the risks of AIDS, of pregnant women, if they shouldundergo tests. There is awareness raising work for women who may be who may suffer HIV/AIDS and then who can be treated and cared for subsequently. This is in place for children and women with HIV/AIDS.The idea is to provide better care and treatment. I don't know if I have replied to all of the questions.Now, on the universal health coverage, of course, I stand to be corrected by the minister. This is asystem that is currently being set up. We conducted a census amongst the population. We have startedwork at a certain level. And in addition to that, at the same time, we talked about these technicalplatforms, if you will, and looked at how to improve them for the purposes of follow-up. Someone who joins a health coverage wants to have better technical services, technical platforms to ensurethat they have better care and better benefits. And this is a system which will soon be established, as I say. That's the additional information I can give you. Thank you very much, indeed, for thatclarification. Madam Suzanne, you voiced a concern about young girls who are drug addicts. These are young girls who are breast feeding and are drug addicts. Is that correct? Young breast feeding drugaddict mothers. Yes, I had asked about these mothers who are drug addicts but the babies are not yet breast fed. The minister, I am not aware of many mothers who do not breast feed their babies.It may happen that there is a problem faced in terms of breast feeding. If there is a mother with HIV/AIDS,a programme has been established so that these mothers can continue to breast feed their children.I am not part of the follow-up but I know that we have a mobile HIV/AIDS treatment centre which hada programme and it allowed mothers with HIV to continue breast feeding their children. I stand to be corrected by the representative from the Ministry of Health. Looking at whether breast feedmilk substitutes could be used or not, I can't give you more information about that. I do know, however,that in Brazil at the Blanche Gomez hospital, that women are provided advice and counseling about the type of milk to give to their children. Now, if they give another type of milk to their children, well,we have awareness raising campaigns about breast feeding for young mothers on Wednesdays andThursdays. We do have these awareness raising days where midwives explain how to breast feed their children to ensure that their children don't fall into the trap of malnutrition. We tell them thatthey have to administer Vitamin A, et cetera. I also know that there are programmes as well for children who tend to be malnourished. We have follow-up programmes for malnourished children. We providethem with very specific treatment and we explain what type of food should be given to their childrenso that they don't become malnourished. We have about 1200 medicines and technicians from Cuba. There was a question about whether there are experts. No, we don't have any experts as part of that cohort.Doctors have to start to work and then during the 4th or 5th year, they can be sent, referred to a specialization branch. We have doctors who are experts, but for those, the young recruits, they'renot yet experts. They have to work for four or five years and then they take up a specialization. Ithink the task force coordinator asked some questions about the number of children. But now on early pregnancies, I think we covered that. Young girls don't drop out of school because of being pregnant.They attend school. The law does not prohibit and I stated this when I was before the African Union Committee who voiced that concern. I told them that in Congo, a young girl who falls pregnant isnot prohibited from pursuing her studies. I gave them my own example. I told them I had colleaguesor classmates who fell pregnant who continue their studies and who now work. So a young girl is not prevented or prohibited from going to school and continuing her studies. As regards the subsidy ofthe grant that's given to young girls, they're also young boys from poor, needy families who receivethese grants. I think it's the secondary school that provides grants to the best pupils. But when itcomes to the national social network programs, social net programs, we said that there are grants providedto vulnerable families so that they can support their children who go to school or who need medical care.Now, the problem of sexual violence in the family, this is unacceptable. No one can accept it. Asadult women, we do not accept rape. Even if it's among spouses, there needs to be a common agreement.We cannot accept to be raped even if we are married. And we cannot accept seeing one's child being raped.I do not believe that Congolese society is one that will accept rape amongst children. Now, I told youthat there was an issue with the mayor of Brazzaville. He was arrested. He was convicted. And escaped fromprison. But yesterday, he was caught and arrested in the town of Sembe in the Sangha department toI don't know if he was brought back to Brazzaville yesterday or if he is soon to arrive in Brazzaville.This is not something that's accepted. Rape is not accepted. But there is a cultural problem here. Andwe are working on this. There are family secrets that are not accepted. Particularly by the Ministry ofSocial Affairs or the Ministry of Justice. We need to reach a stage where children themselves can reporta case. It shouldn't be reported by a neighbor. We also have this cultural issue that if this gets out,if the secret leaves the family, the child would be at risk. Now, we don't have any centers. That istrue. We don't have any structures to place these children in. We are working so that we build a center. It won't be a center for minors but one rather for women or women who have faced violence so thatthey can be sheltered, hosted in those centers. We need to be able to find a center where women andgirls can be hosted. They need to report themselves. If a young girl speaks out, we are going to set up asocial assistant in each school. We are trying to put forward this project so that it is incorporated bythe government so that we have social assistants in all schools and structures. Their job will be to accompany the child regardless of their situation. Now, the coordinator, we are going to come back tothat. He asked about the tasks and the duties of the junior members of Parliament. It is their task also to protect their colleagues whether they be boys or girls and they need to be able to pass that informationon to adults. As regards the family cocoon, so-called family upbringing, Madame Suzanne asked about theuse of the mosquito nets. Now, there is awareness raising work done before they are distributed. We explain to families why they need to protect themselves and why they are being given mosquito nets. Once thesemosquito nets are distributed, the government very much hopes that they will be used correctly. We hope that mosquito nets will be used to protect children. Now, once the awareness raising work concludes andonce a family takes these mosquito nets and uses them for other purposes, unless we put a guardian in frontof each house and each village, awareness raising is done with the chiefs of the villages, social action districts who support the Ministry of Health. Their job is to explain and to tell people that they needto protect themselves with these mosquito nets, particularly in coastal areas, water areas where there is a lot of water, where flooding has occurred. They cannot have a humanitarian campaign withoutmosquito nets. We always provide explanation. They are aware of the harm done by malaria.Now, if they don't use those mosquito nets, well, we provide them with these mosquito nets. There was amajor campaign ruled out and each family was supposed to have the same number of mosquito nets as beds in the family. So things really are quite difficult. It is not easy, but awareness raising is ongoing.Yes, we still need social workers. We continue to improve the quality of social support. We have theNational Institute of Social Work. Both last year and this year, we have had an admission exam forthat institute. Anyone who graduates from secondary school can apply to attend the National Institute of Social Work. Why? Well, this is because we want skilled, trained workers, those who are already inthe field working, also have an opportunity to pursue continuing training. Also, in that institute, wehave programmes for early childhood. We don't have any schools just for early childhood, but we askedthe French institute, our partner for support. We have signed a memorandum of understanding with a viewto establishing a curriculum for training specialists in early childhood. So that is part and parcel of our work programme. We have got up until 1:00 p.m., haven't we? So we will try and speed ahead.Let's drop in on Mr. Benoit's concerns raised yesterday. You asked about the number of children in detention.We have got some data here. Thank you, Ambassador. Well, in Brazzaville, we have 34 miners, I beg yourpardon, 35 miners in the wing for children, 34 boys and one girl. Then in Point Noir, we have 41 miners,39 boys and two girls. In Dolizy, we have two, both boys. In Mocenjo, sorry, I beg your pardon, in Dolizy,there are two. There is one boy and one girl. In Mocenjo, we have one. It is a boy. In CBT, we have one,a boy. In Madiongo, there are none. And in Gamboma, we have one boy. In Oio, we have four boys and twogirls, so a total of six. In Ewo, we have four, all boys. In Ueso, we have eight boys and one girl, making atotal of nine. And in I Fondo, we have five boys, 105 in total, seven girls, the rest are boys. Have youtotted that up? Thank you. If you can just pause there for a moment, Madam Minister, the Benworth andwould you like to ask a question or make a comment? Yes. Thank you. You have answered part of the question.I would like to know if those children are being held in prisons where they mix with adults or are they in separate facilities. I would like to know what is the proportion between mixed prisons or separate prisonsand what are the prospects for alternatives to detention because obviously we are looking to try and avoid recidivism. Thank you very much. In Brazzaville, there is a separate wing for minors,but in the other prisons, there are no separate wings. What we plan is the following. We havetwo prisons being created. I think the 1st one will be up and running in the department by the end of this month or by the end of next month. We will take the children there for training with a view to theirrehabilitation. Those prisons have specialized staff, health workers, social workers, psychologists,teachers, and vocational training staff. Those centers will come under the auspices of the ministry of youth. The 2nd center will be in the north of the country in Buchanya villagethat is currently being equipped. It is also for the rehabilitation of minors who have committedcrimes. There are others with fewer offenses. They are going to be taken to those centers with a viewto their rehabilitation. At one point, the juvenile judge wanted to know about young people and CIRREV,which is the center for rehabilitating children in situations. Some had already gone through prisons.They were then taken to CIRREV, but it wasn't the right solution for them. They had to go back to prison. This is because they were violent and the other children in CIRREV were just childrenwho were away from their families, living in street situations, not violent, went to school regularly,and who were cared for. Article 37 on the right to refuse premarriage or marriage. I think this is oneof the articles that we can review in the law. Currently, this practice of premarriage is almostobsolete. So I think that we need to amend that law, that article. We need to review it becauseit creates ambiguity, a vacuum for people reading the law raises 1001 questions, but with perhapsthe exception of the really far-flung areas, we won't find this kind of situation anymore. In the majortowns, we won't have that kind of marriage anymore. Girls are given the prerogative to choose theirhusbands. Task force coordinator, you asked us about the aura schools. It is true that they are funded byUNICEF and the LISUNGI project. In the way it is structured, the LISUNGI project has a facet whichdeals with education and health centers, particularly in far-flung areas. So LISUNGI has been funding these aura schools. We need to address this because the project will close at the end of February.It will be the national social safety nets project which will replace it and they will have to address how such schools, the aura schools are going to be supported.Director General, is there any additional information which we can provide to our interlocutors?You have the floor. Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Minister. I thinkthe only subject I still have to address is intercountry adoption. I would like to inform the meeting thatCongo is a party to the Hague Convention on Cooperation Intercountry Adoption. We have been a party since2014 that the legal instrument only entered into force in December 2019 or was discussed only in 2019since 2021 all adoptions must be in accordance with the Hague Convention but we also have the family codeand law 4/20/10. Both of those have provisions pertaining to intercountry adoption. We found that intercountry adoption is very complicated. We normally have full adoption in two stages. Firstly,we have the administrative part in the Ministry of Social Affairs and I can explain this to you by giving an example. Let's imagine there is a child which has been abandoned, picked up from a rubbishbin by law enforcement. If they don't find the biological parents, then that child is put on theMinistry of Social Affairs database and we make sure that the child is taken to one of our shelters foryoung children. We call them the nurseries and we have six months then to ensure adoption of the childso the staff must do everything to try and find the biological parents. Then we have to informthe juvenile judge who rules on the provisional placement of the child in the shelter. If withinsix months there is a claim of parentage who must submit a claim, we also have the decree on adoptionwhich establishes a central authority for dealing with these files. Then you come along with yourlegal representative to initiate the judicial proceedings. So I spoke 1st about the administrative proceedings. Now I'm talking about the judicial proceedings. It can take six months, a year or two years because we need to have the prosecutor, the judge and everybody else who are going to analyzeyour claim because they have to deal with the abandonment, the adoption. The judge has to make all necessary checks to ensure if the child is available for adoption or if the child has beenadopted. Then if the judge confirms the child is handed over to the adoptive parent, then the Ministry of Social Affairs becomes involved again to take note of the identity. But once the judge has ruled onthe adoption, it cannot be turned back. So if you become an adoptive parent, it is from that moment.So that is then the right to take care of the child medically, psychologically andmorally. And once the child is adopted, it is your child. We ban unlawful adoptions. You can look atour files and you will see that we check the Hague Convention rules. A child can come back froman intercountry adoption to know about his or her origins, to know where they were found. We keep all the documentation in the Ministry of Social Affairs. We had children who adopted in France. They came back to our country. They found their files and they discovered where they were abandoned in a rubbishbin or a street and when they left the country. So there is an obligation under the conventionfor adoptive parents to deliver reports on the child to the child and what we have is we have staff goingdown into the field. I went to Italy last year to check on the children adopted there. We work normallyduring the family fate in June. We work on these cases and the children are all brought together inone place and there they get their reports. In a previous year we went to France to look at the adopted children and then Italy. In France we have had the United States as well and Italy. We have alsogot the files Spain and Israel where children have been adopted but as Madam Minister was saying we are awaiting the adoption of a new law on adoption in order to bring our whole legal arsenal into linewith the international instruments, particularly the Hague Convention which is for protecting and for cooperation in intercountry adoption. That's what I can tell you about these cases, Madam Minister.I would just like to add one thing. There is also interfamily adoption. What we have noted is that there are families in Europe who adopt children who are part of their families but that is not in thelaw. They are not cases of full adoption. It is normally a way of getting a child to travel to Europe so they can get their documents. Normally what happens with intercountry adoption is it goesthrough the adoption entity. It is often difficult to deal with these cases because we found thatchildren were traveling directly from Brazzaville to Geneva directly. We need to make sure that the adoption entity deals with these cases and that's why we can say that we don't have unlawful adoptionsanymore. I would like to add some information. Task force coordinator, I will be submitting some moreinformation about the Children's Parliament to you. I don't know if you have the written document. If not, I will give you a copy. If you look at Article 8, you will see that the Children's Parliament in Congo has the mission of to promote and disseminate children's rights, encourage children to expressthemselves and to outline solutions for the problems that concern them, to raise awareness about the basic rules of democracy to disseminate civil and moral values. With that in mind, the Children'sParliament contributes to involving children in their relevant affairs, parents, civil society, stakeholdersand others will be involved in ensuring that there is better attention paid to promoting and protecting children's rights, to raise awareness about the environment and sustainable development, to promoteand disseminate children's rights and to teach children the values of success, moral probity,tolerance, solidarity, respect for others and oneself, to encourage public authorities to meet their international obligations, notably for children in the state's care, to encourage children to freelyexpress their concerns and to involve children in participatory democracy and parliamentary activities through contact with local municipal Councillors, parliamentarians from the adult parliament, etcetera, et cetera. So you are asking if there is a budget for that. The budget comes under the Ministryof Social Affairs and the support provided by UNICEF. That's because we don't want to hand the money straight over to them because it would corrupt them. We want to make sure that it is the ministrythat deals with child protection that governs the budget and that is the Ministry of Social Affairs. So task force coordinator, that's the information that I can provide you about the mission of our youngparliamentarians. So this is what they have to do at both local and national levels. You also asked usabout the representation of out of school children or children living in street situations. Well, they are actually represented by their fellow parliamentarians. I recently received the Potopoto neighborhoodparliamentarian, that's from Brazzaville and she nearly broke down in tears when she said why haven't street children got the same rights as us to go to school and to eat? But let's not forget that thesechildren were chosen at school on the basis of their skills and their qualities. You can't have a childwho doesn't know how to express themselves but we didn't exclude children with disabilities or children coming from vulnerable families or children with albinism. They can all be represented in parliamentand indigenous children as well, particularly those who are at school, they can join the children'sparliament. We have to recognize their abilities to express themselves and to be able to saywhat they want to those who are listening to them. So I think that God willing, the next thing would befor us to appear before the committee during the school holidays so that children can come here and tell you directly about the problems that they face. So there, Madam Chair, I think that I have broughttogether all the answers to the committee members' concerns. Thank you very much. Thank you very much,Your Excellency. I think it's been a very interesting and intense dialogue and we are now going to be drawing to a close. So I'm going to hand over to the task force coordinator to ask him to make someconcluding remarks. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. First and foremost, I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to the Delegation for engaging this exercise. We know it's quite difficult. It's not easy withthe pressure on you during this review to reply immediately to a whole set of questions. The aimof this exercise, as you know, is to establish a dialogue to refresh one's memory as a state whenratifying a convention and to ensure that the state fully implements the spirit of this convention. I hope that this aim has been achieved. In any event, I heard very clearly from you the political will andyour mobilization to pursue the goals of this exercise. We received a whole raft of replies. We have been able to pinpoint the many difficulties that the country still encounters. That's no surprise. Eachcountry faces challenges and, of course, this is also the case for the Republic of Congo. Hence, the need to take stock and to include the ensure that actions are continued over time. Now, what I want to makeclear is that this dialogue isn't the end of the process. I tend to say it's the beginning of a new one. In a couple of weeks' time, you are going to receive concluding observations. And in thoseobservations, you will note that we will request you to implement them and so that this implementationcarries out properly. We need to have a follow-up structure in place, also coordination becausethe concluding observations and recommendations will touch upon a number of departments, ministries and administrations. And there is, therefore, a need for general coordination. Generally speaking, we also ask you to adapt the concluding observations so that they are understood by children themselves. They arethe beneficiaries, of course. And I'm thinking of a presentation before child parliamentarians who then can themselves share this information and disseminate it with their peers. We will also request you toeffectively implement budgets, action plans, timelines in a very specific fashion. There will be a number of issues that we would like to highlight, perhaps the ratification of a number oftreaties that are still being discussed. I'm thinking of the international convention on enforcement appearances and the optional protocol to the convention on civil and political rights whenit comes to the abolition of the death penalty. And when it comes to the CRC, the optional protocol to individual communications which hasn't been mentioned, but I do think that would be the completionof the legal structure which deals with that in the country. And I think these are issues that would then need to be discussed subsequently. We are, of course, delighted to be informed, to be kept abreast of what the state is implementing. There are a number of initiatives which we haven't discussed, but it wouldbe a good idea to follow them. I know that you are thinking of integrating black babies. It's not a verynice term, but this is a program that's being implemented. The aim is to ensure that these children are lifted off the street and are part of a integration program. It also applies to the armed forces and vocational training. This seems to be quite an interesting project on paper and we wish you everysuccess in achieving and implementing that program. So those are some of the challenges that you face. And I very much hope that the state will be able to grapple with the flooding that has occurred, particularlyamongst the population and in particular children. You have our full support and backing as well as the technical support of all of the United Nations agencies and just like UNICEF are very much present andactive in the country and they are there to lend their support to you. Thank you very much indeed. I found this dialogue to be very interesting and productive. Thank you. Your Excellency, it is you who will havethe last word. So I'm handing over to you to make your final general remarks. Thank you very much, Madam Chair,to your team and the task force coordinator for your conclusions. We came here to share information with you to learn and also to make improvements. When you undertake work and someone points outthat the things are going badly, you get the impression that you are not on the right track and that you are heading straight for a wall. But I think that there is room for improvement, for corrections and I thinkit is a good idea to take stock and look at what needs to be improved. I don't see this as in a negative light. I'm here to take on board your comments and observations and I have noted down the establishmentof a Committee, a follow-up Committee. If we have a Committee that will follow up on our commitments, the questions for which you are awaiting a response, you won't want to wait four years for a report andfor those answers. If a Committee is established, we can regularly inform you about developments andwe can tell you that this is the difficulty we have faced in one particular area. Perhaps we won't move quickly but we will need then to review the 2010 law and the articles that perhaps aren't in line withthe Convention. So I am delighted, Madam Chair, to have had this time with you to have heard your comments, your questions, which are somewhat titillating or have been titillating at times. There have been manyquestions raining down upon us, of course, but the aim of the exercise is for us to improve. I would like to thank Madam Suzanne Au who takes very seriously health-related issues. I think we are leaving herewith a whole package of information. Thank you very much indeed for your support and your understanding when it comes to problems that aren't always easy to deal with. But we are striving to move forward andto align ourselves with international standards. However, much remains to be done. Thank you one and all and thank you very much indeed, Madam Chair and to the entire Committee. Thank you, Your Excellency. It iswonderful to hear your renewed commitment and we are glad to hear that you are going to be keeping this on your agenda and following up after you receive the concluding observations. Thank you so much to all the Delegation for all your hard work and your contributions. We really appreciate it andwe wish you a safe journey home and please take our messages back to the children in the Republic of Congo. Perhaps you can tell the children in the Parliament that you have been here and what the experience was like and you can share the concluding observations with them as well.Thank you. The meeting is now closed."}
{"title": "", "text": "Welcome to everyone. I declare open the 2762nd meeting of the 95th session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. I want to express a warm welcome to the Delegation of Bulgariahere in Geneva for the review of its 6th and 7th periodic reports under the convention. I would like to recognize the presence of the head of Delegation, Her Excellency IvankaShalapatova. She is the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and we also have here with us the Ambassador, Yuri Stork. Thank you very much for being here and we see that you have a verysubstantial Delegation. Your Excellency, I'm going to hand over to you to make your opening remarks. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Distinguished Members of the Committee, Ladiesand Gentlemen, it is my honor to lead the Delegation of the Republic of Bulgaria on the occasion of the consideration by the Committee of the Rights of the Child of the 6th and the 7th periodic reports of Bulgaria on the implementation of the Convention of the Rights of the Child.Bulgaria has been facing a range of challenges in the past years related to regional and global realities like the recovery from COVID-19 pandemic, the negative impact of two wars on children,families and societies, the impact of radicalization, manipulation and propaganda often targeting the value of democracy, the role of civil society and children's rights. In addition to the globalchallenges in Bulgaria in the reporting period, the period has been characterized by lack of stability and a series of political crises. A total of eight governments have been changedsince 2016, four regular and four caretaker which limited ability to instate serious legislative and policy reforms. Of course, despite all difficult times, we believe that we have also achievedprogress in the implementation of the Convention. We are here to report and share with you our achievements and areas for further improvements. Bulgaria reaffirms its dedication to the Convention and our Delegation represents the commitment of the newly elected regular government whichhas an ambitious agenda to turn Bulgaria into a great place for children to be born and develop their full potential in a protected and inclusive environment. Bulgaria appreciates the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and its constructive dialogue with state parties.A large number of the recommendations received during the previous dialogue in 2016 have been reflected in policies and programs that safeguard and promote the well-being of children. In the past eight years, there have been a number of legislation amendments adopted, strategicdocuments developed and supportive measures implemented in this domain. In addition to the information already provided in the 6th and the 7th periodic reports, I would like to specifically point out some of the most significant recent developments and initiatives undertaken to improvethe protection and promotion of the Rights of the Child and, of course, to address some of the pressing challenges in this area. In the area of child protection, Bulgaria is actively working to strengthen its child protection system by implementing comprehensive policies, enhancinglegal frameworks and fostering collaborations across sectors to ensure no child is left vulnerable or exposed to harm. In July 2020, the Child Protection Act was amended to ensure notification of imminent risk of abandonment of a child after birth and prevention of abandonment, especiallyof children with disabilities. Perhaps the most significant development in the child protection area in Bulgaria is the deinstitutionalization reform. Bulgaria now has less than 200 children in institutional care in the old type of children's homes, which is a huge change when comparedto the situation during the last reporting, when the number was around 1,500, while in 2009, there were more than 7,500 children in institutions. From the 137 institutions that existed in 2009,we now have only four, which we are committed to fully close by the end of this year. Violence against children is one area where I'm happy to say we have significant achievements in thelast decade. A number of legislative changes have been enforced to combat domestic violence, as well as a wide range of initiatives to combat violence in various forms. The government has recently adopted a national program for the prevention of violence and abuse of childrenfor the period 2023-2026, which defines the framework of the national policy in the field of dealing with violence against children. A new program for the development of integrated services for victims of violence is currently being prepared. In addition, the Bulgarian authoritiesestablished a national children's hotline, which is open 24/7, free of charge, and it receives calls from all over the country. The Bulgarian government is resolutely committed to eradicating child poverty, placing the wellbeing and future of the youngest citizens at the forefront ofour agenda. To this end, we have formulated the national objective for reducing the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by 2030 by 787,000 people, and a specific subtargetfor reducing the number of children under 18 at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 196,750 people, which is 25% of the overall national target. A number of key changes have also beenmade to the Family Allowances Act and the Labor Code in order to support families and empower parents to participate in children's lives. Perhaps most significantly, an entirely new legal framework for social services has been instated with the entering into force of thenew Social Assistance Act in 2020. The new law aims to improve the mechanisms for planning, provision, financing, control, and monitoring of the services, as well as increasing their quality, efficiency, and sustainability. Social services are seen as a key instrument to guaranteechildren's rights through targeted support based on individual needs assessment, the promotion of an integrated approach, and public/private participation in the provision of social services. In November 2022, Bulgaria adopted an action plan on the establishment of a European ChildGuarantee for the period until 2030. The action plan identifies the most vulnerable children, namely children with disabilities, migrant children and refugees, children from minority groups, children in alternative care, and children in vulnerable situation. As part of its 1stimplementation activities, nearly 50,000 children and their families according to their individual needs will benefit from activities for health prevention, home visiting services for children from zero to three years, services for early childhood development and intervention, counselingand mediation for the labor market. In terms of child justice, in June 2023, significant amendments to the criminal procedure code were adopted to fully guarantee the right of the minors to a fair trial. We should admit, however, that we are lagging behind on the serious and deepreforms and they will be implemented by the end of this year to reform the child justice system in its entirety. The reform of the child justice system is one of the pillars of the new national strategy for the child for the period 2024-2030 which is currently being developedwith the view to be ready by the end of next month with the aim of achieving a higher level of care and guarantee of children's rights. The state agency for child protection and the ministry of labor and social policy have conducted an in-depth consultation process including withchildren. Their insights and unique viewpoints always contribute to more fair and child centric policies. A good practice in this area of child participation in Bulgaria is the national children's council, an advisory body to the chair of the state agency for child protection consistingof children aged 13 to 18 including children from vulnerable groups. Their opinions and proposals are taken into full account in the creation and implementation of strategies, policies and various programs. Being an external border to the European Union, Bulgaria has been facingmigrant pressure and a number of security challenges since 2014. The war of aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine further increased their scope. Since the beginning of the war thenumber of Ukrainians who entered Bulgaria is 2.1 million. 171, 571,000 Ukrainians registered for temporary protection. Most of them women and children. Bulgaria has taken a number ofmeasures including through legislative amendments to provide support to refugees from Ukraine with temporary protections such as full access to the labor market, full access to psychological support, social welfare assistance and social services, accommodation and education. Thousandsof Ukrainian school aged children are enrolled in the Bulgarian education system. We are looking to carefully plan our future investments in children and we are acutely aware of the needto start early and invest in children from the earliest age. In October 2023 by order of the Prime Minister a permanent interministerial working group for planning and coordinationof early childhood development policies was established. It is tasked to elaborate an annual plan to promote early childhood development by providing access to social, health, educational and integratedservices and to draft a strategic document for early childhood development in Bulgaria. A reformof the system for early childhood education and care is also underway. To further improve access to education and care in the early years since April 2022 the government has alleviated all crashes in kindergarten fees for families across the country regardless of their socioeconomicstatus. We also developed a national framework for the quality of early childhood education and care. We are particularly proud of the substantial decline also of infant mortalityin our country. Our strategy is focused on investing in prevention, on building a reliable data system which will enable us to implement data driven policies, invest in a competent workforce inall systems responsible for children's rights and achieving a sustainable impact of the investments. I would like to assure you that right after the new concluding observations are published our country will prepare a plan for their implementation. They will be thoroughly examined both by theNational Council for Child Protection and the National Children's Council and specific deadlines for their implementation will be fixed. Madam Chair, Bulgaria remains committed to furtherstrengthening the protection of the rights of the child at a global level. As of January 2023 Bulgaria joined the UNICEF Executive Board where we have been cooperating with other board members to support UNICEF in its noble work of helping children in need worldwide. The group of friendsof children and SDGs that Bulgaria co-chairs in New York work strongly to include the topic of children's rights in all major global processes at the UN level. Being an active member of the UN Human Rights Council in the period 2019/2021 Bulgaria undertook tangible efforts to upholdthe importance of protecting and promoting children's rights around the world. On October 10, 2023 the UN General Assembly elected Bulgaria for a 2nd term as a Member State of the UN HumanRights Council for the period 2024/2026. Bulgaria will continue to support and actively participate in the elaboration of the resolutions on the rights of the child of the council and will work to keep their consensual nature. As a current Member State of the UN Human Rights CouncilBulgaria is an active promoter of the idea of recognizing a right to free secondary education and at least one year of free and compulsory preprimary education. Finally let me briefly introduce the members of the Bulgarian Delegation representing all key authorities who come withgreat enthusiasm and dedication. I will start with the Deputy Head of our Delegation, Mr. Yuri Sterk, our Ambassador and Representative of the Republic of Bulgaria to the UN office.Also we have Mr. Dechev who is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Natalia Miteva, Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Dr. Mikhail Okuliski, the Deputy Minister of Health, Teodora Ivanova Chairperson of the State Agency for Child Protection. I hope that Mariana Toshiva, the Chairpersonof the State Agency for Refugees is with us. Thank you very much. She had a quick travel to join the discussion. Thank you. Genka Georgieva from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chief Inspector Petr Petrov from the Ministry of Interior, Christina Gruzdanova from the Ministryof Foreign Affairs, Head of Unit, Irina Kovacheva from the Ministry of Health, State Expert, Janko Kovacheva, State Expert from the State Agency for Child Protection, Victoria Kolcheva, Chief Expert from the Ministry of Justice, Vesela Vuchkova from the Ministry of Health, also ChiefExpert, Bojana Aleksov, Chief Expert from the Ministry of Education and Science, Kamelia Petrova, Counselor in the Permanent Representative Office of the Bulgarian Republic and Georgie Georgieva, Third Secretary in the Permanent Representation of Our Country. And Gergana Aliakova whom I'mvery thankful for her interpretation support. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. Now I'm going to hand over to the coordinator of our country task force, thatis Hind Ayubi Idrisi and she will make some opening remarks. Much appreciated, Madam Chairperson. Just making sure that you have connected to the English interpretation channel, which ischannel number 2, just making sure that the Delegation and everyone else needing the interpretation has got interpretation into English. You seem to have it. As I was saying, thank you, Madam Chair. Very warm welcome to the Delegation of the Republic of Bulgaria in our midst this afternoon.Absolutely delighted to be involved in this dialogue and to be the person responsible for coordinating the work of our task force made up of, in addition to myself, my colleague, Mr. Bragy Goodbransonand Ms. Faith Harris Marshall who is following us online from Barbados. So may I begin withthe end of your introductory statement, Madam Minister, I would like to commend Bulgaria for initiatives that you have always taken internationally, in particular the renewal of the commitment of thestate parties at the 30th anniversary of the CRC and also you have advocated in favor of protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, in particular the children. So these are very good, laudableinitiatives to uphold the rights of children worldwide. So may I also commend you for having been involved or for having joined and worked in this new government. We really hope that this will bring thecountry political stability thanks to which you will be able to move forward. So we are full of hopehaving heard what you had to say at the beginning of our meeting. This being said, some clarification needs to be brought as you have underscored yourself, our presentation, sorry, we coverthe whole period including between when you hand it over to your reporter. Now, the optional protocol,we are looking at the deadline of 2025 for the optional protocol. So what measures have you taken to give effect to this accession, potential accession. We really hope that accession happensin 2025 as I was saying before. Turning now to laws per se, many legislative initiatives have been taken and I really need you to be clear on this. In this report of the state party in paragraph 33 morespecifically you mentioned the fact that the draft amendments to law 054011 on the amendment of thelaw on the protection of children has been withdrawn and this because a number of provisions ran counter to the principle of the protection of the rights of the child. So these provisions, what were they ifyou could tell me and also could you tell us if any progress has been made on the amendment of thischild protection act which has been interrupted. You also talked to us about the criminal code and the criminal procedure. I will revisit that later on but as far as coordination is concerned could you tell us more kindly about how it works. In other words, what main bodies in charge of coordinatingmatters and ensuring that you monitor the follow-up to the implementation of the CRC and OPC and OPEC. So you have a number of different agencies and the state party's report speaks of a commission, a groupof interministerial experts and this group has been set up for it to then create a mechanism to follow up on the recommendations including those recommendations stemming from the CRC. So my question is what isthis body? How does it work? What means has this body been given? Is this authority powerful enough to be able to monitor things horizontally and vertically and this mechanism in charge of followingup the recommendations of the committee, when was it created and what impact has it had? With regardto the general strategy, Madam Minister, you referred to the report of the state party, it refers toseveral different strategies. The state party has adopted these strategies since the last report submitted to us, the committee. But I don't think you have a comprehensive overall strategy. So much sothat when you read the state party report on the 24th of March, 2022, it was decided by the National Council for the Protection of the Rights of the Children to resume the work of the interministerialWorking Group for the development of a national strategy. So you tell us about that on one hand, but you also tell us about a 2024/2030 national strategy, a different strategy. Now is that the nationalstrategy which had been considered for the protection of the rights of the child in order to implement the CRC and its protocols or is it a different strategy happening in the context of the Europeanstrategy for the rights of the children designed more to combat poverty, vulnerability that children might be experiencing? So could you clarify exactly what these strategies are? The strategy you mentioned,is it the comprehensive strategy to cover all the rights of the child or is it something else? And what are you doing to ensure that it is implemented in terms of budgetary appropriations, in terms of follow-up monitoring? Everything that a strategy needs to be effective when it is a comprehensivestrategy. In terms of resources now, you are right, Madam Minister, Bulgaria has experienced a number of economic challenges. Covid has had the effect it has had. It has an impact on national budgets, created other problems. The fact is that the share of GDP set aside for public expenditure in the areaof health and education and social protection remains still today below the average of the European Union states. So my question would be what measures have you taken to improve your funding of your socialsectors? Also what measures have you taken to ensure that enough budget is set aside for the rights of the child? In other words, have you thought about a child's rights-based budgeting process or at leastdeveloping budget that is sensitive to the rights of the child? What are you doing to ensure that you can trace expenditure to ensure that enough is set aside for the rights of the child? Data gathering now, you have many initiatives including and in particular the survey carried out by the National Institutes forStatistics in order for you to establish a mapping of and target those sectors of society whose rights might have been violated. This being said, we do not have a centralized disaggregated data collectionsystem designed to cover all of matters pertaining to the rights of the child. You have made progress admittedly on what you do to combat violence but once again it is difficult for you to gather disaggregatedcomprehensive statistics to address cases of violence against children, sexual exploitation, online violence, et cetera, et cetera. So what are you planning to do? What are you thinking of doing? What have you already doneto actually create this comprehensive data gathering system which provides you with properly disaggregated data? You have a very good ombuds person who is extremely active in advocating for human, forthe rights of the child who comes, you have created a special national department for the rights of the child but despite the fact that you tell us that you have sufficient gradual funding for this department,this being said, you only have two staff if I'm not wrong and that is not enough to cover everything that needs to be done to do advocacy and to protect the rights of the child comprehensively. So what areyou planning to do to better support this national department or this directorate? Also, the commission that you have to combat discrimination, is it up and running? Is it still in existence, this commission?Bulgaria has an ombuds person, a general ombuds person and then a special department for the rights of children and a national commission to combat discrimination against children. So I have all these three bodies. The problem is, though, that children do not have direct access to these bodies,can't file complaints directly. They need to be represented by adults if they want to do so and therefore there is an issue of accessibility, accessibility for children to national, nationally available remedies. So what are you planning to do to make it possible for these children to availthemselves of these existing mechanisms? You have adopted a number of mechanisms in the area oftraining and the dissemination of the CRC but what are you doing to ensure thattraining is made systematic and compulsory, training on the CRC and its optional protocols forpeople who work in contact with children? And also, there is another concern I would like to share with you as far as dissemination is concerned. You need not only to disseminate the convention but ensurethat the convention is properly rooted in people's mindset socially. So what are you doing to constantly disseminate information about the CRC to ensure that the whole of society is familiar with the content ofthe CRC? Civil society has come up against huge problems since the last report. It has clashedwith a number of difficulties. The civil society did not have enough social space to work and play its role. So my question would be what are you doing to address remedy that situation to allow a civil society to be a fully fledged partner with you to ensure that together you can implement the CRC andits protocols? And finally, the strategy on corporate social responsibility, that strategy was setup in 2019. How effective has it been? It covered 2019, 2023. So how successful has it been in improving living standards and conditions for children? Finally, may I commend you once again for having amended thefamily code and thanks to which you have been able to put an end to every exception for marriages underage of 18. That's an extremely significant success. But what are you doing specifically toensure that people do not get married under age? For example, in the Roma community, some children were getting married as early as 12, even at the time when it was prohibited. It still happens. So what are you doing to ensure that these laws are actually enforced? Thank you very much in anticipation.Thank you very much. The next speaker is Benyam Mesmo. Welcome to the Delegation. It's a pleasureto have you here. We have seen each other, some of you I think in 2016 as well. This is a 6 to 7 report. So it's a clear indication that you engage with this Committee on a regular basis as much as possible. Soquite a number of the questions that at least for my part that I'm interested in are not just only about legislation. They are predominantly about, for instance, quality and impact. And I hope you can bear with me. I think it's a very decent report, well drafted, cross referenced and it makesit easily accessible and thank you for the annexes as well which are very useful. Now I want to start with the four cardinal principles and particularly with non-discrimination. There are a number of things that we can commend you for. For instance, the establishment in 2019 of a permanent Working Group in the commission for the protection against discrimination to address discrimination againstchildren. But again, of course, there are significant challenges in relation to children of Roma descent, migrants, asylum seekers and so forth, so forth. Now, the 1st point that I just want to raise, in Annex 1 you provide us some data from 2017 to 2020 with respect to the commission for protectionagainst discrimination and some of the cases that it has dealt with. And they are very small numbers, 5, 4, 2 and 2. Those are the numbers that you have provided. So what are some of the challengesin terms of making the process as accessible as possible to children, particularly with a view to address discrimination cases? I hope you agree with me that those numbers are actually very, very minuscule taking into account the challenge that exists. Now the 2nd point is in Paragraph 70,you mentioned that the government, the national legal system, and I quote, does not allow discrimination of children on any grounds. And then it also says national anti-discrimination laws as well as child protection act share the same principle. Then does that lead to the conclusion that legislative effortsare adequate enough, that there aren't any gaps in the legislative framework that are creatingloopholes that do not prevent or address discrimination? Honorable Minister, you emphasized the point on prevention that resounds very, very loudly, particularly in relation to non-discrimination, that the prevention element is important. So I'll just give a mention, for instance, in terms oflegislation, there are concerns that, for instance, Article 90, Paragraph 2 of the social services actmight actually lead to some discrimination against children with disabilities. So if there are other examples that you have identified that you can draw our attention to, that legislative efforts can address discrimination, particularly with the view to prevent, it would be much more welcome. My colleagues willdeal with other issues, disabilities and I'll deal with health and also migration and so forth, but from the discrimination angle again, refugees from Ukraine, we are very grateful for the positive efforts that you are undertaking. The numbers are mammoths, 2.1 million is a significant number. So they arrivepredominantly at the border, crossing points along Bulgaria's northern border with Romania. They have significantly unhindered access, but there are concerns that those that are arriving at the southern border are being pushed back. Doesn't this have discriminatory elements? How do you view thosepractices? Don't they violate Article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child that prohibits discrimination? If you can explain a bit more, that would be appreciated. You have provided some details on efforts to address hate speech, again, absolutely critical. Now, two things here. One isArticle 162.2 of the criminal code. To what extent is it being effective? To what extent is it helping you to address hate speech? The 2nd is, are there efforts to establish protocols to prevent and condemn hate speech by public officials and politicians? So if there are efforts, what has been theimpact? Some of the information that we have looked at gives an indication how during election campaigns,including the political parties, some of these hate speeches actually manifest themselves predominantly and, of course, they have implication for children and children's rights. Now, let me move to there are a few other elements on non-discrimination, but I could hopefully come back to them once particularlymy colleague has addressed issues pertaining to violence against children. Let me come to issues pertaining to best interests. Again, your state party report provides some details how this is being done. I will just zoom in on two points. One is there are concerns and let me hear your reaction. There areconcerns that actually say that there are no procedures in place to ensure that the best interests of the child are determined and are a primary consideration in all actions affecting children. Not just certain aspects, not some aspects, but all aspects that actually affect children. So to what extent are youplanning to address this comment? For instance, if we come back to migration from the moment of arrival until a durable solution has been identified, we are informed that there are challenges in best interests determination. Of course, related to best interests determination is the issue of training, particularlyof course those that work with and for children. What are some of the impacts that you have seento training and awareness raising to make sure that best interests is not a side issue but actually isinculcated directly. Now, in relation to the respect for the views of the child, again, very grateful for the information you have provided under paragraphs 82 to 86. Let me mention a couple of points here.What are the efforts that are being undertaken to address norms, harmful beliefs, but also attitudes that discourage children's active participation in society? And what are some of the impacts that youhave seen in this regard? In your report, you make reference twice to the SCP implemented project developed effective policies for observing children's rights. We understand it is from 2018to 2020. We are now 2020 for January. So what are the efforts that you have actually undertaken to implement? And if you have already implemented some of those elements, how have they actually helped youto make progress in realizing children's rights to have their views considered? In our list of issues, we didn't raise questions on the right to life, survival and development. But in the report, inyour response, there are a few elements. Let me start with the positive note. The positive note is that you have made significant progress on the under 5 mortality, which you have already alluded to, which is positive. And it also provides some data. We obviously commend you for that. But you alsoadmit one element, for instance. First of all, the number is still considerable. And there are still efforts that need to be undertaken to address that number. The 2nd is you highlight the challenge that you have faced, particularly in the rural areas. So what are the efforts and the progressthat you are making to address that? The 2nd point that I want to mention is in relation to road accidents. Again, the numbers indicate considerable challenge in terms of road accidents. So with the focus on the right to life, if you can draw attention to some elements there, that would be welcome.There are issues pertaining to suicide rates, particularly for adolescents. Again, if you can share some information on this with a focus on the right to life, that would be much appreciated. Let me come to civil rights and freedoms. I won't be long here. You have ratified a number of instrumentspertaining to nationality and statelessness. We have some figures in relation to the number of stateless individuals that have been provided a status in Bulgaria since 2017. Are there challengesin addressing the obstacles that children without nationality, children that are stateless face in Bulgaria? The 2nd is in your 1954 convention ratification, you have entered a number ofreservations, Article 7, Article 21, 23, 27 and so forth. How are you trying to make sure thatthose reservations are not affecting the rights of children who are stateless? Now, in relation tothe issue of surrogacy, commercial surrogacy and so forth, are there efforts to adopt regulations to govern the practice of commercial surrogacy arrangements, particularly with a focus on children's best interest? And then access to information again, we are grateful for the informationthat you have provided. I will just focus on one element. What has been the effort you have undertaken to ensure that laws and policies on access to information and the digital environment protect children's rights, privacy and safety? And again, if you can update some information, taking intoaccount the fact that the information contained is relatively out of date, that would be welcome. Thank you, Chair. Over to you. Thank you. Our next speaker for this round is Bragy Gudbrandson. Thank you,Chair. Dear Minister and members of the Delegation, warmly welcome. I look forward to exchange viewswith you and learn from you about the situation in Bulgaria. Of course, we will focus on the sort ofelements that are scopes for improvement and be critical in our presentation. But it should be said that many things in we are impressed by your work and your approach and I will try to remember to mentionthose as well in my intervention. First, on violence, the prevalence of violence, there is a problem here due to lack of statistics. And I can see that there are sort of conflicting information or datain this respect. For example, there are rising numbers from the Ministry of Interior with regard to offenses against children while there has been a systematic decline in the reports to the childprotection system. Can these developments be sort of explained? And I am concerned there is no overarching or unified system for data collection and by that I mean agencies do not collect disaggregated databy protected characteristics to allow for analysis in many important areas. Corporate punishment, well, the Bulgarian legislation provides for general prohibition on all forms of violence. We knowthat. And much has been done but still the it can be argued that prohibition is rather weak and thesocial norms accepting corporate punishment are unfortunately still strong and not consistentlyaddressed by the government as well as rather low awareness by children of the rights and support available to protect them against violence. Now, what measures have been taken to strengthen an explicitnormative prohibition to use of corporate punishment? And the sort of programs you have implemented inthis respect. For the child 2019/2/30 was very strong on this 19/2/30 was very strong on thiscorporate punishment but unfortunately its withdrawal didn't sort of make it possible to implement this. I was very pleased to listen to the opening statement to learn that a new national strategy for the childis currently being developed. Will that address corporate punishment in these practices in societyin as a strong manner as the earlier one? Now, there are national programs for the prevention of violence and child abuse. I must admit I'm a bit confused in these national programs because they aremany in fact if I understand it correctly. And one, the latest one was introduced to the government last year, 2023 if I remember correctly. Now, what changes are being introduced in this new national programwith regard to corporate punishment? And have assessments been made on the outcome of the former programs that have been enacted. Now, with regard to domestic violence, we, of course, welcome thenew act on the protection against domestic violence. It simplifies legal procedures and strengthens victims' rights. We are aware of this progress making there. However, there are causes of concern becausein the provision, it is invested that a new system of specialized services will be developed andimplemented. So the problem could be that we will have in Bulgaria two parallel regimes for the regulation of social services and the response system to domestic violence and children at risk. Can you addressthis and explain how this is going to be integrated on the one hand, the system regulated by the socialservices act and the other one, the domestic violence? Now, I appreciate very much your emphasis in youract on child protection on the multisectoral coordination. I think it is absolutely crucial. Andyou are one of the few nations perhaps that have for a pretty long time had this in your legislation. I commend you for that. There are, however, concerns here as the quality of institutional cooperationhas, to the best of my knowledge, actually decreased over the past years with fewer multidisciplinary teams created and there is a lack of reporting from health and educational services, et cetera, etcetera. Now, are you aware of this development and other plans to deal with this issue? What are the root causes for this? Is it the lack of resources, lack of social workers, child professionals? Thisis an important issue to be dealt with. Now, intervention to child victims and witnesses, I couldnot talk at length on that. We all know that a child that has been abused or subjected to violence needsto have favorable conditions to disclose about the abuse. And the disclosure is a prerequisite for the continuation of the case to provide the child with the necessary social support and safety thatneeds therapeutic services. It's necessary for also the judicial and medical process, so on. Now, itseems to me that it's not quite clear how children's disclosure are elicited in Bulgaria as a whole. I know you have these blue rooms in the courthouses, but if I understand it correctly, they can only dealwith the top of the iceberg, those cases that are being processed in the judicial system by law enforcement and the prosecution. Now, there are lots of cases and the majority of these never come tothat stage. And so we need to have an environment favorable to children and professionals who are trained in forensic interviewing who can elicit the child's disclosure and the child's narrative andpreserve that by audiovisual recording and this audiovisual recording can then be used in the judicial system and for the court purposes. Are there any movements, trends in Bulgaria to implementthis approach? Secondly, I want to ask specifically about the child's narratives that are video recorded in the blue rooms. I believe that some of the pretrial states and those court judges,these recordings are evidenced in the court proceedings, but to the best of my knowledge, it happens that children need to be called in the courthouses to be cross examined, even face to face by thelegal defense of the perpetrator. Is that correct? Could you introduce the cross examination if that is needed on the pretrial states and use the video recording during the main procedures so the childdoesn't need to wait months and years for the court case to come? Now, the support for victims,and you have done a lot in there, but still it is my understanding that there are 19 crisis centers in the country which has the capacity to support almost 200 children. According to my sources, these centershave too few understaffed and cannot meet the demand for specialized services. The same applies to theresponse services in the child protection department. They are also having high workloads and turnovers and so on. Are you aware of these problems and is something being done to deal with it? Violence inalternative care institutions, that continues to be a fact and is manifested in many ways. What measures have been taken to deal with these? Online abuse and sexual exploitation. I just today learned aboutthe new report from Internet Watch Foundation which informs us that more than 90% of child sexual abuseimages found on the Internet is now self-generated by the children themselves. Of course, these arein sexting between peers in most cases, but we know that there are also grooming cases, there are coercivecases, et cetera, et cetera. This is not a problem specific for Bulgaria, of course. It is our common problem. I would like to learn if you have taken any measures to counteract this and deal with thisproblem. Finally, with regard to harmful practices, the issue of intersex children, has Bulgaria consideredto legally prohibit unnecessary medical or surgical treatment of intersex children? Is that on the agenda? I will now turn to the family environment and alternative care. First, with regard to thefamily code and parental conflict, I'm concerned about that. Do you have services that are available,accessible for parents who are in divorce procedures and custody, maybe custody conflicts? Are thereservices for children in that situation to help them out? How are children heard in the court proceduresin dealing with these cases? Secondly, the children of migrant parents, we know that there is an increased immigration of Bulgarian citizens going to work abroad. It has been reported that one in four childrenin Bulgaria is left behind by parents who migrate abroad from work. I'm not sure if this figure is correct, but it is amazing if this is true. About 40% from the Roman community. Now, these children areoften entrusted to the care of the grandparents or extended family. Have you taken any measures to address the vulnerability of these children that are left behind? On deinstitutionalization, you shouldbe commended for your great work in this area in the past decade or so. You have made significant reform.However, you are not done yet. You are in the process and I urge you to continue. You mentioned in your stage report that the last remaining four infant homes were envisaged to be closed by the end of last year,2023. Did that happen? Critical appraisal. It could be sort of argued that deinstitutionalization in Bulgaria has mostly focused on quantity of children referred to alternatives to institutional care ratherthan quality of these alternative care settings and that the children are not fully integrated into the community. The argument is really that the actual number of children that are placed out of home,about 2,000 children a year, that number hasn't decreased over this period if my sources are correct. This is concerning. Secondly, I want to mention that there are evidence that support theclaim that support to families with children is insufficient and that explains this excessive out of home placement. Of course, there are multiple factors involved there. If you look at where these childrenare placed, it's I think a worrying development of the use of residential care in family type placementcenters, even newly built family type placement centers are becoming sort of dominant in there. Theemphasis on foster care is not sufficient. Now, I would like to ask you about this as I have information that indicates that the number of foster families is decreasing as a consequence of lack of support.The foster care system is sort of project funded. That doesn't make it really sustainable. Secondly, there has been propaganda campaigns against foster care and foster parents have been described as moneyseekers, et cetera. Is something being done to deal with it, to strengthen foster parents in terms ofcapacity building and training, et cetera, et cetera. Now, the many argue that the children, this high number of children deprived of family environment is due to the weaknesses of the child protection system andthere is evidence to support that the child protection system fails to prevent family separation and to provide quality timely and create support for children at risk and prevent and react to violence againstthem. Has this been addressed? Has it been examined, the work practices of the child protection system?Or is this, again, a different consequence of the lack of human and economic resources? And finally, there are these two groups of children that are particularly at risk of being placed in out of homeplacement, children with disabilities that continue facing the highest risk being separated and Romani children. Can you sort of go through the measures that have been taken in recent years directed specificallyat these categories of children to prevent them from family separation? Thank you. Thank you very much.Well, that brings us to the end of the questions for this round. What we will do now is we will take a 15 minute break and you can use the room next door to organize yourselves and work out how you are goingto respond. Then when we come back, you will have the rest of the afternoon until about 5:30 and then we will take the questions for the 2nd round. So if you haven't finished answering the questions at that point, we will pause anyway so that we can gather the questions so that you have got thisevening to prepare for the 2nd round. I'm going to hand the floor to you and you can indicate to ushow you are going to proceed with answering the 1st round of questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. We will start with answering the questions referring to the criminal code and part of the legislative amendmentsin Bulgaria and then we will continue with the questions related to the coordination and some clarification on the child guarantee, the budget allocation. So I suggest we start one by one. Interms of the criminal code amendments, I will ask my colleague the Deputy Minister of Justice, the flooris yours. Thank you very much. Thank you. I hope you hear me. Concerning the criminal code ofBulgaria, Bulgarian state has adopted several amendments of this very important legal instrument.Bulgaria pursues consistent policy aimed at preventing and eliminating all forms of discrimination and creating understanding and tolerance towards persons belonging to different ethnic religiouslinguistic groups of the population. Internationally, Bulgaria has ratified the framework convention for the protection of national minorities as well as the international convention of the elimination of allforms of racial discrimination. The requirements of the framework decision 2008/913 of the GHA on combatingcertain forms of and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law have also been introduced in the Bulgarian legislation. The national legal framework for combating all cases of hate crimes,racism, intolerance, xenophobia is also up to date and solid. The principle of equality and non-discriminationis guaranteed at the highest legislative level. The constitution of Bulgaria prohibits discrimination in the most categorical way. The recent amendments of the criminal code and the criminal procedure code arein July 2023 the National Assembly adopted important amendments in the criminal code in order to effectively combat racism and intolerance, especially in the qualifying of provisions of the kidnapping. Thisis Article 142 of the criminal code. Also, we have special provision concerning the element of racism,xenophobia in another crime, unlawful imprisonment, Article 142A of the criminal code. Also, again,another crime in which we provide new more severely punished punishment when the coercionis committed for religious, xenophobic or racist reasons. This is Article 143. For the same reasons,we have more severely punished crime in Article 144, threatening, for the same reasons, xenophobic,racist, religious reasons in the crime stalking. This is Article 144A. Also, the crime insult, Article 148,discretion, destruction or damage of religious temple, house or prayer shrine, graves or tombstones,this is Article 164, Paragraph 2, unlawful destruction or damage of another movable or immovable properties,this is in Article 216 of the criminal code, manifest incitement to commit a crime, this is Article 320, andArticle 330 have been supplemented all these kinds of crimes with new paragraphs providing for a heavierpenalty in the event of the offense being committed with racist or xenophobic motivation. The provisionsgoverning hate speech are in Article 162, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the criminal code and Article 163, Paragraph1 of the criminal code as well as in Article 172, Paragraph 1 of the criminal code governing crimesagainst the labor rights of the citizens have also been supplemented, the bias under Article 162 of thecriminal code and Article 163 of the criminal code were supplemented with color, origin, sexual orientationand those under Article 172 of the criminal code with color and sexual orientation. We have also supplement ofthe text of Article 419A of the criminal code which advocates the efforts of Bulgarian authorities forcounteraction to antisemitism. The provisions provide for criminal liability for publicly condoning, denyingor grossly trivializing crimes against peace and humanity committed in a manner likely to incite to violence or hatred against individuals or groups of people united by race, skin color, religion, ethnic,national origin, et cetera. Criminal responsibilities expressly imposed for publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivializing crimes committed during and in connection with national socialist regime. Thequalifying provisions governing murder are in Article 116, bodily harm Article 131, kidnapping Article 142,imprisonment, unlawful imprisonment Article 142A. All these qualifying more severely punishing crimes arebased to the element that they are committed for racial or xenophobic or religious ethnic reasons.Concerning the amendments of the criminal procedure code, it was supplemented last year in order to expandthe list of procedural rights of victims including victims of hate crimes, racism, xenophobia. We also made very important amendments in the criminal procedure code to guarantee the full and correctthe transposition of two important directives of the European Union. The 1st directive is Directive 2016,number 800, which concerns the procedural guarantees for children who are suspect or charged for committinga crime in the field of criminal procedure. The 2nd directive is Directive 2012, number 29, concerningthe minimal standards of the rights and support and protection of victims of crime. In conclusion, I wouldlike also to add that we also made very important amendment of the family code which bans the opportunitychildren to marry under age of 18. This is a crime which must be investigated by police authorities ifthis happens. Thank you very much. I'm ready to answer to all your questions if you have other questions.Then I would like to invite the Chairperson of the State Agency for Child Protection to elaborate more on the questions related to all the bodies, the coordination, the way all these structures and bodies ensure the follow-up from the intervention with the Committee. Please, the floor is yours.Thank you, members of the Child Rights Committee, guests. Thank you for the opportunity to talk youthrough the coordination in Bulgaria in the area of child rights. The Child Protection Agency is a specialized body at the Council of Ministers tasked with management, coordination and controlling thearea of child rights. The Child Protection Agency carries out its powers on the basis of a special act and that's the Child Protection Act. That act covers the UN Child Rights Convention principles.According to this act, the opinion of children is taken into account, the national legislation, the convention principles and public opinion, all those are taken into account in our operation.The Child Protection Agency has a special coordination body and this is the National Child Protection Council, a body under the agency Chairperson. All protection bodies are representedon that council and they are provided for in detail in the Child Protection Act. Those are the Chairperson of the Child Protection Agency, the Minister of Labour and Social Policy, the Minister of Justice, Minister of Health, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Education and Science,Mayors of municipalities, the Minister of Culture. Overall, that's the membership of the NationalCouncil and there is a possibility for civil society to be represented. There is a procedure in place whereby civil society organisation can apply and be approved to be members of the National Council.What's the role of that council? That council makes decisions concerning all important documents and papers related to child rights. It examines strategies to be adopted alongside with programmesand the action plans under them. An absolute grounds provided for in the law is that wheneverthere is a bill amending a piece of legislation concerning child rights, the ex ante opinion of that council needs to be asked and taken into account. I believe that's a very important task.In addition, there are three institutional working parties or task forces whose operation is of great relevance for the council's decisions. Those three groups concern prevention of violence and abuse ofchildren. It is one of the priorities of our work. Secondly, there is the task force on the national strategy for child protection, a topic I will dwell upon a bit later. Thirdly, there is an institutionalworking party on the implementation of the UN Child Protection Committee recommendations. It is not a secret that two months ago yet another working party was set up concerning the amendment to the ChildProtection Act. It is an intention of ours to be carried out in 2024. In view of the coordinationfunction of the Child Protection Act and let me reiterate as provided for in the law, we are in charge of a wide range of coordination mechanisms. We have to monitor their implementation. As an example,I would like to mention the coordination mechanism concerning violence. In 2020 following an amendment to the Child Protection Act, this mechanism is now provided for in the law. On the basis of thatmechanism, we follow special methodology to carry out analysis and reports on the topic of violence in Bulgaria. Well, that's about all I could say on the topic of coordination in Bulgaria. Thank you.No microphone for the speaker from the panel. Now, the child strategy and why it was not adopted.It is my view that it hasn't been discussed widely enough with the public but it came across strong resistance as a result of which it was neither adopted nor the draft prepared could be launched. I thinkwe have learned all too well our lessons of 2019 and 2020. Since last year following an order by Minister Sharapatova, a Working Party was set up and the process was relaunched. The most importantthing about it is that in our consultation process, we have decided to have advanced discussion with the public on what they expect and most importantly, we heard children's voice. We asked children whatthey would like to see in that paper. Together with the Minister of Labour and Social Policy, we launched an initiative entitled the voice of children. We visited a number of institutions, services, childrenwith antisocial contact, children in Roma organizations who came with their parents so that we can hear what they expect us to deliver. We had a public opinion poll on the topic on the website of theChild Protection Agency. We published eight questions to parents, starting with Dear Parents, what would you like to see on that document? We analyzed their reports. I dare say that for a few days now, we havehad a draft. We had the courage of having that discussed with different social groups, with academia, political parties and quite naturally with children. Thus, they will be able to see this new draft preparedafter that wide range of consultations. By February, we expect to have a draft for a national strategy forthe child for the period 2024/2030. That draft will be supported by the relevant plans with responsible entities, indicators of performances and deadlines. So it is a new visionary document we will presentto our public. Thank you. To the strategy on the rights of the child, there is in Bulgaria high political will to ensure that this strategy is going to be accepted with a big consensus in the societyand it will not only stay as a document but it will influence the priorities of all the state, regional and local authorities and the society. The next question was related to the fact whether thisstrategy is more following the philosophy and the priority of the European priority documents, especially the poverty alleviation. Our driving force is the philosophy of the Convention on the Rights of theChild. So the strategy is aiming to ensure 1st strengthening the whole child protection system. We are currently developing amendments in the full legislation, regulations to turn the state agency forchild protection into a state agency for the rights of the child because the child protection system is already there. We created it back in 2000. So it is time now to mainstream all children's rights and havea state authority with the respective funding resources and power to make sure that children's rights are enshrined in all the sectoral and cross-sectoral policies. So, of course, we take into considerationthe European targets of reducing child poverty. We are implementing extremely ambitious plan of actionwhich was developed on the basis of supported by UNICEF national research on the root causes of child poverty. So now we know what are the root causes and the action plan to tackle child poverty. Ofcourse, it is quite ambitious to tackle all the domains which are generating obstacles and are triggering children to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion. But the philosophy of the strategyis children's rights. If you allow me to move on on the budget allocations, unfortunately Bulgaria has not undertaken unofficially regulated child rights budgeting mechanism. We are quite happy to sharethat thanks to the initiative of the national network for children, a vibrant civil society network together with some economic analysis centers and again with the support of UNICEF Bulgaria,there is a draft mechanism which already is generating data. For example, according to the recent data,there is an increase in the investments on children and families in 2017 we invested 4.1% of the GDP forchildren and family policies and measures and in 2021 there was an increase in the investment to 4.7%of the GDP of Bulgaria. Unfortunately we don't have the data counting the 2020 budget but now I can say that being a minister from June 2023 we had significant increase in the budget for this calendar year onlyfor social programs and support services not only for children but also for young people and the elderly.I can generalize the fact that there is a tendency to increase the investments and I have to say that we are developing together with other Member States in the European Union a joint system to measure theimpact of social investments and to ensure that finance ministry colleagues are not treating theseresources as cost but as an investment because when we invest in children we invest in the prosperity of the whole country. So this is the clarification we can give on the budgeting. On the data gathering andsome addition from my colleague from the Ministry of Health on data on the budgeting allocations, please the floor is yours. Thank you, honorable colleagues. I would like to confirm as Deputy Minister of Healththe substantial increase of funds for the health care of the children in Bulgaria. The Ministry of Healthincreased its budget by 4% and reestablished the unit maternal and child health which wasdestroyed several years ago but now is reestablished and one of my colleagues from this unit is part of Delegation. I'm also Chair of the Supervisory Board of the National Health Insurance Fund and I'm very proudto report to you that there is substantial increase also of the funds for child care for the differentexaminations, interventions for the children with about 25%. But also we are paying special attentionto the rural areas. We can mention lately also on the decrease of the infant mortality but regarding the rural areas where there is no so effective health care, the Health Insurance Fund increased throughdifferent mechanisms the access to health care for pregnant women and for delivering the babies. Thankyou. Okay. I suggest we move on to data gathering and our progress so far to ensure segregated data. We will start with the State Agency for Child Protection, Ministry of Health and others may add.Please, the floor is yours. Thank you. We can't but commend ourselves with the success of the ChildProtection Agency and the Government respectively. This year we have started the development of a national information system we have never had before. That's why I'm sharing this with pride. Indeed,the law provides for the development and operation of such a system and on that basis provided for in the Child Protection Act we applied for a project. Fortunately we were successful in securing fundingfor it. The State Child Protection Agency information system will be implemented on the basis of theprinciples and aims of the new eGovernance Strategy of Bulgaria, the national program until 2030,the national program for prevention of child abuse of children until 2026, the draft Child Protection Strategy and a wide range of recommendations by the UN Child Rights Committee.That national information system will have data on children at risk, talented children, children on the adoption list and non-Government organizations dealing with children who have dropped out of schooland other relevant data, data relevant for child protection in Bulgaria. We have preparedthis chart with the architecture of the system and later on we will provide that to all members so that you can have a clarity on the sources of data and to see how this horizontal child protectionpolicy will be given meaning because our purpose is to be able to draw adequate policies on the basis of that system. The system has been launched, the system development has been launched with signingmemorandum of understanding with the most important ministries such as the Ministry of the Interior,Ministry of Health, et cetera. We lay the foundations of the sources of information for the system.We amended the implementing regulation under the Child Protection Act in force as July last yearthat provided the legal basis for launching the system development. Indeed,in addition to the national information system, the Child Protection Agency focuses on data collectionthrough the different monitoring mechanisms we carry out. As I mentioned, I will talk about theviolence prevention mechanism provided for in Article 36 of the Child Protection Act.National information system will give access to all institutions so that all of us can use the same sets of data when we are to stand for our positions before different European and internationalorganizations. Thank you. Institute, I would like to underline the beneficial cooperation between UNICEF and the National Statistics Institute because thanks to this cooperation, the institute is quite ambitiousthat it will further implement better systems to segregate data. At the moment, we can say that thanks to their partnership with the fundamental rights agency, the institute is as a result of a pilotproject they are providing segregated data 1st in the remits of the national census, but also for children in vulnerable situations. This is something that we are going to align with the new nationalcommon unified information system. So I believe that as soon as all the data is driven together in the new system which is subsidized, funded and as you can see, we are committed to make it happen, then wecan report next time impact on having the data when we plan improvements in the child protection system.Short interventions from the health and education system on data. Thank you. I would like to reportthat last year we finalized the full integration of the national health information system which isincluding all kinds of data for the children regarding their mental health, somatic diseases, laboratoryresults, rare diseases, if the child is affected or NCDs, chronic diseases, et cetera. Throughsmart phone application, every parent has direct access to the data of his or her kids and this data can be used for individual purposes, for treatment purposes, but also for planning and policy developmentalso on regional basis. From my point of view, this is very important for the sustainable health policyin Bulgaria. Thank you. Good afternoon. Well, related, integrated with the national health and information system is the information system in the Bulgarian education system. So what we have is,1st of all, a single identity for each user in the education system in the K to 12 specifically,that includes users such as all students, all teachers, administrators and parents. So we haveover a million users in the platform that is related to the administrative services in the education system as well as the educational outcomes. And in addition to that, importantly, this is a system that populates every other platform related to education, including our custom designed andrecently launched digital backpack. This is where all educational content lives in Bulgaria with free access to that is provided to every user in the country, the goal being to prevent digital exclusion and to help support every learner in their journey. So in addition to these integrations between platformsin education, we are seeking integrations with other systems so that the data for our children in the country is, 1st of all, protected, but it is also consistent and it lives within one integrated sort of system across the ministries. Colleagues from the Ministry of Interior.In 2018, under a Bulgarian Swiss project, the Ministry of the Interior set up anIT system against child crime and child protection. In that system, we have personal data populated. That's where we register children under 18 who have committed criminal offenses or other antisocialacts and children with the respect of which protection has been granted. Thanks to a jointinitiative with the child protection system, the Ministry of the Interior will be able to provide desegregated data on police protection. All that will be added to the child protection agency national information system. I will go on to the next question related to civil society.I believe your observation is right in terms of the period that we are reporting. But the good news is that the role of civil society is highly valued by the current government and there will be a number ofinitiatives we are undertaking to empower but also to invest in the social innovations and the ability of civil society organizations to be sustainable partners but also constructive partners of thegovernment in terms of the success we have ensuring the children's rights. So the measures are obviously to continue all the existing mechanisms for participation of the civil society as my colleague,the Chairperson of the state agency for child protection already underlined NGOs are active participants in the national council for child protection. Also there is a new national councilin our ministry, in the ministry of labor and social policy to receive constructive feedback and comments of all civil society organizations. Also we are about to launch a big project funded with 22 millionEuros related to the social economy where NGOs are very, very active participants. And we are improving the way according to the law for nongovernmental organizations, the way they can develop theconsultative committee which is at the level of the Vice Prime Minister of the country. According to the law the state is supposed to invest 1 million Bulgarian lev in the capacity of NGOs. On top ofthat as I already mentioned there is a big increase in the budget allocation for delegated by the state social services. We are happy to say that NGOs are extremely competent providers of the most complexservices partnering local authorities. So there is increase in the funding standard for social services so the service providers will receive more adequate funding and also there is investment in thethe establishment of new social services which will meet better the needs of the children and their families. So in relation to the civil society we hope that the next report will give the arguments andwill indicate the impact of all these measures. In terms of the corporate social responsibility strategythat there is a national working group. It is our mechanism to analyze the impact of the previous strategy and this will inform the new strategy for corporate social responsibility. I would like to say that there is very big involvement of the academia also the NGO sector and representatives of thecorporate sector and there are more and more good practices in Bulgaria of companies investing in different initiatives of both local authorities, NGOs to ensure children's rights, especially activepartners in the institutionalization process which is very much based on the community engagement and companies are important members of the community. So we will be able to provide you with additionalinformation as soon as the impact analysis of the previous CSR strategy is finalized and I hope we can report additionally as soon as the new strategy is already in force. And just to finish, the philosophyunder which my team is coordinating all the stakeholders, thinking about corporate social responsibilities, obviously the sustainable development goals because now we are planning to actually connect thehorizontal implication of all SDGs with the prosperity and welfare of children. This is our ambition but at the moment I can just report it's a plan. There was a question related to the family code and how it willbe enforced to make sure that our enthusiasm for the most recent changes actually impact the quality of life of children and families and the relations, I would like to give the floor to my colleague from the Ministry of Justice and, of course, anybody else from the group may add. Please, the floor is yours.Thank you very much again. I missed to mention actually another very important amendment of thefamily code and it concerns the opportunity for the adopted person but also for the adopters of thechild to discover the secret of adoptions and actually the real biological parents of the adopted child.So this is a new very important amendment of the Bulgarian family code in Article 105, Paragraph 1.So this is extremely important for the rights of children. Of course, we also provided another veryimportant amendments in the criminal procedure code concerning rights of the accused and suspect minorsin criminal proceedings. They have now new rights which are added to the classical rights for everysuspect and every accused in criminal proceedings. They have the right to an individual assessmentto establish their individual characteristics, the right to a medical examination upon detention,the right to be accompanied by a parent, another adult or in court hearings, the right to detention to be applied to them as an exceptional measure, the right to protection of their private and family life.We also made another very important amendment of the criminal procedure code because we underlined in the legal provisions that all investigations and all trials, criminal trials which are led againstminors must have absolute priority. And also we made another very radical amendment which concernsthe terms, the period of detention in the pretrial proceedings until these amendments which came intoforce in June last year, all accused had the same time limits of detention in the pretrial proceedings.After June 2023, thanks to these amendments for minors we have less smaller periods of detentionconcerning only them, only the minors who are accused. And, of course, there was a question concerningthe use of so-called blue houses. We would like homes, rooms. I would like to underline that they are notused only in criminal trials but they are used also in pretrial proceedings and also in civil proceedings.For us it is important the rights of the child. It doesn't matter so much what is the kind of proceedings. It is important the child. And also we made another amendment in the criminal procedure codewhich tried to prevent 2nd victimization of minors who are victims of a crime. We provide obligationwhen they give testimonies to be videotaped or audiotaped to prevent direct contact withthe accused who committed crimes against them, all with the idea to protect theirmental order not to be in some way touched because they are for us always vulnerable victims. Thank you.Thank you very much. Some additions from my colleagues also it will be great if you can clarify the various locations of the blue rooms and also do we have methodology which is unified because I think the interest is okay. We have the infrastructureis it effective, effectively actually supporting the children, please. Thank you. Since you have raised the blue rooms question, there is a point of clarification I would like to make. The Child Protection Agency launched an initiative to map all blue rooms across the country. Currently the number is 70%Now we have a full map of those with their contact details and phone numbers and that information will be made available to courts, prosecution offices, the social assistance agency and its Child Protection Department. Moreover, the Working Party of the Child Protection Agency has drawn up a methodology to workin blue rooms that would also help experts in working with children using those rooms. There is a point I would like to add that in view of ensuring children's best interest in 2023 in terms of children's travels abroad, the family code was amended in Article127B was added. The regional court in the area where a child resides shall examine requests to put a ban on child leaving the country in the event of concrete manifest risk of a child being transported out of the country by a parent, a custodian or a family member.Such proceedings will be opened on the request of a parent, custodian and the court shall immediately inform the border police of such proceedings opened pending judgment the child might leave the country only by virtue of a court order.We elaborate more on the questions related to the refugees, our measures. Also I would like to invite my colleagues to elaborate more on hate speech, what are the measures that we are taking to ensure that we tackle all these topics. Please, I will give the floor to the agency for refugees.Thank you, Minister, Distinguished Chairperson, Distinguished Members of the Committee. I will try to be very brief and touch upon the procedure best interest determination procedures in place for migrant children and refugee children and, of course, asylum seeking children. Here I would like to stress that there is excellent cooperation between Ministry of Interior structures and state agencyfor refugees in case migrant child has been identified, especially in case when the child is unaccompanied. So this procedure includes as soon as possible transfer to one of the safe zones located in our reception facilities for unaccompanied children and parallel to that communication with the respectiveunit for child protection under the agency for social assistance in order to organize the legal, so to say, transfer to our reception facilities. Also I could elaborate more if there are more questions on that, but once the migrant child or applicant for asylum is in one of the reception facilities, as said, we have two safe zonesand a 3rd one with the support of UNICEF will be open at the end of this month in the largest facility close to the Turkish-Bulgarian border. So best interest determination starts, a social expert is appointed to make a rapid vulnerability assessment. Here it is worth to mention that especially unaccompanied children, they areone of the vulnerable groups under the law for asylum and refugees. So after this rapid assessment, which includes also urgent needs to be addressed, the child is registered. And also parallel to that, with the last amendments back 2020 of the law for asylum and refugees,finally we have a legal representative of unaccompanied children which brings us very close to the mechanism of guardianship and here I'm really happy to share that now there is the public discussion until 4th of February 2024 of the new proposed amendmentsto the law for asylum and refugees where the mechanism of guardianship is already designed and we really hope that this Government is really very positive and supportive that it will pass through the Parliament and we will really finally have the guardianship mechanism for migrant children and refugee children. Also the procedure for best interests includesidentification of as soon as possible family reunification if the parents are in a memberstate through the Dublin regulation but also if it's a minor child unaccompanied, then the bestthe solution is to find accommodation in special care and not to remain in our safe zones and here we have real progress in the last two years. We have improved the cooperation with the social carefacilities and last year finally we had reached 49 children which believe me is not easy to find placesin that facilities but 49 unaccompanied children have been placed in that more appropriate facilities and last but not least about training, a lot of efforts all these years are put on training. Thisincludes from border police officers, then again officers from different departments of Ministry of Interior and state agency for refugees staff, not only social experts but also interviewers,registrators and people responsible for the accommodation. The training have different curriculum, it's about child rights, how to minimize the risk for children placed in our in the reception facilitiesbut also when they are in another facility before coming to the safe zones. Special emphasizes on howto support and how to look for mental health care of those children and also state agency for refugeesstaff is implementing the special tool on vulnerability drafted by the European agency on asylum which hasa particular part on how to work with unaccompanied minors. This is very shortly from my side and maybealso it's worth to touch upon the push backs have been mentioned but from our side I can share that they have been isolated cases reported to the state agency for refugees by some asylum seekers themselves,however you know that we have a very strong presence of Frontex, the European agency and very goodcollaboration also between Frontex forces and border police officers and with regards to those pushbacks probably Ministry of Interior could in addition contribute. Also I would like to mention it's my last point here for the time being that with the last amendments to the Foreigners Act we have in theForeigners Act finally also the definition of unaccompanied minors and also the two types of when children could be considered accompanied of course the one is the legal provision about parents and closerelatives to be proved to accompany the child but also the Bulgarian Foreigners Act includes the provision of so-called persons who take care for a child based on the tradition which we know is typical for certaincountries of origin and last but not least I just would like to underline that all asylum applicationsare dealt by the state agency for refugees staff without any discrimination including ethnicity, nationality, country of origin, et cetera. Thank you very much. Thank you. I understand that we canelaborate more on that topic tomorrow. So I suggest we move on to the right to life and survival. I'll give the floor to my colleague from the Ministry of Health. Please. Thank you. We are implementingsubstantial activities and measures in order to protect the lives of children and adolescents and alsoto decrease the infant mortality as I already stated. I would like to share with you the sustainable efforts over the last six, seven years for training of general practitioners, psychologists, socialworkers in early detection of signs of depression and suicide ideation and this is leading to substantialdecrease of the suicide attempts over the last years. There are very few deaths fortunately dueto suicide and through this involvement of professionals from primary healthcare, we are reachingalmost all children and their parents all over the territory of the country. In addition, I just wantto underline that the efforts to reduce the infant mortality also link to the special order of the Ministryof Health, the ordinance 26 which is allowing pregnant uninsured women to have access to monitoring oftheir pregnancies in total four examinations before delivery. The recommendation of the WHO is eight examinations before delivery but we are on the way to increase this number step by step. Something whichis very crucial from my point of view as a mental health professional and I was teaching health and sexual health at schools for many years as well. Under the plan for recovery and sustainability, wefinally are introducing the health, mental health and sexual health education at the Bulgarian schools in a sustainable way, systematic way for all children in accordance to their age. This should start fromthe 15th of September for the new school year. There is a compendium of best practices by Bulgarian scientists,specialists but also by UNICEF, WHO and other relevant organizations. These interventions would addressthe needs of the young people, especially the teenagers, to deal with their interhuman relations,especially in the cases of love pain because we know from the statistics that those cases are leading toincrease the risk of suicide and also suffering from depression. I also want to mention here thepatronage care which we also try to introduce. There are projects by UNICEF in the most vulnerable areas of Bulgaria in the area of Slovenia and other cities but also another Bulgarian NGO and the Ministry ofHealth is trying in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy to take over those goodpractices and to finance them in accordance to our budgets. Thank you. Okay. I suggest that we move onto all the questions related to violence and the way we are ensuring that the new national program is going to be more effective in our efforts to meet these challenges. Please, the floor is yours.Thank you. By decision of the Council of Ministers of 2023, a national program to prevent violence andchild abuse was adopted. There is a two-year plan to implement that national program.So that program is a four-year strategic document setting out the national framework of our government's policy in the area of violence against children. It's coupled with the mechanism of coordinationand cooperation between public bodies, the civil society and the NGO sector. It relies on the supportnetwork of experts, support for parents, awareness among children and improvement of our legal framework.The national program has five strategic goals and 28 strategic objectives. It's based on a thoroughanalysis of the situation in the country. The analysis is for the period 2019/2021 and it's based on data provided by the National Statistics Institute, Eurostat and the responsible ministries.Some of the operational objectives concern the protection of the rights of children involved inconflicts between the parents. Indeed, that problem exists in our country. Another group of children under this program are children whose parents reside overseas over a long period of time, children withdisabilities and children with complex communication challenges, children victims of trafficking and children victims of labor exploitation. A special focus in that strategic document is early marriages andearly births. A review of the legal framework has been made and concrete recommendations to improve the existing legislation have been made. The most important amendments being the amendment to the Family Code ofDecember 2023, amendments already adopted by Parliament. A focus in this important strategic document is the support by all parents. The program provides for a straightforward monitoring mechanism,both internally and externally and it's for the 1st time that we see that in a document like that. Data is collected on a quarterly basis that's analyzed and forwarded to all members of the National ChildProtection Council to make sure that they're fully aware of the challenges identified under that program.So what have we accomplished so far? The program has existed for a year. A thorough analysis has been made and the most important activities further to the methodology to use the blue rooms and hear childrenin blue rooms. There are some more important points I'd like to mention. One of the activitiesis a joint one between our agency and the Ministry of Health and the Regional Health Directorate. We carried out monitoring on all hospitals concerning admission of children, unaccompanied childrenin hospitals and the measures to be taken in that respect. A report has been drawn up on the actual situation in the country on children with disabilities and children with complex communication needs. Now,we have a clarity on the number of those children and their initial needs. We had a special roundtable discussion on that topic. A Working Party has yet to be set up so that we can start addressingthat matter. Monitoring has been carried out in the two correctional facilities for children serving custodial sentences in the near Brata and Sliven. Now, we have an idea of what's been going onthere. We'll be working towards developing programs to work with children who have violated the law but also with their parents. Last but not least, we have set up a Working Party to develop special indicatorsthat's particularly relevant because that Working Party will be able to inform us on how to accountfor violence by and against children. So, we'll have a single methodology. In terms of interventions on early marriages and early births, on each 33 months, we have meetings in different areas of the country,the last one being in the area of the town of Sliven where we have the biggest number of such cases.I'd like to also let you know that we've involved municipalities, that's local authorities, so that we can report on regular basis on the measures and improvements on that important strategic document.Thank you. Dear Distinguished Members of the Committee, dear colleagues, I'm from Ministry of Health. I only want to add that regarding the recommendation for established adequate andcoordinated mechanisms for identification and protection of child victims of trafficking,Ministry of Health has taken actions for accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the Council of EuropeConvention Against Trafficking in Human Organs. Thank you for attention. In addition, anybody else fromthe Delegation? Ministry of Interior? A question has been asked concerning online exploitation of childrenand I'd like to briefly talk you through the measures the Ministry of the Interior has taken to prevent such criminal offenses. In terms of prevention, the cyber crime section under theorganized crime directorate of the ministry, they work against sexual exploitation of children. They have regular meetings across the country with children and together with the National Centerfor Safe Internet, police officers share cases they worked on depending on the age group of children they work with. Children are informed of the different online threats and how to resist againstthose. We inform them of the different types of computer crimes that we teach them in safe use of the Internet and how to deal with this computer settings, those to prevent unsolicited contact.I inform them of the risk and what to do to protect themselves against those risks. To add to that point, on the 9th of November, 2023, we had the 1st national conference on children in the digitalworld. So it was entitled together for safe Internet in Bulgaria. The event was organized by UNICEF together with the Child Protection Agency, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Network forChildren and the Parents Association. Experts and management from the Ministry of the Interior alsoattended that event. Thank you. At the date that you are referring to in terms of the social services infrastructure for children who are victims of abuse, you are absolutely right, pointed out the factthat at the moment the infrastructure and its capacity is not enough. That's why I'm happy to say that in this year's budget, as I already highlighted, there is significant increase in the funding for new services. Our priority is to increase the capacity of the existing well functioning withquality services around the country but also to be able to provide additional resource to the local authorities and NGOs to open new crisis centers both for children and for mothers who are victims ofany form of abuse. Our data shows that this investment will be really invested in this infrastructure and let me again say that we are happy that in line with the philosophy of the Social Assistance Act,this is going to happen in a very well planned manner because the new map for social services, includingspecialized services for children, victims of abuse is already ensuring that there is analysis on the demand on the basis of which the investment and the infrastructure is going to be opened up. And againto say not only the crisis center but we are going to increase the infrastructure of the community support centers which are extremely instrumental. Also we are improving the local authority coordination betweenMinistry of Interior team because they opened up a special structure related to supporting women andchildren who are in such situations coordinating with the social services to intervene early and effectively and also, of course, we have the mother and baby units. We are ready to finish because time is runningout with just a short reflection on the intersex children on behalf of the Ministry of Health and I believe this should be May I actually suggest that you address us on that tomorrow because otherwise we won't have enough time to put all our 2nd round of questions to you and we would like to do thattoday so that you have time to think about it. And, of course, you can expect follow-up questions on everything that you have said as well but you will get those tomorrow. So let's move to the 2nd round of questions and thank you so much for all your answers so far. But the 1st speaker in this roundis Bragy Gudbrandson. Thank you, Chair and thank you Delegation for your information. Well, I will address the cluster on disability and I will try to confine myself to a few elements 1st regarding generalimplementation of your legislation. We do appreciate the measures to advance the rights of children with disabilities. Can you share with us how you plan to continue Bulgaria's efforts to adopt a human rightsbased approach to disability? And I will ask you two specific questions on that. On one hand,the awareness raising campaigns which I believe are necessary to combat the stigmatization of children with disability and promote a more positive image of them as right holders. And the 2nd part is theagain statistics, the absence of a unified interinstitutional system for collecting data on the number of children with disabilities, the type of disability and the specific needs of these childrenwhich I believe seriously hampers the implementation with the effective policies to ensure equal access to basic services for children with disabilities. Now, the 2nd aspect is the early detection ofdisability. Studies reveal that for nearly one-third of children in Bulgaria, developmental difficultiesor disabilities are detected too late or only after the age of three. According to all our information, not all areas of child development are systematically monitored. Is the government aware of this situationand plans to remedy it? On early intervention, there is no system for early childhood intervention, including systematic developmental monitoring and referral to early childhood intervention services for all childrenidentified with developmental delays. In last year, I think UNICEF reported that it would be happy to work together with the Bulgarian government to support the development of a national early childhood interventionsystem. Is the government willing to work with UNICEF on this matter? Fragmentation of services is a concern.A study on services for children with disabilities and particularly developmental disabilities under 7revealed rather sort of fragmentation of services across social health and educational sector with no coordination between the multiple experts and service providers and services are more sort of like expert driven and notfamily orientated enough. Are you aware of these shortcomings and willing to seek solutions to this?Yes. We have earlier discussed the high rate of institutionalization of children with disabilities. What measures, if any, have been taken to facilitate thetransition of children with disabilities from the institutional setting to a family setting and strengthen the non-institutional protection network in line with the position ofthis committee and the CRPD. Finally, the training and capacity building for professionals working with children with disabilities. There doesn't seem to be arrangements for regulartraining and supervisions of the professionals who directly work with children with developmental difficulties and disabilities. Studies have shown thatthere is a prevalence of negative attitudes of professionals towards children with disabilities. Is the state party aware of this situation and plans to respond to it? Thank you very much for listening.The next speaker is Benyam Mezmur. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I also join my colleague in thanking the responses that have been provided, particularly those that are focused on, as I mentioned earlier, impact and progress and quality butalso decision making and program making that is focused on data, which I think is something that I will come to in a moment. I will focus on health. I have 5 min . So forgive me if I don't give you much credit and I come to the question straight. Now, in relation to health and health services, what are the efforts being undertaken to establish the national children's hospital and also the efforts to ensure the availability of health mediators throughout the state party? You provide detailed information on that, but if you canrespond to this, it would be appreciated. Do you also see the need to develop a strategy to address health inequalities and the underlying causes in respect of uninsured pregnant women and children in disadvantaged situations because this is one issue that has come out clearly? Now, is there also a feeling that there are adequate allocation of resources, human and financial resources for the implementation of the nationalprogram for improving maternal and child health 2021/2030? It is a very important plan and program. But if you can share with us if not, then what are the efforts to make sure that the necessary resources are allocated to make that program as successful as possible? Now, in relation to the Roma community, this doesn't come out as a surprise to you. You make reference to children of Roma region or Roma communities more than20 times in your report. Are there efforts to prevent the segregation of Roma women and their newborns into ethnically segregated maternity wards to ensure that they have equal access to quality health services? Is this an issue that you have identified as a problem? If so, how do you plan to address this? Let me come to breastfeeding. Now, paragraph 156 provides some information on breastfeeding, adequate information. For instance, aboutthe preparation and training of mothers for breastfeeding newborns, the numerous initiatives that mark World Breastfeeding Week and an information campaign on breastfeeding. What it doesn't provide and which we are keen to hear from you is what have been the impacts of these efforts that you have been undertaking to address breastfeeding. For instance, in relation to underweight and anemia among infants or in relation to particularly minorities, there is some data that shows thatthe exclusive breastfeeding numbers are going down. In fact, some of the data as compared to Europe also shows a relatively lower number within Bulgaria. Let me come to adolescent health. One specific point that I would like to flag is that you can be commended for the adoption of the educational standard on civic health, environmental and intercultural education in 2016, which also includes sexual reproductive health and rights issues, but still in Bulgaria we have a very high adolescent birth rateand also significant numbers of abortion. So the question is what measures have been implemented to ensure that adolescents, including those with specific needs, have access to appropriate and high quality information and services for sexual and reproductive health and rights, including easy and affordable access to effective contraception. When I pose this question, it is not lost on me that there is resistance within parties, within communities. Soit would be important if you also share with us some of the efforts you are undertaking to address those resistances that might be prevalent within the state party. There were some references to mental health. We appreciate the responses. The head of Delegation has already mentioned that COVID is one of the challenges and long lasting effects that you are facing. This also relates to mental health. So what are some of theissues that you have continued to address that have been created as a result of COVID? And in general, how were the effects and also how were the effects and impact of the national program to improve maternal and child health 2014-2020 was evaluated? If it also includes some elements on mental health, it would be much appreciated. In the interest of time, let me come to standard of living. Here, two specific questions. Just as an entry, let me mentionthat the data shows the significant disparity that specific minorities face, particularly Roma children face. Now, is there a plan to increase social benefits to reflect the rising cost of living? And secondly, are there also any plans to review the impact of the amendments to the family allowance act concerning the suspension or determination of family allowances if the child stops attending school or when the child becomes a parent with a view to ensuring thatall such children in need can receive social benefits and family allowances? Finally, in relation to climate change and environment, environmental health, again, thank you for the information that has been provided. Two points here. You have provided some detail about the plans that you have put in, for instance, in relation to mitigation, in relation to adaptation. To what extent do these plans actually take children's views into account? Secondly, to what extent do they movebeyond making children beneficiaries but actually active role players? Now, I understand one plan is from 2019, but maybe you can look forward and tell us what you plan to do to make sure that children are not in the margins but actually at the center. And the 2nd point and last, the national atmospheric air quality monitoring system that monitors air quality based on the atmospheric air purity act is provided. That's good. But I hope it's also telling you that more than 90% of children in Bulgariaare exposed to excessive levels of air pollution. This is according to WHO guidelines. 5% of children have elevated levels of lead in their blood. So what are the efforts that are being undertaken to address this? Thank you, Chair. Over to you. Thank you, Mr. Merzmer. The next speaker is Faith Marshall Harris. She is in Barbados and she will now be joining us online to put her questions to you. So Faith, we hope thatyou can hear us and see us and we look forward to seeing you in a moment. Yes, I can certainly see you and hear you. Warm, very warm greetings to the Delegation from Bulgaria. I would like to explain that due to circumstances entirely beyond my control, I'm not in the room with you. But I'm joining remotelyfrom Australia. But I was very determined to be part of this dialogue. So despite my distance, I'm hanging on your every word. I was very motivated to hear about the children of Bulgaria. I did not want to miss any part of it. Honorable Madam Minister, I find that in listeningyou what has happened so far, what has been said so far, that in a number of the areas you have preempted my questions. I understand that you are a new government installed fromJune 2023, so that in fact a number of my questions that I wanted to ask you seem to have answered. This is particularly in the area of asylum seeking, refugees and immigrantchildren, as well as child justice. But because it would seem to me that you have hit the ground running since June 2023 and a lot has changed, I am therefore in those areas going to be moretelling you what my wish list would be that you include and probably invite you to think of some other areas that you have not mentioned so far. But 1st let me deal with education.And that may be for me the problematic area that I want to highlight. I know that the rightto education is guaranteed in your constitution and it is compulsory and free up to the age of 16 years and quite commendably it is free access to early childhood education which isrecently granted from the age of 3 and made compulsory from 4 years. But what is concerning is that they seem to be exceptionally low enrollment rates for early childhood education and veryhigh dropout rates at the primary and secondary levels. And that this is particularly so in deprived areas where the rural and urban poor live where the ethnic minority children arelike that of the Roma and for children with disabilities. So I would wish to know if this is a matter you have started to address because it seems to me that you have been looking at most of these concerns already and you possibly have done. I would like to suggest that youfocus on this if you have not done so so far. One of the reports that we have noted is that there was a possibility that in fact this had to do with funding which did not follow throughin terms of the implementation of the attempts to provide more and earlier start to childhoodeducation. So I would wish that also to be noted. The dropout rates are, of course, very concerningas well and particularly so among the Roma and girls. I know that they are often leaving school early. Of course, that might be part of their tradition and their reality but I would like to know ifthere is anything that you are doing to stem this trend to prevent early dropout among them because this limits their future development and life chances and in fact continues the cycle where they remain in poverty. So I wanted to know if anything can be done to change thisnarrative for them. I think that I have read and I have picked up the idea that you have been making very clear attempts recently to reform education but the quality of education still seems to presentsome concerns, particularly the aims of it, the delivery of positive educational outcomes, especially for children in the vulnerable situations, seem to be not as it should be. Once again, I must ask ifthis has anything to do with the lack of funding. For example, a report for the key policy initiatives such as inclusive education for children with disabilities and the desegregation of schools, thatthese were not actually funded from the main Ministry of Education budget and consequently these projects tended sometimes to be side-lined. Students themselves have been complaining by the reports that we getthat what they learn in schools is not relevant to them. There is no teaching of life skills, e.g. , digital literacy is below par, that teachers are using outdated methods because many of themare nearing retirement and that this is affecting the quality of what they can deliver because there is no teacher training or retraining of the aging teaching staff who are stuck with the old methods and that there has been a failure to recruit younger teachers. I wonder if thisis because of either poor pay or poor conditions and they are saying that this is why they are lagging behind. In that regard, let me point out that I noted from reports that Bulgaria has the lowestPISA rating in all of Europe and I would want you to pay some attention or tell me that this is nowimproving rapidly. I was pleased to hear that you have introduced or because my report earlier was that there was no teaching of sexual and reproductive health in schools but I heard earlier that this wasso. I don't know if my report was an old one. There was a note of reports that they are very low levels of literacy and numeracy and that every other 15-year-old is underperforming and that the performanceof Roma and other children from vulnerable situations lags some three years behind their peers. The question is, is this due to lack of materials or a proper development of curricula or poor teaching methods? I wouldinvite you to consider whether that's the causes and whether this is being addressed. One of the difficulties that appeared in our report seemed to be that the school environment is plagued with violence, harassment andbullying and the parents claim that much of this is perpetuated by staff. I don't know if this is rightly attributed and this is particularly against children from vulnerable groups. The parents claim that there is physical, verbal and psychological abuse of children andthat this is not adequately reported or addressed and I would be interested if any mechanism could be put in place to ensure that these concerns are addressed. I think the dry drop rate among vulnerable children could also be attributed to the fact that although your constitution provides on the article 36/2 the right of everyone to study and use their mother tongue, that in manychildren actually do not get this opportunity to study in their mother tongue because not many teachers are trained or equipped to do so and also whether there was enough cultural sensitivity in the curriculum to allow persons who belong to minorities to want to continue in education. One of my concerns is the human rights education part of the school curriculum and my suggestionwould be that if it is not, it should be because it would help to reduce discrimination and segregation in schools as obviously it would teach children how to be sensitive to each other's rights. I think that I have covered most of what I had because as I said I have been sort of editing this very rapidly. One of the areas that I haven't really heard enough about is inclusive education which although admirablyBulgaria seems to have been spearheading the move towards inclusive education, this seems very much still to be a bit of a paper tiger in that the quality is still not there, not enough teachers to teach children in the mainstream schools, disabled children in mainstream schools. There is not, I gather, not enough sufficient, not enough funding resources and not enough provisionof reasonable accommodation to improve their access. I'm moving very swiftly on to the special protection measures. Now, a lot of what you have told me earlier actually addressed the question of asylum seeking, refugee and migrant children. I can quickly look at the one or two areas that I didn't think, I thought that I need to hear more about and that is that there were many, many reports. I don't know how quitecredible, of the violent push back of children at the border. I commend you absolutely for the large number of Ukrainian children that you have hosted and the arrangements you have made for them. But I am detecting from the reports, but this may, of course, you can correct me, that the provisions made to the Ukrainian children were somewhat exceptional and did not extend to the other children coming fromother areas and that, in fact, there is a great deal of reform law that at the border they are beating, sexual assault, mauling by dogs, use of electronic devices, forced undressing and robbery and that the border officials themselves are exercising their own form of deciding who comes over the border and this ismainly in terms of Turkey and Greece. So I would like you to address that. There was a concern that was registered that children were being detained in unsanitary conditions but you have been speaking that they are moving to safe zones and also one of the reports I received was that the, in fact, they are not getting formal education. There is some informal education paid mainlyby NGOs and that the government themselves are not giving them health care or educational care but some of your reports today suggest that that may be an antiquated report. I want to deal with the justice area. Look, mainly I am pleased and thrilled that finally you are moving on modernizing justice and I cannot cover all of what I would like to ask you to do adequately butI want to be assured because I heard that you will be bringing us a new justice, child justice legislation in the next few months to come and so that is exciting. But I hope it includes the use of diversion, that it includes dealing with making sure that children have legal aid, making sure that they are not detained for lengthy periods and thatI would obviously in follow-up deal with some of these in case I have missed any of them. But I think that in terms of child justice, it seems as if you are moving in the right direction quite after I must say to you 15, how many years? Since 2009 when this modern legislation was promised. My last point on child justice was that the, and which is concerning, that children under the age of criminal responsibility arebeing detained in correctional schools which is deprived of the liberty and they are caught for challenging behaviors. I hope you are getting rid of this antiquated notion of antisocial behavior and that eventually they are virtually criminalized despite the fact that they are under the age of criminal responsibility and that their situations are not reviewed in those facilities and I hope that you are also considering their legal liability in the future. Thank you. Just a questionand that they are not getting any judicial oversight. I will stop at this point because I think that I will get the chance to complete any other concerns that I may have. Thank you.Thank you very much, Faith. And Hind, I will be addressing has one or two questions as well. Thank you very much, Faith. And now Hind is going to ask some questions. Thank you verymuch, Madam Chair. I only have a few short minutes left. And, of course, I will be able to return to these matters tomorrow and address more issues. First of all, on the follow-up to the two optional protocols, let me start with the protocol on the sale of children andpornography and child pornography. As has been said, there is a lot of sexual violence against children, notably online. We have heard that there is a strategy for the digital sphere.My question is about what is envisaged or what you are already doing to have a comprehensive strategy to protect against this sale of children or pornography or child pornography and to combatthe causes of these phenomena. What about prevention? What is being done to ensure that legislation is entirely in line with the definitions of the sale of children and child pornography inthe protocol? I know you have a legal framework, but we would like to know about exact alignment with the Convention. Another question relates to the amendment of penal code, thinking aboutthe European directive to combat child pornography. And finally, what have you done to consider the recommendations of the special rapporteur who visited Bulgaria and worked specificallyon these issues in 2020? Moving on swiftly to the protocol on children in armed conflict, in your report, you say that the authorities are trained to detect children who have beeninvolved in armed conflict when they seek international protection. Could you perhaps provide information about the number of such children identified if you have these figures and what has been doneto provide care for them and to ensure they are fully included in society once again? Thank you for your patience and we will come back to more questions tomorrow. Thank you very much,Hind. And thank you to you for all taking all your notes and getting ready for tomorrow. And I know it is a lot of questions. But you have the evening to prepare. Sorry. And we will seeyou tomorrow at 10:00. And, of course, there will be opportunity for you to answer these questions, anything that was left over that you didn't get to. But you can also expect that the Committee will be asking more follow-up questions as we go. Thank you. Enjoy the eveningas well as you can. And thank you to the interpreters for the extra minute."}
{"title": "", "text": "I declare open the 2763rd meeting of the 95th session of the Committee on the Rights ofthe Child. This is the 2nd meeting dedicated to the review of the 5th and 6th and 7th reports of Bulgaria. We welcome the Delegation back for the 2nd meeting. And I just wantto point out that you will have time during this meeting until 12:45 to finish answering the 1st rounds of questions and, of course, to carry on with your 2nd round of questionsthat you did. And then there will but during that time there will be a short break at 11:30. So at 11:30 we will have a break. And then at 12:45 we should be rounding off. Of course,at any time it's also possible that members might be asking follow-up questions. So I'm going to hand over to you, Your Excellency, and you can let us know how you are going tobe proceeding. Madam Chair, good morning, everyone. Thank you for allowing us to elaborate more on the questions that we received yesterday. We will start with the questions raised by Mrs.Harris related to education, the reform in this area, digitalization. And please allow me to give the floor to the Deputy Minister of Education and Science. The floor is yours. Good morning, Natalia Miteva, Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Bulgaria. It is a pleasure tobe able to respond to your questions. And thank you all for addressing key areas in Bulgarian education in all your questions yesterday. I will start by addressing the inclusion of vulnerablegroups, specifically Roma and the issues of dropouts as you suggested yesterday. Importantly, the main values of our educational system include universal access to education and lack of discrimination.To that end, we do not have the segregated schools. What we have is a leftover of where territorially schools were built in previous decades under an entirely different system. So we do have schools that are in neighborhoods or geographic areas with the concentration ofvulnerable groups. To address that sort of secondary segregation that exists, we have launched a number of national programs over time and invested tens of millions of Euro to provide municipalities with the resources to address that at the local level which is where all of this is taking place.That includes mixing students between schools at the city and village level. It includes free transportation where needed additional cultural activities to increase sensitivity to these issues working with parents, community leaders and families to address different kinds of vulnerabilitiesand to where possible provide opportunities for these children to attend different schools. With that, I also want to say that our policy towards all vulnerable groups does not focus on ethnic character and we do not specifically collect ethnic data so that we do not elicit any discriminationin our policies or data. What we do think of is different kinds of vulnerabilities and that includes a lot of times whether or not the child speaks a different language at the home, in their home or whether or not they live in a sort of poverty cycle or poverty, impoverishedfamily, different religious backgrounds and so on. So our policies reflect that by funding educational mediators. These are targeted specialists that work with communities and we have closeto 500 of those for which have provided sustainable funding so they can work full time with communities and families to make sure that kids are taken care of. In addition, we have at the local level cross institutional working groups under the so-called mechanism for inclusion. So thoseare local teams that include people from the regional authorities of education, from the social system and the police and together as a team they go into neighborhoods prior tothe start of the educational year to make sure every kid is included at the start of the school year. They also follow through throughout the academic year to make sure that children stay and do not drop out in the course of the year. Our measures to improve educational inclusionalso include the fact that we have completely removed tuition fees for nurseries and kindergartens for all children around the country regardless of their socioeconomic status. In addition, all school books are free up to the 7th grade and they will become free up to the 12th grade,the end of the high school level starting next year. We have also the so-called focal schools. So those are schools where if you don't have a school in your community, free transportation will be provided to a focal school in close proximity as well as free breakfast and lunch.Last but not least, we have the so-called protected schools where that is possible with a small number of children so that in isolated areas we do have a school in the community as well. With that, I want to say that the educational attainment of Roma specifically has increasedover the last decade. Between 2011 and 2021, the high school graduation rate of Roma has doubled and the number of Roma students that are completely completing a college degree hasmultiplied by 6. In the early childhood and education area, I do want to address what was mentioned in terms of inclusion rate in early childhood education and care. So between 0 and 3 yearsof age, we do have the humble 17.5% of inclusion. That reflects the long maternity leave and the choice of young mothers to take care of their kids in the 1st two years. So when we lookat the two to three-year-olds, the coefficient increases to 42.1% of inclusion. And when we look at the three to six-year-old level, it is at 87.3%. Of course, to increase access but also the qualityof early childhood education and care, we have formed a cross-institutional Working Group under the Council of Ministers at the highest possible level in the government so that we can work together to address these issues. And we have, in fact, an annual plan for 2024 with some rigorousmeasures that will be voted within the next couple of days and will begin implementation. I want to move to address the quality, the overall quality of education and our PISA results. So we have struggled to create a standard for quality since 2018 and a number of governments have openedthat topic and not successfully completed that. We have the ambitious goal of voting on putting together a text which is already being completed but also voting on a standard of quality which would include how we define quality of education, how we measure it, how we monitor it and howwe fund it. So related to that, we will have more to report later this year but we are quite ambitious in our plans because a lot of our inspection and evaluation in the system isrelated to what we think of as quality. And with that, I would like to address what is happening at the PISA level but also at our external evaluations level. So it is clear that the methods that are being deployed at school are probably no longer as relevant to the contemporary needsof just society, the digital world and the labor market. So we are launching a large scale curriculum reform to address some of those issues. In addition, we are addressing in mass scale teacher training with the resource of 178 million lev which is about 80 million euro jointly investedfrom the European Union and Bulgaria to move to the so-called competency approach where we train and demand from students and assess what is called skills and competencies and not just knowledge. One thing that PISA revealed is that Bulgarian students have a lot of knowledgebut are not able to use that in real life situations. So we are gradually changing our national assessments beginning with the 10th grade assessment, national assessment and we will move to the 12th and 7th grade assessments to provide a stimulus for the entire system to move to more practicalbased questions and testing versus knowledge based. We are making also significant investments in the teacher workforce whereas for years the average age of teachers has been about 55,56. We have been able to lower that by half year within the past year alone and we think we are turning the tide based on the significant number of measures. One of those is, of course, increasing teacher salaries. Over a ten-year period of time they doubled to where we arekeeping the starting teacher salary at 125% of the average salary in the country. We think that alone has moved the teaching profession towards more decency and respect but it is not going to be a sufficient measure to improve quality. So we are, of course, working on anumber of things to measures to be able to support and motivate young teachers. One of those is a program for mentoring young teachers in the 1st year on the job because that is when the dropout happens for young teachers at the school level. So we will be able to report resultsfrom internal assessment later but the initial results show that these sorts of measures have been very positive. Last but not least, I want to address the digitization question from yesterday. This is an area where we aim to be on the front line. Not only have we invested 200 millionlevel, 100 million Euro over the past five years to improve digital infrastructure and provide devices and platforms and content. We have decreased the student device ratio from 1 to 18, meaning18 students to a device to 1 to 6 or 1 to 7 which is slightly better than the European average over five years. But we have also created a national platform called the digital backpack where we are encouraging teachers to create interactive content and we are placing all of our digitalcontent in one protected environment. Going forward, we have also just launched a working group on digitization that just met yesterday afternoon while we were speaking to vote on and approve standard for using artificial intelligence in education with all its guidelines and ethicalconsiderations. In addition, we will be working on guidelines on how to how much technology to use, especially in the early years to support cognitive development and not overuse technology. The goal of this working group is to create a vision which will include preventing digitalpoverty and digital exclusion as well. With that, I also want to mention our significant investment in STEM as well with the 250 million euro for our STEM center in each and every school in the countrywith 100% coverage where we will be training 40,000 teachers as well to use STEM interactive teaching methods at the school level. Before I turn over to my colleague Boiano to talk to you about special education very, very briefly, I want to assure you we are well aware of all the deficienciesthat are taking place and how quickly times are changing and how quickly education needs to react. So with large scale reforms and some bold moves, we are hoping to be able to turn the tide on some of our negative educational attainment results and to be able to show somevery rigorous assessment data in the coming years. With that, I will let Boiano speak verybriefly about special educational policies. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Miteva. The preschool and school education act regulates early assessment of needs of children at kindergartens in view of preventionof risk of learning difficulties as part of the overall support for early childhood development.The ordinance in question provides for a screening test for children from three to three and a half years. The Ministry of Education holds Intellectual Property of Rights on that screening test thatassess children's learning capacity. Currently, we have a manual on carrying out the screening testof early assessment of learning difficulties for children from three to three and a half years old and we have guidelines for the development of three-year-olds. Trainings are coming up inFebruary. We will have a training of 62 trainers for the test to be used in school and preschool level. We will have two from each, two trainees from each district who will then teach teachers across thecountry so that they can use the screening assessment in their daily work. Preschool started three years in our country. That's why we administer the test back then. Once the relevant legislation is amendedby covering crashes, nursing schools in our system, we will consider such an early screening test for children aged a year and a half. The Ministry of Education and Science works towards introducingfunctional assessment of needs of students and we have a project funded under the operational program science and education for smart development in its section concerning inclusive education. 260trainers were trained in 2023. Importantly, most importantly here it is an interinstitutional approach covering the Ministry of Education, the regional inclusive support centers, the Ministryof Health, regional health inspections, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and the social assistance directorate. As a result in December we signed an agreement, a memorandum between the three ministries introducing for the 1st time an interinstitutional mechanism to support personal development at thelocal level. We have to note here that the regional centers to support early development, we transformedspecial needs school into centers for inclusion support. The regional centers for inclusion support have functions very different from the former resource centers. They ensure coordination,consultations, education and they also have functions in terms of inclusive education. They allow for supervision to be carried out by the regional centers for support for inclusive education. In conclusion,I would like to mention that in 2023 in kindergartens and schools a total of 24,366 children with learning and special needs were assisted. Due to time constraints I will also mention that we alsowill also support the application of Bulgarian sign language and the legislation adopted in 2021. So we will use sign language in schools. It is a brand new approach. The purpose being to introduce it widerand mainstream it in education and social services. Reflecting on the questions raised by Mr. Mesmor and Mr. Goodbranson related to the health domain and the policies, my colleague, the deputy minister fromhealth is going to reflect on that. The floor is yours. Thank you, Madam. Dear colleagues, it is mypleasure and I am very honored to go into details to all these very important questions, mainly stated by Mr. Mesmor. I will start with the question on early detection and early interventions and the healthinequalities in Bulgaria. I would like to start with very good news from the last moment. Accordingto the survey of the European Commission, there is a decrease of out of pocket expenditures in Bulgaria but by about 10%. Out of pocket expenditures are one of the major obstacles for poor families and vulnerablefamilies to have full access to healthcare. So such a decrease of copayment is a significant step toquality healthcare. In September last year, the Ministry of Health established as I already mentioned yesterday the maternal and child health department at the Ministry of Health. This step which was made bythe highest political level in the country clearly demonstrates the political will for long term improvement of maternal and child health in Bulgaria. Also in September last year, we developed the nationalstrategy for child and adolescent health and pediatric care 2030 and the linked action plan. The strategy isthe 1st separate national strategic document that focuses on child healthcare as an integral part of general public healthcare. The goal of the strategy is sustainable improvement of children's health for which one ofthe major priorities with corresponding areas of impact have been defined. In this connection, we are developing human resources for children's healthcare in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. We aredeveloping competent integrated workforce which would take over the responsibility forthe children's healthcare but also through quality training and qualification, all other remaining duties. Outside the scope of health insurance, the Ministry of Health funds from the state budget different screening programs for newborns for early detection and timely treatment of diseases. This year, we are introducinga screening for early childhood development with the instrument ASQ3. The idea of this screening is that all children in the country are subject to testing and that it is carried out twice during the 9th month and during the 18th month after the birth. The screening should be carried out by pediatrician or general practitionerIt is very easy for handling and would be also used by the patronage nurses. Depending on the results, children who fall below a certain threshold are referred to a social service for early childhood intervention or to intervention by the health system. The funds for the license ofthe test were issued in 2024 and will be testing phase in 2024 in order to be fully integrated in 2025. Ministry of Health is also introducing three new screening programs for 50 million level provided by the Ministry of Finance for spinal muscular atrophy, severe immune deficits and cystic fibrosis.The scope is to test all newborn children, about 68,000, including control samples. With regards to the prevention of inequalities, by order of the Ministry of Health, 23 mobile offices are providing support by the regional health inspectorates in different regions of the country in order tofor vulnerable groups and also Roma population to have access to healthcare. As I already mentioned yesterday, there is also the ordinance 26 of the Ministry of Health which is providing obstetric assistance to uninsured women and is carrying out examinations outside the scope of compulsory health insurance for children and pregnant women. As you probably know, we havevery sustainable network of health mediators which is growing every year. We have about 350 health mediators and under the project, the predefined project health for all, within the program local development, the policy reduction and enhanced inclusion of vulnerable groups, there are several interventions all over the territory of the country with abudget of about 1,100,000 Euro. I want to mention one of my top level priorities and this is the HPV vaccination. HPV vaccination is free of charge for all girls aged 12, 14 with the new 9 violent vaccine. There are several campaigns by theregional health inspectorates, the national health insurance fund, et cetera. We want to prevent this 900 deaths annually by a disease which is vaccine preventable. The vaccine coverage is very low for the moment, but for less than one year, we increase it with almost 4%. There was a question also on breastfeeding which I want to address. The preparationand training of mothers for breastfeeding newborns is included in the main medical activities in neonatology. In the standard preventive medical activities, one of the main activities is the promotion of natural nutrition for newborns and infants. Initiatives for marking breastfeeding week which promotes events and disseminates materials to promote and support breastfeeding fact, also informationcampaigns by the national center for public health and analysis and NGOs are also being implemented. I want next to address the issue of the national children hospital. I am very happy to share with you that there is already one national children hospital developed in the town of Burgas withthe Spanish technical assistance. It is starting functioning this year. Regarding the national children hospital in Sofia, I would like to share that the analysis of the European investment bank is already finalized and shared with the decision makers. There is the technical proposal under development. The publiccouncil consisting of all relevant entities including NGOs is being was established and had already two meetings. The hospital was also decided. It is in a place which is very closeto one of the main roads in Bulgaria, also with opportunity for helipad and until the 24th of March, the tender would be finalized and the overall duration of building of the hospital would be 28 months. Next, there was avery interesting question by Mr. Mesmo about the consequences of COVID-19 for the mental health and what the state is doing. This is failing very much in my competency. So I would just share with you that I am very happy to report that the national health insurance fund, I am the chair of the supervisory boardof this entity and we increased the access to psychiatric treatment from one visit per month to two visits which is not sufficient but it is a step in the right direction. We are under development of two new clinical pathways for psychiatry. This is being done for the 1st time. We never had clinical pathways for mental health inBulgaria but now there would be two pathways for affective disorders including depression and the other pathway would be for schizophrenia and psychosis. Something which is being done by our colleagues under the ministry of health at the national center for public health and analysis is to develop recommendations for the employees andthe employers how to deal with long COVID including mental health consequences because we know that people with long COVID do 30% of the people who had long COVID are having also mental health problems. And to deal also with the so-called presentism to be at work but not effectively. So this isbeing done by occupational therapists and psychologists in different parts of the country. Last but not least, I would like to address also the issue from yesterday about intersexual children. I had consultation this morning again with one of my teachers in sexology in Bulgaria and I would like to state that this process is verysmooth. There are absolutely no problems with the approach. Children who are being born with intersexuality, after Genetic Tests until reaching their 3rd age are already under consultation and operation before developing the sexual identity. So thisthis process is rather effective and smooth. You are not asking about transsexual children. I can provide answer maybe in future hearings about this, but this is what I wanted to state. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I suggest that we move onto the questions that were raised by Mrs. Harris and Mr. Mesmore on the special protection children at the border and the information that was shared about different practices there. So I would like to give the floor to the state agency for child protection and the colleaguefrom the Ministry of Interior. The floor is yours. Colleagues, some allegations were made yesterdayon human treatment of migrant children by the border police. Different forms of violence were mentioned and I would like to offer some explanations on that matter. As the Member States, Bulgariacarries out border controls in line with regulation 2016/399 of the European Parliament on the Europeancode on movement of persons across borders. To ensure the best possible conditions, the border police has signed a tripartite memorandum with the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and the UNHCRto monitor the border area. That memorandum ensures access to individuals detained including thepolice detention facility as we have a police detention of up to 24 hours as an administrativemeasure. We consider the children as children at risk. That is why in 2017 we amended the ordinanceon offering police protection to children by expressing mentioning unaccompanied children seekinggranted international protection. Post 2017 we have very few cases of children detained. Most of them are offered police protection as an urgent measure ensuring the best interests of the child. TheBulgarian Red Cross also has access to police detention facilities. In 2019, together with theUNHCR, we drew up brochures and audio files for unaccompanied children seeking or having been grantedinternational protection. Those are in French, English, Turkish, Pashto, Urdu and Arabic. Inthose languages, we also have audio files. To ensure the best interests of migrant children,the board of police service carries out regular training on the following topics: Access to the territory and international protection proceedings, vulnerable groups, cultural and regional specificsin working with 3rd country children. Those trainings are carried out by the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, the Bulgarian Red Cross, the UNHCR and UNICEF. The board of police operates under thefundamental rights manual developed by Frontex. Last but not least, I would like to mention thatmigrants crossing our border are often briefed by smugglers that they are subject to registration inthe EuroDAX system should they be caught. That brings about the application of the Dublin regulation in2014, 2016 and 2023. Bulgaria has seen a massive migrant pressure. In 2023, we had 23,000 asylumapplications registered. The Ministry of the Interior doesn't rule out the likelihood of havingcases of violence against migrant children. We would very much like to invite you to share with us the sourcesof your information so that we can further look into those cases. Thank you. In addition to my colleagues,sorry for a moment, my name is Maria Natasha, State Agency for Refugees at the Council of Ministers, Chairperson. Just would like to compliment that actually all those feedbacks who you have mentionedin the request, they are carefully checked and border police authorities and Ministry of Interior, of course, they have procedures to investigate the signals. Also the organizations mentioned includingUNHCR, Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, they are providing monitoring reports on the situation and wheresuch information has been approved. There are measures to avoid and also the border police authorities,they have organized a system together with Frontex of control almost every week, sudden control of theborder line in order to check how the police officers are behaving and also they are doing such sudden checks at the places for 24 hours police custody. So this is in addition if there are more questions onthat topic, we will give them to our colleagues of border police and in due time we will refer to you.Thank you. Thank you very much. I suggest that we move on. Okay. So I suggest we move on to reflecton the two optional protocols as well as the way our juridical system is providing support to children, also children whose parents are incarcerated. So I will give the floor to the Deputy Minister of Justice, please.Thank you very much, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. I wish to respond to what's been said by the representativeof the Kingdom of Morocco relating to the question about the adoption of the initial or 1st optionalprotocol, the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, or to the UN Conventionon the Rights of the Child. This 1st optional protocol we can inform you has been entirelytransposed into our domestic law. We have done this by amending our penal code in its Chapter 2, Section 8.As part of this revised Section 8, we have included new legal provisions.Under the age of 18. And we have also criminalized pornography to a much more stringent degree.This is, of course, pornography involving children. And we have included provisions for new technologiesand their use including Internet, social networks, social media. And I'm happy to report that just yesterdayin the Legal Affairs Commission in our Parliament, that changes to the penal code have been adoptedin order to transpose the European Union Directive. This is Directive 2011/93 relating to sexual violence and sexual exploitation of children.I expect that in the near future, it will be promulgated as an act of law.Fate of the children and their parents, parents who are incarcerated, I would like to get acquainted, thepublic, with what Bulgarian state has done until now. Actually, in connection with the execution of prisonsentences, the target group is defined as convicted parents of children up to the age of 18. The activitiesto be implemented are a group work program on positive fatherhood through which knowledge related to thebringing and care of children is acquired. Another activity is the profession mother program which aims to improve theparenting skills of women prisoners. The law and the Internet foundation under the international project has conductedtraining in some prisons on the topic of developing the parenting skills of prisoners. Various NGOs provide annual opportunitiesfor underprivileged prisoners to provide their children with gifts on various holidays. By awarding under section 98 of theprison act extended visitation, visitation with relatives outside the prison and home leave, an opportunity is provided for directcontact with the children. Contacts are made with the child protection department of the social assistance, social care, socialhomes for the placement of children in difficult situations, directorates as well as foster care placement, placements. Assistance shallbe provided for the return of the child to the family placed in the social home as well as for conducting a visit. Assistance is alsoprovided for the other parent to obtain child wear benefits. Visits between prisoners and their children are held by video conference. In cases ofsocial hardship and in presence of important circumstances including those concerning the family and/or children of the prisoner, telephonecalls shall be allowed at the expense of the prison from a prison telephone. In the prison environment, the prisoners themselves make toys,souvenirs, cards and much more for their children which they hand over during visitations. Mothers with children in prison are provided with necessarymedical care and counseling including from outside organizations. And last concerning measures for children of parents in detention or imprisonment, last I wouldlike to mention the implementation of the committee of ministers recommendation 2018/5 to the Member States on children with incarceratedparents and the project enhancing staff capacity, building a pilot prison linked to a learning center and improving the rehabilitation of prisoners. Predefinedproject 2 under the Norwegian financial mechanism, specialized training program has been developed for the prison staff to work with children with incarceratedparents. 40 supervisory and security staff from all prisons in Bulgaria have been trained to work with this program. Thank you very much. Thank you. If you allowme, I would like to move on to reflecting on the questions that were raised in relation to children with disabilities, the social protection and thebenefit system and the care system in Bulgaria with reference to the institutionalization process. I will start with children with disabilities. And here I would like to point out four major initiatives which we believe are contributing to better ensure the rights of this group of children. First obviously is the law on preschool and school education. I won't talk a lot about it because theDeputy Minister touched on that. Basically what we believe is that with the provisions of the law we create an entirely new framework for inclusive education which is focusing on supporting for the personal development of the children, the organization and coordination of activities to provide supportive environment with, of course, adapted facilities, activities which are carried out on the implementation of theBulgarian sign language, activities aiming at supporting special schools for pupils with sensory disabilities and, of course, the key role of the centers for special educational support to provide the additional support which is needed for children. And the activities related to the form and modernization of the environment in the preschool age, the crashes, the kindergartens and the school and the special training of the variousworkforce representatives. We believe that inclusive education is a complex process and as my colleague highlighted we don't want to push it before the whole environment in the kindergarten, in the crash and in the school is ready to be inclusive. The 2nd measure is obviously the social protection benefits which we are updating. There is significant increase in the provision of benefits forchildren with disabilities as I highlighted yesterday. There is big increase in the monthly child care allowance which was not raised since 2013 and in the current budget it was raised significantly. Also we provide one of eight for the birth of a child granted under the terms and conditions of Article 6 of the Child Support Act. The amounts of all the monthly allowances aredifferentiated according to the degree of disability or the degree of the reduced working capacity and in accordance with the statutory purpose and the circumstances under which the child is for upbringing. Also the Personal Assistance Act in December 2018, a new Personal Assistance Act was adopted which regulates the terms and conditions for the provision and use of personal assistancefor people and children with disabilities. We are currently analyzing the way we can target better the Personal Assistance Services. It is heavily subsidized and we believe that it is also an added value for the comprehensive policy for children with disabilities. Of course, the new Social Services Act which includes a definition of early intervention for children and disabilities, something we didn't have before that in the legislation. So this is aleading to significant increase in the number of social services which are targeted also children with disabilities. If I mentioned if I forgot to mention yesterday at the end of September 2023 we have a big number of social services, 675 and I already shared yesterday that in the current year budget we have even ensured higher increase in the servicesfor children, especially targeting children with disabilities. Also yesterday you raised the concern about the provision in Article 90 of the Social Assistance Act which makes an exception to the ban on residential care for children 0 to 3 if the children have disabilities. Of course, the key argument here was that as a temporary provision we should allow we should be able to allow for the old institutions to beclosed and give the system time to adjust to the need for providing family based care for especially children with disabilities. It is important to say that not all disabilities are included in this provision. Only children with the most severe conditions which need constant or very intensive medical care for which we do not have ready family alternatives. And as I already said our priority in the whole care system isnot to have multiple placements for children before we ensure that every placement is well planned and it will provide better care than the previous placement arrangement for the child. In terms of the EU guarantee, it is important to note that children with disabilities are a key target group in the action plan for the implementation of the EU child guarantee and eradicating poverty. The plan is divided intosix areas of impact in accordance with the directions of the child guarantee, education and early childhood care, inclusive education and school activities, health care, healthy nutrition, appropriate housing and, of course, other tools to overcome exclusion. In the programming period 2021/2027 a minimum of 5% of the ESF plus funds for Bulgaria will be invested in measures to support children and implement the child guaranteeprogram distributed between the education program and the program for human resources development. And last but not least as my colleague, the Deputy Minister of Health highlighted early childhood intervention will not only be implemented because we have it in the action plan for the EU child guarantee but it is also fundamental for us to reform the care system and to ensure that children with disabilities and developmental difficulties are supported as early as possible but we are havingthe necessary resources to scale up all the good practices demonstrated by UNICEF and by local service providing organizations. Our ministry is currently developing a national program called social services for early childhood intervention and we believe that with the next reporting we will be ready to share the impact related to the target to build more holistic network of services in every region of the country so that all the children with developmental difficulties haveaccess. Also, of course, we will invest in intensive training introductory and upgrading, scaling and up scaling of the staff, support for the inclusion of children with disabilities in early childhood education and care starting from the crashes, development of national quality standards and, of course, quality standards on the capacity of the workforce. And last but not least communication activities to promote social inclusion of children becauseyou rightly pointed out when there is stigma, when there is discrimination among the society our role is to raise awareness and to alleviate attitudinal blockages because these children have equal rights and should have equal strong start in their life. If you allow me, I would like to elaborate more on our philosophy to manage the new construction of the care system because asaying that we will close the last specialized institutions for babies, the so-called medical social care. We are not thinking that our job is done. Yes, no institutions. So the care system is good enough. Obviously, our focus is 1st to close these institutions and we hope in the planning that this December the whole society will be able to celebrate the end of this long term existingexisting system. How we do the closure, obviously our priority is to prevent. We don't want to close the entry without ensuring family support services and without allowing childrento have alternatives. Apart from that, the exit scenarios, obviously 1st priority is reintegration back to the birth family which is not possible unless we provide the family with the whole spectrum of supportive services and consultation, of course. The 2nd optionis kinship care for these children, very well developed service in the country and, of course, the last resort should be small group homes. Obviously some of these small group homes will be with medical treatment not treatment but medical services because some of the childrenhave severe disabilities and without access to medical support it will be impossible to keep the quality of life. Also we would like to obviously now start the process of improvingthe quality of care in the small group homes because you rightly pointed that when we started the closure of the homes for children with disabilities, it was we relied more on the small group homesthan the family alternative because at the time we didn't have the family alternative infrastructure. As I said, we believed that if we placed children without having the ready family environment,this will not be responsible activity. So now what I would like to say is that in terms of the statistics for the number, 5585 children are in family alternatives and only 2765 arein residential community based services. So obviously the proportion of family alternatives is higher than the proportion of residential care but our plan is to revise even the 2765of the children and our plan in the next years is to reduce the number in those residential care alternatives. I would like to say the fact that after all, these are small group homes which are community based. So children attend mainstream kindergartens, crashes. They attendother services which are in the community and in the quality standards of those alternatives we obviously expect high contact and intensive contact with families so that the exit willbe guaranteed and quick. We realize the negative impact of group care for children. We are quite aware of this. So our plan is to improve the residential care for children and reduce it as much as we can when the family alternatives are ready. In terms of the prevention and capacitybuilding of the child protection system, I'm very happy to say that there are a range of projects with EU funding which are going to allow us to invest in early childhood development. We have a whole new project called future for children which is going to target 40,000 childrenin vulnerable situations so that we can strengthen our family support portfolio of services. Preventionis cheaper and better. We know this very well. So now with the funds from the European Union we are able to even increase the prevention services and demonstrate that the state is a partnerof the families. And our priority is to keep families cohesive and their integrity is our priority. Of course if this is not possible we will provide quality alternatives. I alreadymentioned yesterday that we are in a process of modernizing and strengthening the child protection system. We are about to launch the new strategy for human resources in the social system as I mentioned salaries will be increased and capacity and result of the workers. We are amending thechild protection act only after we analyze the pitfalls and the ways of improvement. And Ihave to say that we are lagging behind the capacity building of the system but with our new policy priorities I'm sure that we are going to compensate to demonstrate successful family support servicesand competent workforce. In terms of prevention I'm happy to say that we have reported morethan 2,000 successful prevention cases from the child protection departments. Our hope is to increase this. In terms of foster care you rightly pointed continuing funding foster carewith EU funding is not showing political will for this service to be fundamental component of the care system. That's why our plan is to make it totally sustainable funded by the state budget service which will be again delegated to local authorities and professional NGOs. That'swhy we are currently developing legal amendments and a unified financial standard so that foster care can be managed professionally. We have funding for that and the EU funding is goingto cover a capacity of foster care system of 3,300 children which is giving us room for growth.I'm happy to say that we don't only think in our care system for the entry and the care quality but also the exit care. So we have funding for professional integration of the children whoare exiting the care system so that we can assist them with labor, with professional orientation, with socialization and with mentoring because we know very well that we have to pay specialattention for this transition period for the children exiting the care system. Last but not least, I would like to reflect on our social protection system and the way we would liketo make it more impactful on the question of how the social assistance is helping to address social inequalities. I have to say that there has been a fairly significant drop in the child poverty and social exclusion rate over the past decade although we fully recognize andadmit that the levels do remain much higher than we would like them to seem. So regarding the effectiveness of the benefits because this is very important, you can imagine that when we debate with our colleagues in the finance of ministry for more investments in the socialsphere, we would like to obviously give the arguments what this investment is generatingespecially when we talk about benefits. So regarding to that, the latest info from the UNICEF report card is that social assistance in Bulgaria does have an impact on child poverty. Basically, thedata shows that as a result of the social transfers, we can report decrease of poverty with 42.4%.But when we talk about the benefit system in Bulgaria, I would like to say that there is high political will to ensure adequacy and targeting of all the 12 types of benefits that we are providing. Only three of these 12 types are based on income. So we would like to improvethe adequacy targeting. Also we would like to ensure each of these benefits is timely provided and not after the risk has already exacerbated. And also our plan is to ensure when there isvulnerable child and family, we invest together benefit and social services because our ultimate impact goals is to ensure empowerment of the children and the families to exit vulnerabilityand not to keep and create a system where children and families become dependent on benefit system. So there was a question related to the revisions in the family allowance, the family allowancesfor children. The question concerned Article 7, Paragraph 11. Yes, these provisions were adopted, I have to admit, with the aim to combat early pregnancies and birth as well as school dropouts.Unfortunately, time has shown us that these are not working as prevention measures as we planned and expected them to perform and actually we find cases that there are there is negativeimpact on the most vulnerable, usually Roma children and this is allowing the perpetuation of the cycle of intergenerational poverty. So this is one of the reasons in our governanceprogram of the current government, we started a revision of the family allowances act. There will be an assessment of the social impact of all family benefits as I already highlightedand we are going to have a special attention on having clear data about the negative impact of such exclusions or measures in the family allowance act so that obviously our plan isto make sure that we amend the legislation and in this respect to make sure that, as I said, the impact of the benefits is actually to have quality of life of the children. I would liketo stop here with the reflection on these three groups of questions. Also there was a question on the surrogacy and corporal punishment. I would like to give the floor for quick reflectionfrom the state agency for child protection and the Ministry of Justice, please. So we havestatutory we don't have express statutory regulation on surrogacy. Following a systemic interpretationof our national law, there is a firm conclusion that there is a strict ban on surrogacy. Dearcolleagues, we believe that there is still a prohibition of corporal punishment of childrenin Bulgaria legislation as the protection against domestic violence act provides for a general prohibition of all forms of violence including corporal punishment of children. Accordingto Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the mentioned above law, domestic violence is any act of physical, mental or sexual violence and any attempted such violence as well as the forcible restrictionof individual freedom and of privacy carried out against individuals who have or have hadfamily or kingship ties or cohabit or dwell in the same home or in de facto conjugal or intimate relationship. The provision of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the law provides that anydomestic violence committed in the presence of a child shall also be considered as mental and emotional abuse of the child. With the amendments of the protection from domestic violence actpromulgated last year in the summer, it was adopted that the acts under Paragraph 1 or 2 may be committed by action or inaction. The purpose of those proposed amendments is toassist victims by adding additional protection mechanism by introducing an obligation for the relatives of an abused person to notify the competent authorities about the act of violence.This proposal will reduce cases of domestic violence against minors perpetrated by one parent against the other without the latter against the other, without the latter takingaction as well as cases of domestic violence against vulnerable people who are in a helpless state as a result of serious disability, illness or old age or who have placed who have been placedunder guardianship. It should also be noted that by the act of amendment and supplementto the criminal code promulgated in 2019 also criminalized all forms of domestic violence. Inthe event of noncompliance with an order for protection from domestic violence, the perpetrator of the violence is punishable by the imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to 5,000level which is around 2500 Euros. This is prescribed in Article 296, Paragraph 1 of the criminalcode. According to Paragraph 4, if the act is committed repeatedly, the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for one to five years. In view of the foregoing, we consider that Bulgarianlegislation currently prohibits corporal punishment of children and provides sufficient safeguards for the protection of children. I would like also to mention that by virtue of our criminalcode, if a bodily harm was committed by anyone against a minor, if the victim is a minor,this is always more severely punished crime. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I would like to give the floor to my colleague from the Ministry of Exterior to elaborate on allthe questions related to discrimination and the way we tackle it. The floor is yours. Thank you, Madam Minister. I would like to refer to the questions raised by Mr. Mesmor and alsoMs. Idrissi regarding the Commission for Protection Against Discrimination in Bulgaria. The Commission does work closely with all institutions mandated in the field of human rights. For example, it co-chairs together with the Ombudsman the Council which monitors the implementation of the rightsof persons with disabilities including children. It also issues on a regular basis recommendations regarding hate speech in electoral campaigns. It is true that the access of children to theCommission is through a parent or a legal representative, but the Commission has acted on its own initiativeon a number of cases of violation of the rights of the child and furthermore, the Commission has been gathering data on what complaints, what of the complaints, what number of the complaintsthey receive regarding particular the rights of children. For example, in 2020, there were 15 complaints submitted by school children through their parents regarding scholarshipsand in 2022, 35 complaints were received regarding the premises of kindergartens and schools andalso 25 complaints which covered various issues of the rights of the child and discrimination. Using more than 40 signals through the years, the Commission initiated an open-ended programmefor inspection and analysis of all premises of kindergartens and schools with follow-up prescriptions to improve the architectural design. Regarding statistics on complaints, I would like to addthat the Ombudsman has maintained for several years now on its website a special form to be filled in and sent directly by children online and through the years, the numbers of complaintsreceived directly by children has been increasing. In 2020, the number of complaints were 40, 150and in 2023, this is a preliminary number, 587. What I can also say is that both Ombudsman and the Commission have established valuable partnerships with NGOs, schools, municipal authorities,universities, of course, members of the business community and they all contribute significantlyto the efficiency of awareness raising campaigns, training and prevention. The Commission has covered in training programmes regarding rights of the child more than 3,000 representatives of theeducational system and the Ombudsman on its own part organizes the institution of the Ombudsman organizes interactive sessions for education of children as well, including workshops andthe Commission on its own part has been inviting on a regular basis students, especially law students to participate in workshops representing the procedures before the Commission in order tohave such a practice. Thank you for the attention. We're going to just back for now because we've got a few members who would like to ask questions and I think it's better for you to get the questionsbefore the break so that you can also have a bit of time to prepare. So the 1st personwho has asked for the floor is Hind Ayubi Idrisi. Thank you, Madam Chairperson and I'm also gratefulto the Delegation of the Republic of Bulgaria for all of the answers we've heard so far. They have been very detailed. I would like to circle back to a number of issues, however, in particular with regardsto the optional protocol. I took duly note of those measures taken to embody in domestic law the provisions of the optional protocol including what was adopted recently for the embodiment of theEuropean directive related to this optional protocol. Now, the legal framework is very important, of course, but it is not enough. Why do I say this? Concretely, I need to ask you, concretely, what have you doneto prevent, to prevent these offenses covered by the protocol? We know that among the main causes for these phenomena, even if it should not justify what happens, but sadly we find that poverty, 1st ofall, is responsible for what happens. Often the children come from very vulnerable families, what we call marginalized categories. In that area, you have taken a strong step forward by deinstitutionalizingthe victims and children which reduces the risk of children being exposed to those offenses. But concretely, what are you doing, 1st of all, in the area of prevention, 1st of all, and what are you doing in the area of treatment, care and reintegration? Why do I ask you all of this? Because in certainsocieties it is extremely difficult to allow, enable a child, empower a child to report and say to him or her that he or she is allowed to, very often there is an omerta, the law of silence prevails and childrendo not want to or are afraid to speak. So you need to empower, embolden your children to be able to report, to be able to talk to someone whom they trust and report cases of violence. That's my main concern. So once again, to rephrase the question, how have you translated these legal provisions intoconcrete measures to prevent and to combat and to provide treatment for children who are victims of these various forms of sexual violence? Thank you very much. Faith Marshall Harris, who is joining uson line, has also asked for the floor. Thank you, Chair. And thank you for all of the, you know, substantive answers that you have given so far. However, I have got one or two areas that I have not heardaddressed and I want to quickly ask you about them. I'm going to start with child justice. I am very pleased to learn, of course, that you do plan a major overhaul in the form of that system. But I would just like to get some assurances from the public that it will include the use of diversion. I didn't hearany mention of that. Faith, just hold on a minute. Your voice is a little quiet. This might be resolved through increasing the volume on the headsets. So if people can just do that, then let's go ahead. Pleasecontinue. So you were saying that you wanted some assurances about the overhaul of the juvenile justice system or the child justice system and you were beginning to list the things you would liketo have assurances on. Yes, thank you. The 1st thing that I wanted to see mentioned is that diversion,the fact that there would be greater use of diversion away from the court proceedings. Secondly, I didn't hear address the concern I had about the place of children who are somehow charged, they shouldn't becharged, but they are under the age of criminal responsibility, under age 14. And they are being charged under antisocial behavior law where they are in fact being accused of offenses which they shouldn'tbe. And I would like to be assured that this will now stop under the new law and that they will be treated as children at risk, which is the international standard, and not as children offending. And also the abolition ofstate of offenses that was urged that would be included. The question of legal aid, I'm not quite sure if I understood that this is going to be mandatory and applicable to all children, because apparently at themoment it seems to be discretionary. And also whether it would start immediately from interrogation and not simply when a court process has started. There have been some reports that parents feel that they are notinformed when children are arrested and they have also complained about the treatment of those children while in custody. And I would like to please examine that situation. I would also now move on to one of the points with education that I didn't hear. I wanted to ask if it is going to be, or if it is still, but when we have counselors in school, because of the high level of violenceand bullying and harassment, whether in fact there can be a provision for counselors to assist with interventions there. The parents have, there have been reports from parents of the fact that this is not being managed or controlled by teachers at their new trainings to help with this aspect of what is happening in the school. You mentioned that segregationis not necessary and indeed it is against the law. Please, can you put your microphone near to your mouth because the microphone is far from your mouth so the interpreters cannot hear you. Yes, I will do that. Thank you very much. Yes. I hope that you are hearing me better now. The question that I raised just now is about segregation. I recommend that theparents recognize, of course, that it is against the law, but the reports of segregated classes, and this is obviously at the local level, and I'm urging the State Party to look into that to see if that can be regulated. On the immigration, I didn't hear any mention of what has been reported attached children. I know I did hear thatthere is now a new arrangement where there is a deemed relationship between children and persons that they are traveling with, but I would ask that this be examined more carefully because there have been reports that some children are deemed to be attached and, in fact, some of them are absolute strangers. They don't know those persons and this needs some examination. I understand that there will be anew method of age assessment. I'm asking whether this will be multidisciplinary, whether modern methods will be used, whether it is child friendly, child sensitive methods, and whether, in fact, they will be the benefit of the adult afforded where there is lack of clarity. Those are my main questions to you. I hope that you got most of them. If possible, I will clarify if this is not so.Thank you so much, Chair. Thank you, Faith. I have also recorded some of the questions because I was able to hear you, so I can clarify as well. The next speaker is Mr. Gudbrandson.Thank you, Chair. Good morning to you all. I want to express my appreciation on your excellent answers that I have received for most of my questions that I posed yesterday. There are, though, a couple of issues that I want to raise which are pretty close to my heart. With regard to violence and responseto violence and the blue rules, I'm trying to clarify this in my mind. You see, when you are dealing with child abuse, let's just take sexual abuse as an example, but this applies to other types of abuse or violence. Normally we don't have any witnesses and we don't have any evidence except the child's narrative. Now, child abuse is not only alegal issue. It's not only a criminal matter. It is also a child protection matter because you need to take measures to ensure the safety of the child and ensure that the child receives the necessary recovery. But it is also a health issue because you need to do the forensic medical evaluation and you need to provide the mental support, the service.So you have three systems that need to deal with this. And you have Article 12 in the convention on child rights which entitles the child to express its view and it has a right to be heard by all of these agencies or structures. Now the blue rooms are good forgood for the justice system. They are located in the court buildings more generally, the 70 rooms, most of them. But it obviously means that the children then, the child victimsneed to be interviewed on multiple occasions in other structures. So this results in multiple interviews which are retraumatizing for the child, makes the situation of the child worse. Andsecondly, also interferes with the criminal aspect of the case because we know and research has shown us that the child's narrative changes as the child's interviews in multiple occasions. So havethere not been any discussion on sort of collaborating? You have this wonderful Child Protection Act that states the importance of the multisectoral approach and multidisciplinary teams. Can't yousort of incorporate this at the earliest dates of the intervention? I will leave this as my final question. Yeah, I'm sorry, just one more. I didn't have response to my question on cross-examination. Itis my belief that children may be required to give their testimony during court hearings in courts and even me, the perpetrator, not necessarily so. Now, can't you do this cross-examination on thepretrial state and record them? So the child does not need to be in a state of distress for maybe one or two years until the main procedure of the case is carried out in the courtroom. Thank you very much.Thank you very much and greetings to the Delegation. It is my pleasure to conduct this dialogue with yourDelegation. I follow it with a lot of interest because obviously your country is ongoing a lot of reforms implementingchildren's rights and that's very nice to hear. I have a few follow-up questions that weren't completely addressed untilnow. Some of them are related to detention of children. Detention of children in the frame of migration, I heard that there is very few children who are detained in the frame of migration but I understood that we are talking about anaccompanied minor. What about children migrating with the family? I'm not sure these are covered by that and is there a real willingness to avoid completely and to ban detention of children for reason of migration? You may knowthat this is the policy and recommendation of our Committee. In another field, child justice or yeah, the child justicesystem, we heard in your introductory remarks and in the answer of several questions that the reform of all the child justice andgeneral justice system is still ongoing for many years. We understood that this you recognize that this should have been gone furtherand quicker. My question regarding that is do you have a calendar when this reform will be implemented? Do you have a few orientationof this reform? What are the main goals of the reform that is under hopefully under preparation? But I think that there are somereforms that could be done before the global reform of the system because we have and my colleague has already addressed them too. We can seethat there are huge problem and systemic problem, the antisocial behavior policy and so on. Are you willing to implement some urgent reform inthis sector? Also linked to deprivation of liberty because children are deprived of liberty, there is a high rate of deprivation of liberty in that context and I don'tthink that one should wait until the world reform enters into force to address this problem. And yeah, finally on that topic, Bulgaria has ratified theoptional protocol under the Convention Against Torture which provides for the setting up of a national preventive mechanism which is in place. It's part ofthe duties of the General Ombudsman. We have already said that the General Ombudsman doesn't have a lot of means. So I don't know how he or she can conduct allthese monitoring visits and follow-up and control but is there any specific capacity of the Ombudsman to conduct monitoring of the detention of children basedon what and is there specific training and is there a plan to create a specific Ombudsman for children and who could also take over this monitoring for the deprivation of liberty when it comesto children? And my final question is related to Ukrainian children. We acknowledge that Bulgaria has had to face a very important number of persons coming from Ukraine and wecommend what has been done but my question is related to children who were in institution in Ukraine and what was the policy of Bulgaria? We know that the Ukrainian authorities wanted to keep those children coming from big institution to one institution. That was their willingness. They wanted to keep all those children together and this is not in line with your policy that you are explaining very well. So howdid you deal with children coming from Ukraine in Bulgaria when they were in institution in Ukraine? Sorry to be long but thank you very much. Thank you, Chair. Good morning. And I would like to join my colleagues and thank you for all information you have provided to the Committee. It was very helpful. I have two brief questions. The one is relative to gambling because you have explained what stepsare being undertaken to address the issue of mental health of children and adolescents. So are any special rehabilitation services for children involved in gambling or who has this problem of addiction? This is one issue. And the 2nd issue, the Delegation has mentioned earlier that in the system of education you are in the process toelaborate the procedures and rules for using of artificial intelligence. So I would like to ask you to elaborate a little bit more about that. Are you using in the educational system artificial intelligence now and you are going to regulate it somehow so that the use of AI is happening in responsible way or there is something else you would like to do with that? Thank you very much.A very good morning, Madam Chair and my thanks to the Delegation for all of the answers that they have been providing since yesterday. I have some concerns I wish to raise. You spoke a moment ago about a legal arsenal to protect children from corporal punishment. I am interested in the particular situation ofchildren who witness domestic violence. Is there any training or information provided about law? And can you tell us how many parents have actually had this law invoked when taking measures against them? Are there any hotlines available for children so that they can report cases of violence? Now,I didn't hear any mention about HIV/AIDS or sexually transmitted diseases when you spoke about health. Is there any provision for providing information to adolescents in this respect? I don't think I have heard any information about this so far. Thank you. Thank you. And if I may, I would also like to ask two questions. You have told us that you believe that corporal punishment is bannedbecause your domestic violence act bans all forms of violence against everyone. Well, I can tell you that there are constitutions and laws like that in many places in the world, but that does not necessarily mean that corporal punishment is actually banned. So really what we want to know is does the population believe that corporal punishment is banned? Is it clear? It's, you know, that's one interpretation of your law, butI don't think we want children to have to argue with their parents about the interpretation of the domestic violence act. So we would like something more precise on that, please. And then the other thing is you have mentioned about the fact that you have laws relating to online material of a sexual nature. So what I'm interested in is when children consensually share material, e.g. , because we heard from Mr. Goodbrunson thatthat is now the highest amount of the type of images that are being shared online, is the law, does it treat children differently from the way that it would treat adults doing that? So in other words, if an adult shares an image of a child, that is clearly the production of child pornography or the conveying of child pornography. And in some legal systems the same thing happens. In other words, the law is not very differentiated. Is your lawsufficiently differentiated to avoid drawing a lot of children into the criminal justice system who could perhaps be dealt with through other means such as diversion or, you know, social measures? Right. So we will take our break now for 15 minutes and please be back promptly so that you can give us your answers on these round of questions. Thank you. So it is 22 now. So you would need to be back at 5:00 too. We are resumingthe session. If everyone can take their seats. Just one other item that I want to add, but you can perhaps provide the answers in writing afterwards, and that is the response you gave us to intersex children. You said things are going smoothly, but to be honest, that doesn't really mean anything. So I don't expect that you could give us a detailed feedback on that now because I understand that the experts are not present here. Butso you could perhaps just give us an indication afterwards. What is the policy and what is the practice regarding nonessential surgeries on intersex children? Right. So but as I said, you can simply follow up in writing on that. Thank you. So Your Excellency, I'm handing back to you. Thank you very much. I would like to 1st invite the colleague from the Ministry of Education to elaborate more on the practices in schools and therules related to counseling segregation. The floor is yours. Thank you. The preschool and school education act provides for the following. Article 62 Paragraph 4 reads when in the kindergarten children are enrolled and those children are of different ethnic background but at the same age, it should not be allowed for the groups to be segregated on the basis ofethnic background. According to 99/4, in the same class, students of different ethnic background are enrolled. They might not be segregated on the basis of ethnic background. And the Paragraph 6 of the same Article when students at the same age of different ethnic background are enrolled in the same classand to be training the same profession or same profile, they might not be segregated on the basis of ethnic background. In small towns and villages due to demographics, somecommunicators stick together because oftentimes there are places where mostly Roma residents live and hence they enroll their children in a nearby school. This is a choice of parents.They usually choose the closest possible school. In terms of your question on aggression, bullyingand harassment and whether they are expert train, in the inclusive education act in the period 2020/23, 650 experts and 19 psychologists were trained and that's from the national mobilepsychological assistance team. In August 2023, a Working Party was set up with the Council of Ministers to deal with aggression in schools. In terms of proposals to improve policies toprevent violence and harassment and bullying in school to ensure a safe school environment, we have the following measures. Focusing on work with parents, that's to say under thenational program to support children's personal development, we have yet to launch that program. We introduced mediation at the local level with teams comprising an expert in education, psychologistsand others for the purpose of improving the communication between parents and schools, especially where children are victims of conflicts between parents. Next, we have introduced mentors at the regional level. The Ministry of Education and Science together with UNICEF have developedthe program entitled steps together to ensure a safe school environment to prevent violence and harassment and bullying in schools. We have increased the number of psychologists furthermoreby ensuring the funding for it. We held a working meeting with school psychologists to develop the professional network with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science. Then weintroduced supervision for school psychologists and teachers in terms of trainings and upskilling. We provided for two supervision sessions per year and where necessary for additional two.We have meetings with the school self-governance to involve adolescents to deal with this phenomenon and strengthen self-governance. So we encourage setting up regional self-governance studentteams to support education managers by applying the peer training approach. We continue an initiative, a competition for best student initiatives in view of strengthening school self-governanceand incentivize students to work towards civic education. So we had a campaign in the schoolfree of violence. The idea was to collect narratives and stories of actual experiences of students,parents and teachers, the focus being prevention of drug use and risk contact and those narrativeswill be then offered back to students as a tool for prevention of drug use. Then we support educationinstitutions at the regional level to implement inclusive education policies, social emotional intelligence. The latter is also very important for full communication for self-knowledge and decisionmaking. We analyze on an annual basis a number of different types of incidents of aggression. We followthe trends and those are very important in view of informing future prevention policies. In terms of the mic went off. No mic for the speaker. The mic went off. No mic for the speaker. The phone hasstopped working for some reason. Could you it is on. I apologize for that. In terms of risk contact, in termsof use of psychoactive substances within the context of auto aggression, we intend to carry out a monitoring of policies even more so that in many cases of substance use is a prerequisite of aggression. Giventhat adolescents use actively social networks, we also focus on safe use of those. We also address the issueof frequent cyber attacks against education institutions. We envisage different forms of raising awareness in all parties to the education process, those are children, parents and teachers by using the resources of all competentauthorities including those dealing with cybersecurity. Through the national programs of the Ministry of Education, mostly the together for arts and sports program, taking into account the important role of sport to preventaggression and violence. So that's yet another important aspect of our work. We offer guidelines to school principalsdrawing their attention on different types of incidents that place children at risk. The purpose of all those measures alongside with a wide range of other activities the ministry carries out in the field is to get to know anddisseminate the practices by multidisciplinary teams to prevent aggression and violence situations. Thank you for your attention.Thank you very much. I would like to invite the colleagues from the State Agency for Child Protection, Ministry of Interior to elaborate more on the way we respondto the specific needs of children who have been victims of abuse or who have witnessed abuse, the role and location of the blue rooms and also the integratedapproach between health, social services, education and the justice system. The floor is yours. Thank you. As I mentioned yesterday, to implement the nationalprogram on prevention of abuse and violence against children for the period 2023-2026, we had a Working Party that drafted guidelines forinterrogation and examination of children in the special blue rooms. The purpose of the guidelines is to avoid direct contact with the alleged perpetrator of violence, abuse or criminal offense. Thekey purpose of blue rooms is to protect the child witnesses' rights in need of special protection. It's specialized environment to interview children by trained practitioners, those are most frequentlypsychologists or teachers who inform children of what's been going on, of their situation, their rights by doing so in a language in line with the child's cognitive capacityand needs. As to the question on where blue rooms are located, as I mentioned, there's a 17 number, 33 are with social services, 21 in courts or prosecution offices, 6 are part of the Ministry of the Interior's structures and 10 in local authorities' premises. In terms of violence against children, I'd like to make a few more points. There's a violence coordinationmechanism in our country. Since 2020, that mechanism is provided for in the law. On the basis of that mechanism, within a period of 24 hours following a complaint of a child at risk, a multidisciplinary team is set up and they work with the child within those 24 hoursand the teams have representatives of the regional police directorate, a specialist, an inspector in juvenile delinquency, representative of the regional prosecution office and the local authorities but social workers have the lead as they have to make an assessment of the complaint within that short period. Thank you.Ministry of Interior. Colleagues, as Marshall Harris mentioned that there are cases where children are detained without being offered lawyer or informing their parents or carers and I'd like to offer some explanations on the matter. In2020, an amendment was made to the guidelines on detention and equipment of premises for detention. Those are the Ministry of the Interior premises of detention. The guidelines were amended as a result of judgments against Bulgaria, a roadmap to implement judgments against Bulgaria by the European Court.By decision 586 of the Council of Ministers, the new guidelines were adopted. We had consultations with the European Commission to discuss issues concerning the implementation of full transposition in Bulgarian legislation of the Directive 2012/11/2.2012/13 of the year of the 22nd of May. It concerns the right to information in the contextof criminal proceedings. Directive 2013/48 concerning the right to access to a lawyerin criminal matters and Directive 2010/64 of the EU of the 22nd of May 2012 on the rightto translation and interpretation in criminal matters. Initially an ordinance concerning theguidelines was amended. Article 15 paragraph 12 and 13 provide for mandatory notificationof a parent, custodian or other carer of persons under 18 and mandatory participation of a defencecounsel when the person detained is under 18 and it's an imperative obligation irrespective of the child's opinion on the matter. Later on the Ministry of the Interior Act was alsoamended. Article 72 reads that police authorities can detain persons para 1 for which there is the indication that they might have committed a criminal offense. Paragraph 5 of the samearticle reads that if the detainee regardless of the grounds of detention is under 18, theyare appointed a defence counsel as from the moment of their detention. So this is Article72 paragraph 1 item 5. A new provision was added to Article 74A paragraph 1 that reads as follows:When an individual under Article 72 para 1 is under 18, a copy of the order under Article74 para 1. So to sum up, children's rights are ensured and the grounds for a child's detentionunder the Ministry of the Interior, so the rights are guaranteed and the likelihood of detaining them is reduced to a minimum. In terms of Ms. Marshall Harris's question on a child's attachmentto adult migrants, I would like to turn it over to the State Agency for the Refugee President, Ms. Tost. Very briefly, 1st of all, about the children who are accompanied by their parentsby the law for foreigners, there is this regulation indeed that they could remain in the premises, detention premises, up to three months. However, the case right now and in the last more thanfive years is that as long as a family member launched an application for asylum, within six days the family has to be transferred to one of the reception facilities of the State Agencyfor Refugees. So you can see that we reduced the possible stay up to six days. Secondly, about unaccompanied minors, there have been amendments in 2018 in the law for foreignerswhich already prohibited the placement in a detention center of an unaccompanied minor. Of course, I have to say if it has been identified at very early stage that the minor is unaccompanied.However, there are two situations when minors have been detected as being unaccompanied at a later stage, meaning already in a detention facility. The one is if a minor declares whenhe has been identified or arrested that he is over 18 and the 2nd situation is that a minor himself declares that he is with his brother, older brother or uncle or somebodyfrom the family. So in that case, unfortunately, the children go to that placement in a detention, but otherwise all identified unaccompanied minors at a very early stage and efforts are put andare there to guarantee that as early as possible children are identified, migrant children as unaccompanied, they are immediately 24/7 are able to be transferred to our safe zones. Andas I explained yesterday, this goes parallel with communication with the relevant child protectionunit on regional level. And about age assessment, as of 1st of March, 2024, and thank you for mentioning this achievement because it was a really long battle for this instruction, both agencies, state agency for refugees and state agency for child protection adopted an instructionfor age assessment which has to be the instruction mainly tries to avoid the medical examination. This is a last tool after interview and appropriate evaluation done by multifunctional team includingpsychologists, trained psychologists has been done. And if still the doubt is that it is an adult, then we can use according to the law for asylum and refugees the implementation of medical checking.Thank you. Thank you very much. Just a small addition to the fact that the majority of the children who come from Ukraine who are with their families are being supported in line with thephilosophy of the Child Protection Act. So they have full access to all the family support and child support services. Some of these children who have developmental difficulties or disabilities haveequal access to day care centers where experts in working with children with disabilities also havethe opportunity to work with these children. And in terms of placement, we do not have the philosophy to group and place children from Ukraine in institutions. I already highlighted that we don't have institutions of the old type anymore. So our priority and the data in terms we can additionallysend you the exact figures but the data is that the majority of these children are either with their families or placed with kinship in kinship care with close family members and only one in 2023 wasplaced in a small group home which is residential care. Now I would like to invite the colleagues toreflect on the rehabilitation and the approach we undertake to support children who are involved in gambling and addiction, the question which was raised by Ms. Kiladze. I would like to give thefloor to the colleagues from the Ministry of Health. Thank you very much. In 2019, the Ministry of Health asked the World Health Organization to provide a policy brief on the harm of gambling which was providedbased on the newest scientific data. This statement was used by the Bulgarian Parliament to prohibit andto control better the commercial, the commercials regarding the national, the so-called national lottery which was very aggressive and was leading to poverty because it was pushing especially young people,children but also elderly to use their pocket money and their very scarce resources tobuy such tickets. This lottery was prohibited. Now we have substantial problem with the online gambling,especially for sport events. For this, from this reason, we, the Ministry of Health in cooperationwith the Bulgarian Pediatric Association, National Network of Children and the WHO developed andaround several workshops for bringing the issue to the attention of the children and their teachers.Regarding the special rehabilitation services, there is the state center for the treatment of addictions near Sofia in Suhudo. They are providing the treatment and also consultation forthe rehabilitation purposes. There are also several programs provided by psychotherapists. Unfortunately, because the National Health Insurance Fund is not covering psychotherapy, those are paid out ofpocket by the parents or by the individuals themselves. We have such discussions at thesupervisory board of the National Health Insurance Fund for provision also of psychotherapy and psychologicalsupport from the fund, but this will be an issue this year of further discussions. And regarding the issueof intersection, okay. Thank you. Only one small additional fact on behalf of the social system. We have two types of social services which are also involved in the work with children who have addictionor are involved in gambling. These are the community support centers and the centers for social rehabilitation. We are happy to share with you that we have psychologists and social pedagogues who are employed in those two types of centers and they are also working with this target group of children.There is room for improvement in the cooperation between these experts and these services and the health system so that we can report better impact. Just to close the cooperation in this matter. Sonow you can go back to intersex and HIV and AIDS. Thank you. I would like to bring some more objective facts to my a bit subjective statement about the intersexuality and the approach in Bulgaria. We havethe medical standards for surgery related to gender change which are used also in the case of intersexuality. Ordinance No. 6 as of August 24th of 2015 and the approval of the medical standard plasticrestorative and aesthetic surgery regulates the implementation of surgery related to gender change. Those surgeries are among the operations and manipulations in the field of plastic restorative and aesthetic surgery performed in medical establishments for hospitals and specialized outpatient medicalcare. Doctors cannot make the decision by themselves to change the gender of patients whether they are children or adults. An informed decision is made by the patient when over 18 years of age or by theparent custodian when the patient is under 18 years of age. Where the patient's behavior constitutes a danger to the child's personality, health, upbringing or property, the district court shall take appropriatemeasures in the child's best interest, restricting parental rights, withdrawing or imposing conditions and the exercise of some of them and may entrust another person with the exercise of such rights. Ifnecessary, the child's place of residence may be changed or he or she may be placed outside the family. Such measures shall also be taken where for prolonged physical or mental illness or otherobjective reasons, the parent is unable to exercise his parental rights. Thank you. And just to continue maybe with the last question on HIV and AIDS, in order to improve sexual and reproductive health, variousactivities were carried out among students and young people by the Ministry of Health. The national program for the prevention and control of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, 21st, 25th,targets young people, children and people at risk. In 2022, implementing the national programthrough the country, regional health inspectorates, employees assisted by medical specialists in the school network and other local institutions have implemented over 500 campaign activities whichwere distributed, condoms, educational materials, et cetera. There is a network of 12 easily accessibleoffices for anonymous and free voluntary counseling and testing for HIV. They include interventions that aim at changing sexual behavior of target groups, health education based on building social andvital skills in schools, education about HIV and sexually transmitted infections, safe sexual behavior based on skill development in Roma girls and boys and training of trainers from the Roma community.I just want to add that as I mentioned yesterday, under the plan for recovery and sustainability, health and sexual health education is foreseen to be introduced this year in all Bulgarian schools andchildren and young adolescents will have access to valid and trustful information in accordance totheir age and needs. Thank you. Just a quick reflection at the end on the questions raised byMs. Susanna Ajo on the legal arsenal. We have to protect children. The floor is yours. Thank you very much. I would like to mention that according to the criminal procedure code, every victim which is minoror between 14 and 18 has the right to be interrogated in presence of a psychologist or pedagogist and inthe presence of his or her parent. In the case of minors, it's an obligation. In cases of personsbetween 14 and 18, it's on the decision of the investigating authority. Also, we use very often theso-called blue rooms for victims, victims of crimes, especially sexual crimes or domestic violence crimesand we try very often, it's a common practice, to do this interrogation of the victims, minor victimswith judge. If it's done with judge in the pretrial phase of the criminal proceedings, then there is no need during the trial phase the same child to be interrogated again. We can use straight the protocolfrom the pretrial investigation to avoid 2nd victimization. Also, this kind of blue rooms are sowell equipped and so well constructed with the idea to avoid direct contact between the child victimand the perpetrator. Also, we have special provisions for such cases which allow in criminal procedure codeto use videotaping or audiotaping of such children, victim children. I would like also to mentionthat we have special telephone line for primary legal aid which is in our national bureau for legal aid andwe have another hot line which is 24 hours which is specialized for domestic violence and both telephonelines could be used by children who feel victims, either of domestic violence or sexual violence. Also,there was a question for cases when a child is watching pornography. We have special Article in Article 155paragraph 3 which makes this a crime when somebody legally criminally liable inclines or provokes aminor to watch pornography. Of course, if a minor provokes a minor to watch pornography, this is not a crime because a minor cannot be criminally liable. We also have a memorandum between the Ministry ofJustice, Interior Ministry, the Bar Associations and the National Bureau for Legal Aid which memorandumgives opportunity for very rapid legal aid free of charge when somebody who is a victim of domesticviolence has a need of this free of charge legal aid and there are barristers on duty in every of 19bar associations for every night, every day, 24 hours, barristers on duty for domestic violence who are obliged and they consent in advance to go everywhere where is the victim of domestic violence, no matterwhether the victim is at his home, her home or in the police station or even sometimes unfortunatelyin the hospital because sometimes they are in the hospital. Thank you. I'm afraid we have to wrap up. We are ready to provide additional information on some of the questions for which we didn't managewithin the limited time to elaborate more. So this would be generally the root causes related to the optional protocol, the plan for the juvenile justice reform, also the structural decisions around theombuds person as an institution capacity within or different structures. We would like to use the opportunity to provide additional information. Thank you very much. I don't know if the members have anyanything further to follow up with. We do have a few minutes on hand. Mr. Bragy Goodbranson.Thank you again for your excellent responses. Just a clarification with regard to thecourt procedure in taking the child's statement in the blue room, if I understood it correctly,the right of the accused person is being assured by his lawyer or his defense being able to cross examinethe child in the blue room. So the principle of equality of arm is, in fact, de facto implemented on the pretrial states so you won't need to do it during the main hearing. So did I understand thatcorrectly? Yes. It is possible the interrogation of the child victim who is a witness to be done crossto be a cross examination in which will participate not only the prosecutor but also the accused with his defendant but in a way that the child will not see him. He could get the questions, give the answerswithout seeing him just to avoid the stressful situation which is normal and to avoid 2ndvictimization. It is a practice, yes. It is a practice. Thank you. I would also like to just follow up on the issue of children sending images to one another. You talked about in your response just nowyou spoke about when children are being asked to look at pornography. But this is actually a bigger phenomenon. It is also creating, you know, creating child pornography because if a person makes a child pornographic image of a child then they are creating child pornography. Now what is happeningis that children are making pictures of themselves and they are children and in some legal systems that is interpreted to mean that they have created child pornography. So that's and that's a very serious crime. So suddenly children find themselves drawn into the net of criminality on somethingvery, very serious whereas if adults share consensually they are not in trouble. They may do so. Now we may, of course, we should almost certainly have social policies to discourage children from doing thisbecause of all the immense risks that go with it such as it could then be shared with a 3rd person nonconsensually. So we don't want to encourage children to do this but we do have to face the reality that they do do it and then is the legal system sufficiently flexible and even on what you said,you said that look surely an adult would a child wouldn't be liable because it is only adults that are liable. Well, what about the 14 to 18 year olds who are the ones that are most likely to be doing this? So would they have no liability? So I'm simply asking whether because if your law is notspecific, the framework as it currently stands is ill equipped to deal with these new emerging difficultissues. I just would like to briefly answer. If a minor between 14 and 18 provokesanother minor to watch child pornography or any kind of pornography, then this minor who is between the ageof 14 and 18 could be criminally liable. He or she could be criminally liable but not if it is under 14.Fair enough but it is generally the 14 to 18 year olds that will be doing this.So I think what we are saying is you are going to need to look at your law to see if it is sufficiently responsive. I see now two more members who would like to take the floor. Mr. Benyam Mesmer and then Tuaiba Al Barwani. Thank you very much, Chair and thank you to the Delegation for the responses.My question is very brief. One is yesterday I had mentioned about the data that you provided in annex 1 in relation to the cases that are coming to the commission for the protection against discriminationwhich I mentioned was 2017 to 2020 which was 5, 4, 2 and 2 which is very low. But we heard new figures today. 2022 and 2023 you provided 2023 numbers as preliminary. So if you can provide those details in writing that would be very much appreciated. There were a few queries in relation to climate changeincluding the 2019 national strategy for adaptation to climate change but also some of the work that is being done by the national atmospheric air quality monitoring systems. So if you can also providesome of those details that would also be appreciated. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Chair. And thank you,Delegation for your really elaborate and very interesting responses to all the questions that have been raised. I wanted to follow up on some of the questions that were raised with regardsto education. I understood that you have done a lot of reforms in the school systems, especially withregards to inclusion of minority groups and language minority groups and remote area schools and so on.What I heard is that among the innovations or the new processes that you have introduced ispassing students from one area to better schools so that they can also have a share of the good schools. I was wondering whether you have evaluated this practice because my understanding in countrieswhere this has been tried has been found to be a failure really and they have gone back to where they were, just improve the schools where they are rather than pass students because it alienatesthe students who are coming from remote areas and makes them stand out and they are really they don't perform well. So my question to you maybe Bulgaria is different but I wanted to know whether you have done any evaluations to see the impact of this kind of process in the quality of education and schoolperformance and students' personal performances. Thank you very much. Okay. So that brings us to the end of the questions. You can see that if there is time we can go on forever. So it is good that we have some time constraints. So those last few points please and then we can move to the final closingpart. Thank you, Madame Chair. We are going to elaborate more on the impact of climate change and if you would agree we will provide the reflection on the other questions additionally. Also our DeputyMinister of Education had to depart. So I would like to use the opportunity to provide in depth information on the impact data in the education system and also the segregated data on discrimination if that's okaywith you. But on the impact of climate change we are ready to reflect now, please. Thank you. And thank you to Mr. Mesmo for bringing this question again. We prepared our answer but we just missedto share it with you. There is substantial work on the consequences of climate change, especially for the young people in Bulgaria done by the National Center of Public Health and Analysis mainly and alsoby the professional NGO for health with the leadership of one of the Parliament members with whom weare having a lot of joint projects. The National Center of Public Health and Analysis developed twoguides, guidelines, one on heat waves and climate change and one on air quality. Based on theseguides, two Lancet workshops were developed and executed with high interest by the health professionalsbut also by the Association of Students in Medicine. These young people who are studying medicine from their side involved a lot of young people, children and adolescents in sharing this information aboutthe risks of the bad air, especially in the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia but also in the major citiesbecause due to the pollution of health with the small particulars less than 2.5 nanometers, there is ahuge risk for the children, especially when they make sport or when they go out in the environment,in order to minimize those risks and how to deal with the consequences of the climate change. Based on all of these good practices, the regional health inspectorates which are 29 in Bulgaria are goinginto the schools and sharing these lessons with the students. What is really important from my point of view is the inclusion of this topic at the health education which will start in September in allBulgarian schools in order to minimize the risks not only of the bad air but also of the heat waves because they are more and more often in Bulgaria and they have huge consequences not only for the somatic healthbut also for the mental health of women, of children, of vulnerable groups. Let's say because these familiesare not for they is not affordable to have air conditioners at their homes so they are exposedto too heavy to heat. And this is also true for the Roma community. So the health mediators are alsosharing good practices like drinking enough water and staying in the shadow with their clients which isvery important from my point of view. Thank you. And maybe just the final sentence. This year Bulgariawill produce its new criteria for access to energy poverty benefits which are a new energy policy in Bulgaria. So we are quite hopeful that with these new regulations related to ensuring energy efficiencyof the households we are going to tackle the root causes that my colleague just mentioned and such households are going to be financially and with technical assistance supported to ensure energyefficiency not only for heating their households in the winter but also for addressing the heat waves because we very much rely on much more active support to households to tackle climate implications onthe safeguarding of children and again to say that Bulgaria is quite actively consulting with children and young people and we believe from the government that we should not only hear their voice but they should be also the actors and the players in all these new policies which are going to shape thefuture that they are going to live in. Thank you. Thank you. Now I'm going to hand over to thetask force coordinator Ms. Hind Ayubi-Adrisi to make some closing remarks.Thank you very much Madam Chair and thank you once again to the Delegation of the Republic of Bulgaria.It has truly been a great joy to have a constructive dialogue such as this one. The Committee is very happy to have heard everything that you have said about your intentions and the measures that you wishto put in place in order to ensure that the Convention and its optional protocols are fully implemented. Wewill closely be monitoring the actual implementation of everything that is undertaken. We would very much like to see the mechanism that Madam Minister mentioned in the introductory statement, the mechanism for thefollow-up to the recommendations issued by this Committee following the dialogue will be rapidlyimplemented because that will be the only way of monitoring the follow-up and implementation of these recommendations. As soon as possible and by 2025 we would very much like to see Bulgariaacceding to the 3rd optional protocol to our Convention as you have indicated. This protocol will be celebrating its 10th anniversary and it would be a sign of a commitment by your state ifthis were to actually happen. So thank you once again and I wish you the best of luck. And now over to you, Your Excellency, for your closing remarks. Madam Chair, Distinguished Members of the Committee,ladies and gentlemen, the Bulgaria Delegation greatly appreciates this open and fruitful dialogue with the Committee members over the past two days. We have sought to acquaint you with the comprehensive implementation by Bulgaria of the obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and theratified so far optional protocols. We did our best to answer all questions and as I already committed, we are going to submit in writing further details to elaborate more on the matters that were raised.We are really grateful for the questions which sound to us as also suggestions for improvements.I would like to assure you that all competent authorities unfortunately not all of them represented physically today but, of course, actively involved with all the relevant stakeholders from the academia, from the civil society, children, parents themselves, we will carefully study and analyze all the concernsand the recommendations and we will take as I already committed prompt and appropriate measures foreffective follow-up and I'm happy that you reassured us that the quicker we do the action plan and the follow-up mobilization, the better. So this is something that as the leader of the Delegation I'malso quite motivated to do that in due course. Our constructive exchange will allow us to assess more clearly all the areas where we have truly made progress and we have to sustain this progressbut also we identified clearly where are the areas we need to undertake more significant efforts. The Bulgarian Delegation is convinced that the outcome of the productive dialogue with the Committee duringthe last two days will provide useful guidelines for taking further steps towards improving and refining the legal base but also the institutional infrastructure, the policy framework and the practicesin Bulgaria. We are going to further rely on your huge expertise as a Committee as well as our partners again from the civil society international institutions such as UNICEF, UNHCR which have always stood by usand supported our efforts to improve the lives and future of the children in Bulgaria and I would like to highlight that without this support it will be very challenging for us to reform the system inBulgaria. Given the fact that I have dedicated more than 30 years of my professional life to children's rights, I would like to assure you that it is my personal commitment not just hope that the Bulgarianreport in the future will present the real results. I fully realize that committing is 1st stage,doing the commitment and delivering your promises is the 2nd and demonstrating the impact is the more important stage when we talk about responsible authorities. So Madam Chair, let me express thedeep gratitude of the Bulgarian Delegation to you personally for your excellent manner in which you conducted this interactive dialogue during the presentation of our periodic report. We wish to extendthanks to all members of the committee for your substantive interventions and your constructive manner in which you posed your questions. We are also grateful to the whole Secretariat, the interpretersof course and other staff members of OHCR for their valuable assistance in assuring the smooth proceedings yesterday and today. I know we were speaking fast. We wanted in the short time to say more and more andto elaborate sometimes complex matters. So thank you all for being so positive and encouraging. I think Bulgaria needs constructive and encouraging guidance because we are committed to ensure therights of children. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So it seems that Bulgaria is poised at the moment of big opportunity and it is wonderful to hear not only your commitment but alsoyour determination to make all of those plans a reality. So we wish you a good journey home and we convey our best wishes to all the children of Bulgaria. The meeting is now closed."}
{"title": "", "text": "In my capacity as President of the Council, I now announce the opening of our International Meeting of the Human Rights Council on Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda for SustainableDevelopment, titled Integrating Human Rights into the International Financial Architecture Reform. At the outset, let me in my capacity again extend my very best wishes on the occasionof the new year and welcome you all to this important International Meeting for Dialogue and Comparison on Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as mandatedby the Human Rights Council Resolution 52/14 in April 2023. Excellencies, Distinguished Guests and colleagues, as you would recall, the President of the Council last year by his letter dated19 December 2023 appointed His Excellency Mr. Mark Buechler, Ambassador and permanent representative of Luxembourg as Chair of this 6th International Meeting. However, through the note verbal fromthe permanent mission of Luxembourg to the Secretariat which was circulated to all Delegations yesterdayafternoon, I was informed that Ambassador Buechler due to reasons beyond his control would not be able to return to Geneva in time to Chair this meeting. The Ambassador while doing his utmostto be in Geneva for this meeting delegated his responsibilities as Chair of this meeting to his Deputy permanent representative, Mr. Luke Dockendorf until the time he arrives in Genevahopefully during this day. Given these unfortunate circumstances, if you all agree, I would want over I would hand over, sorry, the Chairing of this meeting to Mr. Dockendorf, Deputy DPRof Luxembourg until such time as His Excellency Mr. Mark Buechler arrives. So if there is no particular comment, I wish then to call invite Mr. Dockendorf, DPR of Luxembourg to come tothe podium and take over the Chairing of this meeting. You are most welcome, sir. Please cometo the podium, Mr. Dockendorf. Excellencies, distinguished guests and colleagues, ladiesand gentlemen, it is my honor to Chair this meeting until my Ambassador arrives here. You would recall that in April 2023 the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution AHRC/RES/52/14 on the promotion and protection of human rights and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for SustainableDevelopment. The Resolution mandated three full day intercessional meetings for dialogue and cooperation on human rights and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to be held in 2024, 2025 and 2026. Our meeting today is the 1st of the three full day meetings. Theobjectives of these intercessional meetings is to provide a space for states, UN and regional human rights mechanisms, UN entities, civil society and other stakeholders to share good practices, achievements, challenges and lessons learned concerning integrated approaches inthe promotion and protection of human rights and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The focus of this intercessional meeting is informed by the theme of the HighLevel Political Forum 2024, reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises, the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutionswhile considering the multiple global crises. The theme is integrating human rights into the international financial architecture reforms, a cornerstone for realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the human rights economy with a focus on SDG 1, ending povertyin all its forms everywhere, SDG 16, promote peaceful and inclusive societies for Sustainable Development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. And finally, SDG 17, strengthen the means of implementation andrevitalize the global partnership for Sustainable Development. The meeting will look into the overarching promise of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind and to reach those furthest behind 1st . This discussion is timely and topical. It happens at a time of interlinkedglobal crises deeply affecting human rights and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It draws on the fundamental recognition that the promotion and protection of human rightsand the 2030 Agenda are interrelated and mutually reinforcing and it highlights the critical importance of the High Commissioner's vision on the human rights economy and the urgency of applying a human rights lens to the reforms of the international financial architecture. A summary report of thediscussions of this meeting will be provided to all its participants and to the Human Rights Council at its 56th session. As in the case of the previous intercessional meetings, the outcomes of this meeting will also feed into the discussions at the high level politicalforum in July 2024. It is also expected that the official inputs to the annual high level political forum will be of support to the preparations for and the deliberations at the 2024 Summit of the Future, Summit for the Future, including its pact for the future. The program and conceptnote for this meeting have been shared with participants and are also available on the meeting'sweb page. This meeting will be divided into four sessions, a high level opening session and three thematic sessions focusing on the role of international financial institutions, debt restructuring and international cooperation on tax matters. During the high level session,opening remarks will be made by His Excellency Mr. Omar Sniba, Ambassador and permanent representative of Morocco and President of the Human Rights Council. Her Excellency Ms. Paula Narvaez, President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council and Mr. Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner forHuman Rights. Ms. Fernanda Simbra Santiago, the Special Advisor to the Ministry of Finance of Brazil will present the keynote address. The 1st session will focus on how adopting a human rights lens to the reform of the international financial institutions is important to eradicatepoverty and advance human rights at the Sustainable Development Goals. The session is planned for2 h and will include four panelists. It will be moderated by Ms. Magdalena Sepulveda, Executive Director for the Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The 2nd session will explore how to maximize available resources for economic, social and cultural rights andleave no one behind at a time of growing debt distress. The session is planned for 1 h and 25 minutes and will include four panelists. The session will be moderated by Mr. Richard Corzul Wright who is Director of the Globalization and Development Strategies Division in UNCTAD.The 3rd session will bring a human rights perspective to the current global developments on inclusive and effective international tax cooperation. The session is planned for 1 h and 25 minutes and will include three panelists. The session will be moderated by Ms. Erzge Aydogan, Directorof the SDG Lab. Each moderator will lead the discussions with the panelists on the thematic sessions as outlined in the agenda following which I will then open the floor for interventions from member and observer states and other observers. We will conclude each session with final remarksfrom our esteemed panelists. Excellencies, distinguished guests and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, it is now my pleasure to welcome the President of the Council, His Excellency Mr. Omar Sneba for his introductory remarks. Excellency, you have the floor. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.I would like again to extend a very warm welcome on my behalf as President of the Council to all the very distinguished panelists and participants as you rightly now pointed out. I mean, we havereally an important team of panelists and all those who will debate on these very importantissues. Welcome for you all. Of course, including representatives of Member States and international organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations present in theroom and those joining online. Your valuable contribution to our debate will surely enrich the outcome of this international meeting. Marking the 1st of a three-part series, this internationalseminar comes at an important moment as the Summit for Future which will be held in September 2024 will bring forth important discussion at the fore for, I quote, \"multilateral solutionfor a better tomorrow,\" end quote. Recalling the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which we celebrate recently in our summit here in Geneva, it is important that the gapsin the current international financial architecture are addressed in order to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and ensure that no one is left behind. By the way, I would like to recall in the presence of the Ambassador of France this morning the important conferencewhich took place recently in Paris in this very important subject for all of us, for the global community. Welcome, Mr. Ambassador. Economic challenges associated with unsustainable debtand the existing debt restructuring mechanism remain a huge concern. Over one-third of low and middle income countries are either under debt distress or at risk of it. In 2022 alonelow and middle income countries paid $443 billion in external, public and publicly guaranteed debt servicing. And nearly half of 1.1 billion people who are living in situations of povertyare children under the age of 18. The Council has been asked to act on persisting and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, growing challenges around multidimensional poverty and wideninginequalities, climate change, the limited fiscal capacity of countries to mobilize maximum available resources and the grave impacts of cost of living crisis among populations which endangers aswe know all our common and important target concerning the 2030 Agenda. In response, the Council has called on states to implement approaches that integrate the promotion and protection of humanrights and the realization of 2030 Agenda. In that sense, I appreciate that this international meeting underscores the need for integrating human rights into international financial architecturereforms and developments. This is essential for the implementation of 2030 Agenda and moving towards a human rights economy. By the way, probably it is not the place, I mean, to right now giveinformation about my own Agenda as President, but I have in my Agenda on your behalf planned meetings with the financial institutions, international financial institutions and, of course, the reportof this international session and all your discussion hopefully will be echoed there. I rely on all participants to share good practices, achievements, challenges and lessons learned as well as toolsand methodologies used to promote human rights and implement the Global Development Agenda. The broad expertise present in this room will ensure a rich discussion and deeper understanding of the synergies between this new Development Agenda and the range of international humanrights laws and standards including civil, political, economic, social rights and cultural rights. Finally, it is in this spirit that I wish you all the best, excellent deliberation and I look forward to your report as I said before which will be considered at one of ourcoming sessions of the Human Rights Council and I do hope will have also impact in realities concretely on the ground. I thank you so much, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much, Mr. President of the Human Rights Council for your remarks and thank you also for sharing some ideas thatyou will be implementing as Human Rights Council President. I think these are very timely and topical. I now have the honor to give the floor to Her Excellency, Ms. Paula Narvaez, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council who will make her remarks via video message. Excellencies,Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my honor to address this important gathering in my capacity as President of the Economic and Social Council and in accordance with Resolution37/25 and subsequent resolutions of the Human Rights Council that have called for a more integrated approach to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for the fullrealization of human rights. I will use this opportunity to briefly highlight the role of ECOSOC in focusing holistically on the means of implementation including by integrating humanrights into the international financial architecture reforms as a cornerstone for realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and a Human Rights Economy. The political declarationof the 2023 SDG Summit sent a strong political signal about the urgency of reforming the international financial architecture. The Economic and Social Council including its various forums and segmentscan help to translate the Summit's commitments into focused policy guidance and practical actions. As President of the Council, I aim to make the most of these opportunities. ECOSOC through its forum onfinancing for development and the development cooperation process stands ready to advance the respect for human rights in the international financial architecture as we embark on the preparationsof the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in 2025. Member States will in 2024 be gearing up for the Summit of the Future which is expected to address a broad set ofgovernance reforms including to the international financial architecture. We need to take steps both individually and through international cooperation to bridge the great finance divide through equalityand no discrimination prioritizing the most marginalized and committing to leaving no onebehind. The realization of rights enshrined in human rights conventions especially economic and social rights is closely connected with global economic and financial governance. The international financialarchitecture was crafted almost 80 years ago. Its governance arrangements are out of step with the realities of today. Its flaws have been exposed by new challenges and crises. Too often the currentinternational financial architecture still operates in a way that is at odds with our collective commitments to universal human rights. It is unfair and unjust and fails to serve the most vulnerable.Excellencies, reforming the financial architecture is pivotal for supporting the realization of human rights and achievement of sustainable inclusive and equitable transformations. Meaningful reforms must be rooted in astronger voice and representation of developing countries in global economic decision making. This will help foster more inclusive, effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions. Additionally, to support thehuman rights agenda international financial institutions must further prioritize social spending and promoting fiscal space. They can do so by enhancing concessional funding while ensuring that social environmental and humanrights safeguards are in place. Updating the development banks mission, policies, practice, metrics and internalincentives to put a laser focus on achieving the 2030 agenda will also be essential. Accelerating achievement of the SDGs is an imperative for all countries. But with more than 50 countries facing severe debt challenges,either in or at high risk of debt distress, progress is being slowed, halted or even reversed. For many countries, debtservicing costs do not allow for SDG investment. For countries in severe debt distress, the lack of a mechanism for restructuringsovereign debt prolongs the painful process of resolution. Effectively mobilizing domestic revenue is key for funding the human right of universal access to essential services. However, developing countries are often sidelined in international tax norms setting. They face obstacles on issues like tax related illicit financial flows and taxationof income from cross-border services. The recent establishment of an ad hoc Intergovernmental Committee to develop draft terms of reference for a U.N. Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation marks a crucial step in addressing this global challenge. The ad hoc Committee provides a vital opportunity to build trust and consensus amongMember States through transparent and inclusive processes. By fostering a space where diverse voices are heard and valued, it can help pave the way for an inclusive, fair and effective international tax system that not only supports but also helps to prioritize the fulfillment of human rights. In his report, our Common Agenda, the Secretariat General proposed a biennial Summit on International Taxation and International Payment, which will feature the commission's recommendations in this session and a report on the document. In his report, our common agenda, the Secretariat General proposed a biennial Summit on Internationalof ECOSOC, the International Financial Institutions and the G20 to discuss high level economic priorities and the contributions of different actors. This initiative merits further consideration.I would like to conclude this brief opening statement by thanking the Human Rights Council for its involvement in the work of ECOSOC. I welcome our continued collaboration this year as we prepare for the financing for development forum and the high level political forum onsustainable development. Let us strive to strengthen efforts to integrate our shared objectives in our work across the spectrum of sustainable development. Thank you for your kind attention and I wish yousuccess during the important deliberations taking place today. I thank the ECOSOC president for her very helpful statement and I now have the honor to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,Mr. Volker Turk, to make his opening statement also via video message. Mr. President, Excellencies, colleagues, nine years ago the world came together to map out a bold path for change, equality andjustice. The Sustainable Development Agenda is our shared roadmap towards the world we want, human rights for everyone everywhere. But as we live out the rebound effects of profound geopoliticalcrises, rising conflicts and a global pandemic, we are swerving way off course. In fact, we are going backwards. Inequalities are skyrocketing. Climate change is burning and pounding our planet and thenumber of people living in severe poverty has risen for the 1st time in a generation. Imagine a world where 750 million people do not have enough to eat. Imagine a world where almost half of humanity, some3.3 billion people live in countries where governments spend more on servicing their debts rather than ensuring children are in school or that people have access to affordable healthcare. This is not aprediction of some dystopian future. It is a dystopia that we are living today. 80 years ago the international financial system was set up to protect the world from deep economic and financial crises.But today the system is broken. In the wake of the pandemic, countries are drowning even deeper in debt. Developing nations carry the biggest burden. They pay interest rates up to eight times higherthan developed countries pushing them into debt distress. Yet there is still no multilateral legal framework which could ensure sovereign debt crises are resolved fairly, swiftly and effectively. The result,strangled by debt servicing commitments, many countries are simply unable sufficiently to invest in human rights and the sustainable development goals. We must avoid these debt traps becoming even bigger deathtraps. We must also tackle rampant global tax abuse. A staggering 480 billion U.S. dollars is lost each year to tax evasion and avoidance by powerful multinational corporations and the super rich. Fordeveloping nations, the equivalent of half of their public health budgets is being drained, robbing them of the capacity to invest what they need into human rights, particularly economic, social and culturalrights. Mr. President, the UN Secretary General has called repeatedly for a fundamental overhaul of our dated and unjust international financial system. Infusing the values and protections provided byhuman rights into this overhaul is critical. Speaking in concrete terms, I suggest six points of action. First, we need a massive injection of financial resources to get the sustainable development goals back on track. Butthis must focus on providing concessional financing or loans with much lower interest rates and longer andfairer borrowing terms. Financial support must enhance all states' capacities to invest sustainably in all human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. Second, urgent reform of the governance of international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must also transform their economic paradigm. To firmly anchor macroeconomic policies and financing decisions in humanrights, to put an end to policy conditionalities that disregard a state's human rights obligations or impacts of a state's policies on the enjoyment of human rights and to update policy and practice to consider human rights and inequality impact before and after financial operations, loans and investments to help ensure these institutions proactively support rather than impede the achievement of human rights and the SDGs.Third, we must address debt distress. This means tackling the high cost of debt and it means a more effective process for restructuring unsustainable sovereign debt, taking into account states' international human rights obligations. Fourth, an update of the principles of responsible borrowing and lending, including by private creditors, to better reflect human rights. We must advance towards a multilateral legal framework under which states andentities would be encouraged, not penalized, when boosting their social spending. Debt sustainability analysis should reflect the need for adequate fiscal space to secure access to health, education, social protection and other rights, giving priority to fulfilling these rights over paying external creditors. Fifth, a redesign of the global tax architecture to make it fairer and more inclusive. Theinitiative proposed by the Africa Group just adopted by the UN General Assembly is an important step in this direction. It advances towards the development of a legally binding framework convention on international tax cooperation. And 6th , a fair and just global economy means a reform of global tax rules that will increase the resources governments can mobilize domestically by ensuring that multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes inall the countries where they operate by elevating the global minimal income tax rate to thwart the race to the bottom and by promoting financial transparency, integrity and accountability, including through public reporting of corporate profits and curbing tax-related illicit financial flows to tax havens. It also means national economies with more efficient and transparent tax regimes and progressive tax policies on income and wealth.Excellencies, it is time for a profound shift in our approach to economic policies. It is time to integrate human rights into the heart of the international financial architecture. It is more than time to implement human rights economies in all parts of the world. These are economies which place people, their human rights, including their economic, social and other rights at center stage. Economies which prioritize the health of our planetwhere people are empowered to participate in decision-making processes that affect them, where resources are more fairly distributed, reducing poverty and inequalities and where we can be finally lifted out of our silos in the acknowledgment that the realization of human rights is the responsibility of us all and it requires international cooperation, assistance and solidarity. The Sustainable Development Goals embody a united vision of human rights and developmentand I sincerely hope we can rise above the challenges and work together to urgently bring our vision to fruition and guarantee at last that no one is left behind. I look forward to hearing the results of your conversations today. Thank you. Thank you, High Commissioner, for a very inspirational statement. And I now have the distinct honor to invite Ms. Fernanda Simra Santiago, the Special Advisor to the Minister of Financeof Brazil, to present today's keynote address. Please. Good morning to everyone. We started in 2023 facing numerous challenges. It was urgent to reorganize public accounts while preserving social spending, lowering interest rates, reducing the population debt and regaining market confidence. In Brazil, high inflation had reduced people's real income andmade it difficult for poor families to access goods and services. Unemployment remained at high levels and hunger had returned to the country at alarming rates. To make sure actions against poverty were included in the government budget, it was essential to strengthen income transfer and other social programs. To this end, even during the government transition, a constitutional amendment was approved thatmade it possible to overcome the limitations of the existing fiscal framework that made spending on social programs difficult. Further, in the 1st half of 2023, the Lula government approved a policy of permanent appreciation of the minimum wage and increased it higher than inflation levels, impacting salaries and social security benefits. On taxation, we must state that fiscal justthis is a central concern of us. We are convinced that poorest cannot pay proportionally more taxes than the richest. To start changing this, we approved a change to income tax on closed-end investment funds and offshore companies and increased the tax exempt range for individual incomes. As a result, 13.7 million Brazilians became exempt from the tax. For this year, othermeasures are being developed to increase the progressiveness of income tax. Furthermore, a major reform on the consumption tax was approved after decades of negotiations. It will reduce the number of taxes that now will be charged only at destination and eliminate duplication. The reform will provide more transparency and simplicity to the system, substantially impact people's lives. This concernespecially individuals on lower incomes who will benefit from tax cashback for essential services such as electricity and their exemption for basic food basket and menstrual hygiene products. The reform also approved the progressive taxation on inheritance, taxation on the ownership of aircraft and vessels and in addition to the selective tax for activities that harm health and environmentalenvironment. Besides this, a new fiscal regime which seeks to make fiscal variables more predictable, public debt more sustainable and provide flexibility to accommodate fluctuations along the economy cycle. To achieve these goals, the new regime set a limit to real growth in the government expenditure at 70% of real revenue growth and also fixed a maximum of 2.5% points andminimum of 0.6 for this growth in addition to a minimum level for public investment. Macro economy sustainability is reconciled with fiscal justice. Brazilian economic policies focuses on increasing the country's growth potential with environmental, social and fiscal responsibility. It is within this framework that the ecological transformation plan is included with theobjective of establishing an economic development model that reconciles economic growth with the appropriate use of natural resources and the best social distribution of gains, decarbonizing the economy, increasing productive and reducing social inequalities. This is a green now industrialization making use of the Brazilian clean energy matrix developing new technologies in areas where the country hasgreat competitive potential and exploiting its biodiversity in a sustainable way. What the plan seeks is a way to explore these assets with respect for the environment, gains for the most vulnerable Brazilian citizens and without replication the historical cycles of exporting commodities with very low added value. It has six pillars with actions to be implemented by the end of the governmentsustainable finance, technological densification, bioeconomy, energy transition, circular economy and the new infrastructure to adapt to the climate change. In the context of sustainable finance in particular we approve the regulation of the carbon market issued public bonds to finance sustainable economic activities begun to design of the taxonomy of sustainable finance and thefinance created a new criteria for the agricultural loans providing lower rates for small farmers who reforest and manage the soil sustainably among other measures. Finally, Minister Fernando Haddad recently said this is our chance to reconnect the global south and north around a positive agenda of social, economic and ecological transmission. In fact, social problemand the climate crisis have no borders. The Brazilian government believes that improving the populations live conditions depends on a global economy agenda that plays the protection of the environment and the human rights. The economy growth that is sought is one that is sustainable in both the social and environmental spheres. For 2024, the objective is to continue promoting the public policiesto improve income distribution and the living conditions of the Brazilian population with fiscal responsibility and advancing the constructing of a fairer system that respects the environment. The tax is not easy but it is necessary to understand that fiscal, monetary, credit, exchange rate, commercial, sectorial and regulatory policies impact people's lives and, therefore, economicpolicy decisions must consider this impact when being drawn up and applied. All politics at its core is social. It has been a pleasure being with you all of you today. Thank you. Thank you very much for a very insightful and inspiring speech, Ms. Fernanda. This actually brings us to the end of our opening segment today. Excellencies, distinguished guests and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,we have heard much to guide our reflections on overcoming the multiple crises that we are facing right now while at the same time advancing a human rights economy and the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and our very sincere thanks to all the speakers in this segment. The upside of finishing early means that we will have more time for exchange with all of you at the 1st panel. So we will now take a short technical break and then we will start with the 1st thematic session.Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, we are going to start with the 1st thematic panel now. Thank you. So I have the distinct pleasure to welcome our 1st moderator of today, Ms. Magdalena Sepulveda, the Executive Director for the Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and she will be leading the discussion in this session as well as four distinguished speakers,Professor Jayati Ghosh, Professor Avinash Persaud, Mr. Robert Powell and Ms. Sarah Sadun. Before giving the floor to Ms. Sepulveda and the panelists, I invite Delegations who wish to inscribe on the list of speakers for this 1st sessions to raise their name plates just like this. See you up there. State representatives present in the room should raise name plates in order to be recognized while those on the Zoom platform should pressthe raise hand button on their screen if they wish to speak. Observers present in the room and to do not have name plates such as national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations are invited to register with the Secretariat at the desk on my left. That's right over there. And now Ms. Sepulveda, the floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Distinguished Delegates, ladies and gentlemen, for all of us who has been long enough working in andaround the system, we all remember the sense of accomplishment when the MDGs were fulfilled in 2015 and the expectation when the SDGs were negotiated. The hope for a better world in 2030 were very high. Unfortunately, times have changed. From 2020 to 2023, the world expects theexperience multiple shocks including COVID-19 pandemic, increased geopolitical tensions and wars, climate related humanitarian disasters, the cost of living crisis just to mention a few. The cumulative effect of this poly crisis have translated in a sharp increase in poverty and extreme poverty aroundthe globe. For the 1st time, global progress on reducing poverty is in reverse. There is no doubt that progress on the SDGs and human rights are also in great danger. Fortunately, there is still hope. However, this time, bolder measures should be taken to change the structural inequalities inthe global economy and in our societies. Fighting inequality and improving the life of people in particular those most vulnerable and disadvantaged required groundbreaking reforms that will be discussed in the three panels today. In this 1st panel, we will discuss how the international financial institutions, the IMF and the World Bank could be reformed tobridge the great financial divide in resources available for the realization of sustainable development and human rights. It has been estimated that an SDG stimulus of at least $500 billion is needed to get the SDGs back on track. So we need very measured androbust measures that need to be a change in paradigm. In the context in which developing countries do not have sufficient resources to fully recover from COVID, to address the climate emergency, recovering from war and to invest in human rights, today we will discuss what those structural reforms are those that need to be done. Can wescale up resources available for developing? What resources should be taking sorry, what measures should be taking by the IMF and the World Bank to move towards a human rights economy? Could the international financial institution missions, operational policies be realized with human rights, labor and environmental standardsin mind? These are the questions that our esteemed panel will be discussing today. I have the pleasure to introduce them. Our 1st speaker will be Professor Hayati Ghosh, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, member of the UN high level advisory board for economic and social affairs. Professor Ghosh is a veryprominent and influencer writer that has published many economic best sellers. She has received several prizes for her contributions to the social science in India and elsewhere. And we have the pleasure to hear her today. After her, we will have Professor Abinash Persaud, who is the special adviser on climate change at the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, former special envoy to the Prime Minister of Barbados on investment and financial services. Professor Persaud is also a former senior executive of JP Morgan, UBS, State Street and GAM London Limited and former Chairman of ELARA Capital PLC and RBC Barbados.He is a non-executive director of Proven Investments Limited. He is a former governor, London School of Economics and in 2010, president of the British Association for Advanced Science. After him, he will hear from Robert Power, who is the International MonetaryFund Special Representative to the United Nations. Mr. Power's extensive experience at the IMF includes policy development, aid effectiveness, country operation, debt relief activities, and capacity building. He has been the chief of a strategy and evaluation division of the Institute for Economic Policy and Development and is CEO of the International Monetary Fund. Mr.division of the institute for capacity development. He has also worked for the division of the finance department. And he joined the IMF and World Bank heavily in that poor and havehelped and joined the IMF and World Bank heavy in that poor countries initiative. Later last but not least we will hear from Sarah Sadun. She is the senior and she is here with us. Sheis the senior researcher and advocate on economic justice and rights at human rights watch. In recent years her work has focused on integrating human rights into economic policy decisionsof government and international financial institutions, particularly the IMF. As you can see, we have a great panel today. And we are going to start with Professor Gaush. Professor Gaush, I don'tknow if we have the connection yet. You have the floor. Thank you so much, Madalena. And thank you all, Excellencies and colleagues. I really feel privileged at this opportunity to speakto this really August Council on these critical questions of how international financial institutions have to be reformed and their functioning has to be improved to ensure human rights and developmental obligations of the Member States. I'm especially happy to actually share the panel with my goodfriend, Madalena, who is also such an important advocate for some of these policies. I think, you know, we have heard already some very powerful interventions that have shown us the extent of the poly crises that are facing the world and particularly impacting on human rights. And I think it's particularly important to focus on the international financial institutions, the IMF and the World Bank which were created 80 years ago because it is now widely accepted that they are no longerfit for purpose in a global economy that has changed dramatically. It's the relative size and significance of different national economies that has changed, but there have also been other very major changes like the rise of private financial flows. And these have led to major inadequacies in both the organization and the functioning of these institutions. What this means is that the sharply increasing economic and ecological inequalities across the world are accentuated and these createsocial and political tensions and geopolitical conflicts that are increasingly intense and impacting on human rights. What's interesting and sad is that despite the recognition that humanity faces common challenges, that we need global public investment on a large scale, the institutions that should be enabling this, the IMF and the World Bank are too slow, too unwieldy and let's admit they are too miserly in their responses. They don't provide anything near the required finance to meeturgent needs or to address enormous human rights and development challenges. Instead, they actually currently operate in many ways along with private financial flows to exacerbate these problems. But, of course, we must move beyond critique and I believe there are important steps that can and must be taken to make the IFS fit for purpose in the current context, particularly to create the foundations of a human rights economy. I'm going to suggest three types of reform that Ibelieve are necessary. Organizational and governance reforms along with changes in functioning and program implementation. Then 2nd , the immediate measures. And 3rd , the medium-term strategies that can ensure that these institutions can meet future likely challenges. So let's 1st consider organizational and governance reforms. The quotas and voting rights in both institutions are currently heavily skewed in favor of a few rich economies. This is simply no longer justifiedby their shares in global output or trade. And this has really affected the credibility and legitimacy of the IFIs. So this has to be revised to better reflect both changed economic significance in the world economy and the rights of stakeholders, irrespective of economic size. So what we want is a situation where not only large economies with relatively few people have disproportionate voice and power to influence decisions. Thereare these gentlemen's conventions on the leadership of these institutions, always a head of the World Bank is an American and a European is a head of the IMF. This cannot be justified on any grounds. We need more open, transparent and democratic processes for choosing the leadership. The IMF's executive board should be expanded to ensure more representation from global majority countries, especially Africa. And for important decisions, the adoption of a double majority voting mechanismso that the decisions have to have the support of both principle shareholders and the majority of shareholders, which would dramatically improve legitimacy. Ideally, there should be a general increase in quotas and shares to reflect the change, distribution and size of the global economy. But even more than formal governance reforms, possibly changes in organization and manner of functioning are even more important. For too long, both these institutions have operated within avery narrow and excessively market oriented economic framework. This has repeatedly failed in terms of resolving the problems of indebted countries and those with foreign exchange difficulties. And it's unable to address the big questions that fall outside these restrictive and unrealistic assumptions of that economic model. As a result, we get the conditions that are associated with lack of development, extreme volatility and periodic crises in many countries and repetitive need for assistance from these same institutions.This economic model underlying the programming must change. It should take account of demand side factors, fiscal multipliers, the impact of specific policies on employment, economic inequalities, access to basic goods and services, social protection and environmental conditions and, of course, climate change. So one important reason why these institutions have been able to ignore all of this is because the programs and agreements they sign do not explicitly take accountof human rights, particularly with regard to the conditionalities that they impose on recipient countries. Again, this has to change. Recognizing and adhering to the human rights responsibilities of governments must be active elements of both preparing and implementing any loan programs. For example, fiscal austerity measures like cuts in public social spending that operate to reduce social and economic rights should not be approved. And taxation measures should be progressive rather than regressive,really we need a human rights audit of all the programming. However, even within this current restrictive framework of the IFIs, there is scope for immediate actions that would significantly improve the external conditions for global majority countries and these are some of the immediate actions I mentioned. One of the most obvious is the issuance of new special drawing rights, SDRs, the liquidity created by the IMF and subsequent annual issues that could be in line with the increase of thecountries in global GDP. I was a member of the UN Secretary General's advisory board on effective multilateralism. We recommended that the IMF introduce a system of new allocations not based on quotas because this disproportionately provides SDRs to rich countries that do not need them or use them. But instead go for selective SDR allocation. This would mean that only those countries that face weak external positions would receive additional SDRs.With specific conditions like climate shocks, terms of trade shocks, interest rate shocks, capital flows resulting from global changes, need for global public investment to deal with climate, et cetera. And then these SDR allocations would be automatically triggered. Along with this, the IMF should develop its own exchange rate swap facility which could provide support with minimal or no conditionality in cases of global shocks and climate shocks. This would ensure a swifterglobal response as well as provide an embryonic but automatic global financial safety net which let's remember is one of the most important reasons for the very existence of the IMF. In addition, there are changes required in the international system for dealing with sovereign debt with the multilateral legal framework that ensures the participation of all public and private creditors and with the kinds of debt relief packages that would ensure the revival of economic activity and the progressive realization of thehuman rights. For the medium term, it's important for the IFIs to be equipped and ready for emergent challenges created by climate change, by potential health and environmental changes in a context that is very difficult with geopolitical fragmentation and open conflict between nations. It's difficult to recognize universal human rights in this very uncertain and difficult context. But definitely we must allow multilateral development banks to be expanded inquantity and scope, to be actively involved in financing for social and economic rights and for development and planetary goals. Regulatory structures specifically for financial regulation have to be reoriented to serve the interests of people and the planet rather than simply safeguarding the interests of large capital. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes currently come up against legal barriers that are created by overlapping trade and investment agreements. So these must be reformed as well. Andfinancial regulators also need to set more stringent targets for financial asset portfolios in support of climate goals. There is a session on international tax reform I'm delighted to note. So I will not go into that in detail. But there is so much scope to promote fairer and more equitable tax systems based on fairer taxation of multinational companies and taxation of the assets of very high net worth individuals preventing illicit financial flows and jurisdictionhopping and regulatory arbitrage to avoid taxation. All of these changes are possible. But clearly they require political will. And at the moment that is not really very present. I think the Human Rights Council is eminently well placed to push for such political will at both national and international levels. I think this would generate the broader conditions for a human rights economy. And so I really welcome your deliberations on this. Thank you. Thank you very much, ProfessorGosch, for those remarks. Very clear about the reforms that need to be taken. Now I will give the floor to Professor Persaud who will also join us for video link. Professor Persaud, you have the floor. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? We can hear you okay. Great. So good morning, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen,you catch me in between jobs at the moment. And so my remarks today are personal and do not necessarily reflect those of my old or new institution, the Inter-American Development Bank where I'm the new climate change special adviser. I'm going to focus on the issue of climate change. It's an issue drenched in equity and loss. The physics of the earth means that between the topics of cancer and Capricorn15 degrees north and south of the equator where 40% of the world lives, including most of the poorest communities, temperatures and sea levels will rise to the highest levels of anywhere on earth. Yet, of course, this region has contributed the least to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Those that contributed the most are essentially as a result the wealthiest countries in theworld. The flow of resources required to address climate change, including building resilience and loss and damage, is 12 times the current budget aid budgets of rich countries. But these budgets are not rising to match these new challenges. They are stuck, double counted, reclassified and shrinking. We have won a climate loss and damage fund, but we need to fund it. And the politics in too many richcountries is not for sending money to impacted foreigners but to deport foreigners. Their politics favors a response to climate change that is protectionist and disadvantages the economic development of poorer, more impacted countries. The rise of green nationalism is filling the void of multilateralism. Climate change is not just an environmental problem. It's an economic problem, a trade problemand, of course, a human rights problem. It is, as my fellow panelists have so well said, a fundamental human rights issue. It threatens the very essence of our existence and undermines the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and communities. The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and marginalized populations, exacerbating existing inequalities and injustices.Let us consider the basic right to life, the most fundamental of all human rights. Climate change poses a direct threat to this right. As extreme weather events, rising sea levels and changing ecosystems result in loss of life and displacement of communities. Migration has doubled largely as a result of climate change. These numbers are not mere statistics. They represent human lives and the pain and suffering of thepain and suffering endured by countless individuals and communities. Climate change undermines the right to health. Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and increased frequency of natural disasters contribute to the spread of diseases, food insecurity, malnutrition and pandemics. Vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and those of preexisting health conditions are particularly at risk. The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause anecdotaladditional, in addition to where we are today, 250,000 deaths annually from 2030. The right to water and sanitation is also severely impacted by climate change. As droughts become more frequent and intense, access to clean and safe drinking water becomes a luxury for too many. According to the UN, over 2 billion people now live in countries experiencing high water stress and this number will rise as climate change intensifies. Lack of access to water affects basic survival, hinders economic development, education, gender equality and is a critical cause of conflict. Climate change also has profound implications for the right to adequate housing and a decent standard of living. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events lead to the destruction of homes and infrastructure, displacing millions of people every year and doubling, as I said, migration. These climate-induced displacements often result in forced migration, loss of livelihoods and increased vulnerability to poverty and exploitation. The most marginalized communities including indigenous peoples, rural populations lack the resources and support systems to adapt and recover. So what can we do from a human rights perspective to address the challenges of climate change? First and foremost, we must recognize that climate change isnot just an environmental problem but a human one, a development one. We must integrate human rights principles into climate change policies and actions at all levels. This means ensuring meaningful participation, transparency and accountability in decision making processes and prioritizing the needs and voices of the most vulnerable and marginalized communities, especially as JIT said at multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. These needs to be lendingthese institutions need to be lending three times more with a far greater focus on human resilience in the age of climate change. Secondly, we must adopt a just transition approach that ensures the protection and promotion of human rights in the shift towards a low carbon and sustainable future. This includes providing support or resources for affected communities, ensuring access to clean energy and creating green jobs that promote social inclusion and economic empowermentbut in particular reducing the cost of capital for green transformation projects in developing countries, countries that will become the largest emitters if not per capita. And we need to do that through a range of policies focused on reducing excessive macro risk premia like currency risk premia and credit risk premia. Thirdly, we must hold governments and corporations accountable for their actions and their contribution toclimate change. This includes demanding stronger regulations, promoting corporate responsibility and advocating for climate justice in international forums. But also developing new international taxes linked to emissions to address loss and damage today and support the loss and damage fund. We must fill the fund. Lastly, we must recognize the interconnectedness of human rights development and climate change. Climate is just another windowon to a world of inequality. Climate justice cannot be achieved without addressing the underlying structural inequalities and injustices that perpetuate the climate crisis. We must strive for more equitable and just society that respects and protects the rights of all individuals regardless of their race, gender and socioeconomic status. In conclusion, climate change is not just an environmental challenge. It is a human rights crisis. It threatens our fundamentalrights and freedoms, disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, exacerbates existing inequalities and poverty. As we strive to address the impacts of climate change, let us remember the human faces behind these statistics and the moral imperative to protect and promote human rights for all. Only by embracing a human rights perspective can we fully address the challenges of climate change and build a more just and sustainable futurefor generations to come. Thank you. Thank you very much, Professor Persaud, for giving very clear indication on how climate change is a human rights and development issue and the rights that have been violated and the measures that are required. Next, we will move to Mr. Robert Powell, representative to the UN of the International Monetary Fund. We will have him through a videomessage. Hello. My name is Robert Powell and I am the International Monetary Fund's special representative to the United Nations. Today's discussion is an excellent opportunity for me to highlight the International Monetary Fund's role in supporting our members' efforts to secure human rights for their citizens. The IMF's purposes are all economic in nature and focus on promoting macroeconomic and financial stability. Butwithin this context, the IMF staff recognize the importance of respecting and supporting human rights. Indeed, in the discharge of its mandate, the IMF contributes directly to the necessary preconditions for achieving human rights. The IMF's activities indirectly promote human rights, particularly social and economic rights by helping its member countries create an economic and institutional environment in whichhuman rights can flourish. For example, the IMF explicitly promotes and protects broad-based and inclusive economic growth, including employment generation and poverty reduction and through policies such as gender budgeting or helping member countries align their budgets with SDG priorities or seeking to protect minimum levels of social spending. Similarly, the IMF has recommended increasingaccess to education and health to reduce income and wealth inequality. The Sustainable Development Goals are objectives which are strongly rooted in human rights. Since they were established, the world has grown more prone to shock. Countries are grappling with food insecurity, climate change and geo economic fragmentation. Policy space is constrained due to tightening global financial conditions, persistent inflation and elevated debt levelsLet me comment on how the international financial system can work together to increase financing for sustainable development and thereby better support all countries in their efforts to secure human rights. First, countries must act decisively to increase their own resources. It starts with efforts to mobilize more domestic resources, develop financial markets and improve governance and transparency. The IMF supportsthese efforts with technical assistance. Second, we must help countries lower debt burdens that are crowding out financing for the SDGs. Debt vulnerabilities remain high. There is currently no systemic debt crisis but for a handful of countries in distress, improving the debt restructuring process is vital. Third, financing sustainable development and thus supporting efforts to achieve our collective human rights goalswill require innovation and coordination among country authorities, international financial institutions, multilateral development banks, the private sector and donors. Public private collaboration is going to be critical. Blended finance, e.g. , help improve risk sharing for critical investments and crowd in private sector finance. Important recent efforts to scale up financing from multilateral development banksare welcome steps in the right direction. The IMF is also doing its part. A couple more recent examples, we have approved ten requests for our new resilience and sustainability to support vulnerable countries including small island developing states taking action to deal with long-term challenges such as climate change. And we are mobilizing additional resources for our poverty reduction and growth program, PRGT, providingconcessional lending to low income countries including many small island developing states. We also continue to cooperate closely with other parts of the United Nations system like the ILO, the World Food Program and UN Women to help members address problems that hinder people's ability to exercise their human rights. In summary, the IMF remains strongly committed to supporting our members' efforts towards achieving the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals and thus to establish the underlying economic and institutional conditions necessary for a world where human rights can flourish. Thank you. We will thank Mr. Powell for his video message. And we will move now to the final panelists for this round of questions. So I will give the floor to Sarah Sadun, senior researcher and advocatefor poverty and equality at Human Rights Watch. Sarah, you have the floor. Thank you very much. I want to begin with a story of a woman named Shanti who lives with her 16-year-old son about an hour outside of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Shanti lost her job cleaning a medical facility at the start of the economic crisis where she had been making $2 a day and eventually found a new job as a domestic cleaner working seven days a week for a dollar a day.During that time, inflation skyrocketed in the country, compounded by measures taken within the context of an IMF program. In May 2022, the value added tax rate was increased from 8% to 12%. Three months later, electricity tariffs were increased by 75%. Then a month later, VAT was further increased to 12% followed by another increase of 66% in electricity tariffs. The IMF program acknowledged that these measures would compound the economic painthat people were facing at a time when poverty rates had doubled to one in four Sri Lankans. It included a social spending floor as well as structural benchmarks intended to improve the country's social protection program called Sarmudi. Now, Shanti had been receiving benefits from Sarmudi since 1997 and they were a lifeline for her. But in July of last year, she was informed that the benefits were stopped as part of the transition to a new social protection program being implemented with the support of the World Bank called Aswasuma. She applied to the programbut didn't hear back. The loss was devastating. Already she had to rely on her mother, an employer for food, unable to pay her electricity bill, her power was cut off and she had to move into her mother's already overcrowded apartment. Shanti's story is not unique. In 2023, Sri Lanka's electric companies cut 1 million connections from the power grid due to failure to pay. Nearly half of those in the last two months of the year. One-third of Sri Lankans are food insecure and halfof children under 5 are facing malnutrition. But the story goes beyond even Sri Lanka. While the IMF and Sri Lankan government negotiated the specific terms of that deal, it reflects an approach the IMF is applying around the world. Human Rights Watch analyzed IMF programs to 38 countries approved since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 with a total population of more than 1 billion people. More than half included measures to remove energy subsidies. More than half raised value added taxes or movedexemptions and more than half mandated decrease in public spending as a percentage of GDP. All these measures risk undermining rights either by increasing the cost of living or eroding public services essential to rights. However, as in Sri Lanka, nearly all loan programs include social spending floors meant in the words of the IMF to protect the poor and vulnerable. Around two-thirds also include some measures to improve social protection. But Sri Lanka is only one example of how this approach is not workingyet. In Kenya, we spoke to a man named Alfredo who fixes electronics for a living. The IMF program there led to a sharp increase in fuel and electricity prices which in turn caused the cost of public transportation to double. Alfredo told Human Rights Watch that on some days his four children aren't able to go to school because he can no longer afford the bus. They regularly go without electricity. The IMF program in Kenya included a social spending floor mandating tiny increases in spending on health, education and cash transfer programsbut their total represents a decrease as a percentage of GDP over the course of the IMF program which is in line with the OHCHR's finding of a downwards trend in the country's social spending. The OHCHR's budget analysis found that total spending in Kenya on health, education, social protection and water and sanitation amount to a mere 6.6% of GDP which is less than, e.g. , UNICEF estimates as the minimum amount needed just to ensure universal access to education. When we asked Alfredo whether he had received anynew support to cope with price increases, he laughed. I would like to be clear that the IMF's greater attention to social spending reflects a positive evolution in how the IMF understands its mandate but Shanti and Alfredo's stories demonstrate the urgent need for a new approach, an approach that does not relegate the question of how economic policy reforms affect people to an afterthought to impacts that need to be mitigated to protect the poor and vulnerable but rather an approach that puts human rights at thecore of economic policy making. But as we have heard, it is not only human rights. Shanti and Alfredo's stories also share a common feature that bring climate squarely into the picture, the impact of removing energy subsidies. Fossil fuel subsidies delay the transition to renewable energy sources contributing to a climate crisis, the brunt of which as Professor Persaud described is already falling on those who are poorest. But the cruel irony is that the policies necessary to confront theclimate crisis can also fall hardest on the most vulnerable. Currently IMF policy is to mitigate these impacts through cash transfer programs that are generally limited to only a small percentage of the population deemed, quote, the poorest. But as we have seen in Sri Lanka and Kenya, this does little to address widespread economic implications leading to frequent public opposition and even protests as we have seen, e.g. , in Pakistan, in Angola, in Ecuador and undermining the ability of governments to implement fossil fuel subsidy removal.Fortunately, we are at a moment of convergence and momentum for alternative visions for aligning economic policies to deliver on economic, social and cultural rights while confronting the climate crisis. The High Commissioner's call for a human rights economy to address root causes and structural barriers to equality, justice and sustainability is one such example, highlighting the transformative potential of integrating human rights into economic policy decisions and our global economic system.In a similar vein, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights is developing an approach for eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities and for realizing human rights without relying on GDP growth. This is in line with calls by Oxfam, e.g. , to move beyond GDP as well as calls for a new eco-social contract. The climate movement has also been developing a framework for a just transition with a just transition work program established in 2022 at COP 27 and further developed last year including a call for enhancedinternational cooperation to support just transition pathways, language that mirrors how the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights defines available resources to include international assistance and cooperation creating an important link to human rights. And finally, the UN is beginning the process of drafting the pact for the future ahead of the September Summit which is a crucial opportunity for bringing these efforts together and incorporating them into international financial institutions. These initiatives may go by different namesbut they share a common understanding, that for governments to deliver on rights and the SDGs, the global economic system itself must change. This is not to let governments off the hook. There are many things individual governments can do to improve rights from prioritizing rights and budgets to improving progressive revenue generation. But the reality is that many governments simply do not have the resources to realize rights. By broadening the spotlight to include not only individual governments but also the international system in which they operate,the call for human rights economy gives full weight to the obligation of international assistance and cooperation enshrined in the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. But what does this mean in practice? There are many elements which will be discussed today, tax, debt, illicit financial flows but I want to offer three concrete recommendations. The 1st is assessments, assessments, assessments. By this I mean every major economic policy reform proposal should be assessed for its impacton poverty, inequality and human rights and these assessments should be made public. This is in line with the guiding principles developed by the former independent expert on foreign debt which was approved by the human rights council to conduct human rights impact assessments of economic policy reforms to ensure that governments and the IFIs that support them pursue policy options most protective of rights. The publication of these assessments is critical for bringing the public into debates about economic policies that affectthem. This is not only important for in line with human rights but also SDG 16.7 to ensure responsive inclusive participatory and representative decision making at all levels. In the context of the IMF there is already a powerful tool to make these assessments called distributional impact analyses that measure how specific policies affect people's real income but these analyses are undertaken only selectively and rarely published. Second, social spending should be linked to internationally agreed andrecommended benchmarks. We know how much governments need to spend as percentage of budgets or GDP to realize, e.g. , the right to health, education and social protection. In some cases governments have signed agreements to achieve these goals. Governments have also agreed through the ILO framework to social protection floors. But these and other benchmarks are not part of the fabric of our international system. IMF social spending floors don't even entertain the illusion of trying to meet them. Debt restructuring negotiations do nottake into account the reality that governments are servicing debt at the expense of social spending. In 2021 83 countries paid more per capita to service their external debt than they spent per capita on health care. Finally we need to move beyond targeted social protection to realize everyone's right to social security. This is particularly important now because in the wake of the pandemic there has been a renewed attention to social protection as a way of improving economic resilience as well as mitigating the impacts of climate policies such asremoving energy subsidies or introducing carbon taxes. But the view that reduces social protection which is enshrined in human rights law and ILO Convention to small cash transfers to a segment of the population considered the poorest amounts to a bandage on a bullet wound. I would like to end by imagining living in a world in which the IMF applied these principles. It would mean that there was a robust public debate around the decision to remove energy subsidies and how the savings would be used to protect people's rightsand it would mean social spending floors would not only prevent cuts to government spending that hurts rights but also puts governments on a credible path to achieving international benchmarks for delivering on key public services and it would mean building toward universal social protection systems that supports everyone at key moments over the course of their lives. In other words it would mean that Shanti would be living in her home with the lights on and Alfredo's children would be happily riding the bus on the way to school. Thank you very much for giving very, very concrete examples how wecan have a better alignment between economic policies and human rights moving to the human rights based economy. Now I'm going to give back the floor to Mr. President for the next discussion.Thank you very much for playing an excellent moderating role. We will now turn to the interventions from the floor and I would like to remind you that all interventions will be limited to a maximum of 2 min . I encourage you to intervene in an interactive way through comments and questions taking into account and reflecting on what our distinguished panelists have said. I invite once again state representatives who wish to take the floor.I will follow now the list drawn up by the Secretariat in the order in which name plates were raised. And to start I give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Venezuela on behalf of a group of countries. You have the floor, sir.Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am pleased to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of friends in defense of the United Nations charter. First and foremost we would like to express our gratitude to the Secretariat for organizing this intercession meeting. It is evident today that the multi-faceted challenges far from being effectively addressed in 2030 agenda was formulated and we are pleased to share thehave endured and become more complex and profound. Despite significant progress nationally and globally during the past decades, it must be regretfully acknowledged that this cyclical trend of conflicts, rising inequalities, crisis and humanitarian disasters have ravaged mostly developing countries. Mr. Chair, one of Saturday's realities is that the multi crisis and challenges are being compounded by deliberate and new challenges. Among these challengesare coercive unilateral measures which have intensified the negative impacts of the economies and sustainable development efforts of nations. Or a strike to prioritize a human rights economy is not feasible in the face of coercive unilateral measures. Nevertheless, countries under legal sanctions are constantly striving to protect the human rights of their citizens and their economies against the adverse impacts of these measures. Mr. Chair, addressing the Sustainable Development Goals in conflict areas requires acomprehensive and adaptive approach that prioritizes peace building, security and the specific needs of the affected communities. Leave no one behind was chosen the central transformative pledge for the 2030 Agenda. The realization of these promises in Palestine remains extremely difficult so long as the Palestinian people are not able to exercise the inalienable right to self-determination. Israeli occupation hinders the exercise of sovereignty and obstructs sustainabledevelopment. Sustainable development is closely connected to ending occupation. The UNCTAD has stated that the Israeli occupying power imposes a myriad of restrictions on the Palestinian economy that are impeding any prospects of sustainable economic growth. The full version of this statement has been sent to the Secretariat. Thank you very much. I thank the speaker of Venezuela and I pass the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the European Union, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Madam moderator,the European Union welcomes today's meeting and thanks Chile, Luxembourg and the core group of the 2030 Agenda Resolution together with the office of the High Commissioner. We thank the panelists for their thoughts on the reform of the international financial architecture. Like the UN and the multilateral system, the EU is founded on the principle of protecting human dignity of all people everywhere and on the universality and indivisibility of human rights. Today it is clear that the world facessignificant development challenges, poverty, climate, vulnerability and soaring debt. Our collective aspiration is to establish the strengthened international financial architecture that prioritizes people and the planet. The EU's global gateway strategy and our financial architecture for development translates our commitment to human rights-based sustainable development. Until 2027, the EU will invest up to 300 billion Euros in projectsworldwide. In 2022, the European investment bank invested close to 11 billion Euros in developing countries, for instance, helping 11.6 million people get access to safe drinking water or supplying 2.1 million households with electricity from renewable sources. Reforms of the international financial architecture are necessary to close the gap in development finance, scale up the capacity of the system in the long term and ensure that human rights are notleft behind. The European investment bank is committed to the international framework for the development of the European Union and the European Union's vision after thought. This includes applying a gender perspective. But the challenges identified ahead of this year's summit of the future are daunting and complex. We would, therefore, like to ask the panelists how to overcome short-term thinking and tear down silos between microeconomics issues and human rights. I thank you. Thank you. And I give now the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Iraq followed by Iran. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are pleased to have the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Iraq followed by Iran. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Iraq followed by Iran. Thank you. Thankyou, Mr. President. Iraq renews its commitment to working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to support all international efforts to this end and to seek to find solutions to all challenges through a national approach that reconciles the specificities of Iraq with the SDGs. Iraq works to fight poverty, to strengthen social protection, fight corruption and to strengthengood governance and to fight unemployment as well. International cooperation is a need in order to improve the living conditions in all countries including the Developing Countries and Least Developed Countries. The international cooperation should limit the negative impacts of unilateral coercive measures and to fight the illicit financial flows and to aid in the recovery of funds to their original countriesand also debts of Developing States should be eased and interest rates should be lowered for that purpose. Mr. President, the right to development is an inalienable human right. It includes the full realization of the right to self-determination and the people's right to practice full sovereignty over their natural resources. Iraq calls for all countriesto respect the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people and the right to establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and to stop supporting the strategy of the occupying power that is based on apartheid and the robbery of the riches of the Palestinian people and we should stop the genocide against the defenseless Palestinian people. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the speaker from Iraq and give the floor to the speaker from Iran followed by Thailand.Thank you, Mr. Chair. Iran aligns itself with the statement delivered by Venezuela on behalf of the group of France. First, we express our gratitude to the Secretariat for organizing this international meeting. The 15-year journey towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals passed its midway point. Over the past decade, nations at the national, regional and international levels have exerted both individual and collective efforts to address comprehensive societal goals. Currently, we find ourselvesmade at this journey uncertain about whether these goals have genuinely served global public interests and whether their realization aligns with international communities' focus. While acknowledging the considerable efforts made, it's crucial not to overlook the fact that the challenges have often surpassed these efforts. In some instances, despite governmental endeavors, challenges behind their control have impeded the achievements of numerous SustainableDevelopment Goals. National priorities and genuine needs have frequently been nullified by pressures from the international financial systems which mainly are incompatible with the characteristics of the individual countries. Mr. Chair, unilateral coercive measures have significant negative impacts on countries and their ability to achieve Sustainable Development including the goals of the 2013 Agenda. It appearsthat the reforming international financial structures and enhancing the effective role of developing countries coupled with the refraining from unilateral coercive measures by developed countries and avoiding exerting pressure on 3rd parties to comply with such unlawful measures should be emphasized more than ever as long as we witness such a situation and the susceptibility of the international financial structures to such measuresand approaches that no one left behind principle will remain unrealized existing as mere rhetoric. I thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Iran and pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Thailand followed by Brazil. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thailand thanks the Core Group on Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda Joint Statement and thanks OHCHR, the keynote speaker and panelists for their powerfulstatement and their contribution to this important meeting. Thailand recognizes the urgent global call for the reform of the international financial infrastructure to realize Sustainable Development and Human Rights which are mutually reinforcing in this connection we wish to share the following views. One, the international financial institutions, the IFIs need to be more inclusive and open to developing countriesin its governance. Their perspectives and needs should be incorporated into the IFI reform efforts. Two, IFIs policy framework should be aligned with human rights principles. Its policies should not only target poverty eradication but also tackle structural and systemic shortcomings. Three, IFIs lending and investment decisions should positively impact local communities and prioritize financialfinancing for development projects that contribute to human rights promotions such as health care, education, social protection and also social infrastructure. Four, LIFIs should create incentives that encourage states to adhere to human rights standards while achieving Sustainable Development targets. This could include better loan conditions, technical assistance, capacity building and international cooperation for rights-based development projectsand last but not least, Thailand stands ready to work on this matter in partnership with interested parties to achieve and realize the goals of both the SDGs and human rights. I thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate from Thailand and pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate from Brazil followed by Colombia. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Brazil's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals stemming from the Rio 20 Conference reflects ourdedication to sustainability encompassing environmental, social and economic aspects. The fight against hunger and poverty as well as the right to development must be seen as essential elements in the promotion and protection of human rights. This is precisely what we intend as a G20 priority while building a just world and a sustainable planet. We are also committed to the protection and inclusion of vulnerable groups and minorities. Brazil has recentlyre-established the National Commission for Sustainable Development Goals which marks a strategic move in our Sustainable Development Journey. This body steers our policies and actions towards the SDGs including the innovative and voluntary SDG 18 focused on combating structural racism. We support efforts to reform the international financial architecture which must promote sustained and inclusive economic growth in thegrowth and sustainable development, minimize economic and social costs, respect human rights and support the SDGs. Those efforts should also take into account the discussions regarding debt relief and for stressed nations and the global tax reform. Our progress in advancing SDGs 1, 16 and 17 is commendable. Programs like Bolsa Familia have significantly reduced poverty. In 2020and 2023 Brazil has developed new fiscal rules to resume sustainable growth with stability and predictability while implementing policies to combat hunger and advance social reparation. At the end of the year the National Congress has approved an ambitious tax reform rebalancing the tax system to improve income distribution. Our commitment to sustainable development driven by a vision of equity and inclusivity is unwavering. Thank you, Mr. Chair.Thank you, Distinguished Delegate from Brazil. I now pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Colombia followed by the State of Palestine.Thank you, President. In order to advance on the reform of the global financial architecture we believe it is essential to foster participation by developing countries in the governance of international financial institutions. This will help ensure that more public and private resources areallocated to solutions and partnerships which benefit sustainability and development. The reform of the international financial architecture is essential for the summit of the future during which we hope we will manage to achieve a better representative and fairer international financial architecture which will meet the needs of the current world and help us achieve the SDGs, tackle climate change and ensure the future of upcominggenerations. We must focus on several areas and those are listed in our statement which will be uploaded to the webpage. It is crucial to ensure we use innovative and flexible mechanisms on favorable even concessional bases in order to help improve the availability of loans and terms which are accessible to many countries who are grappling withhigh levels of debt and deficit, especially in the current multi-crisis context. We need to ensure that structural reforms that are climate resilient are implemented and this must be closely linked to the reform of the global financial architecture. We need to ensure access to funding for development for low cost climate solutions which will ensure the fiscal sustainability of developing countries including for middle income states as ourpresident said before the General Assembly, we cannot overcome the living crisis with further debt. So Colombia advocates a new global plan that will provide appropriate resources for countries to tackle the global climate crisis and achieve the SDGs. This plan includes proposals for leveraging the special drawing rights and advocating funds to the climate fund so as toto boost the efforts of countries striving to mitigate the impacts of climate change. As was said at COP 28, we need an agreement between low income countries, middle income countries and rich countries about how to structure the financial architecture in the face of theclimate crisis. That is why during COP 28 Colombia and France announced the climate and nature and funding initiative through which we will look at the necessary reforms at the national and international levels to ensure the sustainability of debt of developing countriesas they seek to increase investment in order to bring about structural economic reforms in order to bolster development. This will be done through a comprehensive overview of how sovereigndebt impacts developing countries' capacity to preserve nature, adapt to climate change, decarbonize their economies and how we can be more sustainable both in fiscal and in environmentalterms. To conclude, Colombia is also consolidating its leadership on matters of global taxation. In 2023 we spearheaded the creation of the regional taxation platform for Latin America and theCaribbean as a constructive regional space through which to share experience and best practices and reach common solutions that help advance decision making in order to improve the taxationsystems of our region. This is where we are holding an urgent discussion on four topics, the progressivity of the global taxation system, tax benefits, climate financing and taxation and taxationof the digital economy and new forms of labor. President, we cannot move forward with the implementation of the SDGs unless we tackle corruption and tax havens which depend on the wealthiest states.So I would like to ask the panelists what are their views about this particular point for they did not mention it in their presentations. Thank you. Very much, sir. And a reminder that longer versions of statements can always be uploaded to the website and that we should all try to stick to the two-minute limit. And now I would like to hand the floor to the Distinguished Delegateof the State of Palestine to be followed by the Ambassador of Portugal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. State of Palestine welcomes the organization of this intercessional meeting. Leave No One Behind was chosen as the slogan for the SDGs agenda. However, the realization of this sloganin Palestine remains extremely difficult as sustainable development is closely connected to ending apartheid illegal occupation and colonization. Mr. Chair, worldwide efforts to implement SDGs have been totally shattered by the continuous illegal colonial occupation of Palestine including theongoing Israeli acts in Gaza causing untold human suffering and disastrous long-term humanitarian, economical and environmental consequences on the national, regional and international level. On the 23rd of October, UNCTAD has issued its latest report where it provided an anatomy of thedevelopment of Gaza prior to the current genocide. It described the restrictions and the viciouscircle of destruction and insufficient reconstruction. Since the 7th of October, since 104 days, the occupying power has mercilessly slaughtered more than 24,285 Palestinians in Gaza and 326 Palestiniansin the West Bank with a child being murdered at the rate of one kid every 10 min . As the UN human rights experts affirm that the Palestinian people in Gaza now make up 80% of all people facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide, marking an unparalleled humanitariancrisis amid Israel's continued bombardment and siege. They also affirmed, and I quote, it is unprecedented to make an entire civilian population go hungry this completely and quickly. Israel is destroying Gaza's food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian people.End of quote. As of 30 December, over 2090,000 housing units have been damaged, ending poverty, zero hunger, good health, clean water, peace, justice, infrastructure. All SDG goals havebeen totally shattered and became a pipe dream for Gaza. Mr. Chair, finally, the World Bank, IMF and UNCTAD stated that the Israeli colonial power imposes restrictions on the Palestinian economy that are impeding any prospect of sustainable economic growth. It prevents the Palestinianpeople from accessing much of their land and use much of their own natural resources. It further isolates the Palestinian people from the global market and fragments the territory into small and disconnected cantons. Finally, Mr. Chair, foreign aid will not be efficient without tacklingthe root cause of the development in Palestine, which is the illegal occupation. Ending the illegal occupation is the 1st step towards development and international peace and security and I thank you. I thank the Delegate of the State of Palestine and pass the floor to the Ambassador of Portugalfollowed by El Salvador. Thank you, Chair, Madam Moderator. We welcome today's intercessional meeting and thank the office of the Commissioner for organizing it with the core group of the 2030 Agenda Resolution of which Portugal is a member. We thank the panelists for theirinterventions. Dear colleagues, it has become clear that the Bretton Woods architecture is in need of reform. As discussions progress on how to achieve this, we must keep a human rights perspective. Our end goal should be to make the international financial architecture fit forpurpose to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to leave no one behind. Some IP programs may limit countries' ability to deliver essential public services and reduce their capacity forsocial spending, including for eradicating poverty and furthering social protection. We highlight the importance of promoting universal systems for social protection which are key to fulfilling the right to social security. We look forward to the panel discussion on the right to socialsecurity that will take place on the 55th session of the Human Rights Council. Therefore, as the High Commissioner has underlined, economic policies must not overlook states' human rights obligations. In other words, we must promote human rights economies that prioritize investment in humanrights, including economic, social and cultural rights. Finally, Portugal reaffirms its active and constructive commitment towards financing for development, recalling the importance of implementing the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to achieve the SDGs. I thank you. I thank theAmbassador of Portugal and pass the floor to El Salvador followed by Cuba. Thank you, PresidentEl Salvador would like to thank the panelists for their presentations. We highlight the relevance of this debate in the current global context. Our country reiterates the urgent need to engage a reform of international financial institutions and the multilateral system in general at thehighest level and in various fora. We have reiterated the need to redress the imbalances inherent in the system, imbalances which have meant that inequalities have widened withinand between countries. In 1948, with the Universal Declaration, we affirmed minimal standards of rights, but unfortunately we have not been able to fully leverage the possibilities andenforce rights to the greatest extent. Moreover, we have seen how marginalization, poverty and inequalities perpetuate injustice around the world. The message and the date presented bythe High Commissioner was fairly clear in that respect. That is why we must have an international financial system which is fairer and has more solidarity in it. We need to ensure that thereare favorable conditions for financing so as to promote economic recovery and the creation of fairer, more resilient and more inclusive societies. We need to promote the adoptionof fresh standards to ensure that credit ratings do not hinder the efforts made by states to overcome the various crises they face and so that they can make progress on development. ElSalvador believes it is necessary to pinpoint options regarding alleviating external debt. My country is in favor of public policies that are inclusive and comprehensive and our own policiescomply with our international treaty and regional treaty obligations. Our country would liketo encourage the various international financial institutions to improve the loan mechanisms they offer because a return to global growth is under threat if developing countries areleft by the wayside. That is why we suggest engaging a debate about overcharges regarding loans and mechanisms to lighten developing countries' debts and to review standards withinthe international financial system. Thank you. I thank the speaker of El Salvador and pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba followed by India. Thank you, President, andmany thanks also to the panelists for their statements and a very good morning to everyone. Nine years on from the deadline for the implementation of the Agenda 2030, the outlook is very bleak.At the current pace none of the 17 SDGs are likely to be achieved and more than 69 of the targets will also not be attained. The commitment of leaving nobody behind is under great threat.An unfair and antidemocratic global order is the cause of inequality and exclusion which the vast majority of people face. It is offensive to humankind that almost 8 million people aresuffering from hunger in a world where enough is produced to feed everyone. Given that we have such knowledge now and that ICTs are thriving, more than 700 million people, that's two-thirdsof whom are women, still do not know how to read or write. The efforts of developing countries do not suffice for implementing Agenda 2030. These should be supported by concrete effortsto ensure market access, access to financing on fair and preferential conditions, technology transfer and north to south cooperation. Industrialized countries have the urgent obligation to fulfilltheir commitments on funding for development and the provision of means for implementation, including delivering on their promise to provide 0.7% of their GDP for ODA. It is also offensiveto humankind that some developed countries who are responsible for the looting of our people have resources for doubling or even tripling the budgets they allocate to the arms raceand to the development of the arms industry while at the same time failing to live up to their obligations in the field of development. President, the backsliding on the implementationof Agenda 2030 is having a negative impact on the attainment of economic, social and cultural rights. These rights are part and parcel of the UN's human rights agenda. Similarly, theright to development of our peoples is under threat. There is the global multidimensional crisis which we are facing but to this you have to add the efforts made by some countries to sabotage our collective efforts and to place technical and legal obstacles on the path towardsthe operationalization of the right to development. Cuba is of the view that the so-called economy of human rights is an evolving concept which does not replace efforts for implementing theright to development. Rather, it should complement it. Tackling this issue solely from an economic perspective would mean that its social dimension would be forgotten as would the principles of solidarity and cooperation. The countries of the south not only have a challenge to ensuredevelopment and promote and protect everyone's human rights. Rather, there is also a responsibility to modify the structures that keep us out of global progress and turn many countries intothe mere laboratories of renewed forms of domination, a new better and fairer social contract is what we need. So we would like to ask the experts three questions. Firstly, what additional measurescould be adopted in order to alleviate external debt? Secondly, what new mechanisms could be adopted in order to monitor implementation by developed countries of their official developmentaid obligations? And thirdly, how can we reduce the impact of unilateral coercive measures on countries affected by them? Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Cuba and passthe floor to the Distinguished Delegate of India followed by Malaysia and renew also the encouragement to stick to 2 min if at all possible. Thank you. Thank you, Chair, for giving the floor. Webelieve that access to low cost financing commensurate to the scale of need and depth of the shocks facing developing countries in recent times, in particular the poorest and most vulnerable is the need of the hour. Standing multilateral development banks by enhancing their operatingmodels, improving responsiveness and accessibility and a substantial increase in their financing capacity can maximize their developmental impact. There is also urgent need to enhance representation and voice of developing countries in decision making in the global international economicand financial institutions to make these institutions more perceptive of requirements on ground and also increase credibility and legitimacy of their decisions. During India's recent presidency of G20 and the declaration, matters related to IFIs have been built upon very extensively.Since its inception, India's technical assistance program and development cooperation instruments have always kept the need and requirements of the recipient at the center of our assistance model. Our approach is thus guided by the priorities of our partners, focuses on creating local opportunitiesand adheres to fiscal responsibility, transparency and viability of the projects. India has also consistently called upon Developed Countries to fully deliver on their respective ODA commitments that compliments and encourages development financing from all other sources including publicand private, domestic and international in a timely manner and contribute to addressing the financial needs of developing countries. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Delegate fromIndia and pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Malaysia to be followed by Spain. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Malaysia believes that the integration of the international human rightsnorms and standards as well as the SDG into the Development Agenda will ensure that no one is left behind. In Malaysia's case, numerous efforts are undertaken to mainstream SDGs in national Development Plans with the aims of safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of all Malaysiansamong the key SDG related programmes in Malaysia are poverty eradication, quality of healthcare, access to education and affordable housing for poor and low income households. Mr. Chair, Malaysia believes in the need for systemic reforms, a total reset of the global institution thatimpact our life. In this respect, reform of the international financial architecture could be a key for large scale SDG related investment to better address global challenges. The international architecture including its business model and financing capacities must be made more fit forpurpose equitable and responsive to the financing needs of developing countries. Therefore, we seek to collaborate with like-minded countries and international organisations to address the root causes of financial crisis and promote a fairer global economic order based on the principleof human rights. At the same time, Malaysia believes that it is timely for countries to work on financial debt and economic frameworks that advance human right for all. Finally, while recognizing the challenges ahead, it is important that we prioritize greater international cooperationand a shared understanding rather than confrontation to address the growing inequality within and between states that could further divide us as people. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I passthe floor to the Ambassador of Spain to be followed by Azerbaijan. Thank you very much, President. Spain aligns itself with the statement delivered by the EU. We would like to thank Luxembourg,Chile, members of the core group, the President of the Council and ECOSOC for the convening of this intersessional meeting and for this 1st panel, a panel which links human rights and the achievement of Agenda 2030 with the reform of the global financial system. Spain believesthat this reform is necessary in order to proactively support the implementation of the SDGs and the achievement of all human rights. We commend the political agreement reached for Spain to host the 4th summit on financing for development pending formal approval in February 2024. Thiswill be one of the key events in the next few years and we will do everything we can to ensure that tangible results are reached. It is Spain's wish that the preparation of this summit be as inclusive as possible and we need to facilitate the participation of all stakeholders, the WorldBank, the IMF, the World Trade Organization, UNCTAD, UNDP but also civil society, trade unions and the private sector. We would like to contribute to creating a climate of trust and work on reducingthe financing gaps for Agenda 2030. We need to work with a view to reforming the international financial architecture so as to give priority to people and planet and to implement a human rights perspective. It is vital to ensure that our thoughts here are also reflected in otherfora which deal with finance, debt and tax policy. Panelists, how can we integrate a gender perspective in the reform of the global financial architecture? Thank you. I thank the Ambassador of Spainand pass the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of Azerbaijan to be followed by the Bahamas. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Azerbaijan as a member of the core group of the 23rd Agenda and Human Rights Resolution thanks all the speakers for their valuable contributions to today's discussions. Giventhat today the world is facing serious challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical crisis together with the adverse effects on human rights, the theme of this intercessional meeting is very important from the perspective of integrating human rights in the deliveryof specific SDGs. Achievement of SDG related commitments represents one of the crucial components of the development policy of the Government of Azerbaijan. At the national level, Azerbaijan has prioritized 88 targets and 119 indicators across all 17 SDGs. At the same time, Azerbaijanhas accepted the 18th national Sustainable Development Goal on mine action activities in April 2023. Moreover, the Government of Azerbaijan has set the country's long-term development pathways to socioeconomic and environmental development through Azerbaijan 23rd and nationalpriorities for socioeconomic development and the midterm strategy for socioeconomic development of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022, 2026 which are fully aligned with its commitments under the 23rd Agenda. My country has entered a strategic phase in the new post-pandemicand post-conflict era which spans from 2021 to 2030. The rehabilitation of all conflict-affected territories and the secured and dignified return and reintegration of IDPs are the major post-conflict rehabilitation goals for Azerbaijan. Being adhered to the principles of leaving no one behind sustainablepeace and stability, Azerbaijan implements the program of great return to its liberated territories and the return of about 1 million internally displaced people to their homelands. Azerbaijan will submit its 1st voluntary national report during the upcoming UN High Level PoliticalForum. Thank you. Thank you to the speaker of Azerbaijan and I pass the floor to the speaker of the Bahamas followed by Mexico. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Bahamas welcomes this importantand timely discussion and we thank the panelists for their insightful contributions. We take this opportunity to highlight a few pertinent points specifically from the perspective of a small island developing state. When examining the economic dynamics of SIDS and more specificallya low-lying archipelagic SIDS such as the Bahamas, we discover a paradox that requires the international communities' careful consideration and advocacy for policy reform within international financial institutions. Vibrant economic activities on the capital island New Providence largely shapeour GDP but we must acknowledge that the developmental path across our archipelago is not homogeneous or uniform. The nuanced realities on the ground within our diverse chain of islands points tothe need for different methods of assessment regarding access to financing at concessional terms. We therefore call echo the call for IFR reform efforts to ensure that these institutions'policies are more aligned with multidimensional human rights perspectives and the realities unique to Member States including the implications of climate change. The devastating impact of hurricanes such as what we experienced in 2019 had a negative economic impact of more than3 billion U.S. dollars on our economy which represents 25% of our gross domestic product and resulted in a significant destruction of infrastructure, much of which was financedthrough international loans. While the infrastructure has disappeared, the obligation to repay these loans remain, thus creating a downward spiral regarding increasing debt and reduced development,all of which negatively impact our capacity to achieve the 2030 SDG goals. In this context, the United Nations multidimensional vulnerability index can serve as a 1st step to a more balancedmetric for GDP or GNI when economically examining Member States. Building on this, the MVI plus which is advocated by the Caribbean Development Bank proposes to include the concept of internationalresilience capacity to capture the reality that exogenous shocks in SIDS such as natural disasters can lead to deep structural scars that persist long after the shock occurred and can lead to longer recovery times and higher costs for developing countries when comparedwith developed countries which hinder the development, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. IFI infrastructure conducive to climate resilient investment is imperative, but we are also not standing idlyby. We are scaling up investment platforms, creating just energy partnerships and pledging to promulgate clean energy reforms. Therefore, it is important to ensure that multilateral banks and IFI infrastructurework in concert with each other and additionally that reforms are not fragmented but conductedcoherently across the international financial architecture. I thank you. I thank the Ambassador of Bahamas and pass the floor to Mexico followed by Cape Verde. Thank you, President. We wouldlike to welcome the organization of this intersessional meeting and we thank the panelists for their thoughts. Mexico believes it is essential to instill a humanist and human rights centered dimension in all reforms that are put forward for the international financial architecturewith a view to eradicating poverty in all its shapes. We reaffirm that promoting a more inclusive and transparent governance within international financial institutions is crucial for strengthening institutions and promoting peace and justice. We would like to highlight gender equality asa key component for achieving fairer and more sustainable societies and this should be reflected across all financial decisions and policies. Mexico puts forward responsible national policiesthat promote progressive and equitable tax systems, especially as regards women's empowerment and groups that have historically been marginalized. We would like to ask the panelists how we thesemechanisms can help improve the situation around the world. We also would believe that there is necessary for to have immediate sustainable and effective climate action that safeguards human rights. Therefore, we reaffirm that financial flows should be in step with low emission andclimate resilient development ensuring access to a healthy environment for current and future generations. Finally, Mexico believes that economic and financial issues should be tackledfrom a perspective that takes into account inequalities, hungry and poverty in all its facets. Tools such as the mobilization of financial resources, fostering innovation, facilitating technologytransfer and capacity building at the global, regional, national and local levels are essential for rekindling trust in public institutions and multilateralism, especially against the backdrop of the challenging geopolitical context. Thank you to the Distinguished Delegate of Mexico. The flooris for Cape Verde followed by Norway. A small reminder, if we all stick to 2 min as the previous Delegate did, we will be able to accommodate all speaking requests. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the panelists for their presentations. Mr. President,the elimination of poverty and hunger constitutes one of the main objectives of sustainable development.It is not by chance, as we know, that it has been decided because it is necessary to guarantee the dignity and living conditions of all human beings at the global level. It is a problem affecting allcountries, especially the small insular states. This affects all countries. My country, Cape Verde, is one of the countries that is particularly focusing on all these issues, giving the reducedcapacities in all senses of the term. In small developing states, the question that I would put to all of the panelists is how can we put the recommendations to small developing states forwardto help us to negotiate with the international financing mechanisms because it is not always a fair relationship. We are also convinced that the reform of the international financial system istoday a priority for us. If we do not do this, then the SDGs will only be a utopian ideal. We need towork together to make sure that this reform takes place and becomes reality. Thank you.I thank the Distinguished Delegate of Cape Verde. I now give the floor to Norway.Thank you, Mr. President. We welcome today's discussion. It is important because the SDGs and human rights are really two sides of the same coin. The fulfillment of human rights is an investment in human dignity, conflict prevention and in building prosperous societies. Norway is pursuing a humanrights-based development policy because we are convinced that it promotes social development and reduces poverty. IFIs are at the heart of achieving the SDGs. With the increased pressure on many countries' fiscal space, the large investments from the multilateral development banks such as the World Bankin health, education and social safety nets are needed more than ever. We agree, therefore,that the ongoing reforms of the IFIs is an opportune moment to explore how they can further support the realization of human rights within their respective mandates. We should work to ensure that human rights are advanced in the different work streams, strategies and collaboration modalities. Thankfully,we have a lot of good work to build on, including the commitment by the World Bank and other IFIs to accountability, participation, equality and nondiscrimination and social inclusion, all important human rights principles. There are also important lessons learned from the decades of work of theWorld Bank and other IFIs on gender equality. The knowledge and data of IFIs such as the World Bank are important in building evidence on what works and what does not. In closing, partnership is key. We welcome, therefore, the enhanced dialogue between IFIs and the human rights communities,including between the World Bank and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Thank you.Thank you, Ambassador. I pass the floor again to Venezuela in a national capacity to be followed bySierra Leone. Thank you very much, President. We thank the panelists for the presentations. In 2015,the world met to adopt the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, but the obstacles and challenges for achieving the SDGs remain and are growing. Heeding the global call for a reform of the internationalfinancial architecture requires that policies and operations of international financial institutions and their main stakeholders are aligned with the respect and protection of human rights and the SDGs.Today, more than 700 million people are living under the poverty line, figures which threaten to rise even more in those countries which are subjected to unilateral coercive measures which are unlawful andwhich are imposed by certain countries and this hinders international finance. This calls for true commitment, solidarity and cooperation between states and international financial institutions. In thefatherland's plan 2019/2025, Venezuela has outlined the goals and indicators and structural policies for its achievement of the SDGs. In the framework of Objective 17, the fatherland's plan includesdevelopment of new forms of trade and financial relations with the financial circuits that are currently dominated by neocolonial powers in order to ensure that implementation of our national goalsis not subordinated to imperial designs. Finally, despite the challenges caused by the imposition of the illegal UCMs, we would like to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to achieving the SDGs and achieving a fairer world. Thank you. I'll pass the floor to Sierra Leone, after which we'll have toswitch to UN agencies and NGOs, but there will still be a possibility to speak this afternoon.Thank you, Chair. Let me wish you all the best as you continue to steer this meeting. We welcome the 16th session of the meeting and thank the panelists for the insightful and detailed presentations thismorning. We are aligned with the Joint Statements by the Co-Group on Agenda 2030 and Human Rights. A human rights-based approach to the international financial architecture is rooted in both the UDHRand the ICSR. Human rights and poverty eradication are inherently linked. Poverty often leads to the violation of human rights, including the rights to education, health, and adequate standard of living.Human rights lens emphasizes that poverty reduction is not just an economic challenge, but a moral imperative based on human dignity. As a least developed country, Sierra Leone has implemented a number ofpolicies aimed at eradicating poverty and promoting human rights in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. We have prioritized coherence between our domestic and economic policies and international financial commitment in order to effectively address poverty eradication and the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals. Currently, my Delegation is actively engaged in implementing responsible debt management strategies.This strategy approach aims to prevent the accumulation of excessive debt burdens, thereby creating fiscal space for substantial investment in poverty reduction and the promotion of human rights. In a concerted effortto accelerate economic growth and build resilience, our government has launched its informative initiative known as the Big Five Game Changers. This comprehensive program covers critical areas such as food security, human capital development, youth unemployment, technology and infrastructure, and revamping thepublic service. Through these initiatives, Sierra Leone is committed to promoting sustainable development, improving the well-being of its citizens, and contributing to the global goals of poverty eradication and the promotion of human rights. Thank you, Chair. I thank the Ambassador of Sierra Leoneand exceptionally will take in the last state to request the floor, which is Zimbabwe, and to be followed by UN Women. Thank you, Mr. President. My Delegation associates itself with the statementdelivered by Venezuela on behalf of the group of friends in defense of the charter of the United Nations. We join the call for the robust reform of the global financial architecture for it to be fit forpurpose and in particular to support the structural transformation of developing countries focusing on the importance of development finance towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for SustainableDevelopment and contributing to environmentally sound industrialization. According to the 2023 World Investment Report, foreign direct investment flows to many smaller developing countries were stagnantwith FDI in Africa falling back to 2019 levels, while the flows to the structural weak, vulnerable, and small economies were dwindling. Further, international project finance towards Africa declined by a whopping47% from 2021. This is of major concern at this critical point when most developing countries are seeking to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate-induced disasters, the cost of living crisis,and some are dealing under the illegal unilateral cohesive measures among numerous other current challenges. The UCMs have no place and should be lifted. The declining FDI inflows against the backdropof unsustainable debt and disproportionate demand for financing strengthens our repeated calls for the reform of the skewed international financial architecture and more international cooperationto address other debilitating challenges such as the illicit financial flows which are siphoning huge amounts of resources that could partially offset the financing gap. I thank you, Mr. President.I thank the Distinguished Speaker from Zimbabwe and pass the floor to UN Women followed by the NGO speakers.Thank you, Chair. I would like to thank the core group, the panelists and the organizers including Luxembourg and Chile for this important discussion. I would like to ask the panelists for concreterecommendations to promote gender equality and women's empowerment for international financial institutions in the current context where we have seen reversals of the progress achieved so far.Thank you. Thank you. And the next speaker is from Association Comunita Papa Giovanni 23. Please.Mr. Chair, Madam Moderator, PG23 thank you and the eminent panelists for the interesting contribution and the concrete proposal to reform the financial architecture that have been made so far in thediscussion. Indeed, the team of this international meeting recognizes the crucial dimension of human rights not only to fully realize the 2030 Agenda but also to ensure that key global initiatives such asthe needed reform of the international financial architecture are pursued for the sake of humanity, especially of the most vulnerable and those left behind by the current economic and development model.As a civil society organization operating on the ground during the last decades we have witnessed in many communities in different areas of the world the adverse effects of international financial fiscal andmonetary policies such as austerity measures, structural adjustment plans, tax dumping among others.The inequities and imbalances of the global economic and financial architecture have proven to be amongthe major obstacles to sustainable development and to impede the full realization of human rights. Even the best national sustainable development programs will not be successful unless such structural obstaclesat the international level are removed. Deep and meaningful reforms of the international financial institutions that are urgently needed to remove these obstacles require holistic and transformativeapproaches to global governance issues. In order to align them with equality, participation, democracy, accountability principles and with human rights standards we are convinced that the right todevelopment perspective should be applied by pursuing and building up and enabling international environment for development of human rights which supports and determines the realization of all human rights andfundamental freedoms for all. In this perspective, APG23 strongly supports the call of the High Commissioner to operate the shift of the economic paradigm of international financial institutions, moving towardsthe human rights economy, prioritizing human environmental rights, ending unfair conditionalitiesand the debt ending, unfair conditionalities and sustainable debt servicing, ensuring adequate fiscal space and establishment of universal social protection floors. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speakerwill be from the Center for Economic and Social Rights. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Madam moderator and the great panelists for their interventions. My question is to Mr. Robert Powell. When isthe IMF going to apply a human rights impact analysis to all its policies and during and exposed human rights impact analysis to ensure that the recommendations, especially fiscal consolidation, increasing VAT orprivatization do not lead to violations of human rights? Thank you very much. Thank you. That was unfortunately the last speaker we were able to accommodate at this session this morning but Delegations inscribed on the list of speakers who could not take the floor during this session will have the possibility to have theirstatements posted on the webpage of this meeting and they are invited to send their statements to the Secretariat by the 25th of January at the email address OHCHR-STGs@UN.org. And I would now like to call on Ms. Sepulveda for leading the final remarks by the panelists who joined us in the room or virtually the floor is yours.Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'm going to revert very quickly to the panelists channeling some of thevery good questions that we have received from the floor. I'm going to start with Professor Gauch and I'mgoing to transmit to her the questions that were raised by Spain, Mexico and UN women. So the question is: How we could better integrate a gender approach in the changes to the international financial architecture? The floor is yours.Thank you. Thank you also for this very interesting discussion and very insightful discussion. I think there are two major points that come out with respect to that specific question about genderthat I would like to highlight. And it comes back to the issue I had raised earlier about the human rights audit. I do believe that the IFIs need auditing and they need stakeholder auditing from all the Member States andcivil society, I think as was also mentioned by the Delegate from Spain. So we really need to submit all ofthe programming, the conditionalities, the agreements and the macro model which underlies that to very specific human rights and gender audits which would ensure that specific conditions attached to loans would not violate the rights particularly of women at the moment. They typically end up doing so. Ithink it was highlighted very well by my fellow panelists. And I think we need to ensure that these conditions cannot be put in place as major requirements for receiving loans. That, e.g. , removal of basic services or cuts in public employment that affect women in particular or higher prices for basic amenities and utilities that impact the ability of women cannot besubstituted by relatively meager amounts of cash transfers which is typically the way that it is operating today in most of the agreements that are signed even in the current year. So I think we need clear gender and human rights auditing of all of the programs and the loans that are offered by the IFIs before they are signed and before they actually are enforced on therecipient countries. If I may, Madeleine, I would like to also just mention one more point that I think was made very compellingly by a number of the Delegates from Venezuela, from Palestine and elsewhere, which is the recognition of the impact of conflict and particularly the impact of conflict on the human rights of women and children. There is, of course, the immediate and terrible impact of violence that we know. But there is also the impact of the destruction of infrastructure and the facilities and thefacilities which has a much longer term impact on human rights. And once again, particularly on women and children. I do believe it is the responsibility of the international community to ensure those human rights. It is not just about, you know, partisan countries coming in to assist with foreign aid. I believe that this is something that the IFIs should factor in in terms of the significant need for financing for reconstruction in post-conflict situations. I think that this is something that the IFIs shouldconsider in their recommendations and the automatic issuance of SDRs and of other forms of financing in post-conflict reconstruction requirements. Thanks. Thank you very much for your response and to bringing the response to other issues that were raised by Distinguished Delegates. Now I'm going to move to Mr. Professor Persaud. Professor Persaud, we heard from severalDelegates how the climate-related crisis have also been damaging their economy. And we heard also this very clearly from the Distinguished Delegate from Barbados. So my question back to you is what measure should international financial sorry, institutions could or shouldshould make at the medium and the long-term to help states in particular developing state and small island state to be able to address the climate crisis? Mr. Persaud, you have the floor. Thank you very much. And I want to welcome that question and all of the comments made by the Distinguished Delegateand Distinguished Representatives. I think you meant the comment specifically from Bahamas as well as others. I think there are three things we need the institutions to do. The 1st is, as Jayati had said, they have become irrelevant in their size and they need to lend three times more than they currently lend with an increased emphasis on resilience and resiliencein a broad sense of the word. When we mean resilience, it is not just about physical resilience against climate change, but it is also about the resilience of our health systems, of our social security systems, of our educational systems. Resilience is as much a systemic issue as it is a physical issue. So I think that's the 1st thing. They need to lend three times more. That needs to be our target. Half of that can come from the way theytreat their existing balance sheets, their existing capital, half. They could lend twice as much as they currently do with their existing money. But they also need to have additional money and they need to have about $10 billion of additional capital per year for ten years and that will allow the Development Banks to triple their lending and to fully finance the gap in resilience. The 2nd thing we need to do, we need the IFIs to dois to play a more active role in catalyzing the flow of private funds for climate mitigation because there is no amount of loss and damage money and resilience that we could ever have if we don'tmitigate the climate. A lot of mitigation makes money. What is resilience and loss and damage doesn't make money. Mitigation, solar farms, wind turbines makes money. We need to get the private sector involved. They are not going to developing countries because of the perceived risks, the excessive risk premiums,excessive because the actual risks turn out to be less than the market pricing of those risks. So we need to find ways through guarantees that reduce these excess risk premiums, unblock the flow of money around the world to really finance the mitigation we need. Let me end by saying twothings, though. There was much criticism of the International Monetary Fund and I am not attached to the International Monetary Fund but I have been a borrower from the IMF. I speak as a borrowingcountry that one has to remember that one goes to the IMF not from voluntary circumstances when a country is essentially bust. When you are essentially bust, if there is no IMF, the conditions are considerablyworse. There is no social expenditure at all. There is a collapse. That doesn't let the IMF off the hook for making sure the design of its policies are much more human rights oriented. In particular, the IMFsays, e.g. , that it believes strongly that the expenditure cuts are much more sustainable than tax increases. That's not proven. That's entirely ideological and philosophical. It is not empirical or proven. It needs to be more imaginative in ways in which it finds the finance. Also, thiswhole very important point raised by my panelists about energy subsidies. Yes, energy subsidies are bad for climate but they are often pro-poor. We need to do this in a much more sensible way. Then the final point I would make which connects with what Jayati and the previous question has said, a lot of publicexpenditure cuts has almost all public expenditure cuts have a huge gender impact. We need to have much more recognition to the audit, yes, but then a response to that, a mitigating response to thatgender impact. Thank you very much for your response. Unfortunately, Mr. Powell is not longer connected but it should not prevent us from having a debate today. I'm going to move to MadameSadun and ask you, Mr. Powell said that the IMF is doing his best to comply with human rights but youraised several important issues in your presentation. There are tensions with that statement. Can you further develop on that? Sure. Thank you very much for the question. I was actually very pleasedto hear Mr. Powell say so concretely that the IMF staff recognize their responsibilities to respect human rights and the role of the human rights in providing a fertile ground for human rights. Asfar as I'm aware, maybe my own ignorance, I haven't actually seen this written in any IMF policy. If we could integrate that idea into the actual policies of the IMF, including the all important need toassess whether IMF advice, conditionalities are actually achieving that goal, I think that would be a very important step forward because as we have discussed what is happening in practice is, forexample, cuts in the majority of loan programs having cuts to public wages including often in social sectors. How is that consistent with human rights? Tax policies often rely on regressive value addedtaxes. How is that consistent with human rights? The way in which the IMF approaches social spendingwhich is completely detached, e.g. , from ILO social protection floors which were agreed by all governments, how is that consistent with human rights? The way the IMF approaches social safety nets or social protection which focus on very narrowly targeted cash transfer programs whereas all peoplehave the right to social security. How is that consistent with human rights? So these would be my questions to him. But I also want, if I can, to take a minute to address some of the comments about Palestine that were made. The 1st report I wrote for human rights watch was called occupation Inc. andI documented how Israeli economic policies were designed to make the Palestinian economy dependent on it and to impoverish Palestinians. Now obviously this is a very extreme case but I think it is animportant reminder that economic policies are choices. They are choices that can impoverish people but there are also choices that can lead to the fulfillment of people's economic and social rights.Thank you. Thank you very much. So I'm going to close this session 1st apologizing to the DistinguishedDelegate of Bahamas for my missaying the country. I think that we have a very, very successful paneltoday. This panel has called us to look at the reform of international financial institutions and from those countries that took the floor today we have a great majority of countries including in the way inwhich they spoke, the EU, Thailand, Brazil, Colombia, Portugal, Ecuador, Malaysia, Spain, Bahamas, Mexico, Venezuela and others that I may have missed in favor of reforming the international financial institutionsand calling for a better human rights approach. So we have to build momentum and I think there is an urgent responsibility and I welcome the commitment of this state to keep on pushing this reformthat now we need to achieve in a very short term. We are a few years at the end of the SDG cycle but we also have a climate emergency upon us. So I really hope that this panel has encouraged, has measuredthe power of all of you and the interest and commitment of several countries to address these issues. It has also been given the floor, put forward by several countries how the climate relatedhumanitarian crisis but also how war is obstructing the compliance of the SDGs but not only that, damagingthe life and livelihood of so many people around the world. But it has also shown us that there are evenmore structural problems to address that are required to fight inequality and I welcome all the participation of all those Distinguished Delegates that put it right on the top of their agenda today, the need ofthis reform. Thank you very much. I pass it to you, Mr. President. Thank you very much for your closing remarks. Just a practical issue in fairness to Mr. Powell. He was supposed to deliver a video statementso I wasn't on Zoom for the questions and answers but I'm sure he would be happy to continue the conversation elsewhere. And that, Excellencies, Distinguished Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, leads us to the end of the 1st part of our meeting and the remaining two sessions will resumeafter the lunch break at 3:00 this afternoon. Thank you all."}
{"title": "", "text": "afternoon. I declare open the 2764th meeting of the 95th session of the Committee on the Rightsof the Child. I warmly welcome the Delegation of Senegal who are here in Geneva for the review of their 6th and 7th combined periodic reports and also for their initial reports under thetwo optional protocols. So today we will be dealing with this afternoon and tomorrow morning we will be dealing with the 6th and 7th reports under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and then tomorrow afternoon we will be dealing with the two optional protocols. But we willask the questions relating to the two optional protocols tomorrow morning so that you have some time to prepare. But for the time being we are going to be focusing on the 6th and 7thperiodic reports. So I would now like to give the floor to the head of Delegation, His Excellencythe Ambassador. I thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, I would like to thank you. I would liketo thank you for this opportunity to discuss with you the 6th to 7th periodic reports of Senegal. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Committee, ladies and gentlemen, members ofcivil society, on behalf of the state of Senegal I would like to 1st off convey my appreciation to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the CRC, for having been so kind as to invitethe government of Senegal to present in this 95th session its combined 6th to 7th periodic reports in one document. This is on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Childand as well as the initial reports on the optional protocols on children in armed conflict and the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. This with the implementationof Article 44 of the Convention of the same name and Articles 12 and 18 of the aforementioned protocols. I would like to also thank the Secretariat of the Committee, thank you foryour commitment and your availability. You undertook regular contact with the permanent mission of Senegal to UNOG. This is a fine opportunity to express a new appreciation for the substantialcontribution of the CRC to the global effort to protect the rights of the child and to offer relevant recommendations and reminders thereof of the common responsibility of states' partiesto continue with the dynamic of bringing positive change to societies. The Delegation that I have with me today includes Mr. Nyandu, the Magistrate Director of Human Rights at the Ministry ofForeign Affairs, Mr. Mam Gordoof, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Women, Family andChildren Protection, Madam Dien Abeh Mbatili, the Ambassador Director of Political Affairs andConsular Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Colonel Usman, the Director of Oversight ofStudies and of Legislation of the Armed Forces, Mr. Gouye, the Director of Promotion of Human Rights and Protection of Children, Madam Kuma, the Director General of the National Agency for Youngand Early Childhood, Mr. Mbapeluam, the Minister Counselor to the Permanent Mission, Mr. Mafalfa,the Magistrate Legal Counselor of the Prime Minister's Office, Mr. Mamsaila, the Technical Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Senegalese Abroad, Madam C.B. Fay, the Technical Counselor andCoordinator of the Gender Cell at the National Education Ministry, Mr. Malik Top, the Head of the Division of Human Rights, Madam Yvonne Gay, the Second Counsel at the Permanent Mission and Mr. Gouye, the First Secretary of the Permanent Mission. As you can see, we have representatives now nationally butalso at our mission that work in the matter of the rights of the children. This is in response to your invitation and so that we can discuss as exhaustively as possible the progress made by Senegal in thesematters. Our country, since its international sovereignty has undertaken many efforts to adoptlegislative and regulatory and institutional measures with the goal of strengthening the protection and promotion of the rights of children. This includes efforts made over recent years to guarantee withoutany discrimination whatsoever the effective enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights of children. As regards judicial matters and social matters for children, Senegalrecently undertook the process nationally of ensuring to protect ensuring the protection of children by creating 24 new educational services and social protection services in the departments that werelacking such services. There is also a new welcome center with four now as the total number of centers that are dedicated to addressing urgency situations. We have also been codifying the protection ofof children that are placed in protection. This was launched in 2023. The committeethat addressed this brings together all relevant ministries that are involved in the protection of children and includes the civil society as well. Through our modernization program of judicial for judicial infrastructure we have educational complexes that are being built in the Dakarand St. Louis areas. These complexes are managed by the Ministry of Justice through the office for the legal protection and social protection, the DPJS. To allow this office, the DPJS, to effectively undertakeits mandate, it is important to underscore that Senegal has recently endowed it with a next genheadquarters. This cost a billion CFA. That's the construction and the finalization of the project. Important efforts have also been taken to provide room and board in these structures. Looking at thehuman strengthening of human resources, our state has recruited 120 specialized educators over the recent two years, 40 per year, three years that is. This is aimed at strengthening the sector further withthe additional hiring of 12 oversight inspectors, educational inspectors. This has allowed for us to have progressive progress by the Ministry of Justice who provides these services, 6,483 childrenwere being cared for in 2018 and this is now 18,000-some children in 2021, 63% are boys, 37% are girls that are benefiting from these programs. These efforts provided by the state have allowed for usto drop the school dropout rates. We have been able to do so in primary school and at the middle school level. Turning to the vulnerability of children, the fight against this, the efforts by the ministryfor children have allowed for numerous areas of progress. This includes the data, this is a term that we will address again and also in the care for children in vulnerable situations in the GINDI centersand this includes the orphans that are in the custody of the different nations. We have alsocared for 194,958 children between 0 and 5 years of age through more than 2323 structures for comprehensive development of children in early childhood. Strengthening our legal and institutional frameworkfor the protection of children, we should note that there has been a series of legislative decrees.They have been taken throughout Senegal. The goal has been to strengthen the care for children,providing them protection from sexual exploitation among other areas. We have also been developingprograms, a draft deinstitutionalization of the national parliament of children. The idea is to improve and strengthen the rights of the child with their participation. Madam Chair, ladies and gentlemen, members of the committee, turning to the care for the healthcare for children,this is a priority for the government. Significant improvements have been made, numerous indicators point at this over recent years. We have also seen a drop in the amount of maternal deaths from 797 in2020 to 717 in 2021. This is a drop of 9.2%. Considerable efforts have been deployed to strengthen nutritional support and early stimulation efforts, numerous follow-up activities and activities aimedat promoting growth in communication have been deployed as well as screening for acute malnutritionand general care for children have been implemented. We have a policy on increasing access to preschool quality services. We have we see that the enrollment of children between 3 and 5 years of age has gonefrom 11.06% to 14.38% between 2021 and 2023. Further, more than 3517 community teachers have beenrecruited to train at the students at the preschool level in the seven regions of the country. Turning to the DARA now, 76 of these schools have signed performance contracts in order to incorporateadditional activities to the Quranic teaching. Oversight by the civil society has also improved with the development or creation of the national civil status agency. Madam Chair, looking at this progressin the different areas of the protection of the rights of children, while far from exhaustive, doyou or rather are targeted at bringing us in to step with this exercise and we it offers us an opportunity again to revisit the challenges that we have despite the significant progress made. Meeting with your committee to address the national report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child and the initial reports on the optional protocols are an important moment for the Government of Senegal. Our goal is to engage with you, the experts, and to conduct as broad and exhaustive andenriching of a dialogue as possible and thus improve the situation of the rights of the child in Senegal.I'm aware of not having covered the entirety of this broad ranging topic, nor have I even covered all of the essential progress that's been made in Senegal. However, our country is busy as it has always beento overcome the challenges and constraints in our irreversible efforts to attain an inclusive society.On behalf of the Delegation, I would like to thank the experts in advance of their statements andI would like to also avail myself of this opportunity to thank you for the attention that you have afforded us. We are all ears. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm now going to give an opportunity to thecoordinator of the task force to say a few opening words and that is Suzanne Aho. Thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you to all of the members of the Delegation and thank you to the headof Delegation for the remarks made and thank you for the comments that you have made. I very much hope that we will be able to hold a rich dialogue, a fruitful dialogue in the interest 1st and foremostof the children. I am going to introduce to you the team that I am coordinating. We have Madame Sophie,Madame Marie Beloff and Mr. Benyam as well and myself as well and Madame Makiko as well and MadameSidiku will also be involved in our work or have been involved in our work. I would like to thank you in advance for being patient in listening to us because we are all here with the same goal, all of us. We willbe able to address this 2nd round here. Thank you very much for being here and I would like to give the floor to Sophie with leave of the Chair. She will be addressing legislation in your country. Thank youvery much. Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon and very warm welcome to the Delegation. I would like tothank the Honorable Head of Delegation for providing us with the introductory information and congratulate the country with the positive steps which have been made for well-being of children but, of course, I willfocus on challenging issues and things which we think might need to be improved. So the 1st and veryimportant point is that since several years there is an ongoing political discourse about the adoption of the Children's Code which was not adopted unfortunately and a lot of provisions need to be brought incompliance with the Convention from family law, criminal code, et cetera. However, to make laws effective it is also very important to establish a clear time plan for its implementation and as well asthe legal mechanisms what are the sanctions and measures if the rules are not respected. And I would like to ask the Delegation to elaborate on those issues. In the State Party report you mentioned thatthere are bills on human trafficking and migrant smuggling which increase strict penalties on perpetrators. Could you update the Committee what is the status quo for those bills? And, of course, ifyou adopt even the best written laws in the world sufficient human and financial resources should be accumulated in order to efficiently implement these laws and if you could please provide us with theinformation how you accumulate the resources for those laws which are already adopted regarding children. Comprehensive policy and strategy. Are there any plans to adopt the 3rd action plan forimplementation of the national child protection strategy after the 2nd one which dates back from 2016-2018? Coordination. Is the national intersectoral child protection Committee as a coordinationbody insured with necessary human and financial resources and is there any effective coordination between national and decentralized level like municipalities 1st of all, of course. Allocation ofresources and budgeting. It is very important that the economy is recovering after COVID-19 and also certain amount of oil and gas has been discovered in your country and it gives us hope that morefinancial budgetary resources will be accumulated for child rights including the social sector which is very important as well. I'm asking because there are some alarming informations showing us that the publicspending on social sector and child rights has been decreased last years and I would like with great pleasure to listen to your answer on that. Is the increase of budget envisaged for vulnerable groupslike girls, Talibs and children with disabilities including for disadvantaged children's program? Is there any plan to set up a budgeting process that includes child rights perspective and which canenable clear allocation of child rights budget and include specific indicators as well as monitoring and evaluation systems? Data collection. What are the characteristics of the basis of which youdisaggregate data relative to children? As far as I have information, the Minister of Women, Family and Child Protection plans to collect data in the sector which can be a 1st step toward creation andnational child protection information management system. Could you please update the Committee on the recent developments in this regard? What is the status quo of this process? How is the state party goingto strengthen the national statistics and demography agency? Of course, 1st of all, regarding child rights and data collection regarding child rights. Independent monitoring. The Senegalese Committeefor Human Rights was downgraded to status B by GA and HRI. In order to ensure the full compliance with the Paris principles, are you going to finalize a new law and ensure its implementation? In this regard,I would like to ask the question about the children's ombudsman. As far as I know, there were some plans about that to establish the children's ombudsman and I would like to ask you to clarify whetherthis process has any follow-up. The next subcluster is child rights and the business sector. Do you consider there is the need to examine and adopt the legislative framework to ensure legal accountabilityof business sector including in tourism, mining and fishing industries? Is there the obligation of companies in place to undertake assessments, consultations and public disclosure of the environmental,health-related and children's rights impacts of their business activities and plans? Is the monitoring of business activities insured by the state, especially to investigate and address child rightsviolations? And what is the actual status quo for the adoption of the tourism code penalizing tourism specific delicts regarding children? This was all from my side for this cluster. Thank you verymuch. Thank you very much. The next speaker is Mary Beloff. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like towelcome the Delegation. I will briefly address you now and then again at the end of the afternoon.Right now my comment or question is as follows. This might seem general and philosophical but it does have concrete implications in the implementation of the Convention because I want to ask about Article 2 onthe definition of the child. It is clear from the reports that you submitted that your country has a political commitment to implementing the Convention and bringing legislation on this point as ourcolleague Sophie has just underscored. However, that isn't happening on the ground. You recognize in the report that you have not been able to adopt laws to do so. So my question again is sort of an umbrellaquestion overarching the other topics that we will be discussing today and tomorrow has to do with whether you can explain to us where the causes are, rather where the difficulties or obstacles are topassing these laws. Are these political obstacles or these deeper cultural obstacles? When one reads the report, one has the impression that to be a child in Senegal has different aspects. For example, if onecompares the labor law with the family code to the difficulties in adopting the children's code, if you look at all of these factors, it leaves us wondering what the strategy is. What are the obstacles 1st of all? Because your commitment is very clear. We see this in the report. However, the results are notattained. Are these obstacles, again, political? If so, the politicians have to resolve them. But if they are cultural, which are more difficult or more complex when it comes to addressing them, what is the strategy that Senegal has when it comes to ensuring that all people up to the age of 18 be treated inthe same manner and be protected or offered the same legal protection as we see enshrined in the convention regardless of what activity they might find themselves, regardless of what social group they might have been born into? I would very much appreciate it if you could enlighten us on where the difficultiesare in Senegal when it comes to making childhood a monolithic reality in Senegal. Thank you very much.Thank you. And the last speaker for this round is Susanna Ho. Okay. So who is it now? Is it Sophie?I have cluster 3 as well and then cluster 5. But I can combine them together. Okay. Good. Okay. Thank you. So my next cluster is the general principles of the convention and firstly the non-discrimination.My 1st question is does the constitution of Senegal explicitly guarantee equality regardless of language, political or other opinion, property, disability and birth status? Is access to justice guaranteed forall children for cases of discrimination and do all children have equal access to healthcare and education in your country? Is the prohibition of discrimination of the base on disability insured especially inschools? What measures are undertaken to combat discrimination in law and in practice of different vulnerable groups of children including girls, LGBTQI children, street children and talibs and othervulnerable groups? Please provide us the information what has been done to raise awareness of the society on discrimination including gender based discrimination. The next very important issue is the best interest ofthe child and I would be very grateful if you could clarify what are the steps done in order to ensure the best interest assessment in Senegal for children. Right to life, survival and development,the infant and child mortality is serious challenge in the country and how you are going to address this issue, what are your next steps, I would like to ask you. Respect for the views of the child,is there any legislation adopted which would ensure the right of the child to be heard enshrined in the Article 12 of the convention and if the answer is positive, please provide the information how it isimplemented and there were several attempts in the past to put the children's Parliament in place and it would be great if you could elaborate on this issue, what is the current process in this regard.The next class I would like to deal with is the violence against children which is a very comprehensivepart for your country. The corporal punishment, please provide the information about the progress made with regards to previous recommendations of the Committee referring to prohibition, corporal punishmentin all settings including at home, data, alternative care, et cetera. Also would you please provideinformation about Article 285 of the family code which confirms right of the person with parental authority to correct the child and whether you have concrete plans to address this concrete specificArticle in the family code. Do you have any programs or mechanisms to promote positive and nonviolent forms of child rearing and discipline? Does the state party arrange awareness raising campaigns forparents and other caregivers as well as professionals working with and for children and wider society to change the attitude and that the corporal punishment is not acceptable? We were alerted that the numbersand cases of corporal punishment is very high in Senegal and this needs to be addressed by comprehensivepolicy. Is there any plan to elaborate the strategy to combat violence against children in all forms in an effective way? And is there any database available specifically for domestic violence against childrenwhich would enable appropriate analysis of the extent causes and nature of such violence and based onthat the state party can combat it effectively based on evidence. In order to ensure that the cases of violence against children are detected it is very important to have accessible confidential and childfriendly mechanisms in place and that the children are informed about that. What are the measures of the government in this regard? How effective and child friendly are investigations and sentencing ofperpetrators for reported cases and is there multi-sectoral and multi-agency approach to ensure the revitalization of the children? Are there sufficient resources ensured for rehabilitationprogrammes for child victims of violence and do you see the need that national child protectionstrategy should be ensured with sufficient human technical and financial resources? Are there any community based and family strengthening programmes to prevent all forms of violence against children including in municipalities? What has been done in order to ensure the mandatory reporting, multi-agencyand multi-sectoral intervention in cases of sexual abuse of children? Is there the legislation in placein line with the Convention guaranteeing that children are protected when they are victims of sexual abuse and not subjected to criminal sanctions? What are the measures regarding the addressing stigmatizationof child victims of sexual abuse including cases of incest? Are there any child friendly and confidential mechanisms to report the cases of child sexual abuse in place? If you could provide us information aboutthe rehabilitation services for child victims of sexual abuse specifically, how you approach this issue and is the reporting investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases insured? It is importantto have child friendly procedures in place in order to avoid revictimization also in this case. Is there any work done in order to raise awareness about child sexual abuse and exploitation amongst professionalsand wider public as well? I unfortunately do not have time to go in details but I would like to ask youto address two last points from myself under the harmful practices which are FGM, the female genital mutilation and the child marriage. Both issues are very challenging as far as I know in your country. Sowhat has been done and what are your plans in this regard? Thank you very much. Thank you. Suzanne.Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chair. I will be turning to civil rights and freedoms. The 1st issuehere is on birth registration. First of all, let me congratulate you because you have had travelinginitiatives that have covered over 50% of children. I would like to know what you have done since. Haveyou continued with these initiatives out in the country, in the interior? Do you also send thedocuments to the local authorities? What is the cost of the registration and what is the cost of that being included on the civil register? Is it free? How does it happen? Do the local populationknow about these mobile court hearings? Are they interested in the registration? How do they goabout getting hold of the birth certificate in these mobile court hearings? Earlier in your introductory remarks you talked about the Dara, the Talibé, the children there. How then do the Talibé children haveaccess to their birth certificates and children who are in the Dara have children being identified who do not have birth certificates and what measures are being taken in that regard? What is the rate ofbirth registration in your country overall and how are you planning to address the issue of thedisparity between rural areas and urban areas? Access to civil registers, is it easy for them to go to the centers where they can register? Do the people, do the population understand the importance of thebirth certificate? If so, what have you done to make them understand that it is important? Turning tocivil status offices, have they been trained? Are they able to manage the records today? Are they given computers and proper equipment? Are they really in a position to be able to support people and helpthem in declaring the birth of their children? On nationality, 1st of all, I would like to ask whether children who are born and who are found abandoned on Senegalese soil, are they given abirth certificate? How do you issue this birth certificate and certificate of nationality for these children, these abandoned children? On nationality, have you carried out studies? Haveyou carried out an assessment to detect the issue of statelessness? How many children are affected by this? What are you planning to do to address the issue of statelessness? I know according to theinformation that I have seen, I think it is around 500,000 children who do not have a nationality.That would entail that they have no birth certificate because that is the cornerstone for them to thenhave access to a nationality. Are the general public aware of the different procedures to file a birthregistration? On the rights of children to private life and protection of image, I don't know whatmeasures you are taking. I know there is a new notion which also exists in the Wolof language. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly. I imagine you are aware of that. I don't know to what extentthat can be applied to children. On the digital environment, the Internet and so on, I have readthat to get rid of children who are bothering the parents, they say go and get your phone, go and play on your iPad or tablet. There is no control over it really. In terms of the government level, do youhave any provisions to regulate that? Do you have anything in place to protect children from seeing harmful images online? Do you have any parental controls in place to protect them? On participationof children, I know that in Senegal, you are quite forward looking on this area, but I wonder whether the children's parliament exists. How does it work or does it not exist at all? And what's the budget?What's its action plan? I believe it's under or what ministry would it fall under? On the role of themedia now, how do the media have watershed in terms of ensuring that children's rights are respected?Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you. Now we have come to the point where we can have a breakso that you can organize the Delegation to be able to prepare your answers. So we will take a 15-minute break and then when we come back, you will begin with answering all of this 1st round of questions. And you will have until 5:30 this afternoon. At 5:30, then we will take the 2ndround of questions so that you have got the evening to prepare for tomorrow. So the room next door tothis one is available to you. And if I can ask you to please be back at 3:55. I will hand the floorto you in order for you to present to us how you are going to answer all of the questions in the 1stround. Thank you very much indeed, Madam Chair. Madam, we have consulted and given that we have allstakeholders present in this Delegation, I do apologize. I am losing my voice actually. I havegot a bit of a coldness actually meaning that I am losing my voice as fast as we speak. So we will respond to the questions ideally in order and I will start by giving the floor to the General Associatefor the Ministry of Women to provide some clarification on the questions raised. Thank you very much,Excellency, Ambassador, Madam Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen, Committee members. Firstly, on pointsrelating to the legal framework and the draft bill and reform on safeguarding children's rights,an issue that was raised by Ms. Sophie, Suzanne and others, the response of the Government is as follows: First of all, we have a legal framework which is extremely protective. The Constitution of Senegalenshrines children's rights therein. Children's rights stand at constitutional level. The preamble of the Constitution expressly refers to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is a comprehensive part of the Constitution. Children's rights are at constitutional level inSenegal. There is a special chapter in the Constitution focusing on human rights with specific provisionson children's education, protection of children, protection and assistance that the state must provide to families to bolster care and assistance provided to children. The same goes for the issueof nondiscrimination. The Constitution of Senegal eradicates all forms of discrimination based ona sex, race, religion and also gives children status therein. We have a legal framework which is very protective of children. We have the family code which includes all elements of protection regardingfamily, birth registration and the civil record and protection from violence. On violence, the criminal code suppresses all forms of violence, physical, sexual and others when it comes to children, particularlywith strong severe punishments. Recently, the law criminalizing rape and pedophilia has criminalized these sexual acts conducted upon children. Our legal framework, as I say, is extremely protectiveof children. We have reforms underway to change this. We need to work with the children's code and thedraft law on the protection of children. Now, the children's code has two advantages. One,we can have in one document all of the provisions. Family code, nationality code, it is a single document. It is very practical for all stakeholders. But the difficulty with the children's code isstrengthen the harmonization with other domestic laws vis-a-vis international instruments. So we want to bring together all of the principles for the rights of the children put together, both in this text and in the constitution where this is an issue of nondiscrimination, the best interest of the childrenand participation as well. There are specific provisions. And this guides all of our decisions.And that's what guides our work. So this code has some constraints, but they are not political because the government is constantly committed to strengthening the legal framework and strengthen the protectionof children at the highest level. The heads of state, the head of state is the number one defender of children. And then in addition to the text, there are plans like the emerging Senegal. So from a social cultural point of view, that's where we see some obstacles. And the rapporteur was right to mentionthis in the code for children. There can be reforms in which the perspective can be out of phase with social cultural values. And so the government should is working to strengthen dialogue to develop strongconsensus around the text so that after the adoption, that text will be fully implemented. That is whatis taking time. But on the technical level, the work is done. So we do need to strengthen this document with the communities, with the religious stakeholders, the cultural stakeholders so that there is a strongconsensus that allows for them to make it their own and to properly implement the text. So the few provisions that go against the spirit or text of the Convention are subject to discussion and effortsto protect are for the most part realized. So we held the recognition of the Committee of our efforts. Theplace of children is fully born in mind on the community level and at all levels. Just in schools, we have more than 1,000 school governments with the governments led by the children, that is. And it allows thechildren throughout the school year to weigh out on these matters. We have community participation systems as well. Boys clubs, girls clubs, children's clubs. So there is a good, strong dynamic for the effective participation of children in communities and the institutions and on the local level. So theidea is to make this there is a children's parliament and they have done a great deal. But the mission of the government right now is to make this nationwide. They would consolidate the community efforts andthe efforts made by the citizens nationally through this decree. The ideas, the decree, work on the decree is stabilizing or working for it to be adopted as quickly as possible. But beyond the text, it isto mobilize all resources necessary in order to support the youth parliament nationally and internationally. That is one of the recommendations that we have seen. And we don't want this just to be a framework forchildren, but we need to ensure that there is participation, that this brings participation in the neighborhoods, in the region nationally with its own budget, a significant budget. Andthe government is mobilizing its partners and partnerships in order to make this a reality beyond the mere text. Now, the 3rd national plan of action and the governance and coordination, the governmenthas done a great deal to strengthen coordination for the protection of children. This is a cross-cutting issue. And that's why we have this committee, the interministerial, intersectorial committee on theprotection of children presided over by the Prime Minister. This mechanism comes through the nationalreference point for the protection of children. And since 2013, we have been working on this inclusive framework to involve all stakeholders, including civil society. We have the Prime Minister at thetop. So we need to strengthen the resources, but the issue is cross-cutting in all relevant ministries. They provide technical and financial support to the protection of children. And this is very important.We have just undertaken the evaluation of this strategy. The final report will be officially launchedin the 1st quarter of this year. And this shows the important efforts undertaken on coordination. This includes all partner development partners, civil society, all stakeholders. The mechanismalso has community presence in the 46 departments of Senegal, where there is a department for the protection of children. There are hundreds of community bodies as well. And in these committees, we have the municipalauthorities and all the other stakeholders as well. So there is coordination aimed at strengthening these efforts. And this will show up in the evaluation. Now, lastly, on resources, the statehas regularly and significantly increased the budget allocated to the protection of children. Today,the protection of children is at the heart of our national emerging Senegal plan and in all three pillars. Before, we had it under human capital. But today, children are to be found in all pillars,so that there are institutions that are adapted to children and accessible at all levels. And then we also have a pillar on law, peace, and security. And that also focuses on the protection of children. They are at the center of public policy. And the state mobilizes resources throughout all departments.And in our ministries today, the state has a program budget approach, whether it is the justice ministry or another ministry, we have a specific program for the protection of children. The ministry of women,we also have a special children's program. And it looks at the whole cycle of life from early childhood through all issues, prevention against violence, et cetera. This program mobilizes 10 billion per yearin our ministry. Nationally, these are significant resources that are mobilized with the support of our partners, UNICEF in particular from the UN, but also contributions from civil society and our international bilateral cooperation. What we have seen is that we must invest increasingly in thechildren and in particular in early childhood. That's the reason for which the state has launched with the support of the World Bank a program that is a very important investment in early years of thechildren, some 42 billion CFA in nutrition, civil status, and also early childhood stimulation. Now, there is also the draft law on the defense of children. I failed to mention that earlier. Thisdraft also exists, this text. The idea is to strengthen oversight of the implementation of policy, but also to provide support in providing specific support for children. So this has been technically validated,the project, the Supreme Court as well. So in the agenda reform, this draft will be given priority.There will be two options, either to put it within the children's code with its own chapter, and if the consensus is to not keep it in the global children's code, it can continue to make its way throughCongress independently. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. The 1st responses I can provide, I thank you kindly.Mr. Duf, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Women, Families, and the Protection of Children.Thank you. I would like to mention to Madame Beloff, yes, indeed, she had spoken of difficulties and obstacles. As the Secretary General has said, the political will is there. However, all courts, allcodes in Senegal have been based on dialogue, including the family code, based on social, cultural, and religious realities. So the government has opted for dialogue to ensure that the text, the instrumentsare consensus-based that will facilitate the implementation. And that might make negotiations, because there are negotiations. We have to convince as many as possible. We have to convince all stakeholdersthat we need to be moving towards the same goal. So the political will is there. In our opinion, we are making progress in the right direction. I would like to also note the presence of the Senegalese Committeeon Human Rights. We work together with them closely. I would like to give the floor, if I might, to the Director of Human Rights, Mr. Nyandu. Thank you, Your Excellency. Head of Delegation, thank you. Since you have justnoted the presence of the President of the National Institute for Human Rights, the NHRI, the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights, I would be more than happy to respond to the questions that were asked regardingwhat the state of Senegal has done to ensure the respect for the Paris principles in this institution. Yes, indeed, the government is committed to a process of regaining status A, not just that, but alsothe idea is to make sure the operations in the NHRI are Paris principles conformant,conforming, that is, and since April last, if I'm correct, much work has been done. The Senegalese government has received a draft law. It was drafted by the NHRI itself. They submitted it to thegovernment itself. They submitted it to the government and since then there have been a great many meetings organized with the NHRI, members of civil society, the government. We have worked together. We createda Committee to work on this draft law. I would like to express my thanks to this process. We have been able to adopt this draft law. I think that was in December. And in our Council of Ministers,that is the last step that we need to have this law in place. That will be sent to Parliament. In addition to the adoption in the Council of Ministers, we have continued to work with the stakeholders. Thegovernment of Senegal has worked closely with the NHRI advocacy in the they have undertaken advocacy efforts in the national parliament so that as soon as possible we can see the adoption of the new lawon the NHRI. We have in the end been very concerned with the return for the NHRI to status A. Thegovernment of Senegal has been very determined even before this draft law that we think will be adopted soon, the government deployed a great many efforts. The government has strengthened the resources ofthat body, providing that body a more or less functional headquarters but also we have been working with members of the National Human Rights Committee of Senegal so that there is consensus for the law to be adopted. These are some of the efforts deployed by the government of Senegal andwe very much hope that the draft law that will perhaps allow for us to return to status A because, again, this is a draft law that was drafted by the NHRI itself and I think that the government of Senegalhas maintained course on this. So the budget has also been strengthened and today we are hoping thatthat will continue. This institution in Senegal, we believe it is a fundamental structure in the protection and promotion of human rights. It is for that reason that Senegal I believe is one of the 1st Africancountries that has been able to put such a body on its feet. I think this is a body that is also one ofthe 1st to be governed by its own law. There was another question that was asked on the roamingcourt rooms. How do these work in Senegal? So these roaming courts, I would it is the head of the courtsthat was looking at that and running that. The government of Senegal has been able to work with the population through birth certificates has worked on budgets each year. There is a Ministry of Justiceoffice that coordinates all of these issues. That's the office of criminal affairs andcivil affairs. They are in contact with all of the trial court presidents. They do so in order to schedulethese roaming courts with specific budgets. When we receive instructions from the Ministry of Justicefor a given period for the roaming courts, those roaming courts are scheduled in and this is in rural areas that they do their work. Before that happens, the presidents of the different jurisdictions that are responsible for organizing these roaming courts are in contact with municipal leaders,the mayors because that's where the civil status records are. So they undertake this entire process in consultation with the mayoralties. But what's important is that before that, there is an outreachcampaign that is undertaken in local areas so the entirety of the population is aware of the presencein the future of a roaming court and when this happens, the population make use of this and it's at the end of that roaming court that the files are sent directly to the civil records department.So it's the president's courts with their teams that work with the roaming court's teams and they receive the files that are included directly in the civil records department. So the presidents ofthe tribunals take these files, they hand down rulings on birth, et cetera, and they transmit that information to the mayors because the mayors in a given morality can do the make sure the work isdone for birth registration. Then the files are signed and approved and the issuance of birth certificates are issued. I want to also underscore that this is these services are free of charge. There is nothingthat's requested financially from these populations that benefit from these roaming services. Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Excellency. Thank you, Mr. Ngandu, magistrate director of human rights in theministry of justice. I'm going to give the floor to our colleague that is a special counselor to the prime minister's office. I would like to thank you very much. Thank you, Your Excellencies, Mr. Ambassador.I would like to also thank the chair. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to the members of the Secretariat. Thank you to all of the committee members as well. Thank you for the kind words that you've had for Senegal and thank you for the kind words you've had for the Delegation. A question from MadamSophie has been asked on the fundamental guarantees in the Senegalese constitution on equality, discrimination,access to schools, et cetera. These items are all mentioned in the Senegalese constitution. I would like, if I might, to react by saying that, yes, our constitution does provide core responses, clearresponses to all of these questions. Article 7 of our constitution lays the groundwork for the guarantee of fundamental freedoms for all of our citizens. Article 7 in its current wording sets forth thathumans are sacred and viable and the state has the obligation of respecting individuals and protecting these individuals. All individuals have the right to life, freedom, safety and security and developmentof their personality, their physical safety and the protection from all mutilation, physical mutilation, that is. In Senegal, there are no privileges for those born in certain families orcertain social strata. If you look at Article 18 of the constitution, 18, 21 and 22, we see that thistext is, they are aiming to address children. Article 18 says forced marriage is a violation of individualfreedoms. It is forbidden and it is punished in conditions as set forth by law. Article 20 indicatesthat the parents have the natural right and the duty of supporting their children and they are supportedin this task by the local community and the government. The youth are protected by the state andthe public sector from exploitation, drugs, controlled substances and moral abandonment and crime. Article22 addresses children specifically, that is to say of our constitution. Article 21 sets forth very clearlythat the state and public bodies must create the preconditions necessary to guarantee education forchildren. Article 22 sets forth that the state has the charge and duty of providing education and trainingof our youth through our public school system. All children, boys and girls alike,throughout the entirety of our national territory have the right to attending school. The institutions and the religious communities and institutions are also recognized as taking part in the educationalsystem. Article 22 of the constitution sets forth that all national institutions, public or private, havethe right, have the duty to build literacy for children in their national language. Thank you forthis opportunity, Madame Sophie, to underscore the fundamental rights afforded children in the area of many of the laws that are set forth in the constitution of Senegal. Thank you very much. I would like to givethe floor to Mr. Konilba from the Armed Forces. He will be providing additional information. Thank you,thank you, Ambassador. I would be focusing on two aspects in particular. First, the rights of children in the private sector, the business sector and especially the protection of children when it comesto tourism. Here we do need to say that Senegal has a very protective legal framework when it comes tolabor rights. In particular, in the child labor sector, all of those that are working in the sector,in the formal sector, are adults. There are regular labor inspections undertaken. There is alsoa presence of security forces and I am referring specifically to the entirety of the mining sector. All those working in the sector are adults and there are regular labor inspections undertaken. Now, as regardsthe protection of children in the tourism industry, we must say here that the state also works hard to ensure the rights and protection of children, particularly to avoid sexual exploitation of thechildren. And we must say that Senegal has had, for a relatively long amount of time now, special or specific tourist police. This was a novelty because it had been the police, the normal police thatundertook such efforts but now there is a tourism police that looks at these issues in particular,ensuring that there is no sexual exploitation of children. Again, special tourist police, they have been put together and they are working in particular in the seaside resorts in the south. These are areaswhere tourists come for their seaside vacations. And that helps to ensure the protection of children. Wecan say also that whether it is in the tourism sector or the private sector, the government has very much worked to ensure the protection of children therein. Thank you. I would like to take the floor nowfor more responses to Madam Marisa Bifait, the technical coordinator in our national education system and Madam Munassis Ahuma from the national agency for early childhood and Mr. Iberra Maki, the directorfor the promotion of the rights of children. Madam, the floor is yours. Thank you kindly. With your leave,then, we will be responding to the questions on the increase in the budget. We should recall that the budget has been increased meaningfully and exponentially since 2012 and that's in our programbudgets. Specific funds are being allocated to programs for children on the whole and the protection of children specifically. I might note that in the ministry of national education, we have a programfor primary education, preschool education, secondary education and also in our literacy program, there are efforts in the DARA as well with the new DARA leadership and also in the ministry of thefamily. I believe that this is the case as well. We should recall that these efforts have yielded a great many results including the promotion of education for girls during parity at all levels. The stats are pointing at this. There is also the promotion of inclusive education. There is a policydocument that is being drafted on this as we speak. And I should like to recall or note a strong measure taken by the head of state when meeting with the DARA community. The idea is to grant funds to localcommunities that are allocated to communities specifically set aside earmarked for the DARA so that the DARA can have access to resources in the most decentralized manner possible as the localcommunities are working directly with these groups. To wrap up, Mr. Head of Delegation, I should notealso that Senegal has undertaken efforts to protect children in bearing in mind the concerns expressed and creating spaces specifically to ensure the effective protection of the rights of children. Ithank you kindly. Thank you very much, Excellency. Let me just come back on what's being done to reducechild mortality. Senegal has strengthened holistic comprehensive care for mothers and children taking into account vital practices when it comes to healthcare and nutrition. Firstly, by promotingparticipatory inclusive governance of integrated early childhood development centers together with collaboration with health centers and the promotion of school canteens. We have also conducted activitiesto contribute to improving the general state of health and well-being of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers as well as that of children under 6 to ensure promotion and development of a system thatis in solidarity around the child from conception through to the age of 6. There is a real framework. There is medical support, nutritional support, educational and financial support available so as to create the required conditions to ensure that the mothers and children are properly taken care of.We have also promoted a community-based approach in terms of health and hygiene practices, in terms of conception of fruit and vegetables of young children as well as health and nutrition support. This isfrom three years and all of this goes hand in hand with strengthening and protecting women in Senegal as well. This is served to cut and reduce the child mortality rate across the board. Thank you.Thank you very much, Your Excellency, for giving me the floor to answer two questions. Firstly,on the existence of services to take care of children victims of violence or sexual abuse and early warning systems, I should tell you that we do have a free telephone number within the Ministry of Women,Family and Child Protection. This is the number 116 which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.This receives all forms of complaints about violence that have been suffered by children.This free hotline helps us to collect information regarding this violence but it also means that we can refer the children to social services and social worker teams who can perhaps refer the children toother structures and the relevant judicial structures and health structures as well. As part of theprotection unit for children, there is also an online platform in Wolof. It is a Wolof word. If youtranslated it to French, it would mean something like report it. So there is a website where abuse can be documented, sexual abuse, children can report it. So you have the two platforms which do work. They areunder the Ministry of Women and they mean that children can report complaints of sexual violence or abuse. The 2nd question I wanted to answer relates to the dissemination of the SNPE, that's thenational strategy on child protection. Within the Ministry of Women and Family, we have often runfocused days, e.g. , during the African week of children and the CRC anniversary and so on. We havethese dedicated days at national level on the rights of the child. We have had a different media on thisalso designed across the country and recently we have had posters that have been translated into four national languages, in particular, Wolof, Serer, Tukola and Jawala. These are national languages andwe have had that information translated into those languages. That's what I wanted to add. Thank you.Thank you. I just wanted to give the floor back to Mr. Tom for a response on statelessness. Thank you, sir.On statelessness, there was one specific question asked and I just took this opportunity to say that this is a concern which has always been at the heart of the Government of Senegal since 2013.We exceeded to the Abidjan declaration on statelessness in West Africa and there have been very many measures taken since that time and Senegal has taken legislative, key legislative measures in 2022 by adopting lawnumber 2022, 1 for the 14th of April, 2022 and this was promulgated on the 14th of April, 2022 and itfocuses on refugee status and statelessness. This is a general law, so it covers issues of refugees, whether they be adults or children and it also covers the issue of statelessness. In this law, Article 102 stipulates that a child without a legal representative on the territory of Senegalwho requests the benefit of the status of refugee or stateless is considered to be a child in danger and consequently may benefit from educational assistance enshrined in the criminal procedurecode of Senegal. So that is one very important measure that we have taken to ensure that care is provided to children who are in situations of statelessness or who are about to become stateless.Article 9, the same law stipulates that this child has the right to be protected under the nationalconstitution on national agreement on statelessness. Now, there is protection provided then in the form of a commission on refugees and statelessness when somebody is in such a situation, they can turn tothe national commission and the law also gives the legal possibility of when somebody is a refugee orstateless person that if they would like to enjoy their rights, they can address this commissionwhich can do something on the administrative level and if not, then they can go to the Senegalese courts to have their situation regularized. So access to judges when it comes to refugees and statelesspersons is guaranteed by this legislation and I think that's something fundamental because when it comes to fundamental human rights, we say where human rights are, there needs to be action to enforcethat. So on that point, we should also note that Senegal does have a national strategy to combat, a national plan of action to eradicate statelessness which runs from 2022 to 2024 and Senegal has takenfull account of the risk of statelessness. On the draft children's code that we touched upon earlier, there has been some explanation given then on the delay as the Committee views it. The issue is alsotaking care of by this draft children's code. So these are efforts that the Committee should be aware of so that you know that Senegal is sensitive to these issues, is aware of them and is continuing to take suitable measures on the legislative and institutional administrative as well as judiciallevels. These will enable us to effectively contribute to the process of combating statelessness across the world. Thank you. Thank you, Director. Do any members of the Delegation, Madame, you have thefloor. Thank you. I just wanted to share some data which incorporates this reduction in child mortality in 2005. We were talking about 61 deaths per 1,000 births today in 2020 or 2023. We are talking about31 per 1,000 births. So this is just to show that Senegal is definitely on the downwards slide there in terms of cutting child mortality. Thank you. Let me give the floor to the Secretary General forcertain clarifications on civil status. Thank you. On civil status, our Human Rights Director recalledthe very favorable legal framework we have for civil status with the principle of this being free,but even better than this being free, but even better than that, Senegal has undertaken an irrevocable approach in terms of trying to have all births registered in terms of civil status. We have arevolutionary program called NECL in what it means exists, you exist, just to stress the importance of identity and having these documents. This program is being strongly supported by a million Europeanpartners and the idea is that it will strengthen awareness raising campaigns across the entire country. We have recently had real key events in terms of raising awareness among society and theinvolvement of all different stakeholders. In terms of this program, in addition to the mobile court hearings which are regularly held, they are really regular, these traveling courts, we have also hadtraining for officials, systematic training for community leaders as well, village leaders, as wellas the different legal, different levels of community leaders and the local leaders also have received training and they, the state has also sought to digitize the birth registration and that is reallythe last sort of step to ensure that we have an integrated approach to ensure that there is universal registration of all children in the civil registry. We are talking now about 75% at national level,with some maximums of 90% in some regions and the minimum level is around 60 or 70%. There is some disparity. This is linked to the fact that sometimes people have to travel to the interior of thecountry or to the capital and sometimes they are still not aware of the importance of this document. That's why we do have these systematic campaigns but also in the adaptive strategies, the state isensuring that the services are there and they are available to the community. There is also a point of making sure that the services are integrated so you have that, as soon as women give birth, thechild will be registered straight away before they even leave the hospital. This is really the approach that we are trying to take. It is really important and it is really going to help us strengthen birthregistration and improve it across the board. Thank you, Your Excellency. Thank you. Let me give thefloor to the Director of Legal Affairs now. I think I just wanted to add in by providing some data on civil status, in addition to the digitalization that we are moving towards, in 2023 there was trainingof 2,800 officials, 613 civil status officials and 613 archivists. So just to show you that we have really focused on training officials who have to deal with the data and who have to assist with birthregistration in Senegal. Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Chairperson, the issue of the cross-cuttingissue and as you have seen we haven't necessarily followed the exact order of the questions as they were put by the different experts but our Delegations, our Delegates will take the floor. Somebody might be responsible for different sectors altogether. So these are the responses that we would have. Ithink we are quite ahead of things in terms of time. I just wanted to say that for the children's code,as we have said, this is a process that is ongoing. Sophie asked if we had a clear deadline and a clear timetable but you will understand, Madam Chair, that given that everything that we have said regarding the discussion process, the consultation process, which is very slow and lengthy, it is difficultto get an exact idea at what date or when that will come to an end. But it is true that the will to do it is there and we do hope that in the very near future we will be able to finalizethis children's code. In terms of the decentralization element, I think we have given information regarding what is happening at the national and local level. There is a real synergy to ensure that children'srights are taken into account comprehensively and holistically. In terms of data disaggregation as well, there was another question asked, how do we ensure that we bolster national statistics collection?The agency is doing an excellent job but we must confess that when it comes to data disaggregation, there are additional efforts that we need to make to have more reliable, accurate statistics. We are working on that and I am sure that in the future we will have more specific, reliable, accurate dataon children on the tourism code. Our experts have also given some elements of a responseto say that violations of this are not tolerated in any way. Awareness raising, we believe the best form of awareness raising is what we are doing already, which is the text in terms of the sanctions, thedifferent punishments in terms of pedophilia and so on. This is now criminalized and so we need to have awareness raising on that and that goes directly to any potential offenders. In terms of discriminationbased on disability, I think there was a question on that one. In Senegal, at national level and local level, there is a program on equal opportunities in Senegal. This is for those living with disabilitiesand also pertains to children with disabilities, particularly those who are in specialized centersand we can give you more information on that if the Committee is interested. Now, in terms of gender based discrimination, this is something that we address very harshly indeed. Senegal is part of a group of countrieswhere in the National Assembly we have parity in terms of number of men and women in the Parliamentand this also speaks to the process of appointing Parliamentarians and, of course, that trickles down to schooling and to ensure that girls do attend school. That's something that is taking off.Regarding now violence against children, as I said, provisions are being drafted and measures are being taken. Our services are vigilant. There are numbers, hotlines to flag abuse and state services anddepartments are stand ready when necessary to intervene and to make available to the judiciary individuals who, you know, offenders and the punishments thereof are rather severe. That waseverything we wanted to say by way of answers so far, Madam Chair. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well,I have two speakers who have already asked for the floor. The 1st is Hind Ayubi Idrissi and the 2nd is Suzanne Aho. So Hind. Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson and my thanks to the Delegation ofSenegal. It's a real pleasure to see the Delegation here in presenting their report. I thank you for the information that you have provided so far with us and I would like just to come back to a numberof issues. We know that the Senegalese Constitution recognizes the primacy of international treaties and so my question is whether the Convention on the Rights of the Child can be directly invoked beforecourts. If so, can you tell us, can you give us examples or does it really need to be translated through harmonization of national legislation? That's my 1st question. I also have a questionregarding coordination. You have told us about the fact that there are various coordination mechanisms in existence, namely the international ministerial commission for the protection of children. So whatresources are made available to this commission for it to really play its coordinating, cross-cutting coordinating role in terms of the Convention and the optional protocols? I'm also thinking aboutthe strategy. You have had a strategy that's been in place since 2013 but there was no longer a relevant plan of action. The last one was adopted in 2018 and here you have started planning things again butthis is based on an assessment, was this based on an assessment of the strategies to see where the problem areas lie. Can you inform the Committee about the results of this assessment? What arethe main choke points that have been identified to inform the next plan? I also have a question about accessibility for children to complaints mechanisms. We know that the current NHRI does not have anythingspecific for the rights of the child. However, the media, the Ombudsman, which has been an institution since 1999, there is a focal point there which deals with children's rights. So what is the action of themedia? Are they accessible? Can children file complaints? If they are told of violations of child rights, can they bring cases? And what information can you give us about access to childrento complaints and effective mechanisms which are confidential? I also have a brief question but here I share your concern as well. I mean, I understand your concern fully. This is the issue of the children'scode. It is true you have had a great deal of consultations. We are trying, you are trying to make progress but we know that they are always resisting forces. My question is whether you have had any public consultation. Have there been any broad reaching public consultations launched in recentyears? If so, what is the result of these public consultations? You also say that you are trying to move forward in adopting the children's code by taking into consideration this is certainly societyand I fully agree and social norms but are these social norms considered also at the same time as respecting the spirit and provisions of the Convention? Let me give you an example. Often in our societiesand our families when we say yes, the role of the child, the child's views but there is the daily reality. How is the child's, how are the child's views taken into account really? The evolutivecapacity of the child, how is that taking account of? In our families, do our families really support the children so that they can properly enjoy their rights like as is stipulated in Article 5 of ourConvention and so on? These are really fundamental issues to ensure effective implementation of the Convention. So what is being done to support this understanding because it is not easy, it is not,the understanding is not easy, it is not homogeneous everywhere and we do have to take into accountthese different areas and thank you very much in advance. Thank you, Madame Chair. My thanks tothe Delegation for their responses. I would like to just come back to birth registration.You said that you have the principle of free birth registration. So declaring a child's birth is free but is the actual certificate itself, is that free? Is the transcription, is that free? I know it issomething like 5,500 francs to have an affidavit or if you say it is free but I would really like to know if the actual papers are free. The process you described, when does the family actually receivethe birth certificate? Are there birth certificates that are not collected? If so, what do you do when that is the case? How do families know that they have a birth certificate that is ready? Whether you aretalking about the physical document or the supplementary judgment and also I asked a question about the Talibé, the children in the Dara, the Granite schools, is there a mechanism to declare them,to register them? I also asked a question about children and the digital environment which you haven't touched upon at all. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Quite a few speakers have asked forthe floor. So I am going to just list the names and then I will take you one by one. So 1st I have Benoit van Keersbilk, Sophie Kiladze, Philip Jaffe, Mary Beloff. Did I miss anyone that wantedto take the floor? Benoit van Keersbilk. Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. My congratulations to the Delegation of Senegal. It is a real pleasure to have this discussion with you this afternoon.I am just going to focus for now on one issue that particularly struck my interest. I think it was the Director General who spoke about access to a judge and you said quite correctly that access to a judgeis fundamental to ensure implementation of rights. I think we all agree on that. And you also mentioned the fact, if I understood properly, that in terms of statelessness you recognize the possibility for the child to act and to come before the judge themselves to address the judge and to file theirdocument or to approach the judge. For example, let me take the example of a child that doesn't have a birth certificate or hasn't been declared at birth. If their parents or other adults do not undertakethat step, can the child themselves go to the judge individually to request documents or to address the court to have recognition of nationality? Very often we find that it is an adult who has to havethe child's rights recognized and we know that there are additional obstacles to that if the adult doesn't for whatever reason do that. Thank you very much for any clarification you might provide there.Thank you, Chair. I would like to thank the Delegation for providing your answers on our questions.But I just would like to ask you to provide more information. You have mentioned that you have somemechanisms for the cases of child abuse and violence against children, but could you clarify a little bit how the interagency and multisectorial involvement works in this case? What are the referral proceduresin case when the violence against child cases reported, what are you doing in order to mobilize all the relevant state agencies for this case? This is one point. Also I have mentioned briefly the FGM andchild marriage issues, but I thought I didn't have time, so I will use this opportunity to address these issues a little bit in depth. Of course, certainly it is very important that you have alreadyadopted the action plan 2021/2026 with the goal of completely eliminating FGM which is a vastly huge issue in your country. But another very important point is whether you have sufficient resourcesaccumulated for the implementation of this action plan, if you could provide information about that.And also as far as I have learned from different resources, there is a very high number even of women who justify the FGM. So what are the measures undertaken by the state party in order to raiseawareness of those parts of population which justify even the women once again?Also about the child marriage, I see according to some surveys the figures are really very high because 32% of women aged 20 to 49 were in their 1st union before the age of 18 and even around 9% before theage of 15 which is very unfortunate. But what are the measures you undertake in order to decrease thisvery high number of child marriage? And also you have, e.g. , some exceptions for girls especially, for girls which allow in certain cases the child marriage. And if you would like to explainwhat are you going to undertake in this regard that 18 is for girls and boys equally without any exceptions in this case which is absolutely in line with the Convention. So these were the questions from myside for this follow-up. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. And good day to the Delegation as well.I was going to address the exact same thing as from our colleague on the children's code but perhaps even more specifically it has been six or seven years that I have been talking about this code which is beingworked on without there being concrete information on the progress being made on the schedule and timing for this. And I would like to challenge the Delegation to provide additional concrete informationon this draft law which, of course, affects practically the half of your population. My 2nd point is that of corporal punishment. We do know that this is an endemic practice in Senegal.I would like to know with more details what significant project or program you have envisagedto provide greater protection to Senegalese children in their daily life. Corporal punishmentis to be found in the daily life of children. It is an attack on their dignity as defined on numerous occasions. I thank you very much for your I thank you in advance for your responses tothese questions. Thank you. Between us as colleagues we have shared concerns, specifically over thechildren's code. And I did want to add something to our concerns on this topic. In step with the report presented by the country, the draft instrument that is being discussed dates back to 2018. The Ministertells us that it is important, of course, to bring together all governing laws and regulations into one law. But at the same time he indicates to us with a great deal of lucidity the difficulties that acountry has when they adopt a law that are not in step with certain values or social practices. So what is necessary to allow for that consensus to arise? My colleagues, Mr. Jaffe and our colleaguehint has made they have made a comment and I would like to join them in saying that we are not clear what the content is that you think or what steps would resolve this tension between the social andcultural values of the country and the mandate and the Convention. We do not see with great clarityhow bringing together all legislation in one text would harmonize this tensionand ensure the respect and protection of all rights for all children in Senegal. So that's the 1st issue now for me and the 2nd before I wrap up, Madam Chair, is that you also noted and we thank you forthe information. Many have noted the efforts made by the country and the difficulties that you face when it comes to statistics. We all know that if we don't have specific precise statistics it is difficultto have effective public policy. I'm getting ahead of myself now with what I'm going to mention later because the Minister mentioned this. If you look at all of the statistical references linked to children,street children and the Talibet children between paragraphs 308 to 373 within the country in the report in just one page do we see statistics we see in one page we see differences in the statistics. Thisis probably owed to we are speculating here to the organizational aspect of having different agencies reporting on the same items. You have expressed this but in the same page here again on the sametopic we have different data on the same topic. So I was wondering if we can undertake an effort among all of us to find out how this can be resolved, the statistical issue. You mentioned it. You mentionedit as being very important for the country and its policies aimed at supporting children. Thank you very much. Thank you. So Your Excellency, as you see there are quite a lot of follow-up questions fromthe members. So now you can use the next 25 minutes to answer these questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'mgoing to give the floor to the Delegation. My voice is a bit rough. I apologize. But before handing thefloor to my colleagues, I did want to respond to Mr. Jaffe. We don't have more information, to be honest. This is workthat's underway. We do again require a great deal of agreement between different parties and we are not there yet. So it wouldn't be advisable for the government to implement the law or that doesn't have agreement becausethen it wouldn't be effective. So since this affects things in different areas, health, et cetera, everyone does need to be on board. And we will get there. But today we cannot give you a specific date on when that children's codewill be ready. Honestly, we can't do that today. As regards corporal punishment, which you had mentioned as an endemic practice, I'm not sure what statistic that's based on saying that it's an endemic practice. For us, we don't see it that way. InSenegal, children are considered to be protected. All provisions of the protection of children have been recalled here. And it is also set forth that children are under the responsibility of their parents that will ensure their education. And that's the case aroundthe world. Raising children, yes, there might be differences in what methods to use in Latin America or in Africa. These are social cultural practices that are anchored in society. But at any rate, the children do benefit from full protection in Senegal fromThere are deterrence sanctions, very severe ones as regards inappropriate practices being brought to bear on children. Even if currentlythe children's code is not in place, there are many measures that exist in the criminal code and throughout our legislationregulations that do ensure that children are protected. Turning to the issue of statistics, Madame Bedoff, this is a problem. There is aproblem with the reliability of reliable statistics. But I did mention in my introductory remarks that the statistics agency is doing extraordinary work. But to break them down, there is still work to be done. Indeed, we will need to verify this data.Perhaps tomorrow we can look back or we can have a response on the discrepancies that you found between data in one section of our report. I would like to give the floor to the Secretary General for additional clarification. I thank you. I thank your Excellency, Ambassador. Thank you all again to the committee experts. Thank you for this cluster of questions. On the national status for theprotection of children, the next step, well, the content of our evaluation allows us a great opportunity because this gives us a snapshot of the situation of children in Senegal. The main challenges that we have noted have to do with the importance of disseminating the rights of the children and raising awareness among the population regarding the importance of the protection of children.That is one of the major foci of our strategy, true communication, true outreach to change behaviors in the communities. We need to invest more in that. There is also a challenge in coordinating efforts. There are enormous efforts being deployed at all levels but to strengthen coordination, particularly as regards the functionality of the national commission for children, this isnecessary. We need to have regular meetings. But we do have budgets aimed from the ministries at certain sectors. So the national mechanisms, national insurance coordination and oversight and we are seeking and we are seeking to have a comprehensiveintegrated oversight system so that we can truly see the progress being made in the sector. The evaluation has shown that we did not have a frame of reference, a performance metric. It's difficult to evaluate progress. However, there are efforts in all areas that are being consolidated nationally on specific topics. In the light of these challenges and our financingshortfalls. We have been, the state has been financing but it is still, it is to be bolstered and that is the intention of the President of the Republic and there are recommendationsbeing made that to, that are aimed at putting forth 3% of the budget for children. The other major challenge has to do with emerging problems, online protection, the protection of childrenand also in the context of climate change. These are new dynamics that we have to bear in mind and this needs to be, and this is being addressed by evaluation. Now, there are strong recommendationsand among them there is a section on the draft law and the stakeholders are aware of this. We need to strengthen dialogue. There is a good proposal from Madame Ayubap, that is to saythat we need to undertake popular consultations. We have met with different sectors, the deputies, the elected officials, those stakeholders in the protection of children but community ingeneral have their contribution to make. So it is not enough to say that we will harmonize and harmonize and harmonize but we need to include the communities. There is a great deal of protectionin the constitution and in our laws. Without the children's code there is protection from the state for children. It is a very protective state. All infractions against children are severelypunished if the elements align. So we want to have it all in a simple document and strengthen our harmonization process. So that is a question that will be still included in our dialogueswith the people and we hope to have that document ready soon. There was a question as well on the protection of children online. We also have a protective framework there. The criminalcode does set forth a punishment in the wake of violence against children including in the media, social media and cyber crime. The criminal code was reformed in order to include definitionson cyber crime offering protection to children in all matters that involve pedophilia and pornography in children. The criminal code was reformed for this. We also have a national mechanismfor the protection of personal data. They undertake monitoring. They do so with children and other groups. They work with the operators. They also work with other stakeholders in order to ensurethe protection of children and their images. On the government level there is policy for protecting children online. Specifically for the online environment. There is a draft lawspecifically on the protection of children online. A specific law that bears in mind the negative effects of social media specifically as they affect children. This specific textstrengthens the instruments in place. There is also a communications campaign on the protection of children online. The idea is to encourage parents to have the right reflexes and to also encouragechildren to explore the benefits of social media but also to look at the dangers. This effort has two mechanisms. Our colleague that works in the protection of children mentioned this before. We have a platform that allows for us to capture images of sexual abuse against childrenin order to eliminate them and to protect the dignity and the best interest of the child. We have a national platform for reporting the WALU which means rescue, SOS. This was developed forchildren but now it's been expanded to include protection for all women and it operates for women as well. This is a 24/7 platform. There are multi-sectoral efforts and multi-participant efforts so that all areas of government are working to protect the children. There is a comprehensiveprotection instrument. If the children is the victim of sexual mistreatment, it might be the health sector that intervenes 1st but there will be other sectors involved including thejudiciary. This is effective locally and this is effective nationally. And there is also a specific care provided, health, nutrition and reinsertion when these cases arise beyond merelyjudiciary matters. So in from 2022, 2023, the WALU platform, SOS platform has had more than 15,000 calls. It's a hotline. And here we do have cases of violence. There are some 75 casesof sexual abuse and all cases were addressed by the government authorities that are tasked with doing just that with consultation, with civil society in the reporting and also in the care provided afterwards and we have strengthened these provisions. We want to consolidate theseefforts. Now turning to data, this is a challenge and why? In our efforts to develop a national evaluation system, we do need to have resources but it's a priority that the state has as regardsthe Taliban. There is no discrimination. These are children as all children that are arrestedunder normal conditions and there is a process that is brought to bear on the issue of costs.This is all free but this does not exclude the possibility of a parent achieving or ratherhaving access to the birth certificates. So after ruling is made in such cases, the courts will transmit the birth certificate to the official records department within the time establishedfor this purpose and whoever is requiring the birth certificate, it is at that hearing that the timetable is handed down and the individual can go before the records department to getthat document. So there really isn't any problem in this. That's the procedure. It's very clear. Now as regards children that are at risk, the state continues to make enormous effortsto raise awareness, educate and protect children. Now the data issue, that can be a source of difficulty because there are different sectors working different areas contributing to someaspect but does not show the whole reality. The state has to undertake a national data mapping program for the entirety of the country. The budget is at 300 million with the supportof the World Bank. The terms of reference were discussed by all stakeholders. Ministry of educationis handling the educational aspect of the data, of the DARA rather and then the other divisions, judiciary, e.g. , do their part. So we will have this nationwide mapping that definitivelyaddresses the issue of data on street children. The head of state and government have committeda structural program beyond what has already been done. There was the original concept whichis to raise awareness among the children on dignity and social cultural values. That wasthe idea and the children that are subject or rather received this educational process, the millions have been invested through specific projects in the national education system and the differentsectors to support this. There is a national program for the modernization of data. There have been 64 million invested in this. Further in the different ministries that are working in social sectors there are programs and funds that are specifically aimed at supporting the DARA or workingwith the DARA. There are thousands of DARA and hundreds of thousands of children that are educated in these DARA schools where they learn their values, the Quran, social values and even some jobtraining and that's very important. They play an important role. Now beyond the support provided through these DARA in the ministry for women we have also developed for some since two years a program for social reinsertion for street children. This allows the DARA to return these children aftertheir Quranic training to their regions to benefit from social reinsertion programs. This is whatmakes everything sustainable. And the last stage that we undertook in November and also in December was to establish an ongoing oversight mechanism for street children. The idea is to work throughour services to take these children off the street and this is on the level of the subregion not just Senegal. We work sometimes with cross border issues with children as well. The other two structuralissues or three issues include and this at the decree or the orders of the head of state, the President,the idea is to invest 6 billion CFA to working with the DARA. It's in the budget. And there's criticalmass focused on data. The idea is to ensure that the Quranic training includes the rights of the children so that they aren't just receiving Quranic training but also information on the protection and avoidanceof exploitation. There's another structural effort in place. That is beyond the modernization of data program. We are focusing on the status of the DARA. This is a major project. This will be defining theconditions for opening a DARA Quranic school and oversight looking at the profile, the curricula and they will be working with the national commission on the DARA Quranic schools. This project has receiveda great deal of support, wide reaching and I can note that it is important to have consensus. The ambassadorsspoke of the family courts, their religious guides, information on the ethnic makeup of the country,Islamic law, modern law, the realities, all of these are within our work in Senegal. Religious women alsohave contributed to the process of working with the DARA Quranic schools. This was adopted in the council of ministers. So there's an effort to finalize this work and pass along the draft project or draft lawto the assembly. It is a good example. The president of the republic has also launched a national day for the DARA Quranic schools, 28 November, that is to encourage the efforts of the DARA Quranic schoolsand to strengthen education and to support them in their efforts. And the last instrument is the WAFU DARA. This is Islamic financing. So this is a national institute that is dedicated to mobilizingresources and also they look at working out of one office that aims at raising resources for the DARAQuranic schools. Lastly on the code for children, I think I have already said this, the process is underwayI'm sorry. I meant to refer to the issue of marriages. Beyond the legal dimension, the state has alreadyconfirmed in 2023 its national plan for fighting against child marriage. This was confirmed at theconsultation with all stakeholders. In this cooperation, there is exemplary cooperation between civil society and the government. There is a specific coalition that is dedicated to addressingthe prohibition of child marriages. All these coalitions are working together on this. So there is a very sincere dialogue, a brotherly, sisterly dialogue between the government and civil society on all issues, the technical aspects, the legal aspects, the issues of cooperation. Andthis is happening on the ground. We also have a national campaign for the eradication of child marriages.There are legal aspects of this that's being discussed and that could lead to a consensus that would allowfor the adoption of this. Now on FGM, this was a question on the social norms and this is a matterof investing in communication and awareness raising. There must be a human rights-based approach and a community-based approach. The government has been working on this. There is a national strategy forattaining zero FGM of women and girls. And this five-year program is part of our national strategy which is annually launched, relaunched, bringing together UNICEF, UNFPA and other stakeholders.These organizations visited Senegal in order to help work with the state to strengthen our efforts. They have asked us to accelerate our efforts and their community efforts underway to strengthen and accelerateprogress specifically in those areas where we still see these practices. The idea is tohave a work with not just a declaration to prohibit this but a council aimed at specifically doing so. There are community efforts with local leaders, national leaders and civil society. There areprograms as well in place that are aimed at supporting these activities, these decentralized activities. Ambassador, Your Excellency, these are some of the complimentary responses I was able to provideto these questions. Thank you very much. So on FGM, I would like to say that Senegal has participated in discussions on this including in the UNGA on the resolution on FGM. These are societal issues,however. The state can't have its political will and its political aspirations. But if the state says this is good for you and the societies say they might reject this and this just takes a long termeffort to address these behaviors and raise awareness on these behaviors. This is the problem of awareness raising really. We work with civil society on this in order to put an end to FGM. Now, the same formarriages, for child marriages, 16 years, the court is clear and our family code is the fruit of longstanding consultation lasting over 10 years, actually back to 1972. There are many countries that do not have afamily code. Many countries do not have a family code. And we do. We fought for at least a decade to ensure that we had a negotiated family court. This court actually predates your convention. It's worthnoting that. And for us to adapt to the realities, it will take some more time. Yes, we need to bear in mind all of these elements. I apologize again for my voice and I will give the floor to my to theDirector to address this issue. May I just come in here because we are now at 5:30 and we need to be able to ask you the next round of questions. But whatever you were going to say there, hold that thought becausetomorrow morning you can start with that. But let us take the questions because we need to use the time.And so I'm going to now ask our 1st speaker this afternoon to ask the 2nd round of questionsthat is Mr. Mesmer. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. This is the 1st time that I'm taking the floor. So welcome to the Delegation of Senegal. It's good to have you here. Before I get to my questions, let mejust put a bit of a context. This is the 627 report. And, of course, you are actually one of the few countries from Africa that has actually been reviewed at this level. So you have been here a fewtimes. And, of course, you have also been reviewed a few times by the African Committee of Experts within the African Union system. Now, why do I want to put this context? Because it means there are a number of contexts that we take into account when we pose the questions. You are an anchor of stability in WestAfrica. And that's for sure. Your economy is growing. You have a very solid democracy. But you also have a very solid democratic culture which, of course, contributes to children's rights. Now, I will befocusing on the family environment and education. And the context that I just mentioned to you is important because we are looking for responses that are focused on impact, that are focused on quality,that are actually focused on progress, but also further investments on some of the very positive investments that you are already doing. Now, let me come to family environment. The 1st point that I just want to flag is in the previous round when we reviewed you, we highlighted that there are insufficientmeasures taken to support parents. In your response in relation to that comment, you said, and I quote paragraph 181, the draft children's code incorporates the equal legal responsibility of mothers and fathersfor their children. It remains to be a draft. And we have got an indication from you that it is not clear when it will actually become a proper code. I know my colleagues have asked about the timeframes. One thing that I have been keen to ask is even though if you don't know what the timeframes are, are wetalking about five years or another ten years? Because it is not a theoretical conversation. In your report, you rely in less than seven times on the draft code to tell us how you are actually implementing the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Meanwhile, it remains to be a draft codewhere we don't have a timeframe for it. So here you mention and rely on the draft code, but to what extent are the issues of equal legal responsibility of mothers and fathers inculcated and implemented in the legal system in Senegal? Not on the basis of the draft code, but hopefully on the basis of otherinstruments because the draft code is a draft code. Now, again, under this section, there is a reference. We had some concerns, you would recall, about some discriminatory provisions that we identified,the issues about levy rate, sorrow rate, repudiation and polygamy. And in your response now, you said it is only polygamy that is an option laid down in the family code. Now, the data shows that polygamyis practiced in Senegal. It has its own benefits, but we are interested if you have identified any shortcomings that it might have for children's rights. It may be in relation to their care. It may be in relation to inheritance. It may be in relation to any other issues. If you can draw our attention to any potentiallimitations that you have identified, and if so, how you plan to address those challenges, it would be something that we are interested in hearing from you. Now, a very positive note is that we know that wehave heard the Ministry of Justice under its Directorate of Judicial and Social Protection is putting in place a legal framework for alternative care. We really welcome that. But again, it is importantthat we get a time frame. What is the time frame that we are actually working on? Because in the absence of this legal framework, we are operating without one. And that often puts children at risk. Now,confiage is something that we had spent some time on during the last review as well. It has some of itslimitations because it is difficult to monitor. It is difficult to support or control. Are there issues that you can draw our attention to that you have taken measures to address some of the limitations of confiage and apologies for the pronunciation that will help to address some issues that children arefacing within that framework? Now, in your report again, you mentioned Paragraph 190 is what I'm looking at. A mapping exercise on public and private facilities receiving and accommodating children was carried out in 2019. We welcome that. But what are some of the findings? What is the extent to whichsome of those findings are helping you to inform law and policy and programs in taking this forward? Sowe want you to take us into your fold to tell us a bit more detail how you are using that to push the boundaries further. Now, two points, and then I will move on to adoption. There are internally displacedpersons in the country. There are children that are deprived of their family environment. So in those instances, they come into the care system, whether it is formal, informal, whatever the case may be in that individual child situation. But in that context, what are the efforts that you undertakeas a state to facilitate family reunification of these children that should not necessarily be in the care system? So what is it that you are doing to facilitate family reunification? Again, as I mentionedat the outset, this includes for the children that are internally displaced in the country. Now, let me come to adoption. Again, a very positive note here, the Central Competent Authority for International Adoptions has been set in 2018. So we really, really welcome that. Two points that I just want to flaghere are, one, there are instances where simple adoption which allow to maintain affiliation with the birth family for intercountry adoptions are allowed. Now, in these instances, the consent ofboth parents reportedly is not systematically obtained for a conversion to a full adoption when the child is actually moved to another country. It is a concern that you have within your radar. If so,are you planning to address it? The other point in relation to adoption that I would like to flag is that you have since, I understand 2018, you have since resumed intercountry adoption with the establishmentof a multisectoral commission to study the process of adoption applications while ensuring the transparency of the process. How do you actually try to make sure that improper financial gain is not coming into the system, money exchanging hands and papers exchanging hands to make sure that thechildren who are being adopted are genuinely children that should benefit from adoption? Now, when I ask these questions about adoption, it is not lost on me that Senegal is a predominantly Muslim countryand kafala and other processes are much more relevant than adoption, but at least it would be appreciated if you draw our attention in this respect. Now, let me come to education. Again, let me provide aprestatement. There are, again, significant progresses that you have made in relation to education. For instance, the reference that is made in your report, the 2013/2025 program for the improvementof the quality, equity and transparency of education and training, that is very much welcome. It has helped to make progress on the ground. Now, one question that I have to raise in relation to that program is how is the coordination mechanism between the various different programs? Because I understandthe overall program, but there are other programs that also have relationships or fit within that is actually being done undertaken. If there are coordination challenges you have identified, how do you plan to strengthen some of those how do you plan to strengthen some of the interventionsthat you need to have for the purpose of coordination? Now, on the issue of education, in your report, you say that the authorities have fully implemented Paragraph 257. The authorities have fully implemented Act No. 2477 of 15 December on the national education policy and you talk about how eliminating directand indirect costs for education are handled. But we have seen also reports where there are still challenges pertaining to direct and indirect costs which actually exclude children at all levels from the education system. So here the question that I want to pose is are there any plans to strengthen,e.g. , social safety net programs by covering school fees for children from the most vulnerablecommunities and how do you plan to move about that? We are quite keen to hear from you. Paragraph 261,there is a very useful information about the measures that are being undertaken on individuals that are found guilty of rape, harassment or pedophilia that are automatically dismissed from public service. But still sexual abuse remains a huge challenge within the education system. Sohere dismissal is welcome. But, of course, we are talking about rape and pedophilia and so forth. So we are quite keen to hear from you about the criminal charge and the role that the criminal law playsin this regard. A number of points were mentioned already in relation to DARA, modernization involving several reforms that you have drawn our attention to in your report. I just want to flag two pointshere. One is the draft bill on the status of DARA. So what are its contents? What can we expect in the coming year or two to help move this forward? And the modernization issue is not new. I remember in 2013when those children died in Dakar, His Excellency, President Makisal came out and made a commitmentto actually make progress on this. Fast forward 10 years, we still have a number of challenges that we are facing. So what is the plan to address this? Not in 10 years. Hopefully in the coming one to two years is something that we are keen to hear from you. Let me mention three points, Chair, and I will endhere for now at least. Now, the budget issue is something that has been mentioned quite a few times. And we want to congratulate you for allocating close to 20% or more of your GDP for education. But I hope you agree with me that there are still limitations there. For instance, 80% of that justgoes to salaries. And we still have a significant number of children that are not in the education system. We still have only 0.4% of children with disabilities that are actually in the education system. So quite a significant level of investment is still required within the education sector andhow do you plan to address that in moving forward? The last point that I want to flag in relation toeducation is the poor educational and transitional opportunities for use. There are some concerns about, for instance, 15 to 17-year-olds struggling to transition opportunities for training, vocational training and so forth. Is there a plan to scale up a number of the initiatives that you have identifiedin your report such as catch-up classes to enable school-aged children to enjoy their right to education? Thank you, Chair. Over to you. Thank you. The next speaker is Suzanne Ajo.Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I have two clusters to address now. A cluster on disabilityand health. On disabilities, do we know the rate of children living with disabilities in the country?What is being done to ensure early detection of disability in children? What is being doneon the ground in terms of nonmedicalized staff who are carrying out vaccinations, particularly in remote areas, nonmedically trained officials giving vaccinations? I think that is actually makingthe situation of children with disabilities worse. What can you tell us about that? What is being doneto develop a mechanism to ensure that children living with disabilities are in school, that they are schooled in an inclusive schooling system? We see that these children often end upin the street. They are used in begging. So what are you doing to support these childrenwho are ultimately victims? Is there any kind of program to combat discrimination against thesechildren? Very often they are exposed and they don't have a very, people have a very bad perception of them. There is a great deal of discrimination against them. Is there any kind of mechanism providing careand assistance for these children on a community basis? Are communities involved in any way incaring for these children? On the budget, what budget do you have allocated or earmarked for programsfor children with disabilities? I don't know if you have got any kind of specific program for these children. Now, it is true you have in 2007, you ratified the Convention on the Rights of Personswith Disabilities, but what we have seen is that the program is still lagging behind. So what are youplanning to do in that area? Let me turn now to health and health infrastructure. How do you bringhealthcare to communities, particularly in rural areas? I read that you have a health center inwhich is in a state of advanced deliberation. I don't know if the state is planning to do anything about that particular center to improve the structure and to make sure that healthcare is available tothe local population in rural communities. Let me turn to the technical platform in hospitals. Are measures being taken to improve the technical platform available in hospitals? What can youtell us about the staff, qualified medical professionals? I also read that there was a problem with brain drain of specialists in the medical sphere. I don't know if you have managed to keepany qualified medical staff in the country on gynecologists. What is being done to keep them?There is a problem in terms of emergency obstetrics. I have read that you have issues with the ambulancesas well. When an ambulance is called, the ambulance staff are more interested in who is going to pay for the fuel, the driver, the trip to transport the ill patient. What can you tell us about that? Youalso have a gold mining area where there are very often accidents. Is there any kind of health clinic or center in the area? If so, how does it work? Because there are a lot of accidents and incidentsthere. What is being done to take care of those patients? Moreover, on the 26th of May, 2022,there was an incident where 11 babies died following a fire. The head of state issued instructions to the Ministry of the Interior. What can you tell us about the follow-up to that incident? What wasthe outcome? What has been done for the mothers in distress? What was the follow-up given to that tragic event? This is not the 1st time that such a thing has happened. This is the 2nd timethat Senegal has seen such an event. What has been done for the mothers and what has been done to prevent this kind of situation where babies die needlessly because of fires? On COVID, I know thatthere was also a scandal there. What was the deal with the embezzlement there regarding the resources that should have been allocated to address COVID? I don't know what happened. I know we were talkingabout criminal prosecution. Were those individuals prosecuted? What was done? What happened to the funds? Were they restored? Were they found? What are you planning to do with those funds if they have beenrestored? On vaccination, I see that as the lady said earlier, the indicators, you were talking about 31 deaths per 1,000 live births, but I also see that in terms of vaccination, well, 1st of all, I wouldlike to know the rate, the exact rate of vaccination coverage today because the figures are somewhatfluctuating on child mortality and to youth mortality here. Indicators, so you have some indicatorsthat have fallen. What's happening? What measures are you taking to ensure continued reduction of that mortality? In terms of prevalence of acute malnutrition, what are you doing in that area?Turning to breastfeeding, do you have any provisions or measures taken to ensure that the practice of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding up to six months become more widespread because we see thatwomen do not really breastfeed very much. You are talking about 34%. What I mean, we are in Africa. I know the last time when you came here, the head of Delegation was saying, well, we are in Africa,mothers breastfeed. That's that. But now you have got a situation where mothers no longer really do breastfeed very much. So what can you tell us about the cost of formula and how it works in terms ofthe staff? Are there any baby friendly hospitals, maternity wards? Do they work properly? Are mothers aware of their existence? On adolescent health now, do adolescents have centers where they can go andget information on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases as well as distributionof contraceptives? What is being done to support adolescents in that area? Still on adolescents,you have an issue with early pregnancy, large numbers of early pregnancy in Senegal. What are you doing to prevent that? Before we talk about care for these young mothers, what are you doing to prevent early pregnancy? There are a lot of magistrates here, judges here. What are you doing in terms ofdecriminalization of abortion? What is being done in terms of health before and after clandestineabortions? Turning to tuberculosis, I know there is an issue particularly in the prisons among children,tuberculosis among children. Where are you in terms of global efforts? I know the last time you came, there was an issue in terms of management in the global fund. I don't know if that's been addressedand whether the global fund is still present and what's going on there. On the ACAMA program, you are a country member of the AU. You have acceded to the campaign on child marriage andwhat's been done today, do you have any strategies in place? Is there free care provided? I would also like to talk about obstetric fistula. Is care for women suffering from this for free? Are women informedthat they can be cared for for free should this arise? Let me turn now to you talked a little bit aboutblood banks. I don't know if that's part of the kit. Is it for free? I know that there is a problemthere on mental health. What's being done in terms of mental health? You said that there is a care structure in place but are we talking about something specific for children? Are there qualified medicalstaff available to assist children on drug addiction and alcoholism? I don't know what you are doing in that area. Could you please tell us what you are doing to reduce risk and what's planned there? Thankyou. Thank you. Just looking at the time, we don't have a lot of time left and we still have one morespeaker, Mary Bella. Yes, you can ask questions and follow up tomorrow. Mary Bella, please take the floor to ask your questions. Thank you very much. Let me begin with the law on refugees andsightlessness from the 14th of April 2022 which was already mentioned two issues. Firstly, given the clear affirmation and commitment shown by the Delegation in terms of the policy in compliance withthe Convention, I would like to hear from you why in the report you stipulate that the law is not enforced because of an issue of regulation. Regulation depends on administrative law in the cultural tradition under the Executive. If there is political will to comply with the Convention,the law has been adopted and the regulation is missing and that depends on the Executive. I don't really understand why it is not enforced. That's my 1st question. Can you tell me when that might be enforced given that it is a regulation that depends on the Executive? Secondly, you mentionedthat recently this law which needs to have its regulations in place, it stipulates that children who are at risk and then they fall under the code of criminal procedure. So if you don't see thatthere is any problem in saying that this is a code of criminal procedure issue that will protect thechildren who are seeking asylum or refugees or who are stateless, there is a more complex issue here legally speaking because under this code it brings together all legislation protecting children butthere are still issues that I would like some clarification on. Why do you think that this move to decriminalize, to ensure protection, that that's compatible with the Convention? Let me move quickly to the issue of child labor. You are very clear in your commitment to eradicate child labor in thecountry, the issue of the informal sector and so on but one question is what are the specific measures that Senegal has adopted to ensure that children who are working informally that they go to school and that they don't drop out of school? You have made a lot of efforts to have more staff and have morechecks but what are you doing specifically to ensure that children can go to school and not be in the street in these kind of subsistence jobs? And we welcome the fiscal measures that you have adopted,particularly for small productive activities but have you measured this kind of fiscal stimulus? Have you seen that it has truly been effective to ensure that children stop carrying out those activitiesand that they remain in school which is the right place for them? Now, please do tell us a bit moreabout issues that the state party report itself recognizes. The report recognizes that there are issues with the minimum age and with hazardous labor in terms of the ILO convention therein. I value the sincerity of the report. It is generally speaking this is guaranteed and ensured and I think that'slaudable the fact that you recognize that there is an issue there but what is the or the problem that I would like to hear more from you about is the fact that in the report in paragraph 292 it stipulates that there has already been an amendment to the legislation but it cannot be complied withbecause the law has not been adopted. So again back to the same comment that I made regarding the issue of the law on trafficking and refugees, if it is an issue of the regulation that depends on the executive and there is political will there, then my question, legal question is why can that not bedirectly applied as a policy of the executive? Why can't you apply the regulation that is compatible with the convention and with the ILO convention that you yourselves in the report recognize that there is a problem in that subject area? And if I may, Madam Chair, just one question on children andstreet situations which we already mentioned the problem of statistics, Article 145 of the criminal code maintains that begging is criminalized for cultural reasons. Clearly it is not an effectivecriminal policy to combat this practice. So in the report you said that there is no problem with this criminalization that has been discussed. The adults are prosecuted but my question is what happens to children who are begging? What is done with them? They are not criminalized but what measuresare taken? Can you give us more information as to how you deal with these begging children? You alsosaid that you have taken measures and responses in terms of artisanal, children working in artisanalprofessions. I understand that that is important, that those professions are, those trades are important but it is perhaps more important to guarantee the rights of these children who are in the most vulnerable situation and this by placing them in schools. So is there any idea of addressing that? If we justtake 30 more seconds, I just would like to talk about questions regarding administration of justice. A general comment and if we can perhaps tomorrow go into more detail, reading the report it is not clearwhether there is a system of response to crime for adolescents, it is different for adolescents. All regulations are within the norms of adult criminal proceedings. So is there anything specific for juveniles, for adolescents? Perhaps we can look at that in more depth tomorrow. Thank you.Thank you very much. Certainly there will be time for follow-up questions tomorrow, I'm sure, to cover anything that we weren't able to ask. So I'm sure you are feeling that's a lot of questions. Butthis is how many Delegations feel. So please don't feel that it is different or special for you. ManyDelegations at this point are feeling, oh, my goodness, that's so much work that we have to do this evening to try and answer all of these questions. So we hope that you are able to spend your evening working onsome of the answers for us tomorrow. We are sorry that you can't just have the evening off. But that is the way and especially you, Excellency, you sound like you need the evening off with your sore throat.So we hope that your health holds and we will see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Yes, certainly. One minute from the interpreters, please. Of course, Madam. Thank you, Madam Chair. My thanks, I just wantedto thank all experts, Committee members for your questions. We believe that these are important questions and tomorrow we look forward to coming back with the relevant responses. There may be some issues that we are not able to respond to tomorrow because we believe that some questions fell outsideof the scope. For example, questions related to alleged COVID scandals, for me, that has nothing to do whatsoever with this Committee and we will not respond to questions that fall outside the scope of the Convention. But for the rest of the questions, we look forward to answering them tomorrow."}
{"title": "", "text": "Good afternoon, Excellencies, Distinguished Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen. I would like to welcome you once again to the 6th International Meeting, Intercessional Meeting on Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda with the focus on Integrating Human Rights into the International FinancialArchitecture Reforms, a cornerstone for realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Human Rights Economy. We will proceed immediately to our 2nd thematic session. For this, I have the pleasure to welcome our 2nd moderator today, Mr. Richard Kozel-Reitz,the Director of the Globalization and Development Strategies Division in UNCTAD who will be leading the discussion as well as our four Distinguished Speakers, Mr. Navid Hanif, Professor Atiyah Waris, Ms. Marianne Randamina and Professor Musaj Davie. Again, before giving the floorto the moderator, I invite Delegations who wish to inscribe on the list of speakers for this session to raise their nameplates. State representatives present in the room should raise their nameplates in order to be recognized while those on the Zoom platform should press on the raise hand button on their screen if they wish to speak. Observers present in the room who do not havenameplates such as national human rights institutions or non-governmental organizations are invited to register with the Secretariat at the desk on my left. And now, Mr. Kozel-Reitz, the flooris yours. Thank you very much, Chair, and good afternoon to everybody. I think it's prettyclear from the discussion this morning that issues around debt are very much at the center of concerns involving the health, stability and governance of the global economy. This isnot a recent phenomena, but it has escalated since the early 1990s when there has been an explosion in levels of debt. The current estimate is that the global debt stock is now $300 trillion.That's 300% of GDP and that's probably an underestimation. Calculating debt flows is not an easy business as we know in UNCTAD. And it's all forms of debt. It's not just government debt which Ithink we will focus on particularly here, but it's private debt. Indeed, private debt has grown more quickly than public debt over the last three decades, households, corporations, students.We have seen an explosion of debt and some people would say an addiction to debt in the contemporary global economy. As you also heard I think from the presentations this morning, there is a realconcern that the scale of debt that is now being faced is threatening the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement and concerns that if we don't deal with the challengesand pressures that come with a mountain of debt, then we won't indeed meet the ambitions of the international community by the end of this decade. And there is a 3rd kind of underlying concern I think we heard this morning which is why haven't we dealt with this problem? Manypeople expected that after the global financial crisis that we would begin to tackle the issues underpinning the challenges around debt in a much more aggressive and systematic way. Andwhilst we have seen reforms at the particularly at the national level and in the European Union and the U.S., we have seen some reforms. They have clearly not been up to the kinds of problemsthat we continue to face over a decade since the global financial crisis hit. So I think we got a sense of those concerns this morning. There is a bigger issue underpinning a lot of this discussion which has to do not simply with debt as a standalone problem but debt aspart of a highly financialized world that has emerged over the last three decades, new sources of finance, new players in the international architecture, the way in which debt has hadprofound impact on policy making at all levels in the global economy. And promises foregone. I mean, the big promises of a financialized world that we would be a much more efficient and muchmore competitive and much more prosperous world. And the one thing that we can all say about this highly indebted world is that whilst we have seen elements of those qualities in some parts of the world, the one ubiquitous feature of this highly financialized world is it isa highly unequal world and that there is a strong connection that a lot of people worry about between the rising levels of debt and the rising levels of inequality. And I think in that context it is good to remember that trying to think about what debt is, debt is a bit like cholesterolin our bodies. We all need cholesterol. And there are good and bad forms of cholesterol. And when we have good cholesterol levels in our body, the body is healthy and energetic and dynamic. But there is a real danger that we see increases in bad types of cholesterol.And when we see bad types of cholesterol in the body, we know that there are problematic symptoms in terms of our health that are likely to follow. And that's true of the economy, too. Debt can have a very virtuous role and a necessary role in a healthy economy. But if you get toomuch of it and if you get the wrong kind of it, then you can see boom and bust cycles and vicious kind of cycles of development that cause unprecedented damage in some cases and not onlyeconomic but social and political damage. So trying to get an issue of how we manage debt is I think a critical one for this audience to come to terms with. And when it comes to managing debt, I think again from this morning's discussion, it is not something we can leaveto the markets and the courts which is one way of handling or managing debt problems. Those are not enough. And they are not enough because debt is very much a systemic issue. It is not just a behavioral challenge. It is a systemic challenge. It is about the rules and the institutionsand the interests that form around a world that is highly indebted that need to be addressed in a more holistic way if we are going to come up with an effective reform agenda. And that's I think something that the human rights community has to come to terms with and deal with. Aswe know, there has always been a traditional division within the human rights agenda between civic, civil and political rights on the one hand, economic and social rights on the other hand. That's a dichotomy that doesn't work in the context of debt because debt is a highlyinterconnected legal, political, economic, financial, moral challenge and you can't kind of silo different parts off of that challenge and hope that you can come up with particular effective solutions. And,of course, last of all in that context, it is a difficult issue always for the UN to handle, but debt issues involve power asymmetries. Creditors tend to be more powerful than debtors for all kinds of reasons and dealing with the question of power in the context of debt is critical ifwe are going to find sustainable solutions to the problems that we face. You heard a lot this morning about the need for reform of the IFIs, the International Financial Institutions andpossible solutions. I'll put my UNCTAD hat on for this. We don't think the IFIs deal with the problems I've just outlined in a very effective fashion and that's partly because their creditors, the IMF and the World Bank are creditors and they look at the world through a creditor lens.Also they don't have a very developmental perspective on the problem. So sustainability is simply a question of whether countries can pay their debt or not. It doesn't bring in issues of education and health and we are very happy that the world has picked up on our 3 billion people livingin a world where payment for debt is higher than health and education. That is an UNCTAD number. But it doesn't figure very much in the way in which that sustainability is sought about in the IFIs and one of the consequences of that is when it comes to dealing with debt problemshistorically the IFIs have delivered too little, too late on just about every occasion that countries run into significant debt crises. Interestingly the exceptions and I think the president ofECOSOC mentioned this morning that it is the 80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions this year. The exception, of course, was immediately after the Second World War when the European economies could not recover on their own. They needed help. They needed help from the UnitedStates. Interestingly the United States decided it wouldn't go through the IFIs and instead it implemented a Marshall Plan very explicitly not using debt instruments. Marshall Aid was in the form largely of grants and at the end of that they had a very large debt conferencein London, the London Debt Conference where the German debt was essentially wiped out. That is 50% of Germany's debt was canceled which allowed the German economy and other parts of Europe to prosper significantly at the end of the from the early 1950s onwards. We don'tfollow those lessons sadly when it comes to developing countries anymore. And so history has I think resonates still in the way in which we think about the debt problem and looking for solutionsto the challenges to allow us to meet the SDGs and the Paris Agreements within the requisite time frame. I think we have a great panel today. I hope to discuss all these issues and to lookfor ways forward from a human rights perspective. And I will introduce the panelists I think as they speak. And we will begin unfortunately, Navid Hanif who is the Assistant Secretary Generalin New York that deals with debt issues. He was going to join us by video link. Unfortunately he can't make it. But he has sent a message. So I think we will start with Navid's message.Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for the opportunityto address the intersessional meeting of the Human Rights Council on the topic of human rights and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The world stands at a crossroads. At the halfway point for implementingthe 2030 Agenda and in Sustainable Development Goals we find ourselves faltering. Progress on almost 85% of SDG targets is insufficient, stalled or regressing. We know financing is the fuel that will driveprogress on the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change. We will need to mobilize itat unprecedented scale and speed to facilitate the massive investments in transformation that we urgently need to deliver Sustainable Development and on the promise made in the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. In this context, I welcome this discussion on how the human rights framework can help inform and shape reforms of the international financial architecture. Our global financial system and theinstitutions that govern it must proactively support the realization of human rights and the 2030 Agendafor Sustainable Development. This is one of the principles embedded in the Agenda on financing for development. Ladies and gentlemen, at the SDG Summit in September, UN Member States welcome theSecretariat General's efforts to promote an SDG stimulus and its proposals to address the high cost of debt, dramatically expanding affordable long-term financing including through publicdevelopment banks and provide contingency financing to countries in need. But a short-term SDG stimulus is not enough. We must finally address long-standing gaps and flaws in the international financialarchitecture. That architecture is not fit for purpose to address the challenges of the 21st century.The Secretariat General has set out bold recommendations to reform the international financial and tax architecture starting with governance reforms to achieve more inclusive, representative and ultimatelymore effective global economic governance. Advancing on many of these bold but indispensable reforms will be up to you, the Member States. And Member States in all their capacities need to be engaged.This is an Agenda that requires the attention of the entire government, including human rights expertsworking alongside their finance ministries, health ministries, education ministries,trade ministries and, of course, foreign ministries. Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn to some of the specific aspects of debt distress, the topic of the 2nd panel. Sovereign debt sustainability concernshave dramatically increased. Currently at least 19 Developing Countries are spending more on debt interest payment than on education. And 45 countries are spending more on interest paymentthan on health. In total, 3.3 billion people live in countries that suffer from underinvestment in education or health due to large interest payment burdens. Leaving them in protracted debt distresswould undermine efforts to deliver on human rights obligations as well as progress towardssustainable development. While these risks are broadly recognized, the international community has yet to find consensus on a commensurate response. A wide range of policy options and proposals for addressingthese debt challenges have been discussed in various fora. But under the current system,debt crisis resolution remains typically too little, too late. We need long-term debt sustainabilityanalyses that incorporate both climate risks and the positive impacts of investment in long-term projects.We must create fiscal space for countries that suffer from debt overhangs effectively and at scale so that they can invest in the SDGs and climate action in the critical period over the next several years.We need to achieve debt treatments that are more effective, timely, deep, and fair. There arevariety of tools at our disposal which can be the starting point to achieve more ofclimate resilient debt clauses that pause debt payments at the time of a natural disaster should be scaled. Debt swaps, if carefully structured, can help to create fiscal space for SDG investment.But we must also create a more robust debt resolution architecture for those inevitable cases where debt workouts become necessary. The Secretary General has proposed a more sustainable debt resolutionarchitecture. Ladies and gentlemen, there are already lessons we can draw upon that help to bringtogether the words of human rights and debt restructuring. Courts administering municipal bankruptcy regimes in some countries have used the level of public service provision and solidity of socialprotection as indicators of whether public debt should be restructured. We should draw on these lessons as the international community seeks to enhance the sovereign debt resolution architecturewith the view to deliver these at the upcoming UN Summit of the Future this year and the 4th international conference on financing for development in 2025. Ladies and gentlemen, I would be remissif I did not mention that Member States also recently agreed in New York to launch the process towards the UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. Aggressive tax avoidance and taxevasion have a corrosive effect on public trust, financial integrity, the rule of law and sustainable development across the globe. Reduced public resource mobilization undermines the abilityto deliver on our human rights commitments. This UN process can enable an international tax systemthat respects countries' sovereignty, reckons with the real ways markets operate and business is donein our modern world and establishes transparent international tax rules and proceduresthat respond to the needs, priorities and capacities of all countries. Allow me to conclude by emphasizing that we must make our economic and financial systems fully aligned with sustainable development needsand human rights obligations. Recognizing and strengthening the links between the human rights agenda and the reforms of the international financial architecture can only bolster our effortsto transform our world. I wish you highly successful deliberations. Thank you for the opportunity tojoin you. Thanks to Naveed for that comprehensive presentation. I think it's clear from what he saidthat the reform of debt architecture is now a UN, a firmly UN position and that's something UNCTAD welcomes. We have been banging the debt reform agenda since 1964. So it is our 60th anniversary thisyear. So it is a very welcome fact that the issue is now very much firmly on the reform agenda of theinternational community. Naveed ended by suggesting that there was a very intrinsic link between that reform agenda and the human rights agenda. So I think it is appropriate now to turn to ProfessorWarris. I don't think I need to introduce her. She is the UN expert on debt and human rights and so is particularly well placed I think to continue that discussion that Naveed has introduced. Thank youvery much. Yes, he stopped right at the spot when I thought in my part of the world we always ask when did the rain start beating us? It is a very rainy day outside in Geneva today. I kept trying tothink about when did it start beating us? At what point in time did this whole conversation of finance butt heads with raising living standards of human beings and when did it start to overwhelm us? Idon't know, 64, 45, decades before I was born. But things to think about nevertheless. I will talk about four main issues before I give some ideas for recommendation. And one of the 1st ones is almostsetting the scene of where we are right now. When COVID hit, one of the things I thought I would see would be freezing of debt, forgiveness of debt interest rates. And it didn't happen. Not only inprivate bonds and debts but not also in public bonds and debt. Neither at international levels nor at domestic levels. It happened in pockets and spaces but it wasn't a widespread decision. And so I kept thinking, well, this is a global problem to which everybody is feeling the pain but clearly they arenot translating it into action. And for me, this is one of the points that I think is really important because as pointed out, certain entities are not mandated to look at things from a human rights basis. As much as they might love human rights, they cannot implement it if they don't have the mandateto deal with it in that particular way. And so COVID did not result in a big change in the financing of most spaces that I was looking at across the world for the reasons that we have already discussed. ButI also started to see whether when we look at, e.g. , low and middle income countries, is it just one crisis facing them or is it multiple crises facing them? And my report last year to the General Assembly was just that, that it is multiple crises facing each country in a diversity of ways. And if you aredealing with that, then an example that always comes to mind is the fact that the top 50 most climate vulnerable nations today are also the most debt vulnerable nations. So there are connections between the rights to a clean and healthy environment, protection of the climate, and debt. And you startto see it as you look more and more into human rights. I will not reemphasize the fact that more is going on debt than has already been mentioned on social protection, health, and education. But I alwayslike to look at who gets the debt, who takes on the debt, who uses the debt, who has to repay the debt.Children that are born when debt has been taken on, then struggle to have good quality lives while we start to repay the debt. And then 20, 25 years later, those same children are the ones repaying the debtbecause they are now inputting into the economy. And if that's the case, then shouldn't we be protecting, even from an economic perspective, that economic entity that is going to produce the finance,that is going to repay the tax and the debt? And for me, these are the points to which I keep coming back to from a human rights perspective because that economic unit that we are talking about, it is not a factory. It is a human being producing work. So how do we get that human being to live a good andhealthy life so that they are also productive is something I think that's quite important from a human rights perspective. But then that takes me to my 2nd point, which is about the human rights implications and their solutions to the debt crisis because I think it is a challenge to try andresolve human rights, but I also think there are solutions within human rights. For a very long time, we would always hear progressive and immediate realization. Immediate realization of civil and political rights has not taken place. And you need money for it. You need money to pay judges. Youneed money to buy voting paper. You need money to allow people to operate a judiciary. You also need money for the right to education and health. So whether you split them apart from a fiscal perspectiveall human rights require resources, financial resources. But on the other hand, these same resourcesare required for a particular purpose. So the same way the rights require resources, the resources also require rights because you are doing it for those same human beings that are the center focus, that economic unit that is supposed to come and produce the finance. So the accumulation of power that Isee is also being attributed in the system and has already been pointed out as well. It's encouraging a certain direction because of where the power asymmetry sits, but it's also encouraging tax evasion which is now starting to take place more and more across borders. And it's really importantthat we remember education and health and social services while we are having those conversations, but also the ballot paper that we have to buy and the judge that has to be hired. So these are two spaces that need to come together as well. But we also have concerns around issues of illicit financialflows which must be stopped. Allowing for the movement of resources outside a border goes against international cooperation and assistance which is a tenet not only in human rights spaces but also in fiscal spaces. International assistance is very much there. And now this takes me to my 3rd point,which is about the principles of borrowing and lending and how this can have an effect on human rights. While the challenges within tax in the global south are also now in the global north, I don't think we can split them anymore. All countries around the world are going back as far as20 to 40 years to audit some of their big multinationals and this is something that is showing us that while there may be varied principles and experiences of it across the world, at the end of the day, communities are coming together to try and collect more and more resources which takes meto what is my March report to the Human Rights Council and that is on the principle of what is called fiscal legitimacy. We can debate the creation of entities. We can discuss how the people are going to be working within it. We can say who is going to sit on the leadership board of these organizations.But unless we have clear principles on how they will conduct themselves, we will continue to have problems in both fiscal spaces as well as human rights spaces. So the principles of fiscal legitimacy for me are as we are going forward in our human rights and in our financing, we need to make surethat we are accountable, that we are transparent, that we are responsible in how the spending is taking place and that it should reflect human rights principles. Of course, efficiency using money welland effectiveness is very key, but most importantly for me, especially because I come from a human rights background is the issue of fairness and justice. It must not just be spending for the sake of it, but the spending of it should come across to be utilized under clear principles and in thisparticular situation, I will say human rights principles. So the fairness and the justice of the system that you are dealing with in finances comes straight round full circle into human rights principles on their spending and their collection. My 4th point before recommendations is howto deal with the issue around not only debt risks but early warning signs. I have now conducted three country visits and I will tell you that the 1st sign I look for when I go into a country is how many people have mental health issues and are walking on the streets. And the reason I look atthat is because mental health care is one of the 1st to lose funding increase around the world when there is a debt crisis or where there is a tightening of local budgets. And that is the 1st funding that falls apart and so that is the most vulnerable population usually in a debt crisisthat you start to see, both in middle as well as in low income countries. So I look for those, the kind of people you find who are unemployed and on the street. Second thing you start to see,the more expensive it gets for a country to live in, the lower the fertility and this is, there is data to back this up. There is numerous reports from the 1990s that say this. You have a lower number ofbirths in a country that has more debt but now not just state level debt but individual level debts. So if you have higher taxes and higher debts in a country, you are less likely to have a bigger population and this is something affecting countries in the global north actually more than in the globalsouth. So this is also very interesting to see how debt is having an effect on the human rights of people on the ground but also in their decisions on who gets to be born for the next generation.The other thing that I noticed, of course, and this is well known is the absence of nutrition amongst children results in stunting. So you have a lower amount of nutrition available. That means that bodies do not develop the way they should in the 1st five years of a child's life. Now,this stunting may not have a big effect initially but it will when you have to deal with people who need to work and who are now shorter than the average. So these are questions of trying to deal with the effects of debt on human rights but also and actually the growth and the development and the existenceof a human being. I would like to move straight to my recommendations now. And one of them has already been mentioned by Naveed before me which is about the multilateral convention that is coming up. But also in the case of COVID, there has been the underutilization of special drawing rights, forexample. Countries need this financing. I also think the United Nations and with UNCTAD incidentally I think are a very good fit on this particular issue should be taking a leading role in developing this multilateral convention because the data sits with them and the priorities and their mandate isvery clear. But we also need to make sure that the playing field is leveled and we need to be all very honest about it. The same rules and regulations that guide us, the principles I have mentionedthat guide us at national levels should also be used at international levels so that we are very aware of how we are spreading the financing across and making sure that the most vulnerable are indeed protected. And finally, in the reform of the global financing fiscal system and the development systems,we need to make sure that we are advancing the sustainable development goals. We have already heard that we are behind the curve. We will stay behind the curve for as long as interest rates and the repayment of debt, whether it is private or public, is prioritized over the lives of humanbeings and not just their existence, which I have alluded to already, but also the quality of their lives over the 1st 20 plus years from birth so that we are producing healthy human beings whocan have a good standard of living. I thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much, Atiya.You mentioned at the beginning that obviously the COVID shock exaggerated a problem that was already brewing in many Developing Countries. There were already clear signs in 2019 that distress wasrising and countries were beginning to show the early signs of default. Obviously, the COVID shockheightened that significantly. Physical space was squeezed. Access to foreign exchange was greatlydiminished. Growth prospects were seriously damaged. In response, the international community did find some solutions. The G20 introduced the debt service suspension initiative, although it was never on ascale that was commensurate with the pressures that Developing Countries were actually facing at the time. There was the introduction of a common framework for debt restructuring that was intended to overcomesome of the weaknesses in the existing arrangements for managing countries that went into debt default.One of those countries was that has and is still in the process, it was hoped that it would be finishedin Marrakesh last October at the IMF World Bank meetings, but there are still issues that have not been resolved. So I think it is appropriate that we could hear now from someone from Zambia, one ofthose countries that has experienced the use of the common framework as a tool for managing serious debtproblems. So it is a great pleasure to welcome Ms. Marianne Wandamina, who is the acting assistant director of external debt at the Ministry of Finance and National Planning from Zambia by video link, Ithink. So you have the floor, Marianne. Thank you very much, Mr. Moderator. Excellencies, DistinguishedDelegates, ladies and gentlemen, as already introduced, my name is Marianne Wandamina. I am the acting assistant director for external debt at the Ministry of Finance and National Planning and also ourdepartment is the one which is responsible for the debt restructuring which has just been mentioned. I have the privilege of presenting Zambia's experience on debt restructuring at this auspicious event. Allow me to commence by thanking the United Nations Human Rights Council and the office of the high commissioneron human rights for the invitation to be a panelist at this meeting. I believe that this meeting will give an opportunity to gain insights from other countries as well as share Zambia's experience indebt restructuring which will provide an avenue to contribute to the reforms being undertaken in international financial architecture. As mentioned before, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,a number of countries were already facing some debt challenges and this was the case for Zambia as well which was on the brink of debt distress. This was as a result of an ambitious infrastructure developmentprogram, a combination of economic challenges which included rising inflation, slow economic growth,insufficient revenue collection and limited fiscal space. We also had high debt service burden arising from the accumulation of non-concessional debt and depreciation of the local currency. So indeed, justto reiterate that the COVID-19 pandemic was an already critical situation. So I will take you a bit back in 2020, the year that Zambia defaulted on its European payments, debt service had increased to 51.7%from 9% of domestic revenue in 2011. It essentially diverted resources away to repayment of principle and interest. I will provide a quote from our Minister of Finance which just captures the situationthat was obtaining. For each quarter that was collected from revenue, the amount that was needed to service debt was 51.7 in GUE or the 51.7% and another 39.4 in GUE towards wages and salaries forpublic servants. This meant that 91.1 GUE or 91% of our revenues was committed to debt service and payments of wages and salaries. This implied that the balance of 8.9 GUE or just about 9% is what remained availablefor all other government programmes including buying of medicines, provision of school requisites, government operations, construction and rehabilitation of roads, supporting our small scale farmers throughthe farmer import support programme, supporting Parliament and supporting constituencies through the constituency development fund, CDF. Allow me, of course, to briefly delve into our experience on debtrestructuring as mentioned. We are undertaking this restructuring under the G20 common framework. It is worth noting that Zambia being among the frontier countries to use the common framework will provide insight into how similar cases may be addressed in the future and possibly form the basis of reformto international financial architecture. In summary, Zambia officially defaulted in the year 2020 and successfully applied to the G20 common framework in 2021. Some notable milestones have been the formationof our official creditor committee in July of 2022 with financing assurances paved way for the approval of the $1.3 billion international monetary fund extended credit facility programme. This was approvedin August of 2022 and we received the 1st disbursement during 2022. During the course of 2023,we have also recorded some significant milestones. We went through two IMF programme reviews successfully and therefore received the 2nd and 3rd disbursements under the programme and we alsoreached a restructuring agreement with the official creditor committee in July of 2023. This agreement was formalized through the memorandum of understanding that was agreed in October. I think the moderatorhas already mentioned Marrakesh being one of the times during which we recorded this milestone.Engagements with our commercial and private creditors including the European holders has also continued.Something that will stand out in the Zambian case and which has also been touched on by the moderator is the time that it has taken to achieve the aforementioned milestones. It is worth noting that the current common framework does not have published guidelines which prescribe timelines as well asprovide definitions for key terminologies such as comparability of treatment. In addition, beyondthe common framework, as a result of the changing creditor landscape, consideration should be givento debt initiatives that provide platforms for the different creditors to weigh in and build consensus on their treatment. As mentioned, our creditors go beyond the traditional multilateral and bilateralcreditors to include the private and commercial creditors. The global sovereign debt round table is a step in the right direction in terms of bringing these different players together. Thetime that it has taken to conclude the debt restructuring is notable. And I will again quote something from our Minister of Finance who said the long delays in Zambian debt restructuring have hamstrung much needed investment, curtailed economic growth, weighed on local financial markets and addedto the living costs for the Zambian people. However, Zambia is not the only country that is facingdebt challenges and the debt problem in low income and some middle income economies continues to deepen post the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevailing situation has brought into question countries' abilitiesto attain the Sustainable Development Goals as well as uphold human rights during this period.In the case of Zambia, despite the debt challenges being faced, the government has continued to protect the most vulnerable in society through programs such as the social cash transfer scheme and other social safety needs such as the food security pack, public welfare assistance scheme, keeping girls inschool and the home grown school program. To mention but a few, this is in addition to other social sector interventions in public health, wash and education sectors. This is commendable. However,we still have a long way to go recognizing that Zambia ranks amongst the countries with the highest levels of poverty and inequality globally where 60% of its overall population being 80% of the ruralpopulation and less than $1.90 a day. This is according to a 2022 report. So we are reaching some but not all of the poor and most vulnerable. With regard to the 2024 national budget which is ourmost recent budget which we are in the process of implementing, the budget allocation to the social sector had a nominal increase of 18% and a 3.8% rise in real terms. The continuation of these vitalinterventions has been made possible as a result of support from our cooperating partners from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, European Union, United Nations agencies and theAfrican Development Bank to mention but a few. It is necessary, however, to conclude the debt restructuring process in as soon as possible time in order to free up the much needed fiscal space as the current debtsituation and constrained liquidity poses real challenges to Zambia's human rights obligations.It would be of benefit to learn from cases such as Zambia to see how the international financial architecture may be reformed especially with regard to sovereign debt restructuring to incorporate notonly sustainable resource mobilization but also human rights considerations. In conclusion, despite being in a position of debt distress, Zambia is committed to making the necessary efforts to chartthe way to achieve the SDGs as well as support human rights. As part of this effort, e.g. , in October, we engage in consultations with the Human Rights Office on advancing the right to food andeducation including through increasing available resources to meet international human rights legal obligations. We look forward to continuing to share our experience and learn from others. I thank youfor your time. Thank you very much, Marianne. I think that's a clear indication of some of the ongoingchallenges that countries face in handling their debt problems through the current architecture. I think it's important, of course, to recognize that Zambia is also a least developed country so theconstraints that it faces in general are of a particularly binding nature and that makes the challenge even greater for their policymakers. But it's also important to recognize that debt problemsare not unique or confined to least developing countries but there are many middle income countries that are facing equally serious debt problems and indeed some are already in debt default. One partof the world that is experiencing serious challenges is the Middle East and Arab countries. Lebanon is already in a very, very serious debt position. So I think it's we're going to close this I thinkappropriately with Professor Moussa Ashtoi who is currently the President of the Economic and Social Council of Jordan and since February 22 has been the Vice President of the Arab Economic andSocial Council. So Professor Ashtoi, you have the floor. Thank you very much, Richard. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great honor and pleasure to be here today to participate in such an importantmeeting focusing on the reform of the international financial system in the context of achievingsustainable development goals. The Economic and Social Council of Jordan is an official institution that provides policy advice to the government on economic and social issues that is based on socialdialogue where all social partners are represented. We are committed in the council to promote participatory and inclusive economic and social development policies in the country. In previous years,the council has provided recommendations on various human rights topics including the right to education,health, women's rights and children's rights through the state of the country reports that we issued. In this context and in cooperation with the United Nations country team in Jordan, we have released apolicy brief on the domestic resource mobilization using a human rights approach in tackling inequalities.Some of the key findings of the study revealed that there are inequalities between municipalities in terms of their share of revenues and services they provide and limited ability to mobilize moreresources, that growth in tax revenues did not respond to changes in GDP growth, that although the income tax law is progressive, the overall current tax system depends highly on indirect taxes whichhas a detrimental effect on the low income group and poor segments of the society. Though with a more upward trend becoming more progressive in income tax for companies and the need to increase efficiencyand transparency of public finance and people's participation in national budget process. Jordan is committed to its obligation for the fulfillment of human rights by adopting economic policies thatensure fulfilling these objectives. In fact, it developed a ten years economic vision to modernize the economy that aims at the enhancing of the well being of the population. However, Jordan's abilityto devote and maximize its available resources to the realization of ESCR is seriously hampered over the years by its serious slow economic growth, serious and accelerating debt burden, external shocks suchas the ongoing war on Gaza and the declining of international financial support to the Syrian refugees in the country. Jordan's economic growth rates have been very slow for more than a decade nowwith an average of 2% for the period spanning from 2010 to 2023. The sluggish economic growth was a result of external shocks such as international economic crisis, the Arab Spring and the civilwars in Syria and Iraq and the global pandemic of COVID-19. This period was characterized by implementations of serious fiscal reform programs. Austerity measures accompanied by these programshave failed to stimulate economic growth and contributed to the soaring of unemployment rates to a record high standing today at 22%. The outstanding central government debt at the end ofthe September 23 amounted to USD57 billion dollars. I'm sorry, 57 for yes. The domestic debt constitutes55% of the total debt while the rest is external. The central government debt at the end of the 2023stood at 113% of GDP, almost double the percentage in 2008 and increasing by 16 percentage points onlybetween 2019 and 2021. The structure of the debt changed since 2021 where the government reducedthe dependence on domestic borrowing for financing budget deficits while increasing the borrowing from external markets. The government aimed by changing the structure of the debt to finance thebalance of payments deficit and reduced the crowding out effects of borrowing from domestic markets to encourage investment and accelerate economic growth. Since the beginning of 2010, the governmentstarted increasing its reliance on external borrowing to meet its financial needs. The shareof public external debt in the total public debt increased from 38.7 in 2008 to 44.9 at the end of 2023. As for the sources of external debt, loans from regional and international institutions amountedfor 38%, most notably loans provided by the World Bank and IMF while those provided by the Arab and foreign government, bilateral and export constituted about 17% of the balance of external debt as bilateralloans accounted for the largest part. While the current and the predicted increase of the public debt is by itself a problem, the annual debt service and its steady increase is becoming even moreproblematic. The external public debt service at the end of 2023 is more than a 5th of the total expenditure, rising from 15% in 2018. The increase of the debt and its service severely limits the fiscalspace and reduces the potential to expand the budget of social security, education, health and other social protection needs. Poverty is relatively high in Jordan and increased dramatically during COVID-19pandemic. Before the global pandemic crisis, the official poverty rate was about 16%. Early models undertaken by the World Bank estimate that the likely short-term increase in poverty might be as high as 11 percentagepoint for Jordanians as a result of the lost labor and remittances incomes for households. At the same time, a huge proportion of the non-poor households are just above the poverty line with high vulnerabilityand at stake of falling into poverty with external or household shocks. The government spends GDP 2.6%of GDP on social protection while with GDP 2.41 million or less than 1% of GDP going to national aid fund whichis cash program beneficiaries. There are around 120,000 families among these recipients. More than double this number is recorded in the system waiting for assistance when funding becomes available. Interestpayments are predicted to be seven times the social assistance budget in 2023, rising to seven times in the next five years. According to our analysis, 15% reduction in interest payments would allow thegovernment to triple its social assistance budget and finance poor people who are not eligible for now programs. The context in Jordan is rapidly changing due to various factors that are interacting andfurther reducing the fiscal space available for social protection. In addition to the significant increase in debt and debt service, there has been a steady decline in international support for refugees, thesevere economic impact of the war on Gaza and the increasing security challenges of different kinds.After 100 days, the Gaza war had serious economic challenges for Jordan, particularly related to transportation, energy, logistics as well as indirect effect on various sectors, mainly tourism. The ongoingcatastrophic situation in Gaza Strip and the regional spillover of the conflict has already impacted Jordan economy through various channels including international domestic tourism as I mentioned, restaurants, cafes and so on. The ministry of tourism data indicates that cancellation of the internationaltourism reached about 80% which has directly affected the hotel occupancy, the tourist companies, transport current health companies as well as if the current crisis continues, it is expected that unemploymentand poverty will increase. The UNDP regional Arab states bureau estimated that more than 200,000 peoplewill slip into poverty in the 1st three months of the crisis which already passed us and it will double if the crisis continues for another three months. Also the rising security risks and challenges,especially cross border security, drug war and terrorism have already accelerated the military expenses which may have negative impact in the expenditure component of the government for socialissues. If the situation continues in the coming year, then it would have serious negative effects on the revenue generation and would have serious constraints on the economy through rising inflation, unemployment and decreasing in government's revenue collection, particularly from corporate and businesssector. Also the government's budget may face serious shortages in the coming period if the current situation continues to escalate, more specifically expected revenues may not be collected and someexpenditure may be blocked due to rising expenses for military and security issues. It is to say that under such circumstances, the government may change its source of revenue collection from progressiveto regressive structures that would affect the vulnerable groups more than higher income groups as it happened during the global pandemic in 2022. The same situation is also valid for budgetary expensessince the government may significantly constrain social and capital expenses in the budget to create some additional fiscal space for military and security related issues. In conclusion, the globalpandemic, the Russian-Ukraine war, the war in Gaza and the rising debt and the cost of the services are posing a serious threat to the ability of advancing the SDGs in Jordan. Austerity measures raise fears orquestions on the possible balance between economic stability and social security. The potential negative impact on social development, inequality and welfare of the people. These austerity measures do not evenachieve the declared objectives of sound economic growth and job creation, not to mention social development. Jordan is not alone in this situation which raises the question about the role of differentstakeholders in the realization of the SDGs and national development including the international financial institutions. This might require a paradigm shift on the best way to strike a balance betweendebt management and social development. As far as the ESC of Jordan is concerned, we are committed to advocate for human rights impact assessment on current and future reforms, economic policies focusing onthe link with the social economic development and the living standards and on those who are or might be left behind. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much, Professor. That concludes, I think, forinsightful and comprehensive presentations on the challenges that we face in the context of a highly indebted, highly interdependent but also highly fragile global economy. And I think that's thebackdrop really for the discussion of the kind of reform agenda that we need to urgently advance if we are going to meet the SDGs and the Paris commitments by 2030. So I'll hand it back now tothe Chair for further interventions. Thank you. Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. Moderator. And we now turn to interventions from the floor. And I'm reminding everyone that we limit these to a maximumof 2 min and again encourage all of you to intervene in an interactive way with comments and questions taking into account and reflecting on what our distinguished panelists have said. We don't have a lot of time left and we have four speakers on the list. If there are no burning additional speakers,I would close the list there and give the floor to those who are on the list now. Yes, five instead of four. And we start with the Distinguished Delegate of India followed by the Russian Federation, please.Thank you, Chair. We thank the panelists for the insightful comments. The need to achieve sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth in the face of tightening global economic situation and worsening debt vulnerabilities cannot be emphasized any further. Cascading global crises have posed challenges tolong-term growth and the Developing Countries are facing an uneven recovery. The three SDGs highlighted in today's panel discussion can be properly addressed only when fiscal responsibility, transparency and viability guide financial options including for development of infrastructuralprojects to avoid imposing further unsustainable debt burdens on already vulnerable countries and communities. In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight India's contributions to plurilateral funds such as India UNDP fund and the India Brazil South Africa fund as well as India'stechnical assistance program and other development cooperation instruments like lines of credit, grants assistance, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. These funds focus on issues like climate resilience, renewable energy, gender equality, health, education, water, sanitation and digitalinclusion, all of which are important for full realization of economic, social and cultural rights.Under India's G20 presidency there was a welcoming of efforts of the global sovereign debt round table participants for facilitating effective debt treatment and of the joint efforts by stakeholders to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency including the voluntary stock-takingexercise of data sharing with the international financial institutions. Our collective commitment to strengthen multilateral development banks with the focus on development needs of low and middle income countries will also help reduce the debt distress and maximize available resources for economic,social and cultural rights. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Speaker from India and pass the floor to the Distinguished Speaker from the Russian Federation followed by the Bahamas. President,the continuing debt crisis has negatively impacted the achievement and realization of economic, social and cultural rights in particular. The irresponsible micro financial policies of the west have provoked the global inflation and undermined the global markets. Unilateral sanctions have been introducedagainst unfavorable states with blocking of accounts and assets and the use of institutions under the west control international payment systems, development banks and this has adversely impacted the lives ofsimple people violating their basic freedoms and rights. The IMF and the World Bank more and moreare taking decisions to block the allocation of funds to countries that are shareholders dueto politicized excuses. The decisions taken have failed to resolve the redistribution of IMF quotas and the new formulas for their calculations. The current financial architecture which is focusedon the so-called rules-based order only serves the interests of its creators and does not service any rights of other participants and therefore does not meet the requirements of a multilateral globalstructure. In these situations we cannot talk about not leaving anyone behind in economic, social and cultural rights. Bretton Woods institutions need to be fully overhauled to ensure transparency andinclusivity. We need to stick to pragmatic depoliticized approaches. Only this way can we make a contribution to achieving the 2030 agenda for the prosperity of the planet and all people. This should be implementedby all countries and all interested parties acting in a joint partnership. Thank you for your attention. Thank you and the floor is for the Ambassador of the Bahamas followed by Iran. Thank you, Chair. Wewelcome the convening of this meeting and the opportunity to further discuss the critical interlinkages between development and human rights. In the face of relentless climate-induced calamities we grapple with an unjust vicious cycle thrusted into the aftermath of disasters beyond our makingcompelled to rebuild and revive development while being ensnared in a paradoxical classification of high income that constrains our access to the vital financial support crucial for our recovery. Thisimpediment is exacerbated by coercive measures such as black listing which further constrains our capacity to realize the right to development and the rights to an adequate standard of living, a clean healthy andsustainable environment and decent work to name a few. This recurring pattern of rebuilding and recoveryis compounded by steep increases in levels of public debt that in turn lead to higher interest rates on international loans. Moreover, a high income classification impedes our ability to accessconcessionary financing. In 2023 to 2024 almost 20% of the Bahamas' recurrent expenditure has been earmarked to repay interest on public debt, resources which could otherwise have been used to fundsocial programs. Despite such challenges we remain determined to ensure the realization of all human rights including economic, social and cultural rights and continue to work assiduously toward this end.Global responsibility sharing and international cooperation are therefore indispensable in supporting states such as the Bahamas in their efforts to achieve a fiscal environment that supports the state's capacity to realize the 2030 Agenda and ensure the full realization and enjoyment of allhuman rights. As stated by Prime Minister of the Bahamas, the Honorable Philip Davis at a recent COP28 Summit, there is time is a luxury we do not have and it is beyond doubt and debate that thepolluter must pay. We therefore reiterate the call for developed nations to scale up and fulfill their international climate finance commitments. In closing, we ask how can adherence to the principlesof international solidarity and the right to development guide our efforts to ensure a more just system of access to international finance? Thank you. Thank you, Ambassador. I pass the floorto the Distinguished Delegate of Iran followed by Canada. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I would like to express my gratitude to the panelists for their insights for contribution in this session. Due to the nature of the existing international financial structures rather than yielding desirable long-termresults for ESCRs, the current situation poses new and multifaceted challenges for many developing and less developed countries. The growing debt distress has compelled them to focus more on finding ways to repay debts and meet commitments imposed by international financial structures, neglectingthe wellbeing and ESCRs of their people. This trend further intangibles developing and less developed countries in a vicious cycle of the debt and commitments, casting a shadow where the prospects of realizing sustainable development goals. Leaving no behind requires a targeted approach that identifiesand addresses tailored-made needs, empowering governments to utilize their own national resources through effective engagement in international financial structures, removing impediments suchas measures and facilitating the transfer and sharing the technologies not only promotes ESCRs within the countries and improves their resilience in crisis but also contributes to reducing inequalitiesamong countries on a global scale. By prioritizing education, healthcare, housing and implementing targeted interventions for groups of societies that are more in need to protect, countries can pave theway for sustainable development that leaves no one behind. International collaboration, innovative financing and a commitment to not exclude others from the global financial decision-making structuresare vital components of this collective efforts to build a more equitable and prosperous future. I thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, sir. And the floor goes to Canada followed by UNCTAD.Thank you, Mr. Chair. As part of the core group of the Resolution on Human Rights and the implementationof the 2030 Agenda, Canada welcomes the organization of this intersessional meeting and thanks the panelists for their presentations and insights. You have all highlighted the numerous challenges ahead of us.Nonetheless, the timeliness of this meeting ahead of this fall's summit of the future allows us all to take stock of the important issues that need to be taken into consideration to support reform efforts to achieve the SDGs and uphold economic, social and cultural rights, both domestically and internationally.The transformation of the international financial architecture is not only important but necessary to redirect resources towards these objectives. Canada supports reform efforts and appreciates the views from panelists on how the international community can encourage sustainability of thesereform efforts. As such, it will be crucial to also scale up concerted efforts towards implementation of robust policies that promote good governance, rule of law, gender equality, access to transparent andfair justice systems and measures to combat rampant corruption. A strong supporter of the creation of the IFM's resilience and sustainability trust, Canada has been among the 1st to finalize a contribution of over $2 billion towards these goals. But there is still much work to do to makethe IFIs fit for purpose to address the new global challenges that many of you have outlined in here today from climate change, pandemic response, fragility and conflicts. But we cannot do this alone. These efforts also require increasing our capacity to mobilize private capital and more effectivelyallocating concessional finance while preserving support for the world's most vulnerable. Considering what you have shared here today, I would be interested in your views on how to facilitate a more systematic approach to engaging private sector in these efforts. Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Speakerof Canada and pass the floor to our final speaker from UNCTAD. And for the opportunity to speak.Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the hierarchical and unequal structure of the international financial system has become disconnected from development priorities. This is nowhere more apparent than inits treatment of sovereign debt problems with countries left hanging in what has been describedas an incandescently painful situation with associated negative effects especially on the most vulnerable people. The past three years have laid bare that an unforeseen shock can put many countries in a precariousposition. External private financing is volatile. The cost of capital is high. More foreign capital flows out than in. There is unequal access to the global financial safety net and illicit financialoutflows are growing. This is not a situation of countries own making but has left them servicing barely affordable debt. On average at the end of 2022 the debt servicing burden as a share of exportrevenues for low income countries was 23%. And it was 16% for middle income and low middle income countries. This is five and three times respectively more than the ceiling that was put on the reparationsrequired of post war Germany in the 1953 London agreement. The UN has said this is unsustainableas it undermines the sustainable development goals. In its most recent trade and development report,UNCTAD calls for among others more concessional finance through greater capitalization of multilateral and regional banks and a new issuance of special drawing rights. Greater access to financing shouldbe guided by improved transparency of terms and conditions around how financing is being used.Digitalizing loan contracts could help automation and accuracy of this information. In UNCTAD we are now revising the principles for responsible sovereign lending and borrowing in order to create momentumto underpin the importance of guiding these guiding principles throughout each stage of the sovereign debt acquisition. At the country level, improved debt sustainability analysis and tracking needsto be available not only to reflect the achievement of the sustainable development goals but also to empower country negotiators with improved data on their potential for growth and fiscal consolidation.Access to a truly global financial safety net would greatly benefit developing countries, especially access to central bank swaps in a time of liquidity crunch and that would help avert crises. We arealso calling for automatic stand stills such as climate resilient debt clauses and the approach spearheaded by the World Bank as well as better understanding of how innovative financial instrumentscan be brought to bear. At the same time, we think that borrowers need to coordinate better, drawinginspiration from private creditors and cooperate to share information and experience. We think that work on a more robust debt work out mechanism and statutory global debt authority needs to begin now with theaims of balancing borrower and lender rights. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was the last speaker of this session. And I would now like to call on Mr. Richard Causel-Wright for leading the final remarksby the panelists who joined us in the room or virtually. The floor is yours. Thank you. I think we only have two panelists left to answer questions. I don't think I will respond because my colleague hasjust laid out a lot of what UNCTAD sees as the way forward and that draws on a long history of our workin trying to understand the dynamics of the contemporary debt challenge and the problems that it has caused to many Developing Countries over the last four or five decades. So I'm not surethere was any specific questions, but I don't know if either of the two panelists would like to respond to what you have heard from the floor. Thank you very much. And in fact, we are looking at evaluatingthe whole situation. Of course, Governments have a lot to do in terms of their commitment to human rights and in all levels of policy, but today the economic decisions of many countries, especially that arein debt issues, crisis, the economic decision is not purely theirs. And I think whatever measures we are taking to improve will not help, in my opinion, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, neitherin 2030 nor in 2035. I think there is no alternative for national economic development. And that calls for investment in the countries, investment in the economy, helping the countries to promote theireconomic development, economic growth. And the current path actually and the measures that have been taking historically, and we have been following this in Jordan for the last 30 years, IMF-led programs,of course, while they are very important, maybe for fiscal stability and economic stability, but they are not an alternative for economic development programs. And they rarely achieve the resultsthat they are declared, because they focus either on budget cuts or reduction in subsidies or more taxes and what have you. And this path, it's a vicious cycle. So I think the challenge today,you know, in addition to what has been mentioned by some of the esteemed Delegates, the international economy, the international crisis today that we are facing, I think many 3rd world countries arereally reaping the outcome of this crisis, although it's not from their making. And I think there has to be some rapprochement at the international level on how to lift these countries out of the problemsand issues that they are facing and for the benefits of all. And we know, especially in the region, our region, the Middle East region, the entire region is really in a very disruptive situation. I mean,we are not talking about only policies. Look what's happening in Syria, in Palestine, in Lebanon, Libya. We don't have stability. Without stability, political stability, there is no chance forsound economic development. And, you know, and I think there is a moral responsibility for internationalmajor players to help solve these problems, the political problems, so we can be on the path of peace and development at the same time. I'm very sorry if I talked too much on this. Yeah. Well,thank you very much for the interactions. It's very heartening to be in a room of what should be human rights and we can have some very technical conversations about debt and finance. It gives me immense pleasure, I have to say on a light note. I heard two specific queries. One was about engagementwith private sector and how to sort of go through that. And the other one that I heard was aboutsolidarity in accessing finance when you have been categorized at a particular position. In October of last year, I presented a report to the General Assembly on the multiple crises facing the worldand I would like to encourage people to please read the report because one of the challenges that is facing countries right now is that you may be a low or a middle income or even a high income country, but there will be certain things that are being done by either regional blocks or unilaterally. I mean,we have had reference to sanctions already that have a direct effect on an economy. And the problem is this low or middle income status, high income status or low income status suddenly actually loses its validity because of actions taken by states or blocks of states. And then there are far reaching effectson that particular country or group of countries. So if we are going to go into this process, one of the things we have to really protect at all costs is to prevent, number one, unilateral actions. Thatis very important. The 2nd thing is regional blocks should not be able to pass guidelines that will undermine the stability of other countries, especially from a financial perspective. I saythis broadly because actually in March I will be reporting back on two countries, Liechtenstein and the Bahamas and so I would like to also maintain that until then. But this is really important that we take it very seriously because the power that countries are wielding and the effect that thepower is having through their technical rules and regulations is actually undermining the stability of countries across the world. And on the issue of engagement in the private sector, one of the bigger challenges and I know in the next session there will be conversations around tax, but one of the biggestchallenges facing choosing to engage with private sector is whether or not they come to the table with clean hands. We have seen cases of, e.g. , multinational corporations that weren't paying taxes but now have such a huge amount of money that they are now giving private debt. We have high networth individuals who didn't pay their taxes again but now are coming in through investment firms and actually funding what are being called Euro bonds, the private bonds that are going into developing countries. So there is a need for, again, solidarity but international cooperation and assistance. Weneed to remove the veil of what is protecting individuals that are living off ill gotten gains or multinational corporations that are not being honorable in their countries and then making sure that there is honor in that space and then that is the funding that you are then able to channel in. And what willend up happening I think to a very large extent actually is that you will find there is a lot of money that countries are not actually collecting that is due to them. And I think this can be a really big game changer as well because even at a domestic level it will then shift the power away from theseprivate companies to where power should be better managed hopefully which is within the state apparatus and government where they are following the rules on human rights which then takes me to if you are going to engage with private sector then you need to make sure that they are implementing human rightsprinciples in how they are using the money, how they are taking money. We heard the example of Zambia. I hope she had been on session because she probably would have been better at explaining this but in the case of Zambia there was a deadlock because the private bond holder refused to come to the tablefor negotiations when they tried to moratorium. So you have a situation where a private entity that's an investment group actually prevented what could have been a major alleviation of pressure on a countrylike Zambia which was in a really serious economic status. And so when you now see these pieces in play of where private actors are coming in we need to understand who they are, how much they hold, who the human being is right at the bottom and to make sure that the finance is honestly gained and then ofcourse engage with them because now there are a huge number, extremely ethical, good businesses out there who really do want to help and support and many of them do support many entities both within the United Nations and in other spaces. So the rules and the regulations that guide countries should alsoguide people who live within the countries whether it is as recipients of human rights or it is as those who are financing and therefore helping support human rights in other parts of the world. Thank you.I don't really have a lot to say. I'm not coming from a human rights perspective. Obviously I come from a development perspective. What I know is that most people everywhere more or less need the same thing,right? Most people want a decent job. They want security. They want a reliable shelter and a homethat they can invest in. They want their kids to have decent education, access to services and they want a better future for those kids. So those are just basic things that everyone everywhere wants to see.And at this moment in time sadly there are pressures of an economic nature that are not allowing for that to happen. Unless we address those structural problems of which debt is a principle one, then Ithink the dream and it is a valuable dream that is embedded in the Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement will simply not be delivered for large parts of our fellow citizens across the world. And the urgencyof dealing with those structural problems I think cannot really be emphasized and I think we heard today in specific circumstances but also more generally in the context of the global systemwhat needs to be done and it is very much now up to Member States really to live up to the ambition that they have set themselves and to find the way forward to ensure that what people want everywherecan be delivered. Thank you. Thank you very much for these concluding remarks and that ends the 2nd session. And we are now taking a very short technical break and we will then right away start with the3rd thematic session. Excellencies, dear colleagues, we are starting the 3rd panel session and I havethe pleasure to welcome our last moderator for today, Ms. Esge Aydowan, the Director of the SDG Lab here in Geneva who will be leading the discussion as well as our three Distinguished Speakers, the Honorable Solomon Ayelet-Derso, Ambassador Francisco Safie Gattica and Ms. Liz Dalton. Before giving the floorto the moderator, I once again invite Delegations who wish to inscribe on the list of speakers to do soby raising their name plates. If you are not in the room, you may raise a hand on Zoom. We haven't had a Zoom intervention yet, so I hope we haven't overlooked anyone, but as we said earlier, it's still possibleto send in an intervention in writing which will be going on the website. NGOs and National Human Rights Institutions and other observers can inscribe themselves, register with the Secretariat at the deskon the left. And now, Ms. Esge Aydowan, the floor is yours. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Hi, everyone.As mentioned, my name is Esge Aydowan. I'm the Director of the SDG Lab. The SDG Lab is a multi-stakeholder innovation space for social innovation that sits within the Office of the Director General here at the United Nations in Geneva and I will be your moderator for today. I'm also just maybe buildingon before, I'm also rather a development practitioner, so that's going to be a bit my angle. I will startgiving you a brief introduction to frame the conversation for today and then introduce the different speakersthat are going to be with us today in the 2nd round. The 1st point was actually introducing myself, so I did that. The 2nd would be why SDGs and human rights and I think I believe that's alsowhy I was invited to moderate the session because, in fact, they are two sides of the same coin, right? They go together. They are complementary. Hence, they need to be tackled together. Interlinkages matter,matter as it was mentioned before. The discussion today is very much focusing on taxation, on combating corruption, illicit financing and the lack of effective taxation systems. In the absence of such,what we are actually missing out on and, again, it's been said before in the previous session is a lot of money, to put it very bluntly. It's much needed financial resources, especially domestic ones, to invest into the realization of human rights but also into the realization of SDGs. As you know,the financing gap is actually increasing as we speak. To put it maybe in numbers, to exemplify it, countries around the world are losing approximately 480 billion, that's a lot of money per year,to global tax abuse and evasion by multinationals and wealth individuals that don't necessarily pay tax where they create value and where they have their business, which obviously impacts and affectsdeveloping countries even more as they lose public funding to invest in to human rights and SDGs.There is hence a great need to establish the connection, the connectivity between the discussions on the future of taxation and human rights and SDGs and to bring that lens stronger into the discussion.These two things, SDGs and human rights, have to go hand in hand and be the compass as we are looking into redesigning systems and redesigning systems in a way that deliver taxation systems for people and planets because that's the only way that we can achieve the future we want and deliver what hasalso been said before for the children and the children of our children. I would like to stop here and use this opportunity to actually introduce the Distinguished Panel. On my very right, a very welcome, a very warm welcome to Mr. Salomon Ayele Derso, who is the Commissioner of the African Commissionon Human Rights and People's Rights. Dr. Salomon Derso is a widely published and very well-known legal scholar, human rights practitioner and peace and security and mediation expert. He is the immediatepast Chairperson and member of the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. He is also the Chairperson of the Commission's Working Group on Extractive Industries, Environment and Human Rightsand a member of the Working Group on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. During his tenure as Chairperson of the Commission, Mr. Derso provided exemplary leadership among others in mobilizing and catalyzingrobust and continuous response to the human rights issues arising in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,including through collaboration with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in issuing a joint statement. As a member of the African Commission, he sponsored several key resolutions on country but also thematic issues, including on the recent joint statement on the UN General Assembly process foradopting a resolution authorizing the negotiation of a UN Convention on Global Tax Cooperation.I would like to introduce also the 2nd speaker on my further right, His Excellency Ambassador Mr. Safi, Francesco Safi Gattica, who is the permanent representative of Chile to the Organization forEconomic Cooperation Development, the OECD. Ambassador Safi took up his duties as permanent representativeof Chile to the OECD last year on April 15. His Excellency holds an LLB, sorry, I'm not so well reversed with these titles, and an LLM in taxation from the Universidad de Chile. He is also a PhD holder in lawfrom the University of Edinburgh. During his academic year between 2018 and '19, he was a postdoctoral Global Hauser Fellow at NYU Law. He started his professional career as a tax adviser in different law firms.He has also been in the past a tax policy adviser to the Chilean Minister of Finance and acted as a policytax adviser to the Chilean Senators Carlos Montes and Ricardo Lagos Weber. Since 2012 and prior to taking up his duties as ambassador and permanent representative of Chile to the OECD, he was anAssociate Professor of Law at the Universidad Adolfo Ibanez in Chile. Last but not least on my very, very right,I should actually have started from that side list, is Ms. Nelson, who is Director of Advocacy and Research at Tax Justice Network. Ms. Nelson leads a team of high level advocates and researchers addressing issuesof international tax reform and governance, climate justice, human rights, intersectional inequalities and data analysis on global and country specific tax abuse. Before joining the tax justice network, Ms. Nelson was a Development Manager at the Skoll Center at the side business schools in the UK.Before that, in the previous 20 years, Ms. Nelson developed housing services for vulnerable and at risk adults and families. She studied human rights and development management from the Open University's global program in development management and women's human rights at the London School of Economics LSC.She is at the same time an Atlantic fellow for social and economic equity. Welcome, Ms. Nelson. I would like to now use the opportunity to dive in into questions that we have prepared for the panelists,so get ready. I would like to start with, just give me 1 s , Mr. Derso, welcome again.So today we are exploring the topic of taxation and how to combat illicit financing corruption in an effective way. From your perspective, having worked in this field for quite some time, also taking up, of course, an African perspective, what do you think are the structural reforms needed to make the currentinternational text architecture, the system more progressive, fit for the future, which obviously means looking into how to make it more inclusive and human rights aligned? Can you reflect on some alsomaybe key developments in that very aspect? Thank you. Over to you. Thank you very much and a very good afternoon to all of you, Your Excellency, the President and also Madam Moderator. Thank you verymuch for the kind invitation extended to me and to the African Commission on Human and People's Rights, the African Union's premier human rights body. There are two, at least I think there are many issuesthat have been canvassed in the course of today, since morning, about the structural issues and conditions that require very serious overhaul or reform as far as the international financial architectureis concerned. But at least two we can mention in relation to the work that we have been doing. One obviously relates to the way international human rights and other systems of international law operate.Here I would like to mention the silos earlier on the President mentioned as one major challenge that we have in advancing this conversation forward. That has to do with the fact that most of the time,at least from my own experience on the African continent, this conversation about reform around the financial and economic architecture in order to give effect to human rights have been happeningamong those who among the converted, so to speak. This conversation has not been happening, e.g. , on the part of finance experts, banking experts, others in the tax experts. These are the kinds ofpeople and experts and communities that need to be part of this conversation if we are going to make headways in this respect. So from an African perspective and the work that we have been doing,two issues that I thought are worth mentioning have to do with 1st international investment regulationsthat are crafted either through bilateral investment treaties or other regulations have been operating and operating in such a way that they do not encourage, actually they do discourage strongly anyuse of progressive taxation by investment receiving countries. This affects strongly in particular developing countries whose regulatory framework in any case remains very weak as it is.This has to do with, of course, the nature of the business model that is promoted by international investment treaties and regulations and international taxation systems as well. So this is one aspect ofit. The other aspect has to do with illicit financial flows and this is a result also of not justthe international investment treaties and the tax system but also practices that are associated withexperts in banking, lawyers that support and operate in the financial industry and financial sector and, of course, the financialization of the global economy itself I think is an important dimension of that.So if we put it in, e.g. , in specific numbers for the global economy according to the tax justice networks, state of tax justice 2023 report, I'm quoting Liz here, countries may lose 4.7 trillionin tax revenue over the next decade due to underpayment of taxes by multinational corporations and wealthy individuals. Despite this being a global phenomenon, Africa and the rest of the developingworld bear the brunt of this phenomenon. The magnitude of the loss Africa suffers was laid bare by the report of the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union's Joint High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows headed by former South African President Thabo Mbeki. According to that report,this was in 2015. Africa was estimated to be losing more than 50 billion dollars annually to illicit financial flows. In 2020, UNCTAD in another report revised the amount to increase to the tween of about90 billion U.S. dollars annually and this is increasing. The African Work Commission through the Working Group on Extractive Industries as well as the Working Group on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has for many years been concerned about the challenge of illicit financial flows from the Africancontinent, particularly in relation to the impact that it has on the realization of fundamental rights on African peoples. The African Commission in 2013 adopted resolution 236 on illicit flight of capitalfrom Africa, drawing attention to the challenge from an African human rights perspective and has since adopted a number of declarations on how to address illicit financial flows from a human rights perspective. I would like to once again draw on the economic development in Africa report of UNCTAD of2020 which highlights the extent of the challenge of IFF from again focusing on the African continentwhich I quote said strips government traders of needed resources for development expenditure. The report identifies inadequate regulation of the financial system and capital account, trade openness orliberalization of trade in the context of weak regulation and poor governance, poor institutional quality and excessive dependence on commodity experts. And importantly according to the reportIFF does not only undermine the tax revenue of governments which it would use for development but additionally also undermine systems of governance, transparency and ultimately the foundations of democracy. It therefore the report therefore says institutions are the primary channels through whichIFFs negatively impact prospects for social and environmental sustainability and therefore the profound negative consequence of IFFs for human rights and indeed for meeting Sustainable DevelopmentGoals. In terms of the work of the African Commission I think I would like to state that perhaps the African Chart on Human and People's Rights which is the founding treaty of the African human rights system is the only international human rights instrument that makes explicit reference to whatit calls international monopolies and the need for addressing the negative consequence of the operation of international monopolies on development, the right to development on indeed economic, social andcultural rights. This is provided for in Article 21 of the African Charter. On the basis of this, through the Working Group that I Chair, we adopted resolutions 3, 6, 7 of the declaration on ensuringthe upholding of the African Charter in the extractive industries but here the most important aspect of the work relates to IFF including, e.g. , the requirement for adopting or reviewing legislationor regulatory mechanisms in order to require that the regulatory system is arranged in such a waythat it is not only actually rather than being guided by the business, the global financial economy business model which requires return profit principally, we were requiring regulatory frameworks to ensure thatcountries actually get what is their due in terms of taxes by addressing among others the excessive tax breaks that are often negotiated by big businesses because of the power asymmetry that exists betweenthe states and these big businesses, duty free benefits and many other arrangements that actuallycreate the loopholes for that are exploited in order to engage in and invade regulatory systems.The commission also adopted state reporting guidelines and principles on Articles 21 and 24 of the African Charter which deal with natural, the right to natural resources and the right to environment. By the way,the right to environment is legally established right in the African human rights system. This was established in 1981 before it became a right within the UN Human Rights Council and in this respect we haveincluded various requirements including, e.g. , the kind of responsibilities that businesses would have but most importantly we required specific reforms relating to among others for ensuring, you know,compliance, fiscal responsibilities and transparency obligations including disclosure of identities of owners, shareholders and local partners, disclosing financial terms of agreements relating to licensefees, relating to national and local tax, custom duties, royalties and shares and payments made to governments by companies at a national level. Of course, financial flows and the issues of limitedtaxation have to do with also the possibility of countries having the possibility of imposing taxes on what may be cross-border economic activities or services. That is another area that requiresaddressing. And our work highlighted very importantly that the reforms have to touch on investment laws of countries. They have to touch on financial regulations and institutions and laws of countries. They haveto touch on banking laws because these are all the institutional setups and arrangements whose effective functioning would ensure that loopholes that are exploited for avoiding taxes for illicit financial flowswould also be addressed. And we underscored as well very importantly the importance of the right to freedom of information and access to information which is linked with transparency for addressing corruptionwhich is one important component of this topic as well. Against this background, we therefore supported and indeed issued a statement in support of the African Group in New York in sponsoring the resolutionadopted by the UN General Assembly on the 22nd of November 2023 for the negotiation within the UN framework of a tax convention for tax cooperation that would enable, as have been expressed, e.g. ,in the earlier session by the key speaker levels the playing ground, so to speak, for all countries as far as taxation is concerned and address those systems and flows that actually facilitate and allowillicit financial flows including by enabling countries where values have been added, where economic activities have been carried out, not just where these businesses are originally established to actually have taxation.And it is against this background that in the context of the discussion that we are having about international financial institutions reform, we support 1st and foremost this initiative for international tax reformwhich needs to address squarely the various structural issues that lead to illicit financial flows and indeed perpetuate corruption. Second, and importantly, we also support the human rights economy agendathat is championed by the UN human rights commission, commissioner by the UN human rights commissioner, but also we indeed agree with the proposals put forward by the UN Secretary General on addressing the structuralissues relating to the organization of the global financial architecture in terms of issues relatingto representation and the reform of decision making in the institutions including IMF, but also importantly the need to address the immediate issues relating to debt distress which is actually leading, I fully agreewith the High Commissioner in his morning remark, debt distress is turning into debt trap is turning into debt traps and this is indeed the experience of many on the global south in particular. Withthat, I would stop here and look forward to the subsequent conversations. Thank you very much.Thank you very much. Thank you very much for this very interesting overview and providing the African perspective analysis on the structural issues and the loopholes that you have mentioned which I thinkprovides a very good segue into the 2nd speaker, Mr. Ambassador Salfi. How can we fix things perhaps would be maybe sort of the simplistic way to say it, but let me please put it into a question for you.Now, reflecting what's been said by Mr. Derso, what do you think are the key measures that are needed that maybe are feasible to ensure the efficiency that is seemingly missing and the resilience of theinternational taxation system so that actually can help realize human rights and the SDGs by leaving also no one behind which is a key principle? What do you think are some of the key concepts, practical stepsand examples that come from your region and I also know that a 1st Latin American Caribbean summit was held on taxation last year in Cartagena, Colombia. Perhaps there are some takeaways you can share fromthat moment as well. Thank you, Ambassador. Well, thank you for the invitation. It's an honor for me to be here today and regarding your questions as Mr. Derso was saying and I think that we have beendiscussing during the whole day there are a lot of measures that actually are needed to be taken in order to make more efficient the international system, but one in which I would like to focusin my presentation actually is the way in which international organizations should cooperate in establishing an agenda that moves forward all the advancement that has already been done to make itmore inclusive and more oriented to outcomes and results that actually can bring better conditions to people's lives that at the end of the day that's the goal that we are looking for. In terms of theregional debate, there are a lot of things happening in South America as you may know. Colombia, Chile and Brazil as the representative of Colombia was saying today in the morning too are part of amultilateral base in which we are discussing about tax systems and how progressive should they be in the region. Colombia and Chile and Brazil have gone through recently tax reforms in Colombia and Brazilthey were more successful than the debate that we are having now in Chile but actually we are going to insist now in March with the tax reform that actually tries to make the system more progressiveto finance human rights especially economic and social rights that are so much needed in our country.That platform is actually bringing new ways in which we can represent the region in international fora and we expect to have results in the near future. Having said that, I would like to focus in thispresentation on some issues that actually I think we still need to work on the international agendaand particularly on the international dimension of the relationship between human rights and tax law.Regardless, I will mention some of the consequences within countries that may come out from the demands of human rights on taxation. After reviewing the connection between human rights and tax and flagging some points that still need to be worked out from the legal perspective, I will refer to the cooperativerole between multilateral international organizations in moving forward with legal reforms on international tax law. As you may see, actually I want to focus on the bricks of tax reforms and the technical work that needs to be done, mainly regarding to your question, Chair. From the human rights perspective,the connection between human rights and tax is clear from a political perspective. There are at least three arguments for the importance of taxation for human rights ends. First, the basic idea of financinghuman rights. All rights, even 1st generation civil and political rights that imply negative liberties require public spending for protection and assurance. Hence, the demand for resources is even more significant regarding 2nd and 3rd generation human rights that imply the provision of socialrights. The following two arguments reinforce the importance of getting the resources through taxes rather than other means. The 2nd argument is based on the connection between democracy and taxation. A transparent tax system where everyone pays its due and inequality is tamed to secure equalpolitical participation and influence in public affairs is ensured through a redistributive tax system in which no avoidance and evasion are permitted. Finally, the 3rd argument shows the connectionbetween human rights and the tax systems as both work together to ensure individual liberty and autonomy. In this way, human rights and taxation show that our radical autonomy can only be achieved collectively. Tax justice network has framed all these arguments on the four Rs of tax, revenue,redistribution, repricing and political representation. To sum it up, from the human rights perspective, the relation between human rights and tax law comes down to a fundamental principle. The realizationof human rights demands more revenue from progressive tax systems. However, another relevant issue must be considered from the political perspective. The protection of human rights also depends on howstates spend revenue. Collecting taxes is a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure human rights as there is no linear relation between the two. An adequate public spending policy and publicinstitutions able to fulfill the work of the state are also necessary for that end. Some authors have argued that human rights law provides alternatives to demanding legal changes on tax issues to secure human rights. Those arguments highlight a chance to demand the fulfillment of this political demandbased on UN countries' human rights commitments and the legal architecture in ECOSOC. The European code of human rights could be an example of how this legal claim could work. However, some issues still needto be addressed. For example, what about the possibility of human rights being a limitation on the tax agenda, for instance, through the human right to privacy? What happens when the enforceability of rights brings inequalities for those that are not part of the legal claim? What about the possible disequilibriumof public finances in developing countries after a judicial decision on the assurance of social rights?To what extent does the warranty of social rights through international human rights claims imply going over democratic processes in sovereign states when there is no clear violation of human rights? Whenanalyzed from the perspective of tax law now, human rights show the importance of progressive, transparent tax systems and on the contrary, the problems that regressive tax systems and noncompliance can imply for equality and the funding of social rights, especially for developing countries. Toevaluate this influence, I want to distinguish between tax policy and tax reform. Human rights are a significant influence when designing the architecture of tax systems. In this dimension, human rights discourse has highlighted the consequences of regressive tax systems for inequality and the funding of socialrights within countries. For example, in the necessary increase of tax to GDP ratios. It has also shown the importance of international coordination because of the consequences that unilateral countries' decisionshave for diminishing revenue in other countries in a world without frontiers for capital. However, whatthe discussion can bring to improve the technicalities of taxation needs to be clarified. At the level of the BRICS, that is tax law and especially international tax law has not been directly affected by human rightsdemands. Beyond the demands for transparency and measures to secure taxation of multinational enterprisessuch as anti-avoidance and anti-evasion policies designed to make those businesses pay where they effectively earn income, human rights still need to be able to show how tax law should be reformed.In other words, important as they are, human rights discourse has yet to transform the traditional way in which taxes are demanded from taxpayers or the consequences that an understanding of human rights has for global distributive justice by globally redistributing revenue for developing countries.To unpack these ideas, it is helpful to scrutinize the work of international organizations in international tax law. It is a fact that during the last 15 years, the international tax reform agenda has become areality. Motivated by the economic and social demands raised after the 2008 subprime economic crisis, it focused mainly on ensuring that multinational enterprises pay their fair share. The work of the OECD through the BEPS project aimed at reinforcing anti-avoidance and anti-evasion rules forthe digital world that defied the traditional application of tax law. The OECD's recommendations gained tracked and beyond criticism were adopted across the globe. When these measures showed their limits, the OECD reformed the agenda to include the negotiation of a global minimum tax in the inclusiveframework of BEPS. Undoubtedly, this work has brought tremendous progress and concrete results emerging from the collaboration on international tax matters facilitated by the OECD over the last few decades.At the local level, examples are the continuous demand to increase the tax to GDP ratio through progressive tax systems and measures to secure transparency. At the international level, examples are the transformational developments in transparency through the implementation of exchange informationstandards that have resulted in identifying billions of dollars of tax revenue for developed and developing countries. Since 2009, nearly 126 billion Euros in additional tax revenues have been identified as aresult of the exchange of information. Secondly, the establishment of BAT guidelines in the context of e-commerce which has resulted in access to billions of dollars in revenues for developing countries.Thirdly, measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting including through the adoption of a global minimum tax and fourthly, the provision of significant technical assistance and capacity building programs including through strong and effective partnerships with the United Nations. The OECD tried to broadenparticipation in its tax work to promote inclusivity. For example, the global forum of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes includes nearly 170 jurisdictions. The inclusive forum onBEBS includes 143 members and 147 jurisdictions participating in the convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters. However, the work of the OECD is criticized because of its lack of inclusivenessand inequality in substantive decision making. It is also criticized for favoring the interest of capital exporting countries, damaging the interest of developing countries. That criticism led to two recent UN resolutions as Mr. Dersu was saying before. The 1st is the promotion of international cooperationto combat illicit financial flows and strengthen good practices on assets returned to foster sustainable development as a result of which the UN Secretary General delivered a report in which three alternativesto replace the work of the OECD were proposed. That debate ended in the 2nd resolution adopted by the UN, promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the United Nations. According to this last resolution, a UN framework convention on international cooperation will be createdthrough a process that will strengthen international tax cooperation to be fully inclusive and more effective.That process implies establishing a member state-led open-ended intergovernmental committee for the purpose of drafting terms of reference for a United Nations framework convention on international tax cooperation. Results are expected to be obtained soon. In this scenario, some aspects are relevantto consider. Firstly, for a country like Chile, ensuring collaboration rather than competition between the OECD and the UN seems important. In a complex geopolitical scenario, if these multilateralorganizations collaborate, their advantages will benefit the political and technical debate on international tax issues. On the contrary, competition will only benefit the status quo and endangered progress.Secondly, on the technical dimension, if SDGs and human rights want to be protected beyond building on what has already been advanced, discussions on the following topics I believe need to be addressed.Firstly, the definition of tax avoidance rather than evasion. Improving the minimum global tax of multinational enterprises on the scope, tax base and tax rates. Personal income tax, social securitycontributions, consumption taxes like digital VAT, the improvement of tax administrations, the effective and fair taxation of extractives, environmental taxes, and very importantly, property, wealth and inheritancetaxes should be included in this discussion. In this ambitious agenda, only cooperation will move us forward. The OECD work does not prohibit countries from establishing unilateral measures that go beyond what its standards establish as a floor. On the contrary, it sets up the conditions for collaborationin a scenario where compromise is the only way forward between sovereign states. Securing the right to tax according to economic activity plus some level of redistribution according to that principle, what I understand are the aims of what has already been discussed in tax policy internationally,work and particularly the work on the global minimum tax seems much better than the scenario we live in, even if it can be improved. A completely different alternative such as establishing a global taxauthority able to redistribute revenue according to country's needs rather than based on real economic activity does not seem fit yet for the world as it is. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr.Ambassador, for your remarks and for your insight that you just shared, not only from a regional perspective but also in terms of the outlook, in terms of measures of what can be done differently. I very much appreciated and liked your sentence on capital has no borders but does it also mean that it shouldn'thave no rules? And on that, I would like to move on to the last panelist, Ms. Liz Nelson from the tax justice network. In fact, just to further develop what's been already now outlined in terms of howto walk the talk and the question is as follows: How can human rights be effectively operationalized, implemented, to strengthen the UN Framework Convention on International Taxation Cooperation that has already been outlined by the previous speakers in the fight against illicit financialflows and corruption? What do you think from your perspective and also your practice in the past are some of the main or key human rights tools and measures that could be included in such a frameworkto specifically target tax motivated illicit financial flows? It's a lot but looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm very grateful to the office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and for Co-Chairs Chile and Luxembourg for the invitation to join this 6th intersessionals meeting and really for the tax justice network, I'm very pleased as has beenquoted a couple of times already but for the broader tax justice movement to contribute our kind of analysis and recommendations. So to try and answer your questions just something of a kind of contextreally which we have heard a bit today, the focus of my comments will provide a summary both of the scale and impact of tax abuse and reiterate some long standing policy recommendations which identifykey areas for tax policy reform in support of a human rights based economy. The geopolitical environmentof which we have heard a lot today and the unequal distribution of resources between global north and global south countries brings into focus the nature of the weak and regressive market driveneconomic models that operate today. Such models give lip service to the intention to address sustainable development and to establish a human rights based economy. People suffer from discrimination and disadvantageassociated with poverty and marginalization as a result of these market driven approaches. The failure of duty bearers particularly the state to establish an economic environment that has at its heart a regimeof progressive and cohesive tax policies thwarts any ambition or obligation to realize economic, social and cultural rights. We have heard already mentioned the four R's of tax. So tax justice can be definedas a state in which the people of any given society are fully able to achieve these four R's of tax. That's revenue to source public services sustainably, redistribution to curb overlapping inequalitiesthat deny human rights, repricing of public goods and bad such as carbon emissions as part of a broader policy packages to prevent social harm and effective representation often not discussed where tax underpinsstate citizen relations in such a way as to promote responsive accountable governance. And just as tax was the form of much extraction from the former colonies, taxation will ultimately be the source offunds to make reparation on some of the damage inflicted. For example, a significant share of the current economic extraction from lower income countries results from the international tax rules producingan unfair distribution of taxing rights. Those rules could equally be reformed to reverse the direction of that distribution. The tax justice is defeated by international obstacles through opportunities foranonymous ownership and illicit movement of assets and income streams. At the domestic level, failures of transparency and scrutiny can allow elite lobbying to neuter progressive taxation over time and toundermine social contract. In 2020, our state of tax justice report estimated that 427 U.S. billion dollarsin tax each year was lost to international corporate tax abuse and tax evasion. Analysis from the grade project at St. Andrews University used this estimate of global tax revenue losses and found that everyyear 17 million more people could benefit from clean water and 34 million from basic sanitation if revenue losses due to global tax abuse were reversed. Moreover, over a ten-year period, these gains would be associatedwith the prevention of 600,000 child deaths and 73,000 maternal deaths. So loss revenues also imply damage to other aspects of effective taxation. In terms of redistribution, the inability to deliver progressiveand direct taxation of income profits strips countries of the key tool to curb inequalities. The direct tax revenue lost to tax abuse are also a proxy for the scale of damage done to the prospects forinclusive political representation. Research by the grade project confirms this, too, with the damage done to countries' governance providing a multiplier mechanism that further exacerbates social harms.Some progress has been made since 2013 when the OECD was mandated by the G20 to propose fundamental reforms in global tax policy and tax transparency. The 1st effort in the base erosion and profitshifting initiative delivered only patchwork progress, but the renewed attempt from 2019 reached something ofa milestone in 2021 when 137 jurisdictions agreed in principle to a two-pillar proposal. The 1st pillar proposed for a small reallocation of taxing rights from the country where a multinational company isresident to the countries where they actually operate and generate their economic value, while the 2nd pillar proposes a minimum tax of 15%. However, the 1st pillar seems unlikely to be impactful even ifadopted, having lost most of the original ambition. The 2nd pillar has been adopted by the EU and a number of corporate tax havens, but most of these jurisdictions that agreed in principle have notyet committed to legislate either proposal. Perhaps unsurprisingly as each proposal has changed very notmuch since 2021. The OECD had estimated that the 2021 minimum tax proposal of 15% would increase globaltax revenue by 220 US billion annually, an increase of around 9% in corporate income taxes, but not total tax revenues. These statements are not backed by our own analysis or by independent research. The latterresearch identifies a range of potential worldwide gains that is between only a quarter and a half of that projected by the OECD. Moreover, the revenues will not accrue to those struggling governments,especially in the globe, but instead will overwhelmingly be captured by the corporate tax havens which have been the most enthusiastic adopters thus far. The tide has turned against the current regime of internationaltax governance. A recent letter addressed to the Secretary General of the OECD from UN experts with special mandates to investigate human rights violations demands answers for its failure to abide by humanrights standards in its leadership of international tax policy. In the formal communication, the mandate holders call on the OECD to demonstrate that it has assessed human rights impacts of the two pillarproposals. So the policy reforms are needed to curb global tax abuse and elicit financial flows by establishing the governance of international tax rules which is truly inclusive and transparent. Wecall for a set of financial transparency policy reforms. Short hand is the ABC as follows: Automatic information exchange of financial account information between jurisdictions to end bank secrecy byproviding transparency over offshore accounts to home tax authorities. For the registers of beneficial ownership that identifies the real beneficial and legal owners of companies, foundations and other legalvehicles so that civil society and revenue authorities crucially are able to identify ownership structures and demand accountability whether for tax abuse or for or the laundering of criminal proceeds. Formultinational companies to report their accounts publicly on a country by country reporting basisrather than as if it was one company. In addition, unitary taxation is proposed to end corporate tax abuse by ensuring that profits are taxed in the location of the real underlying economic activity,building yes on the technical work in the OECD's 1st pillar and applying to all profits of all multinationals. Alongside this, global governance reform centered on the establishment of a genuinelyglobally inclusive process for setting of tax rules and standards. Progressive taxation is fundamental to the achievement of rights. Every human being is affected by the partial and an equal achievementof tax justice. As mentioned before, countries are on course to lose 4.8 trillion in U.S. dollars in tax to tax haven over the next ten years. The equivalent of this to losing a year wide spending on publichealth. We have reached a point of great momentum in the governance of global tax. Last year countries at the UN again as mentioned adopted by a majority a resolution for the creation of an inclusiveintergovernmental committee to set the terms of reference for a framework convention on tax. We must really seize this unique opportunity to achieve finally the set of core tax justice policy measuresand thereby ensure that the benefits are shared between countries and at all income levels. Thank you. Thank you so much, Ms. Nelson. Thank you for highlighting challenges but also concrete measuresand this momentum that we have and that we can make an opportunity and also reality out of designing taxation systems again that deliver for people on the planet. With that I would like to hand over to the Chair and the President. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Madam Moderator for moderatingan enriching session and we will now turn to a final round of interventions from the floor. The rules for this are the same as previously. Raise your name tag if you would like to speak and with that I wouldlike to give the floor to the Ambassador of Ecuador in the name of a group of countries 1st followedby India. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Madam Moderator, I have the honor of speaking on behalf of the core groupof the Resolution on Human Rights and Agenda 2030. We thank the High Commissioner and all panelists for their insightful presentations today. At last year's SDG Summit we heard loud and clear that progress onthe SDG and on respect for human rights is at risk. Secretary General Gutierrez has called for the international financial architecture to be reformed urgently, calling it outdated, dysfunctional andunjust and important reform efforts are now underway. High Commissioners Turk and the office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights have for their part presented a coherent and compelling narrative forthe need to shift to human rights economies which place the economy at the service of the realization of human rights. This requires a profound transformation in how governments worldwide understand their rolein their international human rights obligations. Almost all countries have ratified the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights which requires states to take steps to the maximum of itsavailable resources toward the progressive realization of these human rights. We need more visionary solution to realize an urgently needed just transition for our world beset by multinational crisis, multidimensionalcrisis including the environment, numerous conflicts and staggering inequality reflected in the levels of extreme poverty and hunger. The core group of the human rights in agenda 2030 resolution welcomes theideas shared by the High Commissioner and his office as well as by other panelists and looks forward for their presentation to the Human Rights Council at its 56th session in time for the summit of the future.Thank you for your attention. Thank you, sir. I give the floor to the Distinguished Delegate of India followed by the Ambassador of Poland. Thank you, Chair. We believe that illicit financial flows andcorruption have nullified the positive effects of international development assistance programs globally.In a world rocked by cascading microeconomic crisis, the developing countries are facing an uneven recovery and in several cases the gains in development and poverty reduction have effectively been reversed. We believe that transparency in the functioning of international financial institutions and greateraccess to digitization can help in stemming illegal financial flows globally. In India, we have been able to add a large segment of population and economic activities in the formal economy by implementationof digitization in financial payments and ensuring that the benefits have last mile connectivity.Stemming illicit financial flows not only requires a comprehensive reform of an inequitable global financial system but also new innovative international tax cooperation. The Global South has been working on these issues in Geneva and across other multilateral platforms. We would also like to point out thatduring the recent G20 Presidency of India, the matter of corruption and illicit financial flows was developed upon quite thoroughly. The G20 reaffirmed its commitment to support the financial action task force and operationalization of the global operation network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities.During India's G20 Presidency, the Member Countries also reaffirmed commitment to continue concrete efforts and share information on action towards criminalizing foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation in line with Article 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Thankyou. Thank you, sir. And the floor is for the Ambassador of Poland followed by the representative of the South Center. Thank you very much, Chair. Madam Moderator, at the outset, let me thank the core group of the resolution for organizing today's meeting together with the office of the High Commissioner.Many thanks also to you and to the panelists for the insightful discussion. In Poland's view, strong institutions based on principle of good governance are a prerequisite for sustainable development. For most countries, public finance raised through tax remains the most solid source of financing for theSDGs. Corruption or tax evasion not only weakens trust in governments but also erodes the tax system, leaving less money for investments. In recent years, Poland has significantly improved the efficiency ofits tax system. In just eight years, the value added tax revenue collected increased by almost 90%. Corporate income tax increased over 180%. Poland has also introduced several modifications in tax policysuch as tax reliefs which translated into improved living conditions for citizens, especially those from lower income groups. It is clear that without increased tax revenues, it would have been impossible for Poland to introduce many of child welfare programs, for instance. Now Poland is readyto share its experience with other countries to support them on their path to effective taxation.The Center for Tax Solidarity operating within the Ministry of Finance coordinates tax cooperation projects with international partners to boost their domestic resources mobilization and enhance their capacity to achieve their own SDG-related targets. To conclude, let me underline that increasingefficiency of a tax system makes it fairer for everyone. It is thus a concrete solution that can contribute to enhancing the social solidarity and delivering on the promise to leave no one behind.I thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. And we have our final speaker from the South Center now, please. Thank you, Mr. President. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the South Center, an intergovernmental organization of 55 developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America andthe Caribbean is pleased to share its insights on the topic being discussed today. Corporate taxation is a major revenue generator for governments to successfully achieve the SDGs. However, tax avoidance has accelerated to approximately $1 trillion of profits being shifted to tax havens in 2022 leadingto corporate tax revenue losses that were an equivalent of nearly 10% of corporate tax revenues collected globally. One of the reasons for this is that a plethora of highly complex international tax rules produced under the auspices of the OECD comprising the OECD inclusive framework and theglobal forum on transparency are inefficient to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance, thereby affecting developing countries' capacity to eradicate extreme poverty and achieve SDG 1. This also means that countries, especially developing countries, are unable to mobilize the maximum available resourcesto achieve the realization of obligations under the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. Not only are developing countries in particular losing much needed revenues through illicit financial flows and corruption, but they are also at a receiving end as far as the allocationof taxing rights is concerned, especially in the context of the digital economy. This can be seen clearly in the solution developed in the OECD inclusive framework for taxing the digital economy known as the amount A multilateral convention. This solution is highly complex and appears unlikelyto be implemented owing to the opposition from major developed countries. The South Center and the coalition for dialogue on Africa carried out the world's 1st country level revenue estimates on amount A in 2022 and found that it would generate a maximum of $5.5 billion for the 84 combined MemberStates of the South Center and the African Union, all developing countries. The alternative solution of the United Nations known as Article 12B by contrast would provide developing countries with more than twice the revenue of $11.4 billion. The potentially minimum impact of the amount A multilateral conventionas well as the inefficacy of the existing rules and base erosion and profit shifting are not by accident as they have been negotiated in the OECD inclusive framework which has no statutory basis, no transparency, no democratic decision making, no rules of procedure to govern its functioning and isaccountable exclusively to OECD and G20 countries. All of these shortcomings also impede the achievement of SDG 16 on broadening and strengthening the participation of developing countries in global governance institutions. In this context, the South Center strongly welcomes the resolution to beginthe negotiation of a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation. The South Center has actively supported this direction from the beginning as such a convention can allow developing countries to be full participants in agenda setting and decision making in international tax rules in agenuinely inclusive environment. We call on all developing countries to actively participate in the Intergovernmental Committee that has been set up to negotiate the terms of reference of the convention and to nominate their best officials from foreign and finance ministries as well as tax administrations.The terms of reference are to be finalized by August 2024 giving developing countries a very tight window of opportunity which must be used to the fullest to achieve this once in a lifetime opportunity for reforming the international tax system. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, inconclusion, I conclude, I reiterate that the South Center will continue to support its Member States and other developing countries to achieve a fairer international tax system that can provide the much needed resources for fulfilling human rights and achieving the 2030 Agenda. I thank you. Thank youvery much. I apologize there are still two NGOs speakers to go. The 1st one is the Institute for Human Rights followed by the Center for Economic and Social Rights. Please. Thank you, Mr. President.Institute for Human Rights acknowledges the steps undertaken by the Human Rights Council in aligning with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The proactive engagement and contribution of the state stakeholders and NGOs have significantly advanced the objectives outlined of the UnitedNations Conventions Against Corruption. Corruption itself violated human rights on the many levels and particularly undermines the goal 16 which is aimed to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all and build effective accountable and inclusive institutions. We stronglybelieve that corruption serves as main restraint in the meeting of the 2030 Agenda and it's vital to ensure fiscal transparency globally. Against the backdrop of fragile peace and democracybacksliding, it's increasingly crucial to view corruption as integral component of the mostegregious human rights violations. We regretfully acknowledge that corruption forces and enables authoritarian regimes to retain power for decades. Institute for Human Rights is deeply concerned about the recent backlash against anti-corruption activists and investigativejournalists in Azerbaijan and impunity of the institutions that are involved of their il
