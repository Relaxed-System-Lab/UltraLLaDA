But no abandoning it when you get bored like you did with the camper van renovation business\r\nAlan: well that business was just a hobby. It was never going to make much money. \r\nRob: Well that's not quite what you said at the time. \r\nAlan: OK, well I'll send you the figures and you can see for yourself if I have left anything out.\r\nRob: Alright. I will have a look at it later in the week. A bit busy right now.  \nSummary: Alan wants to start a business connected with fruit sushi and predicts big profit.

And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.\r\nHenning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.\r\nHenning: Somehow, because their status is higher.\r\nMax: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.\r\nHenning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.\r\nMax: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well\r\nHenning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.\r\nMax: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.\r\nHenning: Berlin is a big city though\r\nMax: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid\r\nHenning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.\r\nMax: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.\r\nMax: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. \r\nMax: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!\r\nMax: just bullshit! Luis is so communists but keeps blushing conservative and nationalist stuff.\r\nMax: And in Poland they are sometimes super nice - new American-style capitalist and servile and sometimes the \"communist\" remnants.Throwing your plate in front of you with a hostile \"proszĘ\" with a long accent on the hiper-correct \"ę\".\r\nMax: And then one is confused about his/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture/climate/language/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.\r\nMax: even me! The single biggest anti-nationalist of Europe 🤣\r\nHenning : Hehe, you got passionate!\r\nMax: a bit\nSummary: Max thinks that waiters/waitresses shouldn't be framed by their nationality. \nDialogue: Konrad: My brother has played fortnite for sometime too but now we are kinda League of Legends.\r\nTom: I’ve never heard of that.\r\nKonrad: It’s very popilar game.

Just plan the resin brake accordingly since the resin front on the top will flow faster than the on the mold surface\r\nChris: so would shooting from the side keep it even top and bottom? Maybe thats my issue with pinholes sometimes\r\nJoel: Doubt it, it’s the flow mesh that makes the top flow faster.\r\nJoel:  Best way to test is small panels done on a piece of glass so you can see what’s going on\r\nChris: Im about out of my inter-laminar flow media and dont know where to get more, that seemed to help with the speed of fill.\r\nJoel: I’ve tested with several flow meshes but never any that go in between the layers. The blue mesh seems to flow about twice as fast as the green even though they look identical other than the color\r\nJoel: But it seems letting the flow go as slow as you can get away with without it kicking too early is better at eliminating pin holes. It seams that when the resin travels fast it’s more likely to leave tiny bits of air trapped\r\nChris: I had some woven glass stuff that was stiff and didnt distort, like a flow mesh but I got it from a guy and dont know where to get rolls of it\r\nChris: my epoxy is 1500cps mixed.... slow is an understatement\r\nJoel: Yeah you might wanna find something thinner\r\nChris: :)\nSummary: Joel has tested with several flow meshes and the blue one seems to flow about twice as fast as the green one.

That's alright I'll tell you a joke.\r\nSimon: Any more?\r\nAlan: A stitch in time saves nine. I don't understand how you can stitch time in the first place, and why it should save nine instead of seven or eleven, for example.\r\nSimon: That was the original title of the Outlander novel, you know?\r\nAlan: What \"A Stitch in Time saves Nine?\"\r\nSimon: No, just \"A stitch in time\". That was what Diana Gabaldon called it. Later on they changed the further issues of Book one to Outlander and called it the Outlander series and the TV shows were always just called Outlander.\r\nAlan: About the best historical drama ever made, in my opinion. Really insightful about the eighteenth century. You can almosot feel as if you have lived in it.\r\nSimon: I agree. The only better series I know is Breaking Bad, but that's a completely different genre.\r\nAlan: Both BB and Outlander are hard to cast when it comes to genre. I would say they transcend genre. But you are right, they are very different. \r\nSimon: which do you like better?\r\nAlan: I would still say that BB is the single best TV series ever made, and that by a wide margin. However, once you have seen it from beginning to end and you know what is coming, you don't want to watch it again.\r\nSimon: Right. Whereas you can watch all the Outlander series several times just for the historical insight and the atmosphere as well as the artistic beauty of the scenes and cinematography.\r\nAlan: Yes and Catriona Balfe\r\nSimon: Indeed. There's nobody on Breaking Bad who quite equals her, is there?\r\nAlan: I quite liked Marie Schrader and Jessie's girlfriend who chokes on her own vomit, but Skyler is not exactly my type:\r\nSimon: No. And anyway none of them can hold a candle to Catriona. \r\nAlan: She's a gorgeous woman and a fantastic actress.  \r\nSimon: She and Sam really bring the books to life.\nSummary: Alan and Simon are fans of Breaking Bad and Outlander although they are different genres. The Outlander novel Dana Gabaldon used to be called \"A stitch in time\". Cationa Baife is an Outlander character.

Did they have a schedule?\nDaniel: Well, basically, they were patrolling the streets twice a day – during the day and in the evening, always in twos.\nGina: Could you please talk to your friend so they can help us organise it?\nDaniel: Sure, no problem.\nKate: I think that we can also organise a fundraising for CCTV.\nMichael: Hm, I’m not so sure people will be keen on this.

Saturday is it?\nKate: Yes, I can talk to them. I’m not a big fan of camera either, but in this case it may be the best solution.\nDaniel: Especially as the police is not doing their job. Three burglaries in a week is three too many in my opinion.\nGina: It’s not an easy case, but I think CCTV may help to catch them if not to scare them away.\nMichael: Hm, let’s wait until Saturday so we can speak to others. We can’t do anything without their approval.\nDaniel: I’d happily suggest organising the neighbourhood watch.\nSummary: There has been another burglary in the neighbourhood. They stole a tv, two laptops and a bit of cash. The police are investigating.

If the servant took the money, the mistress would know. And if the servant missed the coin completely, she clearly wasn't doing her job.\r\nOlive: Now that I've gotten that (interesting, but completely useless) fact out of the way, I think the only thing I can say is: hang in there. Or better yet - don't give them (aka your boss) a reason to fire you.\r\nOlive: Right now, you're in a tough situation because you need the job more than they need you - so, even though it's unfair (and I completely agree with you btw), the only way to win the war is to not let them get you down.\r\nOlive: Man... I suck at giving advice.\r\nRobin: Completely useless information is always useful for pub quizzes, flattered, deffinatly go with flattered\r\nOlive: What about the remainder of my answer... ?\r\nRobin: the advice is good, and your right I just need to push through it, as for military I've not a clue, run with the pups try and rehabilitate my joints and see if theres any career I can do, although im also looking at museum's as a possible career \r\nOlive: That could be fun - it's interesting, right? :D\r\nOlive: Have you tried getting a job there?\r\nRobin: Looking online atm but I haven't seen much\nSummary: Robin had an argument with a female colleague at work. He works with Stewart, ex-policeman, that has the same problems. Female night staff and cleaners put the rubbish on the floor to check if he hoovers it. She doesn't do any paperwork.

Anyway\r\nFrannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)\r\nJim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language\r\nFrannie: Ok\r\nJim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one\r\nFrannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?\r\nJim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on\r\nFrannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?\r\nJim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries\r\nFrannie: Ok\r\nJim: I have a question too\r\nFrannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes\r\nJim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November\r\nFrannie: Ok\r\nJim: So... what was exactly the story with the name \"Mediolanum\"?\r\nFrannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant \"p\" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for \"father\" was \"athir\" (vs. \"pater\" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars \"Mediolanum\" came from \"medio-\" and \"planum\" because there is no \"p\", so it's basically \"in the middle of the plane\".\r\nJim: Ok! Thanks\r\nFrannie: You're more than welcome, you helped me too\r\nJim: ;)\r\nFrannie: Good luck for tomorrow!\r\nJim: Godspeed!\nSummary: Frannie and Jim are worrying about their exam tomorrow.

My sister had just taken a bad fall in the bathroom hitting her L lower rib cage against an edge of a bathtub and is experiencing general pain. She doesn't think she's broken anything. Would you think it might be something demanding medical attention?\r\nPeter: Good evening Tim, I'm still in bed reading, Emma is asleep, so I'll stick to writing. Firstly, sorry to hear that but don't worry. If she can still move and talk, it can't be too bad. She doesn't spit blood, does she?\r\nTim: No.\r\nPeter: Is the impacted area swollen?\r\nTim: No.\r\nPeter: BTW when did it happen?\r\nTim: Not more than an hour ago.\r\nPeter: Is she alone? Sorry I mean immediate help if her condition deteriorated.\r\nTim: She lives alone. Her next door neighbours are just across the yard but I don't think they would be much help, being old themselves.\r\nPeter: Do you think she'll be capable of phoning in case of an urgent need?\r\nTim: I should think so. Well, she texted me after the accident.\r\nPeter: While you talked to her, was she lucid?\r\nTim: We couldn't talk because of my wife and the baby in the same room. She also preferred to write, since, as I suppose, it was less painful that talking. And yes – she was absolutely lucid.\r\nPeter: Of course I cannot say anything definite without examining her but judging by the symptoms you've described I'd tend to say that it's just soreness due to the impact of the fall. But she has to observe her body.\r\nTim: Exactly what I told her! Should she see a doctor?\r\nPeter: She might if she feels worse. What she may need, however, are painkillers. Tell your sister not to hesitate to take painkillers. Even strong ones. For that she may need a prescription.\r\nTim: Will they advise me at the drugstore when I describe the case? Anything over the counter?\r\nPeter: If you're going to get them for her, take IBU-ratiopharm 400 g, 20 pills, and 10 pills of the same but 600 g. She may want to start with the stronger one.\r\nPeter: Yes, they're available over the counter.\r\nTim: It's so generous of you to let me have all this advice at this late hour. I really appreciate it, Peter. Thank you very much.\r\nPeter: Really nothing to thank for. Glad I could help. Let me know how she's doing.\r\nTim: I will. Thank you again. And good night.\r\nPeter: Good night, Tim.\nSummary: According to Peter, Tim's sister should observe her body after the fall and take painkillers\nDialogue: Tom: I'm from Straya and you?\r\nPaula: Minesota\r\nTom: Ya in the US are very self-confident\r\nPaula: I wouldn't say that we're self-confident, we just have good soft skills\r\nTom: Gnarly\r\nPaula: How about Australian people?\r\nTom: We're neither like British people nor the Americans\nSummary: Tom is from Australia.

But the pizza dough is specific\r\nTina: You'll need: 250 grams of wheat flour, 150 ml of warm water, 2 spoons of olive oil, 4 grams of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt and the same amount of sugar\r\nTina: You can also add 2 spoons of mixed herbs to that, but it's optional\r\nMona: Good cuz I have everything besides the herbs!\r\nTina: Awesome, so now the instruction. Ready?\r\nMona: Ready!\r\nTina: Pour the flour and yeast to a big bowl and mix them well\r\nTina: Now add the olive, sugar and salt and mix again\r\nTina: Now, while kneading the dough you need to add water little by little, until you get, say, a ball of dough\r\nMona: Got it!

Apart from anything else it is worse than simply taking a second vote and hopefully being able to withdraw from Article 50 notice.\r\nStephanie: Can we even withdraw now?\r\nFred: Apparently we can do that. There are some opinions that say not, but in reality it would be a big relief to the other countries. \r\nFred: The alternative, having no deal at all, is not only risky for the UK, but could cause big trouble to the rest of the states and of course there are quite big issues in the Eurozone already. This could tip over a very big landslide.\r\nStephanie: So you think we could get a better deal if we hold out?\r\nFred: Right now the optimal strategy would be to stay inside the EU, forget about leaving as we did not know the hurdles that would be placed by the powers that be. We need to work today with other Eurosceptic countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and the other ex-Warsaw Pact countries.\r\nStephanie: To do what?\r\nFred: To change the EU into what we actually want it to be. To radically alter it so that it becomes what we hoped it was going to be.\r\nStephanie: Can that be done?\r\nFred: We see that the Germans have had enough of Merkel. When she goes, Macron also goes. It wouldn't take more than one of those bigger countries going the way of Italy, or a few more of the secondary states like Holland and Denmark, from the western side, to start a programme of deep change.\r\nStephanie: Makes sense. IN the end we all need to have some kind of co-operation in Europe.\r\nFred: Every Brexiteer I spoke to actually wants A European Union, they just don't want THIS European Union.\r\nStephanie: But is there any chance that there will be a second vote.\r\nFred: May has said no, but May could be finished in a week from now. If there is a General Election and all the Conservatives stand on a revote platform with UKIP and Labour saying no re-vote, then the Tories may well win. Then they would have to offer a re-vote.\r\nStephanie: What if we then end up staying in but other countries start defaulting and leaving us picking up the bills which was going to maybe happen to France and Germany?\r\nFred: That's the downside risk. Certainly if we are ever going to leave, the time to do it is now, or stay and fight for a different kind of Union which might not need countries to go crashing out of it that way. \r\nStephanie: I don't know if you will every find a format that 30 countries will be able to agree on. \r\nFred: Either you have to make it so that there is really not that much that they have to agree on, or you make everything so harmonised that it is really one country and everyone is unhappy with something. Where we are now is stuck in the middle, trying to agree and enforce too much, but still with options for countries to do things differently and to look after themselves. We haven't managed to deliver the European dream.\nSummary: Fred would like Great Britain to stay in the European Union but according to him the EU should evolve. Stephanie is sceptic if it's possible to find a solution on which 30 countries would agree.\nDialogue: Mary: Love to know your tips on saving money on a daily basis!\r\nGreg: we cut back on heating, water, electricity\r\nMary: seems easy!\r\nBen: we always follow our shopping list and buy non-brand products at the supermarket\r\nGreg: they are much cheaper and of good quality too\r\nNick: try cheaper shops like Asda, Lidl, Aldi\r\nPeter: we plan meals so as not to throw food away and we have take-away only in emergency\r\nGreg: some people throw away loads! such a waste!\r\nMary: we try not to do that, my mother taught me it’s a sin! ;)\r\nBen: some products are cheaper in huge bags, buy seasonal fruit & veg, eat less meat\r\nMary: meat is very expensive, isn’t it?!\r\nEmma: i save a lot on packed lunches, homemade soups and cakes\r\nPeter: cancel Sky and go for Netflix\r\nTom: give up alcohol and cigarettes perhaps\r\nMary: i don’t drink at all and i’m not a smoker! X\r\nTom: at all?! Yeah, whatever!\r\nSam: never leave a house without snacks for kids! Haha!\r\nGreg: we simply try not to buy thing that we don’t need!\r\nTom: when i go shopping for extra stuff i always carry cash with me and i leave my card at home!\r\nPeter: quit the gym, netflix and other stuff if you don’t actually use them!\r\nZara: i save up every month to pay off my mortgage quicker\r\nGreg: switch to tap water- a lot cheaper than bottled water and better for the environment too!\r\nMary: that is awesome!\nSummary: They give Mary a lot of advice on how to save up money. For instance, she can do her shopping in cheaper supermarkets, buy non-brand products and avoid throwing food away or switch to drinking tap water.\nDialogue: Carrie: Did you listen to the JP Cooper yet?\r\nTank: No, been listening to Pumpkins.

I’m thinking about buying a cross trainer. Does anyone of you have any experience in using it at home? Could you maybe recommend me something?\nAnna: Hi John! I bought my first cross trainer a couple of years ago and I have been using one ever since. The type of the machine greatly depends on your built and how much many you would like to spend.\nJohn: My budget is quite limited as is the space in my living room…\nMichael: I’d advise you to first measure the room to know how big the machine can actually be for you to exercise comfortably and effectively.\nTom: Waste of money, most expensive cloth hanger\nJohn: Hahaha, I hope it won’t be in my case. I’m quite determined to lose some weight. I’m tall and a bit overweight, so I worry that I may break the machine\nAnna: Don’t worry about that. It shouldn’t be a problem, but have a look at the specs just in case.\nMichael: When it comes to the price, cheaper models don’t have as many electronic options as the more expensive do, but I’d advise you to invest in it if you’re being serious about losing weight.\nJohn: Why’s that?\nMichael: You can always exercise with your phone and an app, but it’s not the most comfortable way (tried it myself). It’s good to have at least three preinstalled programmes like weight-loss, interval, etc. Then the machine will think for you.\nAnna: My first cross trainer didn’t have such options and I must admit that I was also training with my phone and keeping my times. Now, when the old broke, I bought a “fancier” model and I definitely don’t regret it\nJohn: Do you have any company you can recommend? Or a specific model?\nSusan: I have OBE8731 Powerstride 18\" Rear Drive and I think it’s ok.\nAnna: I think that in case of cross trainer it really goes down to the price range. You won’t be able to buy a really good equipment cheaply.\nMichael: I agree, especially if you’re determined and interested in your scores. It may sound silly, but I think tracking your progress helps to lose weight.\nJohn: Thank you so much for your advice! I can’t spend too much, but I don’t want to throw my money away on something that won’t serve me…\nAnna: Sure, again, in my opinion it is a thing worth investing in. Look up some tutorials and exercise plans in Google, it will also help you out to achieve your goal.\nMichael: Good luck!\nSummary: John wants to buy a cross trainer but he has both a limited budget and space for it. His friends advise him to invest in more expensive machine if he's determined to achieve his goals.\nDialogue: Patric: Auuu!!\r\nJohn: Auu auuuuu!!!\r\nPatric: What are you up to?\r\nJohn: goin to fish for some fish, if you know what I mean haha\r\nPatric: market square?\r\nJohn: exactly, wanna join?\r\nPatric: you know me xD \r\nJohn: 9PM, as always\r\nPatric: I'll be there\nSummary: Patric and John are meeting up at 9pm at Market Square.\nDialogue: Rafal: Hello, I've attached the reviewed version of you e-mail\r\nAlex: Was it acceptable?\r\nRafal: Yes, good job, both of you!\r\nJohn: <thumb up>\nSummary: Rafal sends Alex and John the revieved version of their e-mail.

When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.\r\nJoddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?\r\nMousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!\r\nJoddie: Who said so?\r\nMousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.\r\nJoddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?\r\nMousie: <file_other>\r\nMousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.\r\nJoddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.\r\nMousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.\r\nMousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!\r\nJoddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!\r\nMousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!\r\nJoddie: Yes, I really no longer understand what's going on in Poland...\r\nMousie: After what's happened nobody does.\nSummary: Mousie told Joddie about the attack on Paweł Adamowicz, the President of Gdańsk, during Jurek Owsiak's Wielka Orkiestra concert. She is convinced that the ruling party Prawo i Sprawiedliwość and its leader Jarosław Kaczyński are to blame for the attack because of their hateful conservative views.\nDialogue: Matt: What's up, man?\r\nPaul: Boring lecture...\r\nMatt: Same here.\r\nPaul: Why do they do this to us? :D\r\nMatt: It's a scheme to drive us out of uni.\r\nPaul: They want to take our jobs, because they fear younger and smarter generation of employees.\r\nMatt: Exactly. :D\r\nPaul: We should tell this to someone! Alert some institutions!\r\nMatt: They are all in this together, if you talk to someone, they'll be on to us.\r\nPaul: You're right. We need to save the world together then.\r\nMatt: Looks like it.\r\nPaul: What's our first move?\r\nMatt: Burgers and beer?\r\nPaul: I'm in!\nSummary: Matt and Paul are at boring lectures.

He's a really nice man and he knows his stuff. But I'm a little intimidated by him and all the material we need to study for his exam.\r\nBobo: Me too.\r\nSisi: I find it a litle overwhelming so I wouldn't like to miss his classes because then I will have even bigger backlog.\r\nBobo: You may have. My notes are usually extensive and detailed but when I come home I understnad more or less half of that.\r\nSisi: Same with me :-( I'd better be there. See you.\r\nBobo: See you.\nSummary: Sisi wishes Dr Phisik's lecture was cancelled just like the last time, but he is already back.
