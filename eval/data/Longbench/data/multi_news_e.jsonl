NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff’s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle’s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff’s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn’t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,” Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot then tried to climb out of the car’s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot’s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was “‘the Michael Elliot,” and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn’t lie about his identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and “a couple of jackets.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said authorities didn’t know Elliot would be in their area — there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area — and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. “The swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. …Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner’s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn’t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie’s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case — namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot’s innocence. A state court denied his request. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA Palestinian teen was reportedly abducted and killed near his home in Jerusalem on Wednesday, apparently in revenge for the deaths of three kidnapped Jewish Israelis buried just hours earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crime, which brought strong condemnations from the Obama Administration and European officials, threatened to throw the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians beyond the control of leaders who were calculating how to respond to the last outrage without further escalating tensions on the ground. But in the space of a few hours, the mood shifted from communal grief over the deaths of the young Israelis to fears of ascending communal violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The abduction followed a night of mayhem by Jewish extremists, about 200 of whom marched through Jerusalem chanting “Death to the Arabs” and assaulting Arab Israelis found on the streets. A few hours later, shortly before 4 a.m., Muhammad Hussein Abu Khdeir, 16, was forced into a car by two men on a sidewalk not far from his home in Shuafat, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. An hour later police discovered a charred body in a forest on the outskirts of the city. Family members said it was Muhammad, who had been on his way to dawn prayers, as was customary during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The settlers killed my son, they kidnapped him and killed him,” his father, Hussein Saed Abu Khdeir, told TIME after returning from Jerusalem’s main police station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He reached for his Samsung smartphone, tapped the screen and pulled up a photo of two young men on a sidewalk. He said the image had been taken from a surveillance camera at a candy store around the corner that recorded the abduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These are the ones who kidnapped my son,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few yards away, dozens of young men flung stones at Israeli riot police assembled two blocks downhill. The riot began shortly after the body was discovered, and went on all day. Police fired foam-tipped bullets and sound grenades. Youths twirled slingshots and the occasional Molotov cocktail. The pavement between the two sides might have been gravel, so littered was it with stones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A row of ambulances stood by a hundred feet behind the tin barricades protesters had erected beside the building containing the Khdeirs’ home. As an ambulance driver reported that more than 60 people had been wounded by 5 p.m., another injured youth arrived, slung across the shoulders of a heavyset man in an orange medic’s vest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement urging both sides “not to take the law into your own hands” and promising to “uncover quickly who is behind this despicable murder and what motivated it.” A relative of one of the Jewish Israeli teens, Naftali Fraenkel, who also held U.S. citizenship, was quoted as saying “If a young Arab man was murdered for nationalistic reasons then it is a horrifying and disgusting act. There is no distinguishing blood from blood. Murder is murder, whatever the nationality or age may be. There is no justification, no forgiveness and no atonement for any murder.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the distance between the sides grows with each incident. At the political level, Palestinian leaders leaped at the opportunity to turn the tables on Israel, which used the teens’ disappearance as a pretense to arrest more than 400 West Bank activists, most of them with the militant Islamist group Hamas that Netanyahu blames for the teens’ deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Israel bears full responsibility for this incident,” Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement, which concluded with a threat to drag Israel before U.N. courts, the most militant course Abbas has been willing to chart. “The Palestinian leadership will continue its discussions following this escalation, including joining international organizations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the ground, pessimism ruled. Hussein Abu Khdeir was asked if he had faith in the Israeli police he had spent most of the day with. “No,” he said. Why not? “Because we’re Arab.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They are not concerned,” volunteered Yousef Mkhemer, a community activist seated across the crowded porch. Alluding to Netanyahu’s historic support for Jewish settlements on the West Bank, he said, “The boss of the settlers is the boss of the government. So he cannot shame himself.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The distrust runs beyond political leader, however, to alternate realities. Many if not most Palestinians refuse to say that the three Israeli teens were abducted at all. Their disappearance is widely regarded as an excuse to force apart the newly minted unity government supported by both Hamas and Abbas’ secular Fatah party — a reconciliation polls show has been enthusiastically embraced by Palestinians, but condemned by Netanyahu, who has repeatedly invoked the teens’ kidnapping as reason for dismembering it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a lie,” said Amjad Dweik, 18, of the Israeli teens’ kidnapping and murder. “As soon as the two parties Fatah and Hamas began the reconciliation, Israel began to make up all kinds of things to ruin the unit.” Hussein Abu Khdeir agreed: “They did it,” he said, referring to Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the next breath, the skeptics describe the abduction of Muhammad as vigilante vengeance for the death of the Jewish teens. Residents say young Jewish Israelis had been stalking Shuafat since the bodies were discovered on Monday. Dweik and others spoke of a boy of 9 pulled away from his mother by young Jews a day earlier on the same street where Muhammad was taken. The boy was saved, they say, when passersby intervened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was scratched,” said Hussein Abu Khdeir, referring to the child, who local residents say had been holding his mother’s hand. “They grabbed him by his neck.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His own son’s abduction and apparent death were likewise revenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Yes, of course,” he said. “There’s no other explanation.”\nPassage 2:\nMedia caption Mohammed Abu Khdair's mother: \"My son wasn't answering\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The funeral of a Palestinian teenager abducted and killed in Jerusalem has been delayed so that a post-mortem examination can be completed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another development, Hussein Abu Khdair said he was held by police for eight hours and put under pressure to say his son's killing was unlikely to be an attack to avenge the deaths of the Israeli youths. Israeli police have denied this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the dead teenager's cousins, Dimah Abu Khdeir, said of Israelis: \"They don't care about us... We're not considered citizens.

This was a direct response to a particular egregious filming of the show in our space which saw our store left a mess, our staff mistreated, our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning, and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed. It was also a direct response to a show which is in every way diametrically opposed to our politics and the vision of society we’re organizing to realize. A show which has had a net negative effect on our neighborhood and the city of Portland as a whole. Shortly after this decision was made, a volunteer placed the Fuck Portlandia sign in our window.

It also does not cover the additional business lost by our neighbors who at times also have to remain closed for filming.

In a world where trans femmes – particularly Black trans women – are being brutalized and murdered on a regular basis for simply daring to exist, dude in a dress jokes are lazy, reactionary, and actively harmful. They’re also just straight up not funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also: there are no Black people on Portlandia. There are a tiny number of people of color on Portlandia. Portland is white but it’s not that damn white. It’s also a city with a deeply entrenched history of racism and white supremacy. In Other Words is in the heart of a historically Black neighborhood in Northeast Portland. We have Black Lives Matter written on our window. Black Lives Matter Portland meets regularly in our space. But as more and more Black folks and people of color have become involved at In Other Words, Portlandia has only gotten steadfastly more white. Oh and also: the last time the show filmed in our space, the production crew asked to us to remove the Black Lives Matter sign on our window. We refused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gentrification Isn’t a Joke NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Portlandia is fueling mass displacement in Portland.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSummary NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigative Highlights NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State employees and agencies engaged in various improper governmental activities, including the following: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » Four employees at several agencies misused state time and cost the State approximately $160,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two employees either took extended breaks or left the premises over a five‑year period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee regularly left early from work over two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » A nursing director removed an LVN, who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position to perform duties typically performed by an office technician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » An official built an unauthorized structure on state property with the help of on‑duty staff under his command. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision. We estimated that the employee failed to account for 312 hours of missed work time, costing the State nearly $9,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Motor Vehicles NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A key data operator at the Department of Motor Vehicles failed to perform her essential duties over a period of nearly four years because she slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. From February 2014 through December 2017, the employee misused more than 2,200 hours of work time as a result of sleeping on the job, costing the State more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Correctional Health Care Services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From May 2015 through July 2016, a director of nursing (nursing director) at a Southern California adult prison removed a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position—or post—providing patient care and reassigned her to perform nurse scheduling duties typically performed by an office technician. During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017. The analyst, her manager, an associate warden, and a personnel specialist all failed to follow CDCR procedure and the California Department of Human Resources' policy regarding inmate supervision pay, which resulted in the overpayments. In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Dominguez Hills NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March 2013, a manager at California State University, Dominguez Hills directed a member of his staff to purchase a Nissan-manufactured electric vehicle quick charger for nearly $7,000 before the manager had performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that the equipment was compatible with the energy resource plan for the campus. The quick charger has remained unused for five years, its warranty lapsed in 2014, and Nissan is no longer manufacturing replacement parts. As of February 2018, the campus told us it will be unable to install the quick charger before 2020 or 2021, if at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) assistant chief misused state resources when he violated his rental agreement by building an unauthorized structure on state property using on-duty staff under his command. In 2016 the assistant chief built a 16-foot-by-20-foot structure with plumbing, electrical, and sewer connections in the backyard of the state residence he rented from CAL FIRE without written approval from CAL FIRE to build the structure as his rental agreement required. He also did not have approval from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is responsible for inspecting state‑owned buildings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report estimates the employee slept three or more hours daily at her desk since February 2014, totaling over 2,200 hours of work time and costing more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee worked as a key data operator. Her duties included \"routine data entry for change of address and new vehicle ownership forms,\" the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She processed less than half the documents that she was expected to – an average of 200 documents a day, when key data operators are expected to process more than 550, according to the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While her supervisors were aware of the issue, the report found that they underestimated the amount of time the employee was sleeping on the job and did not properly follow disciplinary procedures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A supervisor reported waking the employee up \"three to four times each day,\" the report says. It says the work the employee did complete \"was often so inaccurate\" that coworkers wouldn't trust her to correctly enter their address or vehicle ownership change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisors suspected a medical issue was contributing to the employee's problems, which led them to be \"reluctant to take further steps to address the employee’s sleeping and poor production.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee's doctor told the DMV she was unable to perform the duties associated with her job. Subsequently, the employee obtained a physician's release saying she was able to perform her job's duties, the report says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahmoud Ghozlan, spokesman for the Brotherhood, was quoted on the group's Facebook page as saying the abuses were committed by groups that \"imagined they could shake legitimacy or impose their view with force\".\nPassage 2:\n* Rival factions hurl petrol bombs, stones outside palace NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Clinton calls for dialogue on contested constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Vice president offers olive branch to opposition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Yasmine Saleh and Marwa Awad NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAIRO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Islamists fought protesters outside the Egyptian president's palace on Wednesday, while inside the building his deputy proposed a way to end a crisis over a draft constitution that has split the most populous Arab nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stones and petrol bombs flew between opposition protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Mursi who had flocked to the palace in response to a call from the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Islamists were hit in the legs by what their friends said were bullets fired during the clashes in streets around the compound in northern Cairo. One of them was bleeding heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leftist group said Islamists had cut off the ear of one of its members. Medical sources said 23 people had been wounded in clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riot police deployed between the two sides to try to stop the confrontations which flared after dark despite an attempt by Vice President Mahmoud Mekky to calm the political crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said amendments to disputed articles in the draft constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then be submitted to the next parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on Dec. 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference, saying opposition demands had to be respected to reach a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing the gravest crisis of his six-month-old tenure, Mursi has shown no sign of buckling, confident that Islamists can win the referendum and a parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Egyptians yearn for an end to political upheaval that has scared off investors and tourists, damaging the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is canceled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'REAL DANGER' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilization by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men served as guards at the Stutthof concentration camp, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told The Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictments were filed against a 93-year-old man from Borken who served in Stutthof from June 1942 to September 1944 and a 92-year-old man from Wuppertal who was there from June 1944 to May 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges were filed last week at the state court in Muenster but only announced Wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified. Both deny they had any knowledge of killings at the camp, Brendel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 65,000 people died at Stutthof. Some were put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men, who have not been named, both served as guards and also watched over prisoners who were taken outside the camp to work. During the time they were at Stutthof, hundreds of killings occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the SS killed more than 100 Polish prisoners and some 77 Soviet prisoners of war in the camp's gas chamber in 1944. An unknown number of Jews also were gassed there in late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between June 1944 and April 1945, SS members also killed several hundred Jews by shooting them in the back of the neck. SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel’s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a “co-plaintiff” in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can’t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,” Meisel said. “Still, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,” Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel’s description of life in the camp — and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors — are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called “Meydele” for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren’t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could “take the stand as a witness,” or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Important lessons’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel’s son, Michael Cohen, said he’s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to “simply move aside and forget about” those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. “She’s very interested in what comes next,” Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story “for the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: “Don’t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.”\n", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections. Authorities say Meisel and several other Stutthof survivors in the US could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to The Washington Post spokesman, Jim McGrath, released a full statement on Wednesday: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EARLIER: Turn: Washington’s Spies actress Heather Lind has come forward with accusations that President George H.W. Bush sexually assaulted her during a photo opportunity with his wife Barbara Bush standing by his side. Bush has since apologized for the incident saying that it was an “attempt at humor” and that he didn’t mean to offend Lind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lind made the accusations through a lengthy Instagram post that has since been deleted. She recently saw a photo of the 93-year-old wheelchair bound Bush shaking hands with Barack Obama at the One America Appeal hurricane relief concert which prompted her to share her alleged experience saying, “…when I got the chance to meet George H. W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Instagram post continued saying that Bush touched her from behind and told her a dirty joke — all while being photographed. All the while Barbara Bush “rolled her eyes as if to say ‘Not again’.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It seems to me a President’s power is in his or her capacity to enact positive change, actually help people, and serve as a symbol of our democracy,” she continued. “He relinquished that power when he used it against me and, judging from the comments of those around him, countless other women before me. What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She closed the post saying, “My fellow cast-mates and producers helped me that day and continue to support me.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nTATAOUINE, Tunisia — A century ago, fleeing Italian colonizers, the inhabitants of Libya ’s remote western mountains descended upon this wind-whipped Tunisian outpost, many to stay permanently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With those desert plateaus once again under siege, this time by the armies of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, about 30,000 Libyans have repeated their ancestors’ flight. Astonishingly, to aid workers, hundreds upon hundreds of Tunisians, some of them the descendants of those earlier refugees, have opened their homes to these Libyan families since early April, when Colonel Qaddafi’s forces went on the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no sprawling refugee camps at the border, just two modest clusters of tents housing around 2,500 people. The vast majority of the newcomers are now living with Tunisian families here and in neighboring villages, an area that in normal times counts just 150,000 residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s the first time I’ve seen such an impressive response,” said Firas Kayal, a spokesman in Tunisia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That generosity is all the more remarkable, he added, given the challenges Tunisia faces in the wake of its own revolution — which in January ended 23 years of kleptocratic rule by President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali — and previous waves of Libyan refugees this year in the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even some of the refugees seem baffled by it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Would you give your house to someone you didn’t know, from another country?” asked Maren Abouzakhar, 22, who fled the besieged Libyan city of Yafran early this month. She spoke in the airy drawing room of the house she and 10 relatives now shared with a local family; the owner had moved himself, his wife and their three children into the unfinished ground floor, leaving the comfortable, perfumed second story for their guests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We don’t even know how to thank them for something like this,” Ms. Abouzakhar said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abdallah Awaye, 35, a thin, sun-darkened man and the owner of the house, described his gesture as a matter of obligation and pride. “This is how it is, these are our customs,” he said. “If there is something to eat, we will eat it together. If there is nothing to eat, we will have nothing together.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the refugees arrived at the border with little more than the clothes on their backs and fears for the sons they left behind to fight the Qaddafi militias, and were rapidly taken in by local residents whose compassion and good cheer have drawn the admiration of Libyans and international aid workers alike. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Kayal also praised the generosity of the Tunisian government, which has kept the country’s borders open from the start of the Libyan conflict. As many 276,000 people — most of them foreign workers — have fled Libya for Tunisia, according to United Nations estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about their willingness to provide shelter to strangers, residents of Tataouine like to cite an apt local proverb: Travelers cry upon arriving in this desolate place, but leave with tears in their eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January’s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution. And many worry that the country’s transitional government has failed to break with what they call decades of neglect for the arid Tunisian south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Generosity and fraternity have been taking precedence over the problems,” said Ali Mourou, the mayor of Tataouine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, he said, in response to appeals from the city, truckloads of aid have flowed in from as far as Tunis, the capital, 300 miles to the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three local coordinating centers have been opened, placing Libyan families in homes and distributing donated couscous, macaroni, milk and tomatoes, as well as mattresses and blankets. Libyan children have been placed in local schools, and doctors and nurses have opened a clinic offering free medical care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve taken the thing as a human obligation, a religious obligation, an obligation of fraternity,” Mr. Mourou said, and the Libyans have been “truly appreciative.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, “They ought to be.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He worries, though.\nPassage 2:\nTRIPOLI/TUNIS Libya's two-month civil war spilled over the border into Tunisia, provoking outrage in the western neighbor, while rebels in Misrata said only NATO could halt the bombardment of the besieged city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month, as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya's land frontier, when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incursion was brief and limited, and Gaddafi's troops even apologized locally. But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia, where the Arab world's wave of uprisings began late last year, leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the gravity of what has happened ... the Tunisian authorities have informed the Libyans of their extreme indignation and demand measures to put an immediate stop to these violations,\" a Tunisian Foreign Ministry statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country's land borders, artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels seized the post a week ago, as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya's Western Mountains have with the outside world, making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food, fuel and medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast, fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict, which broke out in mid-February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi, Libya's second city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi's soldiers apologized to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border, tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the rebels, who had retreated into Tunisia, counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended, rumors spread that the post was back in their hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the confusion, scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting \"We've won! We've won!\" but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MISRATA'S PLIGHT DEEPENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the port city of Misrata, the rebels' biggest enclave in western Libya, the plight of residents worsened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels accused Gaddafi's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now. A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction. \"Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm's way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas. \"Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The ball is now in NATO's court. After Gaddafi's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters, their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts. This can only be solved by NATO.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts, with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead. It was not immediately clear what the targets were. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official Libyan news agency Jana also said that \"the colonial, crusader aggression\" hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening. Two people were killed and many others were wounded, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert, state television reported. \"Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs,\" it quoted a military spokesman as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But rebels denied this. \"The battle is not over and the situation is unclear,\" said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser.

The richness of primary evidence continually delights.\" —Judith Sealander, author of Private Wealth and Public Life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[No] mere philanthropist [but a] subtle, stinging critic of our racial democracy.\" —W. E. B. DuBois on Julius Rosenwald NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this richly revealing biography of a major, but little-known, American businessman and philanthropist, Peter Ascoli brings to life a portrait of Julius Rosenwald, the man and his work. The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men’s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald’s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald’s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ascoli’s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered.\nPassage 2:\nPHILADELPHIA (JTA) — Alex Bethea, the son of cotton and tobacco farm workers, was in sixth grade in 1965 when his family moved from Dillon, South Carolina, to the tiny town of Fairmont, North Carolina, where he attended a school called Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it wasn’t until this week, 50 years later, that Bethea learned that his school was named for Julius Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who is the subject of a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. The film tells the little-known story of Rosenwald’s contribution to African-American culture and education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation came at a July 14 session at the national convention of the NAACP, which drew several thousand delegates to Philadelphia. Bethea was one of some 70 people who attended a screening of the film, “Rosenwald.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Julius Rosenwald had a great impact on my life, and I didn’t even know it,” said Bethea, now a vice principal at an elementary school in New Jersey. “This helps me put the pieces of the puzzle of my life together.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The philanthropy Rosenwald invested in African-American causes in the early 1900s changed the course of education for thousands of children in the rural South and helped foster the careers of prominent artists, including writer Langston Hughes, opera singer Marion Anderson and painter Jacob Lawrence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country. In addition, he developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to help improve the living conditions for the masses who had migrated from the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,” Julian Bond, the renowned civil rights leader, says in the documentary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner told JTA that her new film on Rosenwald “celebrates the affinity between African-Americans and Jews” that started long before the civil rights movement and speaks to the powerful Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner joined Bond and Rabbi David Saperstein, the former head of the Reform movement’s Religious Action Center who now serves as U.S. ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom, for a discussion after the screening at the NAACP conference. It was while attending a public program 12 years ago on Martha’s Vineyard at which Bond and Saperstein discussed black-Jewish relations that Kempner first learned of Rosenwald’s work with African-Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She calls this film the last of a trilogy documenting the lives of “under-known Jewish heroes.” The first two were about baseball legend Hank Greenberg and radio and TV personality Gertrude Berg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interspersing archival footage with interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), both of whom attended Rosenwald schools, the documentary tracks the ascent of Rosenwald, the son of German immigrants who rose to become one of the most powerful businessmen and philanthropists in early 20th-century America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His father, Sam, who came to America in 1851, began, like so many Jewish immigrants of his time, as a peddler. He eventually settled in Springfield, Illinois, where Julius grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1878, his parents sent the 16-year-old Julius to New York to apprentice with his uncles in the men’s clothing manufacturing business. He returned to Illinois to start his own manufacturing company, and through some business and family connections ultimately partnered with Richard Sears, one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Co. After Rosenwald took over the company in 1908, it became the largest retailer in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outside his business life, Rosenwald was heavily influenced by his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, the spiritual leader of the Chicago Sinai Congregation, and he became a major benefactor of Jewish causes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film’s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film’s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America. He was particularly moved by the race riots in 1908 in Springfield, which are said to have sparked the founding of the NAACP. Hirsch was one of the original leaders of the NAACP, and Rosenwald sponsored its first meetings at his temple. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington, a prominent black leader at the time, and became a funder of Washington’s Tuskegee University in Alabama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Rosenwald gave a $25,000 gift to Tuskegee, Washington suggested taking a few thousand dollars to build six schools for young children. Until then, most black children didn’t attend school, but instead spent their time working in the fields alongside their parents. The few schools that did exist were primitive shacks staffed mostly by untrained teachers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than donating all the money for the schools, Rosenwald gave one-third of the funds needed and challenged the local black community to raise another third and the local white community to contribute the rest. In the end, some 5,300 schools were built with seed money from the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund ‘was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fund soon switched focus and began supporting promising black artists, helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund “was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century,” poet Rita Dove says in the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner calls Rosenwald one of the greatest examplars of American Jewish philanthropy and says she hopes her film – whose official opening in theaters is scheduled for mid-August — will motivate others to continue that tradition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,” she said, noting that he gave away a total of $62 million in his lifetime, but “we can all do something.”\nPassage 3:\nScreenshot from the Rosenwald documentary Julius Rosenwald stands with black American students who attended one of over 5,000 schools he built for African-American students in the 20th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the trailer for the documentary Rosenwald, civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) describes the type of school he went to as a child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was a little school a short distance from my home—walking distance. Beautiful little building. It was a Rosenwald school. It was the only school we had,\" Lewis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Rosenwald school—named after Julius Rosenwald, a 20th-century Jewish philanthropist who made his fortune by co-founding the department store we refer to today as Sears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer, released exclusively by The Root, describes how Rosenwald was a relentless businessman but was also deeply inspired by the works and racial-equality teachings of Booker T. Washington. Or, more specifically, Washington's emphasis on what a solid education could do for the racially disadvantaged in America. So much so that Rosenwald teamed up with Washington, and together they hatched a plan to build over 5,000 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a pretty important endeavor, since segregation prohibited blacks from attending the all-white schools in many Southern states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The late poet Maya Angelou appears in the documentary, which is slated to be released in New York Aug. 14, and the rest of the nation throughout the fall. Angelou spoke about one of the schools she attended as a child, a school that was also built by Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought my school was grand. It was the Lafayette County Training School,\" Angelou said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Civil rights and education-reform activist Julian Bonds is also a product of a Rosenwald school. He explained the significance of a Jewish man in the middle of the 20th century committing himself so vehemently to the idea that black American children must be educated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist, who did not have to care about black people but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" Bonds said.\n", "answers": ["Julius Rosenwald is well known as the 20th-century American businessman who co-founded what we now call Sears. But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

That mission is accomplished. What girls need now is encouragement to become leaders. It's time to take them to the C-suite, where the corporate chiefs work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hewlett Packard CEO and President Meg Whitman smiles as she speaks at a conference on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif. on March 9. Op-ed contributor Jennifer Allyn argues: 'Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today marks the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The event, which now includes our sons too, is still a valuable chance to help children understand the workplace. But the problems that face girls and women have changed in the past two decades, and it’s time for the day’s emphasis to change, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What we need now is Take Our Daughters to the C-Suite Day – the offices occupied by corporate \"chiefs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty years ago, the Ms. Foundation launched the program to demystify the workplace for girls and inspire them to embrace a wide range of careers. Now that women represent half the US workforce, we can fairly say that mission has been accomplished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up just 3.6 percent of CEOs, 14 percent of executive officers, and 16 percent of board directors. Companies need to do much more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on what Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg calls an “ambition gap.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies that are already committing time and resources to Take Our Children to Work Day can help close that gap by shifting their focus in three ways: introducing girls to female role models; more clearly explaining what leaders of both genders actually do; and supporting programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introducing girls to a company’s highest ranking women is an easy step any organization can add to their career day programs – and it’s one that can make a huge difference. Marie Wilson, founder of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, often quotes child-rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman on this topic: “You can’t be what you can’t see.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls want to see role models: A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent had not been offered the opportunity to see these women in action at the workplace. Boys, in contrast, see a variety of male leaders in all aspects of their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies can help girls by using the day to introduce their employees’ daughters to women at the highest level of the company. And highlighting these leaders’ accomplishments will give the women themselves more visibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. The more they understand the specific requirements and rewards of leadership, the better choices they can make about their own careers. How do executives motivate teams, solve complex financial problems, and develop new products? Making the responsibilities, roles, and payoffs of leadership clear from the time girls are in grade-school would help make leadership more tangible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would also help resolve another issue the Girl Scouts identified: More than a third of girls said they wouldn’t feel comfortable trying to lead, and nearly 40 percent didn’t think they were cut out for leadership. Hearing directly from both male and female leaders about what they actually do could help close that gap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, these efforts need to reach beyond a single day in April. Companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. That’s what Princeton University did when it found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I thought it was ridiculous. I couldn’t believe it!” Luke told the Daily News Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York Daily News Shaneice Luke received this bill for $11,672,701.66. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The number is mind-boggling.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city medical examiner ruled the death a homicide in December 2012, citing evidence that Rose died from injuries caused by being physically restrained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luke’s attorneys said their investigation showed that the 5-foot-7, 175-pound Rose was restrained in a dangerous prone position for up to 30 minutes by three staffers, including a 275-pound worker who sat on him.

(AP) — Two years after a 33-year-old mentally disabled man died at a state institution in Queens, and one year after his sister filed a lawsuit accusing the staff of killing him, New York officials have sent her an $11.67 million bill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The claim against Rasheen Rose's estate cited his total Medicaid assistance from Aug. 6, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2012, the day he died.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not doing so would be a violation and could put federal Medicaid funding at risk,\" spokeswoman Jennifer O'Sullivan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medicaid, a state and federal program for the poor, doesn't typically demand reimbursement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ilann Maazel, an attorney who has filed lawsuits against the state after others died in state care, said other claim notices recently have been sent to families suing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is something new we're seeing ... and it's problematic,\" he said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, an advocate for the disabled whose adult son gets state-funded residential care, called it \"retaliation\" and \"an outrage\" to send the bill to someone who lost a loved one from abusive care. \"They're going to punish these people because they brought it to view of justice,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York medical examiner concluded Rose's death was a homicide and that he \"became unresponsive\" while being restrained at Fineson Developmental Center. The Queens district attorney's office said it wasn't notified about the death until that homicide ruling was made four months later. Investigators found no criminal conduct but have left the case open, spokesman Kevin Ryan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaneice Luke, Rose's sister, is seeking unspecified punitive and other damages in a federal lawsuit. She alleges that at least three staff threw Rose to the ground and one sat on him, while other staff stood by. She also alleges a history of abuse at Fineson and failure by supervisors and the state to address that or to train staff properly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rasheen Rose did not receive care remotely associated with the amount of money collected by OPWDD for Rasheen Rose over the 10-year period,\" attorney Aaron DePass replied to the state agency on Luke's behalf. Because he was actually killed by his supposed caregivers, \"it is clear that the quality of care he received does not warrant any payment for services whatsoever,\" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In federal court papers, all seven staff named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing, saying they acted within their professional judgment. The state attorney general and private lawyers are defending them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years ago, a congressional oversight committee reported that New York's residential centers for the developmentally disabled like Fineson, which have largely emptied in an ongoing shift to community-based programs and group homes, cost Medicaid about $1.9 million a year for each patient.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battery-powered toy is designed to slowly peck its way through the surrounding shell after the egg is rubbed, tapped and warmed, according to the lawsuit. But Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield filed the complaint, on behalf of a class of other affected people, against Hatchimals' parent company Spin Master after she says the toy she purchased did not hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk says in the lawsuit that she purchased the Hatchimal for approximately $50 on January 14 as a birthday gift for her daughter. She claims she and her daughter followed directions included in the package and the Hatchimal failed to hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk is suing for damages relating to Spin Master's \"deceptive business practices in selling Hatchimals,\" according to the lawsuit. Her attorney Mark Geragos, alleges that the company misrepresented the toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The product is defective and it's unfortunate for all those people because there was kind of a craze about it,\" Geragos told ABC News. \"They ought to rename it the 'bait and switch.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Geragos said Hedjuk was denied a refund or a product repair. The lawsuit also cites several negative reviews on Amazon.com from other consumers saying the toy was defective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My guess is there will be more lawsuits filed any day,\" Geragos said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released Hatchimals, which retailed for $50 to $60, on October 7, 2016. But the popular toy often sold out, creating a market for resellers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"By November 2016, the products were difficult to find and sold out in many locations, which led to a black market for Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit alleges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon, Hatchimals were selling on e-commerce sites for hundreds of dollars, but many parents and children were allegedly let down after the item failed to live up to its name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the lawsuit said. \"Since children do not know what is inside of the egg,\" the lawsuit alleges that according to a Spin Master senior vice president,\"they get excited about what they may get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit goes onto to say, \"This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit also alleges that Spin Master has failed to take \"proper action to address its malfunctioning product.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After receiving complaints that the toy didn't hatch, the company posted onto Facebook that they are \"100% committed to bringing the magic of Hatchimals\" to all of its customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement to ABC News in December, the company said that while \"the vast majority of children have had a magical experience with Hatchimals,\" it also acknowledged it had received calls from consumers who had \"encountered challenges\" and that, \"To ensure all queries receive a timely response, we have increased the number of Consumer Care representatives, extended our hours, and increased the capacity for callers in the queue to help prevent calls dropped due to the holiday volume.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have also created troubleshooting tips on Hatchimals.com and a video with 'The Top 5 Things to Know About Hatchimals',\" the December statement continued. \"We are committed to doing everything possible to resolve any consumer issues.

Now, that disappointment has led to legal action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, California, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Spin Master, alleging the Hatchimal toy she purchased for her daughter never hatched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that start out inside a spotted plastic egg, and are supposed to hatch when the owner rubs the shell. That process should take 25 to 40 minutes, according to Spin Master's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't the case for \"millions of families throughout this country,\" Hejduk said in her lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Millions of children and families across the globe were sourly disappointed with coal in their stockings, in the form of a bait-and-switch marketing scheme perpetrated by Spin Master, the manufacturers of this Christmas season's 'it' gift, Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the suit continued. \"One of the company's senior vice presidents recognized that getting the toy to hatch 'resonates well with kids' and that since children do not know what is inside of the egg 'they get excited about what they may get.' This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Hatchimal cost about $50, depending on the retailer. However, the part-Furby, part-Tamagotchi toys were popular on the resale market, where they sold for upward of $250. Many parents lined up outside Toys R Us and Wal-Mart stores to purchase the highly sought-after toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, once children opened their Christmas presents, the buzz surrounding the toys quickly turned from, \"Where do I find one?\" to \"This thing doesn't hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I paid triple the price so I could get my 5 yr. old daughter what she wanted but when it was time to play with it the Hatchimal would not respond inside the egg. We watched every YouTube video we could for help, but to no avail ... we had to open it ourselves,\" one customer wrote on Amazon.com, according to the lawsuit.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: This story has been updated to include comment from Spin Master\nPassage 4:\nFRESNO, Calif. (CN) – A federal class action claims that Hatchimals, the nationwide toy craze that hatches from an egg, don’t always hatch, producing unhappiness in families that the filing attorney says can range from “extreme disappointment to tragic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that hatch out of the colored spotted eggs they are sold in. The creature inside is a mystery, making kids excited to see what they may get. The hatching is the toy’s signature attraction, according to the Jan. 19 lawsuit against Spin Master Corp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released the toys in early October 2016, in time for the holidays, and they quickly became the year’s must-have gift. By November they were hard to find. Some parents waited for hours outside toy stores; others paid up to seven times the retail price eBay and other internet sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals typically sold for $50 to $60. They were advertised Monday morning for $79.99 on the Toys Are U website, and for $59.99 on the Wal-Mart website, which, however, was out of stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits off the toy, attorney Ben Meiselas said in an interview, but investigations indicate that its failure rate is exceptionally high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This was an aggressive and brilliant marketing campaign built on a house of cards and lies for a product that was not ready for the market,” Meiselas said. “Spin Master knew it was spinning consumers; they knew the product didn’t hatch.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted the irony of the company’s name: Spin Master. Stories told by families who bought the toy “border on extreme disappointment to tragic, depending on different families’ situations and their ability to purchase these expensive items,” said Meiselas, of Geragos & Geragos in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They were playing on the most visceral emotions of a family: a child’s happiness. It exceeds a mere letdown and caused real damages.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many consumers who tried to solve the problem by contacting Spin Master hit a brick wall, as customer service never returned their calls or messages, “with some customers reporting being on hold for as long as three hours before having their call disconnected,” the complaint states, citing a Dec. 28 article in Global News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead plaintiff Jodie Hejduk seeks to represent both a California class and a national class, though Meiselas says his office has been getting calls from people around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We want Spin Master to stop the spin, be a responsible corporate citizen, and redress the damages to consumers, or it’s headed to a jury of moms and dads, husbands and wives, who will decide whether the product was fraudulent. We think they will,” Meiselas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hopes the class action sends a message to other corporations “looking to exploit the average consumer saving money to buy their kids a gift not to sell a defective product that hits Americans in the pocketbook.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk, who snagged one of the coveted toys for her daughter’s birthday, says her daughter was thrilled to get it, but “dismayed” when it never hatched, though she followed the instructions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other parents have written scathing reviews on Amazon.com and on the Toys R Us website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master promised to address the issues, but the few remedial measures it took were ineffective, according to the 25-page complaint. Hejduk says the company should have recalled the toys or issued refunds, but it did neither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master did not return emailed requests for comment on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its report, the team also concluded that while the site where the wreck was found \"is located in the general area where one would expect to find the Santa Maria based on contemporary accounts of Columbus's first voyage, it is further away from shore than one should expect\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A metal tube Mr Clifford had seen during a 2003 expedition and thought to be a lombard, or cannon, was no longer at the site, the experts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'No trace' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents from the time suggest it ran aground on a reef or sandbank off the northern shore of Haiti on the night of 24 to 25 December 1492. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to these historical sources, Columbus told his crew to strip timbers from the ship to build an outpost or fort nearby, leaving sailors behind while he returned to Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time Columbus returned the following year, the fort had been burned down and the crew members had disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wreck of the Santa Maria was never found. The Unesco experts said it could have been buried by sediment over the past centuries or have been slowly worn down by the waves.\nPassage 2:\nThe initiative has been triggered by the underwater exploration work carried out off the north coast of Haiti by the American explorer Barry Clifford, who announced in May that he had discovered what might be Columbus' long-lost vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco – which has now examined Clifford’s wreck – believes that it is not the Santa Maria, but that the real final resting place of Columbus' flagship could be relatively nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris-based organization now plans to look for the Santa Maria in a number of different locations – some on land and others on the seabed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the nature of Unesco’s outright rejection of Clifford’s site, and some of the organisation’s proposed alternatives, are likely to prove controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official Unesco report issued today largely ignores 11-year-old photographic evidence for what could be Columbus-era cannon on the site. The cannon have tragically been looted since the photographs were taken but some of the world’s top experts in early ordnance who have looked at the photos believe that they are 15th or 16th century weapons, sometimes known as lombards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also ignores crucial evidence from an expedition which almost certainly visited the site in 1960. It also admits that no tests, which could have revealed the geographical origin of the vessel, have been carried out on the ballast from the wreck. Likewise no detailed analysis has been carried out on the bronze objects found on the site – tests which might have revealed the objects’ ages. Neither does the report really assess in any detail the case for there potentially being two wrecks, one early and one later, on the site, rather than just one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bronze items – a number of ship construction fasteners – is the main reason for rejecting it as the Santa Maria. Unesco says that ship construction fasteners only came into use in the late 17th century, a belief based mainly on the fact that such fasteners have apparently not been found so far on earlier wrecks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very significantly, Unesco also seems to have moved towards the belief that the Santa Maria may be buried under sediments on what used to be seabed and is now coastal marshland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many scholars are likely to be very critical of any plan Unesco has to look for the Santa Maria in those marshes, because, they argue, Columbus's vessel could not have reached them due to some shallow and dangerous reefs. Unesco’s only argument for looking on land, and one of only two arguments for rejecting Mr Clifford’s site, is a short very ambiguous passage in an edited version of Columbus’ diary. Sadly only edited versions survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco seems to think that the remains of the Santa Maria could be buried in one of two areas of marshland along the North coast of Haiti, near the small town of En Bas Saline, or alternatively near La Petite Anse. The official Unesco report says that “the Santa Maria might indeed now” lie “under coastal sediment”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A painting of the ‘Santa Maria’ caught in a storm off the coast of Hispaniola in 1492 (Alamy) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It added: “To better estimate the location of the wreck of the Santa Maria, it will be important to understand more precisely the geomorphological evolution of the coastline.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Unesco report may also have implications for the US public’s perception of the organisation; America’s relationship with Unesco is currently very poor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has refused to pay its set financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years – and last year the organisation stripped America of its Unesco voting rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria saga could potentially further damage relations, or at least public attitudes, because a senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, who had been conducting a preliminary investigation of the site earlier this year at the request of Barry Clifford, has been refused permission to continue his work. What was in effect a US-led investigation has been more or less killed off by Unesco, and replaced by a partly European team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco has officially advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team’s proposal because “in its current state” it “lacked many elements required for the appropriate underwater archaeological research on the concerned site”, and because it “did not conform\" to the organisation's standards on the protection of underwater cultural heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus’ three-vessel fleet which discovered the New World. The fleet first reached the Americas on 12 October 1492 when they sighted the Bahamas. 75 days later, at around midnight, while Columbus was asleep, the Santa Maria drifted onto a reef and could not be refloated. Within a few hours the ship’s seams began to open – and the interior of the vessel was flooded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christopher Columbus hired the ship in 1492 and sailed in it from southern Spain’s Atlantic coast in search of a new western route to Asia (Rex) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Columbus and his crew were made welcome by a local Taino chieftain. Columbus then established a fort, left a garrison of 39 men there, and returned to report his discoveries to the King and Queen of Spain. Later in 1493, he returned to his fort in Haiti – but it had been destroyed and the garrison had all died or been killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an official statement, Unesco said that \"the evidence collected concerning the location, nature and artifact content\" of the site has been \"subjected to thorough investigation by an acclaimed team of experts\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Beeker still thinks that Clifford’s site is of potential importance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that Mr. Clifford’s site is still the best candidate yet proposed for the wreck of the Santa Maria,” he said. “I am not saying that it is definitely Columbus’ flagship, but without a more thorough and comprehensive investigation, the site cannot be discounted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But even if it ultimately turns out not to be the right site, all the historical and other evidence points to the vessel having been wrecked in that immediate area – certainly within just a few hundred metres of Clifford’s site. Unfortunately Unesco’s ideas as to where the wreck of the Santa Maria may lie are extremely flawed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Their suggestion that it could lie on what is now land is not consistent with contemporary accounts suggesting the wreck’s considerable distance from the shore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In my view it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto what is now land – because the vessel would have been wrecked on the reef before getting that far, which is precisely what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The bronze fasteners are a puzzle – but not sufficient reason on their own to dismiss the site without detailed investigation. There are a number of possible explanations for the presence of those bronze objects. The fact that bronze fasteners have not yet been documented on the few known early Iberian Atlantic shipwrecks does not mean that there were no such ships from that time period that used bronze fasteners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr Clifford has triggered very substantial renewed international interest in finding Columbus’ lost flagship – a vessel which represented the start of continuous contact between the old and new worlds, and one if not the most important event in world history.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reacting to the Unesco report, Mr Clifford, said: “It is essential that Unesco investigates the entire area where the lombard cannons were. I would be delighted to assist them and look forward to them getting in touch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,” he said.\n", "answers": ["The United Nations' cultural body is on the trail of Christopher Columbus' flagship—and it says the wreck that an expedition identified as the Santa Maria earlier this year is a different, much younger ship. As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n14:35 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker writes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vladimir Putin is likely to count the format and tone of his long meeting with Donald Trump as a win – even if nothing much of substance was discussed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia’s election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Trump was “rightly focused on how do we move forward” from the issue, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov even claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader’s denials of involvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections – as Tillerson said had been agreed – is hardly likely to reassure those in Washington worried about Russia’s actions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for Putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when Lavrov visited the White House in May and it later emerged that Trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the Russians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The personalised format of the meeting excluded those in Trump’s team who are more sceptically minded on Russia, such as national security adviser HR McMaster, and Trump’s senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, a longstanding Russia expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russian television emphasised the length of the meeting, which ran more than four times over its scheduled half-hour length, as a sign of Russia’s importance. The news of a US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, announced as the meeting was ongoing, is an example of the kind of top-table diplomacy Putin would like to do with Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Putin looked impassive, but he would have been smiling inside. As journalists were hurried out of the room, Putin appeared to gesture to Trump and ask if these journalists were the ones who had insulted Trump, laughing at his own joke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presumably Putin had been briefed that a disdain for supposed “fake news” would be a promising area of potential common ground with the US president.\nPassage 2:\nUploaded on Jul 7, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin were filmed meeting and shaking hands at the G20 summit in Hamburg on Friday, in footage posted on the German government’s official Facebook page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View the video at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/v...\nPassage 3:\nFILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a news conference at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on January 17, 2017 and U.S. President Donald Trump seen at a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 20, 2017, as seen in this combination photo.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has said he wants to find ways to work with Putin, a goal made more difficult by sharp differences over Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, and allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means every facial expression and physical gesture will be analyzed as much as any words the two leaders utter. The Kremlin said the two enjoyed a passing handshake at the summit ahead of the talks later in the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders, including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss,\" Trump wrote in a tweet on Friday. \"I will represent our country well and fight for its interests!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The meeting is scheduled for 3:45 p.m. local time, shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who has angered world leaders with his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change, will likely have to leave that session early to make the Russia meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some fear the Republican president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, will be less prepared for their sit-down than Putin, who has dealt with the last two U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's nothing ... the Kremlin would like to see more than a (U.S.) president who will settle for a grip and a grin and walk away saying that he had this fabulous meeting with the Kremlin autocrat,\" Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on MSNBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As investigations at home continue into whether there was any collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, the U.S. president has come under pressure to take a hard line against the Kremlin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moscow has denied any interference and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Trump won praise from at least one Republican hawk in the U.S. Congress after his speech in Warsaw in which he urged Russia to stop its \"destabilizing activities\" and end its support for Syria and Iran. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a great start to an important week of American foreign policy,\" said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often been critical of Trump on security issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But earlier in the day, Trump declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials who have said that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump said at a news conference, before accusing Democratic former President Barack Obama of not doing enough to tackle hacking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SENATORS' CONCERNS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of Trump’s meeting with Putin, three U.S. senators wrote to Trump to express “deep concern” about reports that his administration planned to discuss the return to Russia of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration last year in response to alleged Russian election meddling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Senators Johnny Isakson and Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said returning the facilities would \"embolden\" Putin and encourage further efforts by Russia to interfere in Western elections. All three are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House declined to offer details on what Trump would request of Putin and what he might offer in exchange for cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump wanted to talk about how the two countries can work together to stabilize war-ravaged Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-the-ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" Tillerson said before leaving the United States to join Trump in Germany. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was also grappling with a response to North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say had a long enough range to reach Alaska. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions has been Trump's most pressing foreign policy priority, and he met with leaders from Japan and South Korea on Thursday evening to discuss it. He is also slated to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I’d like to see the president figure out how to engage Russia on North Korea,” said Representative Francis Rooney, a Republican from Florida who is on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What I suggested to the president here a while back was that since we have all these conflicting issues about Russia right now and we’re still reeling from the fact that they took Crimea, maybe this is an opportunity to reset the Russia relationship in a positive manner,” Rooney said in an interview.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were suspicious of what Anthony, then 22, was telling them.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 16, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of child neglect. Her attorney was an unknown Florida lawyer named Jose Baez. A Florida grand jury indicted Anthony on capital murder charges October 14, 2008.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was offended by it. I was offended by the fact that he wasn't being treated fairly. I didn't know Baez. I had never met him,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baez started asking Mason, a Florida death penalty qualified attorney, for advice. That propelled Mason to want to meet Anthony. He remembers going to the Orange County jail to introduce himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They brought her to the room, and I have to tell you I was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is. I stood looking at a child herself. I said this can't be,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Could she look you in the eye?\" I asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh yes,\" Mason responded, describing her demeanor as quiet, afraid and unsure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that meeting, with Anthony's approval, Mason decided to join the team pro bono. He said the unpaid time he spent on the case \"was well over a million dollars\" and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said in the years before trial, he normally met with Anthony in a lunch room at the jail. The jail would clear everyone out before Anthony came in. A stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations, so he and Anthony would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before jury selection was to begin, Mason got word that Anthony's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under Florida's open records law.

I turned sideways a little bit, he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but didn't say anything,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never admitted doing anything,\" Mason said. \"All we had were the letters and (separately) the statements Casey had made to the psychiatrist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next it was Cindy Anthony's turn. \"We called Mom in, Cindy, and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion, cried, was very upset,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Baez gave the opening statements. In the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show, he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country was stunned and so was Mason, who was sitting next to Anthony in the courtroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I didn't know that he was going to say that. We had talked about all aspects of it, and I did not know. I don't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself,\" Mason recalled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I asked Mason if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement. Mason said he was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, I was concerned about that because I knew we didn't have the ability to prove that unless George got on the stand and confessed,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecution responded by making George Anthony its first witness. The first question Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony responded with a definitive no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial went on for weeks. Witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case. They finally rested their case on June 15, 2011. Then it was the defense's turn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Casey Anthony: 'I didn't kill my daughter' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of the defense case, Mason described how out-of-court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions. Anthony was approached with the possibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey got very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She didn't want to hear it.\" Mason said. \"Casey would fight it 'til her last breath. She didn't kill her daughter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for Anthony to end any talk of a plea agreement. She knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, plea discussions were stopped in their tracks, Mason said, and the trial went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, on July 5, 2011, after deliberating for 10 hours, jurors announced they had reached a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was holding her breath like a deep sea diver, waiting as we all were,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was acquitted by the 12-person jury on the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida and doesn't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By her own choice, she works inside the home, Mason said, and is living as \"a housekeeper, clerk, secretary and stuff like that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Casey has a lot of world left to have to deal with. She hasn't been freed from her incarceration yet 'cause she can't go out. She can't go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do anything,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason and his wife, Shirley, have continued a relationship with Anthony. Now three years after being acquitted, Mason said Anthony still distrusts the outside world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey is aloof,\" Mason said. \"She is kind of, I think, afraid of people ... she's not real close to. We've had a couple of occasions to have social gatherings that can include her -- close friends, the (legal) team. She still likes to back away from the middle.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2012: Anthony's 'video diary' surfaces NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"does not have any blood family anymore,\" Mason said. The family she has is the residual of the defense team, Dorothy Clay Sims, Lisabeth Fryer and Mason's wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said although there may have been a few conversations between Anthony and her mother in recent years, there is no relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as for a relationship with her father? \"None,\" Mason said emphatically. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shirley Mason has also gotten to know Anthony over the past three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm a cross between a friend, a mother, but not a mother -- only someone who is older who has had experience in the world she has not had,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason gives Anthony advice, but also listens to her when they talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My hope for her is it gets better for her and the world or the people who have been so hateful can let that go and they can move on,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"tries to make her life work,\" Shirley Mason said. She takes care of herself and stays physically fit by working out in the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I do think she wants to speak out,\" Mason said. Anthony declined CNN's request for an interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have never asked her that, but I know she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her.

At their core, the Games are about the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. They are about fair play and human spirit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nobody has epitomised these values more at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 than runners Abbey D’Agostino (USA) and Nikki Hamblin (NZL) and, beyond the Games, the Norwegian men’s handball team. The International Fair Play Committee (CIFP), with the support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), presented them with Fair Play awards today at the Olympic Club in the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro for two separate acts of selflessness and exemplary sportsmanship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The D’Agostino and Hamblin story is one of humanity and sacrifice which has already captured the hearts of people across the globe. New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin tripped and fell to the ground during the 5,000m race, accidentally bringing American D’Agostino down behind her with around 2,000m to go. The 24-year-old D’Agostino was quick to get up again, yet instead of carrying on with her race she stopped to help the stricken Hamblin to her feet, encouraging her to join her in attempting to finish the race. However, during her tumble, D’Agostino suffered an ankle injury, slowing the runner down, but Hamblin sportingly hung back to in return offer her encouragements. The two women went on to complete the race together.

The match was tied when at the last minute the German team scored a goal. It was discovered that when the goal had been scored an extra player had come onto the field. Although the Norwegian team had every right to file a protest, after much deliberation, they finally opted not to contest the results as they felt that the additional player on the field, though illegal, did not partake in the activities that helped the German team score the final goal. Germany went on to qualify for the Olympics, while the Norwegians did not.

A third Olympian, Sydney bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, has also said she was abused by Nassar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Lansing State Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, more than 140 women have alleged sexual abuse by Nassar, under the guise of medical treatment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It doesn’t matter if you’re the Olympic champion or you’re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the United States,” Raisman said in a joint interview with USA TODAY Sports and The Associated Press in August, when she and her Final Five teammates from Rio were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

It should have never ever happened and I think that needs to be discussed more.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, Maroney came forward in a Twitter post, saying Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar abused her until she left the sport, Maroney wrote, adding, \"It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was 'treated.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maroney said Nassar abused her before the U.S. team won gold in the 2012 Olympics and before she won silver on vault.

Attorneys have said that more women are expected to join the lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not known whether Raisman or Maroney are part of those lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCHAMPION, Wis. — In France, the shrine at Lourdes is surrounded by hundreds of hotels and has received as many as 45,000 pilgrims in a single day. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico, draws millions of fervent worshipers a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame. This month, it became one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary have been officially validated by the Roman Catholic Church. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1859, the year after Mary is said to have appeared in Lourdes, a Belgian immigrant here named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who hovered between two trees in a bright light, clothed in dazzling white with a yellow sash around her waist and a crown of stars above her flowing blond locks. As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared “with moral certainty” that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters “of a supernatural character” that are “worthy of belief.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lourdes-like hordes have not yet gathered, but since the weighty decree a growing stream of visitors, some driving several hours, has found its way here to pray and revel in what many say is the palpable presence of Mary. Calls are coming in from as far as New York from church groups that want to visit by the busload, and local church officials are wondering whether they thought too small when they built a new parking lot — planned well before this month — with 75 spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debbie Banda, 46, and her mother, Mary Young, 75, who live nearby, learned of the shrine and the bishop’s decision from the news, and came for the first time on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s incredible — she’s here, you just feel it,” Ms. Banda said after praying in the crypt chapel, said to be on the spot of the apparitions. As they passed a statue of Mary in white, just as described by Ms. Brise, Ms. Banda was overcome with emotion, weeping and hugging her mother. The two of them went back to pray some more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We need the Virgin Mary’s protection, and for her to keep an eye on our soldiers, too,” said Ms. Young, whose sons have served in the Middle East. “We’ll definitely be coming back.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catholic leaders described the decree in Wisconsin as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a gift to the believers,” said the Rev. Johann Roten, director of the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It would be devious to say that this was somehow pulled out of the attic to exorcise the problems of the church today,” Father Roten said in a telephone interview. “But hopefully this will have a beneficial impact on the people, showing them that there are ways of living with faith that are very pure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Diocese of Green Bay is under fire from lawyers in an abuse-related lawsuit, who charge that it has obstructed justice by destroying potentially incriminating files on former priests. The diocese says it has cooperated fully with law enforcement and discarded psychiatric records of deceased priests as required by federal privacy laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bishop Ricken, in an interview at his office in Green Bay, noted that the church has a tradition of taking its time with such cases. Over the years, he said, his predecessors had implicitly endorsed the shrine by holding services there and encouraging people to visit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he moved to Green Bay in 2008, he said, “I was struck by how many stories I heard of answered prayers” — resolved family and employment problems as well as medical cures — and he decided to start a formal investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People have a hunger for the spiritual, and right here in our backyard was a source to meet that need,” Bishop Ricken said. The church’s scandals did not influence his decision, he said, but if the shrine can become a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, “that would be beautiful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops. Wary of fraud, the church is generally reluctant even to investigate claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the 20th century, some 386 major apparitions of Mary were reported at a level beyond local rumors, said Father Roten, who has been an investigator in purported sightings. About 75 of those were studied, and at most a dozen were recognized as valid, he said. Increasingly, he said, the church makes use of psychiatric examinations and brain scans to see if people making claims are mentally healthy and not having hallucinations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That kind of examination was not possible, of course, for Ms. Brise, and Bishop Ricken said that his panel of three theological specialists had considered a host of indirect factors in concluding that her sighting was credible, following guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By all reports, he said, Ms. Brise was humble and honest and faithfully carried out Mary’s mandate to serve the church throughout her life. In one striking sign of a divine presence, he said, the shrine’s grounds and the terrified crowd who gathered there were spared the flames of the Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871, which devoured the surrounding lands and homes and caused more than 1,200 deaths. Her account of Mary’s apparition and message was consistent with accepted cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dozens of families and individuals who stopped to pray at the shrine on Wednesday afternoon seemed to have no doubts at all about the apparitions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a lot of power here,” said Theresa Vandermause, 45, who for years has made a weekly pilgrimage to the shrine with her friend Judy Deprey, 65. “You can feel the presence of Mary, and it feels like she’s listening to you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two women were pleased that the church had finally declared Mary’s visits here to be real, but said that the decree had not really changed anything. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We knew that already!” they declared.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1859 our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, visited the young woman, Adele Brise. It was an unlikely visitation to a simple, humble country girl on a dirt road in the wooded countryside. Her instruction was seemingly simple but required the commitment of Adele’s life’s work: teach the children in the faith. When we pause to think about this, it is very profound. The Holy Mother did not appear in a crowded city or to people of wealth and power. Instead, she appeared to an unlikely person in an unlikely place. In doing so, she made it clear to all the world that there is no one anywhere who is beyond the reach of God’s generous love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is good news. And now it is both our obligation and privilege to pay it forward by celebrating that visit and opening that message to anyone and everyone who answers the call.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nLONDON (AP) — A Swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this April 4, 2012 photo made available by the University of Goteborg in Sweden, the Swedish research team practices before the operations to transplant wombs at the Sahlgrenska Hospital in... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would not say on Monday whether any of the women had succeeded. In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb — in Turkey and Saudi Arabia — but both failed to produce babies. Doctors in Britain and Hungary also are planning similar operations, but using wombs from women who had just died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom said any woman in the study who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some doctors said women who got pregnant with a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby,\" said Dr. Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a gynecologist at Liverpool Women's Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a study published last week, Brannstrom and colleagues described the procedures used to transplant the nine wombs and said there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other experts called it a promising step but said it would be crucial that babies get enough nutrients from the mother's blood supply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We really don't know if the blood flow to the uterus will increase and adapt in the same way,\" as in a regular pregnancy, said Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital in London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is a good sign they have done the (embryo) transfers,\" Khalaf said. \"But a live birth will be the best validation that this works.\"\nPassage 2:\nSwedish medical team hoping for world first as women born without uterus or who lost it to cancer get embryo transfers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of nine women given pioneering womb transplants in Sweden have now also had embryos transferred, the pioneering Swedish doctor treating them has said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg University, said his team had embarked on a programme of embryo transfer for the women, who were either born without a womb or lost it as a result of cancer. All have ovaries so were able to produce eggs that were fertilised using IVF. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the nine women might succeed in giving birth, which would be a world first. Other womb transplants have taken place in Saudi Arabia and Turkey but no recipients have yet managed to have a child. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it failed after two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Brannstrom. He would not say whether any of the women were pregnant at the moment. In a study published last week, the team said that there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four women who received donated wombs. Two patients had to have the uterus removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom's technique is controversial because he is accepting wombs donated by living women, who are relatives or friends of his patients. Elsewhere, wombs from dead donors have been used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Richard Smith, head of the UK charity Womb Transplant UK, which is trying to raise money to carry out transplants here, has said that large chunks of blood vessels had to be removed from the donor as well as the uterus itself, raising the risks of the operation for the donor. In the UK, there would be ethical questions because the operation is not a life-saving procedure, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ. They will also have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n", "answers": ["Swedish doctors are advancing in their quest to implant embryos in women who have received pioneering womb implants, the Guardian reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wood-paneled dining room, with Picasso and de Kooning prints on the walls, Mr. Jones nervously presented a radical suggestion: the magazine, a leader of the revolution that helped take sex in America from furtive to ubiquitous, should stop publishing images of naked women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Hefner, now 89, but still listed as editor in chief, agreed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy magazine is to stop publishing images of naked women as part of its redesign, it has emerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its US owners say the internet has made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines are no longer so commercially viable, the New York Times reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000, official figures show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the magazine will still feature women in provocative poses - though not fully nude. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Battle won' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision was apparently taken last month at a meeting attended by Playboy founder and current editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magazine executives admitted that Playboy - which was founded in 1953 - had been overtaken by the changes it pioneered, according to the New York Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That battle has been fought and won,\" Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders is quoted as saying by the newspaper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gone, too, are the days when interviews with figures of the stature of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and Jimmy Carter made Playboy so culturally and politically significant, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's website has already banished nudity, partly to give it access to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. And its popularity has soared, with web traffic quadrupling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A brand long synonymous with salaciousness is cleaning up its act, and all with the blessing - apparently - of the 89-year-old Mr Hefner, our correspondent adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AFP/Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 60 years of Playboy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's logo showing a rabbit head wearing a bow tie is one of the most recognisable in the world. The company makes most of its money from licensing it around the world to sell products including toiletries, drinks and jewellery, including a necklace worn by the character Carrie Bradshaw in the TV series Sex and the City. About 40% of merchandising income is generated in China, where the magazine itself is not available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the magazine's most famous interviews was a 1976 conversation with Jimmy Carter in which the then presidential candidate admitted he had desired women other than his wife, confessing he had \"looked on a lot of women with lust\" and \"committed adultery in my heart many times\". Other notable interviewees included jazz musician Miles Davis in 1962; writer Vladimir Nabokov in 1964; and John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1981. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Library of Congress in Washington produces a Braille version of Playboy, one of 30 general-interest magazines that are translated for the blind and visually-impaired. In 1985, Congress voted to stop producing a Braille Playboy over morality concerns and to save money. But a group of blind Playboy readers sued for their right to read the magazine and a judge ruled that the ban violated their First Amendment rights under the US constitution. The Braille version can be viewed here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy has gained a reputation for riffing off business stories, beginning with a \"Women of Wall Street\" series in 1989 featuring nine stock market workers - shortly afterwards, seven of the nine were revealed to have left their jobs. Playboy continued with \"Women of Enron\" and \"Women of WorldCom\" shoots after those companies collapsed. It revisited the \"Women of Wall Street\" theme as the global financial crisis hit in 2008. The magazine advertised for models, requiring them to have worked for a financial institution and expressing a preference for those with senior management experience.\nPassage 3:\nSoon \"I read it for the articles\" will be more believable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The iconic men's magazine Playboy says it is planning to drop fully nude female photography from its pages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a letter to readers, the magazine predicted that everyone would be asking why, so it answered, \"Playboy has been a friend to nudity, and nudity has been a friend to Playboy, for decades. The short answer is: times change.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like so many other magazines, Playboy is reacting to the Internet revolution. In Playboy's case, it is about the ubiquity of online pornography. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. It's just passé at this juncture,\" Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders told The New York Times, which first reported the news on Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His comments sent shock waves through the magazine industry. Playboy, founded by Hugh Hefner, has been a controversial part of American popular culture since its debut in 1953. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, we're taking a risk by going non-nude,\" the magazine said, \"but this is a company—like all great companies—that has risk in its DNA.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy has a circulation of around 800,000 -- way down from its pre-Internet glory days when it boasted a circulation of many millions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Why is Playboy giving up nudity? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By covering up the nude photos, the magazine hopes to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The change will take effect in February when Playboy publishes its March issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the magazine will continue to show women in what it calls provocative poses -- like Maxim, Esquire, GQ and other publications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another competitor is Vice, an outlet that began as a print magazine and has evolved into a multimedia juggernaut valued at more than $2 billion. Both Playboy and Vice target young men living in urban areas. \"The difference between us and Vice,\" Flanders told the Times, \"is that we're going after the guy with a job.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Samir Husni, the director of Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi, said that the magazine's attempts at a younger audience may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base.

The family comedy — an adaptation of the popular app game — scored the third-best animated debut of the year, behind Zootopia ($75.1 million) and Kung Fu Panda 3 ($41.3 million). It was enough to knock Captain America: Civil War from its perch, which fell to No. 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Budgeted at $73 million, Angry Birds features the voices of Jason Sudeikis, Sean Penn, Maya Rudolph, Danny McBride and Josh Gad.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, urged the president today to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. Udall, who serves on the committee, said anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. Udall also said without significant progress on his previous requests and on removing obstacles to committee oversight of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, he will be unable to support advancing Caroline Krass's nomination to be CIA general counsel.\nPassage 2:\n— The CIA Inspector Generals Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIAs secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The development marks an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers amid an extraordinary closed-door battle over the 6,300-page report on the agencys use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons. The report is said to be a searing indictment of the program. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials have closely tracked the bitter struggle, a McClatchy investigation has found. But they havent directly intervened, perhaps because they are embroiled in their own feud with the committee, resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClatchys findings are based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIAs headquarters in Langley, Va., and the committees high-security work spaces on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people who spoke to McClatchy asked not to be identified because the feud involves highly classified matters and carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA and the committee declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss the matter and referred questions to the CIA and the Justice Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In question now is whether any part of the committees report, which took some four years to compose and cost $40 million, will ever see the light of day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, according to public statements by committee members. It also shows, members have said, how the techniques didnt provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers  in possible violation of an agreement against doing so  that the agency had provided to intelligence committee staff in a secure room at CIA headquarters that the agency insisted they use to review millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables and other documents, according to people with knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a panel member, apparently was referring to the monitoring when he asked CIA Director John Brennan at a Jan. 29 hearing if provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act apply to the CIA? Seems to me thats a yes or no answer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan replied that hed have to get back to Wyden after looking into what the act actually calls for and its applicability to CIAs authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law makes it a criminal act for someone to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what theyre allowed to access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People familiar with the issue said it wasnt clear whether the monitoring violated any law or administrative regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., who has led calls for the CIA to allow the release of the report, also appeared to be referring to the monitoring in a letter he sent Tuesday to President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and I find these actions to be incredibly troubling for the committees oversight responsibilities and for our democracy, Udall wrote. It is essential that the committee be able to do its oversight work  consistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of powers  without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it is today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall also called on Obama to strip the CIA of control over how much of the Senate report should be made public. The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is my belief that the declassification of the Committee Study is of paramount importance and that decisions about what should or should not be declassified regarding this issue should not be delegated to the CIA, but directly handled by the White House, Udall wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall has led a handful of lawmakers in pressing for the release of the reports conclusions, which committee members have publicly said show that the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the intelligence gained from using water-boarding and other interrogation techniques. On Tuesday, Hayden said For some time, the White House has made clear to the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that a summary of the findings and conclusions of the final report should be declassified, with any appropriate redactions necessary to protect national security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conflict over the committees investigation heightened late last year when the committee discovered that a CIA internal review confirming some of the committees findings had been withheld from Senate investigators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Obama, Udall said the internal report not only corroborates aspects of the committees investigation, but acknowledges significant mistakes and errors made during the course of the CIA program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is vital that we understand how and why the content of the CIAs internal review contradicts the CIAs official June 27, 2013, response to the Committee, he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agency has downplayed the importance of the document, characterizing it as a compilation of summaries of classified documents, rather than an analytical report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story contained an incorrect date for the hearing at which Sen. Wyden asked CIA director Brennan whether federal computer fraud law applied to the CIA.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LONDON (AP) _ Britain's royal family celebrated Christmas on Sunday with one notable absence _ Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip, who remains hospitalized following a heart procedure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 90-year-old prince was recovering from having a coronary stent put in after doctors determined the heart pains that sent him to the hospital on Friday were caused by a blocked artery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buckingham Palace said \"he's in good spirits\" and family members will visit Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, in the hospital after lunch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family's Christmas schedule kicked off with a traditional morning service at St. Mary Magdelene Church, on the queen's sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge crowds that gathered outside the church got an early peek when the royals made a quick private visit to the church ahead of the services. Less than two hours later, they were back _ in different clothes _ for the Christmas service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Queen arrived first _ dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat _ in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate_ now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off the shelves in Britain, wore an eggplant-colored coat and matching hat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the other royals present was the queen's granddaughter, Zara Philips, who was joined by her new husband Mike Tindall, an English rugby player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the service, children lined up to give bouquets of flowers to the queen. Thanking each well-wisher, the queen then handed the bouquets to her granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well-wisher Camilla Fitt, 71, said Charles told her that his father, Philip, was \"very determined\" to get well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Charles said he is coming on,\" said Fitt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family then traveled back to the house for lunch, an integral part of their celebration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another key part of their Christmas festivities is the queen's annual message to the nation, which this year will focus on family and community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 85-year-old queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957. She writes the speeches herself, and the broadcasts mark the rare occasion on which the queen voices her own opinion without government consultation.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n'Alien: Covenant': Film Review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elegantly spare opening, in which a “synthetic,” Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his “father” (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard — a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a “person of faith,” which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby “hidden planet” that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as inviting as are the beautiful landscapes, mountains and lakes, there's trouble lurking in the magnificent flora and fauna and, given the particulars of this bloody franchise, it doesn't take long for humans to fall ill and start bursting with nasty and ferocious critters they never imagined could spring from their innards. This is not the sort of propagation the earthlings had in mind when they set off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a brilliant stroke, the voyagers also encounter David, Walter's double, the very same “synthetic” who co-starred in Prometheus. Distinguishable from his supposedly new and improved relative by virtue of his long hair and British accent, this lone survivor of the previous voyage, who lives among the ruins of a great civilization wiped out by the aliens, gives Fassbender the delicious opportunity of a double performance. The actor makes the most of it, subtly delineating two nearly identical characters as they enact a contest for dominance, the details of which touch in clear but unpretentious ways on the notion of playing God. What goes down between the two remains uncertain right up to the fabulously diabolical twist ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stylistically, the film is a thing of cool beauty, with superb effects and a lovely score. Creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best.

( Mark Rogers / Twentieth Century Fox ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir and Carmen Ejogo. Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Friday in major theatres. 122 minutes. 18A The cast keeps expanding and the critters keep evolving, but there’s one constant to Ridley Scott’s Alien series. It’s the horrific fear of personal invasion, by something that’s about to leap up and latch onto you, causing unimaginable mayhem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alien: Covenant has this dread in abundance. It ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the original Alien in 1979. Scott knows he dropped the ball with Prometheus, the erstwhile Alien prequel he foisted onto the unhappy masses in 2012. It barely showed the infamous beasties, choosing instead to batter senses with windy dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements of this decades-long saga. Alien: Covenant brings back the visceral panic that fans expect from the franchise, along with the show-stopping title creatures: among them the face-hugger, the chest-burster and the canoe-headed xenomorph of artist H.R. Giger’s terrifying imagination. They’re waiting to greet the unsuspecting crew of the spaceship Covenant, who have travelled to the far reaches of the galaxy in search of an Earthlike planet to colonize. (The most terrifying thing of all, barely acknowledged, is the thought of what must have happened to Earth if large-scale evacuations are underway.) The Covenant carries 2,000 passengers and 1,140 human embryos, all frozen in cryogenic deep sleep and with an emphasis on preserving couples and families as they make the years-long journey to a planet called Origae-6. Something happens that interrupts the journey and prompts the exploration of an unknown closer planet that looks to be every bit as inviting — until events prove that theory disastrously wrong. Scott and screenwriters John Logan (Spectre) and Dante Harper tidy up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that director Scott has being exploring for decades, with Alien and also with Blade Runner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, they revive a moribund franchise in much the same way The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars saga, by reconjuring characters and themes from the past. It won’t take you long to figure out who the “Ripley” character is here, for example, and the perilous planet narrative dates right back to the original Alien, and indeed to the dawn of sci-fi moviemaking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This might make the film seem too derivative for some. But for those willing to embrace the retro elements — count me among them — it works like gangbusters. And a story like this can’t get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Covenant more than delivers on that score. Michael Fassbender reprises his android character David from Prometheus, but this mechanical man acquires deeper intrigue when he’s matched against his factory double, an upgraded model named Walter, also played by Fassbender. This is a grand performance times two that demands to be remembered at awards time. Other standouts from the brilliant cast are Katherine Waterston as fearless scientist Daniels, Danny McBride as good ol’ boy pilot Tennessee and Billy Crudup as tragically promoted second-in-command Christopher, a weak man who assumes authority at exactly the wrong time. (Watch also for cameos from Guy Pearce and James Franco, as they help connect the dots between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.) Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Jed Kurzel skilfully combine to boost the film’s fear of the unknown. They make the remote New Zealand shooting locale look and sound both like the verdant paradise the mystery planet is thought to be and the brutal hellhole it actually is. Franchise films very often disappoint, especially as later instalments run out of fresh ideas. Not so Alien: Covenant, which breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts. It leaves us seriously wondering what will happen next, but I can’t tell you more or you’ll yell — not only on Earth, but maybe also in space, where no one can hear you scream.\n", "answers": ["A spaceship arrives on a distant planet that looks like a perfect new home for humans in Alien: Covenant. But if you know anything about Alien movies, you'll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "length": 2356, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5c8c8d3158f3342ca74e9ce9da1508e49fe9a5abb156a80c"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThroughout the race, Mr. Booker’s three rivals — all serious political forces in New Jersey — struggled to shift the focus on their own qualifications, prompting increasingly direct attacks on Mr. Booker’s record and business interests, including his ownership stake in an Internet start-up that had been created with financial backing of his powerful friends while he was in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s campaign pushed back hard against the attacks, saying there was nothing improper about his financial dealings and noting that he had given much of his income to charity and used his media appearances to focus attention on Newark. As he campaigned, he portrayed what his opponents saw as a weakness — that he was insufficiently liberal on issues important to Democrats like gun control and unions — as a strength. He argued that his pragmatic brand of politics, favoring practical solutions over ideology, had enabled him to lift the fortunes of Newark, the state’s largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His message seemed to register with voters. Juan Valdes, a 38-year-old Palisades Park resident who voted for Mr. Booker, said that the mayor’s record in Newark far outweighed any criticism his rivals had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can actually see the changes” in Newark, he said outside a polling place. “How he turned Newark, of all places, around to where it is, I figured he could do some good for the rest of us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s political rise has been unconventional. After graduating from Yale Law School in 1997, he moved to Newark, where he lived in a housing project and became a community activist, making a successful bid for a City Council seat a year later. He positioned himself as an outsider, challenging the city’s political establishment. In 2002, he ran against Sharpe James, the powerful Newark mayor who had been dogged by scandal. Mr. Booker lost that race, but four years later won his second bid for the office and later a second term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s public profile has always been much larger than would be expected for the mayor of a medium-size city. He is a regular on cable television shows, is in great demand on the speaking circuit and has long been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. His ascension to the Senate would make him one of the most recognizable figures in a chamber known for its exclusivity.\nPassage 2:\nBy Matt Friedman and David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWARK — Newark Mayor Cory Booker has easily prevailed in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary tonight, the Associated Press projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker will now face Steve Lonegan, the Republican primary winner, in the Oct. 16 special election to succeed the late Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results show Booker well ahead of his three rivals tonight: U.S. Reps. Rush Holt (D-6th Dist.) and Frank Pallone (D-12th Dist.), and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex). The difference is so large — with Booker leading his closest opponent, Pallone, by a two-to-one margin — that the Associated Press called the race with just 7 percent of the vote in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With 98 percent of the vote in, Booker leads Pallone 59 percent to 20, followed by Holt with 17 and Oliver with 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In Washington, so many people focus on right and left,\" Booker said in his victory speech tonight in front of hundreds of supporters gathered outside the Prudential Center in Newark. \"Here in Newark, we're only concerned with one direction — and that is moving forward. Make me your Senator, and I will be unwavering in my focus in finding common ground.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I believe that this state will once again light the way forward for all of America,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just after 8:40 p.m., when the primary was called for Booker, legendary hip-hop star Q-tip took the stage outside the arena. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The new Senator is wayyyyy ahead,\" Q Tip said in between a remix of The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 300 people were assembled on the plaza by 9 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker, 44, began the race as the frontrunner and never lost that status, raising far more money than his opponents and winning the backing of most of the state's Democratic organizations. His campaign also teamed up with South Jersey Democrats to get residents to cast their votes early by absentee ballot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will be just like that twenty-something who came to Newark to represent people who couldn't afford fancy lawyers,\" Booker, a former city councilman, told the audience tonight. \"I will care about you. I will care about results for all of the people in New Jersey.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker spent much of the race ignoring his three Democratic rivals, instead portraying himself as able to work across the aisle and get results, as demonstrated by relationship with Republican Gov. Chris Christie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Holt, Pallone and Oliver frequently went after Booker, their attacks gained little traction. His campaign hit its bumpiest patch in its final two weeks, when the New York Times raised questions about a tech company he founded, Waywire. It was not, however, enough to overcome his huge lead in the polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tonight, Booker praised his three primary opponents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are our champions, too,\" He said. \"We are no longer opponents. We are allies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had kind words for his new opponent, Lonegan, a conservative activist, the former mayor of Bogota, and an aggressive campaigner who has been blasting Booker for weeks already. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He is a person of strong beliefs and, I found already, even stronger rhetoric,\" Booker said. \"I will match his negative attacks with positive energy.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A rising star in the Democratic Party and a Republican former mayor won their parties' primaries on Tuesday to set up a campaign of political and stylistic contrasts as they seek to fill the final 15 months of the term of the late U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newark Mayor Cory Booker defeated three experienced politicians _ U.S. Reps. Rush Holt and Frank Pallone, who had the support of Lautenberg's family, and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver _ in a Democratic primary that may have been more competitive had the field been less crowded. The race was a major draw for them partly because of New Jersey's history of electing only Democrats to the Senate over the past 40 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Republican primary, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan won handily over Franklin Township physician Alieta Eck, who had never run for office before, even though she received support of some tea party organizations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The election is on a compressed schedule. The day after Lautenberg's death, Republican Gov. Chris Christie scheduled the primaries for Tuesday and a special election for Oct. 16, 20 days before the voting day on which he's seeking re-election. The move drew criticism, with some opponents saying Christie was spending $12 million on an extra election so he could avoid being on the same ballot as Booker, a claim Christie denies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker ran with the support of New Jersey's Democratic establishment and celebrities from across the country. Oprah Winfrey joined him at a fundraiser, and Eva Longoria campaigned with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker is famous in the political world for his life story and his social media fanaticism: He has 1.4 million followers on Twitter, which he uses to field complaints about local issues such as sinkholes and to dispense inspirational quotes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He grew up in suburban Harrington Park, the son of some of the first black IBM executives, played football at Stanford, won a Rhodes scholarship, received a law degree from Yale, then moved into one of the toughest parts of Newark in an effort to revive the state's largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is in his second term as mayor. In the city, reviews are mixed, but his narrative has helped make him well-known elsewhere. And he's leveraged that power to help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in grant money for the city, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He's also given 90 paid speeches across the country since 2008, collecting $1.3 million, nearly half of which he has donated to charity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan, who stepped down from his job as state director of the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity, focused his primary campaign on blasting Booker. He held a news conference to ridicule Booker's broad anti-childhood poverty plan and another at the scene of a homicide in Newark to question whether Booker has done much to reduce crime. He's also been to the New York headquarters of Waywire, a technology startup Booker co-founded, to criticize his role in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Booker, the new opponent means needing to gird himself for attacks from the right after spending an abbreviated primary campaign being criticized from the left by opponents. In debates, Booker found himself defending working with Christie, explaining that he disagrees with the governor \"90 percent of the time\" and promoting his conciliatory image. He also reaffirmed his support for using taxpayer money to send children to private schools, one of the few policy prescriptions on which he and Lonegan agree. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan is a familiar voice in New Jersey politics, blunt and conservative. He ran in and lost gubernatorial primaries in 2005 and 2009. He was a leader of successful opposition to ballot measures that would have raised a state sales tax and funded stem-cell research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Booker, he grew up in suburban Bergen County, in Ridgefield Park, and played college football, at William Paterson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both candidates also became better known through documentaries released in 2005. \"Anytown, U.S.A.\" looked at Lonegan's fiery re-election campaign in Bogota, and \"Street Fight\" chronicled Booker's first, and losing, run for mayor of Newark.\n", "answers": ["No contest: Cory Booker won the Democratic primary for a Senate seat in New Jersey so easily tonight that the AP called it just 45 minutes after the polls closed and with just 7% of returns in, reports the Star-Ledger.

On the Republican side, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan easily won his race as well. The special election is Oct. 16.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA judge has resigned over his conduct of a rape trial in the face of a blistering recommendation for his removal from a national disciplinary body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Court Justice Robin Camp had asked a complainant in a 2014 rape trial why she did not keep her knees together, and mocked the law of consent. At a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the Canadian Judicial Council, the 19-year-old homeless complainant said Justice Camp’s comment made her hate herself and feel like a slut. After the panel unanimously recommended his removal, Justice Camp went to great lengths to save his job. He publicly apologized to the complainant and his fellow judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice minister on resignation of 'knees together’ judge (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He called his knees-together comment “unforgivable,” and acknowledged that he had perceived the complainant’s fragility. He attended in-depth counselling and education sessions with several feminist scholars, three of whom testified at his disciplinary hearing last fall (attended daily by his wife and daughter) that he was sincerely interested in changing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Before Justice Camp, these two judges were recommended for removal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfounded: Police dismiss 1 in 5 sexual assault claims as baseless, Globe investigation reveals NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he fought for an opportunity to appear in person before the larger body of judicial council members who considered the panel’s recommendation, to explain to them that he had acted out of “ignorance, not animus.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The council would receive only written submissions from him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By a vote of 19 to 4, the judicial council said in its ruling released on Thursday that the deep harm Justice Camp had done to public confidence made his dismissal necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We find that the Judge’s conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the Judge incapable of executing the judicial office,” the council said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four dissenters, who found Judge Camp guilty of misconduct but opposed his dismissal, are male, and from the Atlantic provinces (one is Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the president of the Canadian Association for Legal Ethics and a law professor at the University of Calgary, who, along with three other professors, filed the first complaint against Justice Camp, said she is pleased with the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think anything would have been served by carrying this on any further,” she said. “The denunciation was unequivocal. I think [resigning] was the admirable decision on his part and the right thing to do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Constance Backhouse, chair in sexual assault legislation at the University of Ottawa’s law school, said rape myths are still pervasive in the justice system and society. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our legal system still remains mired in 19th-century stereotypes about women, who are suspected of duplicity, promiscuity, malice, and false testimony,” she said. “And our legal thinking reflects the wider culture, which shares far too many of these notions. Until we get over the premise that it is women alone who are responsible for protecting themselves from rape, I suspect we will see more such trials and more protests demanding a woman’s right to sexual autonomy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law of consent and the judiciary’s handling of sexual-assault trials continue to create controversy. In Nova Scotia, a judge acquitted a taxi driver last week of sexually assaulting a female passenger, saying “a drunk can consent.” That ruling is under appeal. The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommendations that judges in effect be fired are rare in the Canadian system, which deems judicial independence a cornerstone. Justice Camp is only the third judge whose removal has been recommended since the judicial council was established in 1971. Both of the others also resigned rather than be removed under a provision of the Constitution that requires Parliament to approve dismissing a judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp’s comments came in the trial of Alexander Wagar in Calgary. The ruling came to light a year later, when the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned it, saying the judge had applied myths and stereotypes about sexual-assault victims. (By then, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had promoted him from provincial court.) The judicial council received scores of complaints. Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley asked for the public disciplinary hearing. “On reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,” Ms. Ganley said in an e-mail to The Globe after Justice Camp resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp, a father of three, received his law degree in 1975 from Stellenbosch University in South Africa, passed exams in Canada in 1998 and was admitted to the Alberta bar in 1999. In 2012, the Progressive Conservative government of Alison Redford appointed him to the Provincial Court. Before then, he practised business law in Calgary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould brought a motion to the House of Commons in which she declared the government’s intent to support the recommendation for removal. Shortly afterward, Justice Camp issued a brief statement through his lawyer, Frank Addario of Toronto, expressing his “sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the Wagar trial.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from Patrick White NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Report Typo/Error\nPassage 2:\nA judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn't keep her “knees together” confirmed he will resign after the Canadian Judicial Council recommended his removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Robin Camp issued a statement Thursday in which he said he will resign from the Federal Court of Canada effective Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,” Camp’s statement went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Canadian Judicial Council’s report called Camp’s conduct “so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that the judge was rendered incapable of executing the judicial office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp’s lawyer Frank Addario had argued that removal was not necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. Four of the council's 23 members did not support removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was in the process of moving forward on the council’s recommendation in Parliament Thursday when she learned of Camp’s resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould later told reporters that the extremely rare removal would have been needed “to ensure the integrity and public confidence in the justice system and the judiciary.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sexual assault and gender-based violence is in no form acceptable and we will continue to stand up for victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence,” Wilson-Raybould added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Norman Sabourin, Executive Director and Senior General Council at the Canadian Judicial Council, told CTV News Channel removals are recommended when the “public has lost confidence in a judge’s ability to discharge the duties of office.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The report of the council emphasizes that all judges have to know the law but also have to possess empathy, have to understand that people who come before them are often vulnerable people and they have to treat them with a degree of civility and deference,” Sabourin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp, who was appointed to the federal court in 2015, faced judicial review after it was revealed that he had stated in a 2014 Alberta provincial court decision that \"pain and sex sometimes go together” and asked the complainant why she didn’t just “keep her knees together.” He also said, \"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander Wagar was acquitted by Camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alberta’s Appeal Court ordered a new trial and last month Wagar was again acquitted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complainant, who was 19 at the time of the first trial, told the disciplinary hearing last year that Camp's comments had made her hate herself. She said she had contemplated suicide as a result of her experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Thursday’s decision, the complainant said \"I was feeling so unhopeful and pretty down and not very hopeful about the justice system but it has kind of turned around by this.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Watershed moment’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the University of Calgary law professor who complained about Camp’s conduct, said she was pleased with the decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Actors within the legal system can make really terrible decisions and terrible mistakes and in his case engage in real misconduct,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But the legal system orients towards progress,” she added. “It tries to get it right in the end.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathleen Mahoney, who is also a law professor at the University of Calgary, told CTV News Channel that she believes the removal is a “watershed moment” in how courts treat sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think this is a very strong statement from the judges of Canada that the time has come that gender bias in these kinds of decisions will no longer be tolerated,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahoney added that she believes the case highlights the need for mandatory judicial training focusing on gendered issues such sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservatives have introduced legislation that would require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases. The justice minister agreed Thursday that judges need to be properly trained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp’s decision is not the only recent case to raise questions about how judges handle sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Halifax earlier this month, Justice Gregory Lenehan acquitted a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a passenger so intoxicated that she passed out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lenehan said in his ruling that “clearly, a drunk can consent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from CTV’s Glen McGregor and files from The Canadian Press\nPassage 3:\nFederal Court Justice Robin Camp, dubbed the \"knees together judge\" for his comments in a sex assault case, has submitted his resignation following a recommendation from Canada's judicial watchdog that he be removed from the bench. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a ruling announced Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) said that at a 2014 sexual assault trial he was presiding over, Camp \"showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by Parliament in respect of sexual assault issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We find that the judge's conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the council's ruling reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement from his lawyer, Camp announced his intention to resign and apologized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have advised Chief Justice Crampton that effective March 10, 2017, I will resign as a member of the Federal Court of Canada,\" the statement read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the [sex assault] trial. I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Camp's statement was issued, Justice Minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould rose in the House of Commons seeking unanimous consent for a motion to remove Camp from the bench, but that consent was denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative Saskatchewan MP Tom Lukiwksi then rose on a point of order and complained the minister had not ensured she had the unanimous consent of all parties before moving her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Votes in both the House of Commons and the Senate are required to remove a federal judge, a move presumably no longer required with Camp's resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould told reporters on Parliament Hill she learned of Camp's decision after she sought support for her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unexpected move by the federal Justice Minister was stopped by an opposition MP 1:05 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Court transcripts from the 2014 sexual assault trial show Camp, who was then a provincial court judge, called the complainant, who was homeless and 19 years old at the time of the alleged assault, \"the accused\" numerous times — a mistake he repeated at the judicial council hearing before correcting himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp also told the young woman \"pain and sex sometimes go together\" and asked why she didn't just keep her \"knees together.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Antithetical' to contemporary values NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge apologized several times for those comments, underwent counselling and took additional training on Canada's sexual assault laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't enough for the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The statements made by Justice Camp during the trial and in his decision, the values implicit in those statements and the way in which he conducted himself are so antithetical to the contemporary values of our judicial system with respect to the manner in which complainants in sexual assault cases should be treated that, in our view, confidence in the system cannot be maintained unless the system disassociates itself from the image which the judge, by his statements and approach, represents in the mind of a reasonable member of the public,\" wrote the majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parliament considers training for judges NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NDP MP Murray Rankin said that by resigning, Camp took the only course of action available in light of the conclusions of the judicial council. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rankin added that Camp's case bolsters a private member's bill by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to ensure judges know Canada's sexual assault laws. Parliament voted unanimously this week to send that bill to committee for further study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambrose, in a statement welcoming the council's ruling, said her bill was designed to hold the judiciary responsible for the ongoing training of its judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, there is not enough accountability on the part of the judiciary in ensuring that judges have the updated training Canadians expect them to have. This needs to change,\" Ambrose said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until Thursday, Camp had fought hard to keep his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He asked to speak directly to the 23 chief and associate chief justices who make up the CJC. But the majority said Camp had already \"been fully and fairly heard,\" and declined saying nothing had changed since his public hearing last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp then asked the Federal Court to stop the judicial council from deliberating his fate and to review an earlier decision he be dismissed. His lawyer Frank Addario argued the judicial council should consider the fact that Alexander Scott Wager, the man who was accused of sexual assault in the original trial, had once again been acquitted. The judge refused to stall the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the council's creation in 1971, no judge has gone to such lengths to keep his job. There have only been two other cases where the council recommended Parliament remove a judge from the bench and in both cases the men resigned almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just like any other judge facing discipline, Camp's legal battle has been paid for by taxpayers through the Commission for Federal Judicial Affairs, which has refused to say how much it has cost so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four judges dissented from the majority and said Camp should not lose his job because he has rehabilitated himself through counselling and further education.\n", "answers": ["A judge who asked a 19-year-old woman why she couldn't have just kept her legs together to prevent being raped has quit rather than be forced out.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAntarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Paradoxically, accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could be lethal. Whether and how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown; one hypothesis is that it melts during summer warming episodes. However, prior in vitro evidence indicates that AFPs also inhibit melting. Our study establishes that pronounced melting inhibition occurs in vivo (i.e., superheated ice occurs inside notothenioid fishes). Our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome AFP-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice. Evolution of the life-saving AFPs exacts a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that, by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals, they prevent death by inoculative freezing. Paradoxically, systemic accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could also be lethal. Whether or how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown. To investigate if ice inside high-latitude Antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally, we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over the long-term record (1999–2012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. Thus, because of the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition, summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice. Our results expose a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of AFPs: beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\nPassage 2:\nEUGENE, Ore., Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of Antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over. But evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and for the fish of Antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the benefit of avoiding frozen blood, Antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins. That's right, the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of marine biologists discovered the odd trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions. They discovered the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" study author Paul Cziko, a doctoral student the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, these ice crystals are likely to melt. But Cziko and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species icy veins. That means these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives -- a risky proposition that could help them stay cool under pressure but could also cause a life-threatening traffic jam inside small capillaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" Cziko added. \"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\nPassage 3:\nScientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of Antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the Antarctic region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notothenioids own the waters circling Antarctica known as the Southern Ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for more than four decades now, including the discovery, in the 1960s, of antifreeze proteins inside these fishes, a vital tool for their survival. But according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers have revealed that these proteins may not be as helpful as they were once thought to be. The proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish, but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment. But we're still working out the details, and this is one of those details,\" Paul Cziko, lead author of the paper, told the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, worked with Christina Cheng and Arthur DeVries, a husband-and-wife team of animal biologists at the University of Illinois. Devries revealed in the late 1960s that antifreeze proteins existed in the bodies of notothenioids. In the 1990s, he discovered that the fishes were also carrying ice crystals in various organs, such as the gills and the spleen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this new study, Cziko's team tested fish in the lab by warming them to a point at which the ice in their bodies completely melted. These were temperatures, though, that the notothenioid never experiences in its own environment. They also examined temperature data logged continuously over the last 11 years in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research group found that the ice crystals didn't melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remained intact. The fish continued to contain ice even after researchers raised the temperature further another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was primarily due to the antifreeze protein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the life-saving protein was given the name \"antifreeze,\" it works differently from, say, the liquid you mix with your windshield wiper fluid, according to Cziko. Rather than acting like a salt and lowering the freezing point, the notothenioids' antifreeze proteins bind themselves to the ice crystals in their bodies and alter the surface of the crystals so that they have a hard time growing any larger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This mechanism doesn't just make it very hard for the ice crystals to grow, though. The proteins bind themselves so tightly that they also make it difficult for the ice to get any smaller, even in above-freezing temperatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When people are studying antifreeze proteins they're looking at the ability of the organisms to deal with cold temperatures and not warm temperatures,\" says Cziko. \"All their focus is towards 'How much does it protect against freezing?' and people just kind of missed that there could also be an anti-melting effect that's important.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In controlled settings, scientists have been able to heat ice above its melting point without having the ice melt. But Cziko says this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does this superheated ice mean for the fish? Even in the slightly warmer summer months when the notothenioid has a chance to thaw out, some ice crystals linger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies is still unknown. The long-term cost of having the protein, Cziko says, is a question for further research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they can tolerate it, maybe they've evolved some other mechanism to deal with these ice crystals inside their bodies,\" says Cziko. \"And maybe in the long-term it does kill the fish and they're not that good at dealing with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest concentration of ice crystals resided in the fishes' spleens. Cziko says it's possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cziko also says research on this particular evolutionary puzzle provides us with a better understanding of the progression of all species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" says Cziko \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\"\n", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler worked as a loan officer and a financial consultant before taking a job as a nurse at Magee-Womens Hospital in 2014, according to his LinkedIn.com profile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As an adult, deflecting my religion by saying ‘I’m not that religious,’ makes it easier for people to accept I’m Jewish — especially when I tell them my father is a rabbi. ‘I’m not that religious,’ is like saying, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not that Jewish, therefore, I’m not so different than you,’ and like clockwork, people don’t look at me as awkwardly as they did a few seconds beforehand,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler said he did his best to treat Bowers with “compassion and empathy. … I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.

I mean, he’s coming off the ambulance yelling ‘kill all the Jews’ and those are the people treating him. That is the height of stupidity.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the lead people who immediately treated Bowers at Allegheny General were Jewish, Cohen said. They include the attending emergency room doctor and a registered nurse whose own father is a rabbi, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen declined to name them but praised them for honoring their profession by putting their emotions aside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s hard.

They didn’t ask anything about him. He was a patient.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long after treating Bowers, the young nurse broke down in tears. Cohen met with him for about 20 minutes and thanked him for doing his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was pretty broken,” Cohen said. “I told him how proud I was. He went home and hugged his parents.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, 63, lives about 50 yards from the Tree of Life Congregation where the mass shooting occurred. He was home on Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise outside. Within minutes, his daughter yelled to him to come downstairs and they watched as police and SWAT teams descended on their street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He described the congregation as a safe place where people gather daily to pray and socialize.

Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue.

He said he didn’t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, “Death to all Jews!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers’ treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place.

Mahler’s Father Is a Retired Rabbi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler’s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue’s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It’s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, “Die Jew. Love, Hitler.” It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn’t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he’s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English.

He wrote, “I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Mediterranean city of Alexandria courtroom, the 21 young female defendants flashed defiant smiles to the media, standing handcuffed in white head scarves and white prison uniforms in the defendants cage. They were convicted on charges related to holding an Oct. 31 protest in the city demanding Morsi's reinstatement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them were seven teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were sentenced to prison terms until they turn 18. The rest _ most aged 18 to 22 _ were sentenced to 11 years in prison. Six other Brotherhood members were sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting the demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought they will get a month or something but we were shocked with the 11 years,\" defense lawyer al-Shimaa Ibrahim Saad said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, said the sentences are meant to be a \"deterrent\" for the group's opposition to the military, vowing the verdict \"will only increase the determination of the people to get their rights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, hundreds of secular youth activists protested Wednesday in downtown Cairo against the government's clampdown on dissent. At the center of the crisis is the law issued this week banning any protests or public political gatherings of more than 10 people without a prior police permit, imposing stiff fines and jail terms for violators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those thinking the authoritarian pharaonic style works will find it doesn't anymore,\" said one protester, Laila Soueif. \"There will be a third wave of the revolution much more violent than before. We are witnessing a turning point.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A day earlier, security forces broke up two small activists' protests in Cairo. Security forces beat and dragged women protesters outside parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The images were reminiscent of the days of Mubarak, the autocrat who ruled the country for nearly 30 years and was ousted in a 2011 uprising. Under his rule, police at times focused on humiliating female protesters. Similarly, under the rule of the military that followed his ouster, police broke up an anti-military protest, half-stripping a female protester and stomping on her chest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After breaking up Tuesday's protest, police detained 14 women, then drove them in a van through the desert where they were dropped off on a remote road in the middle of the night, several of the women said. That too is a tactic used by Mubarak-era police to intimidate protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They want to terrorize us,\" said Mona Seif, a prominent activist who was among the 14 women. \"I think the interior minister decided to escalate and tell everyone whose family was killed... beaten or anything that I am here, this is how I do business, and if you don't like it, beat your head against the wall.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of the criticism, the Cabinet issued a strongly worded statement saying it is determined to implement the new protest law with \"all firmness and force ... so freedom doesn't turn to chaos.\" It linked it to a \"war on terrorism\" _ pointing to the Brotherhood protests and violence by Islamic militants in Sinai. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are elements that want to spread domestic chaos in a desperate attempt to hurt the prestige of the state,\" it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law comes ahead of an election season that will include a referendum on amendments to the Islamist-drafted, Morsi-era constitution. Authorities have shown they are eager to push through the new charter _ but they could face troubles in the January vote on two fronts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secular activists oppose the document because of wider powers it gives the military and the president. The Brotherhood rejects the entire amendment process _ along with the new government in general _ and although it has been weakened by a crackdown, it has kept up protests for over 20 weeks and can still mobilize against the document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the prosecutor general's office ordered 24 people who were arrested in Tuesday's activist protest to be held for four days for questioning on possible charges of violating the protest law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the prosecutors office accused the protesters of \"chanting antagonistic slogans against the state\" and refusing to end their rally. It said the demonstration \"disturbed traffic and affected citizens' interests,\" terms mentioned in the protest law as violations justifying police action. It also accused them of attacking a police officer and taking his telephone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor also ordered the arrests of Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Ahmed Maher, two top activists, on suspicion of inciting others to break the protest law, the state news agency MENA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of the Islamists' eagerness to find a common cause with secular activists, the Brotherhood-led coalition supporting Morsi reached out to them Wednesday with a statement denouncing \"brutal repression\" of the protests the day before, saying the \"youth of the revolution stand united.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition, Diaa al-Sawi, said he will contact youth activists to coordinate rallies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They met a quick rejection, however, from the youth activists, who joined the massive anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A message to the Muslim Brotherhood: we will not put our hands in the hands of those who betrayed and hijacked the revolution,\" said Hossam Moanis, spokesman of one activist group, the Popular Current.\nPassage 2:\nCairo (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested the head of the defense team for the 21 women and girls sentenced for protesting in Egypt last month, a colleague and member of the defense team told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawyer Ahmed El-Hamrawy was arrested at his home in Alexandria at dawn Monday, lawyer Mahmoud Farouq told CNN. \"I can't separate his arrest from the girls' case,\" said Farouq, who is part of the team defending the 21 jailed protesters. \"This means that any lawyer who comes close to the case will be detained.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gen.

The harsh sentence sparked wide criticism of the way the Interior Ministry and the judiciary have been handling the cases of Morsy supporters. An appeals hearing for their case is scheduled to take place Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years for various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,\" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptian lawmakers begin vote on new constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The verdict coincided with an increasing crackdown on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, detained during the Mubarak and the military council regimes in 2006 and 2011, is being held pending investigations for his alleged involvement in calling for a demonstration. Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, is also being questioned about similar charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Legislation restricting demonstrations reignited confrontations between police and the non-Islamist opposition, especially at university campuses across the country. A demonstration coinciding with the retrial of two policemen accused of killing Khaled Saied, whose death had fueled the uprising in 2011, was dispersed with force in Alexandria on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"El-Hamrawy was part of Morsy's opposition.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe upcoming Tribeca Film Festival has come under heat for its screening of a documentary that promotes the anti-vaccination movement. In a statement, Robert De Niro defended the screening of Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe while also distancing himself as part of the anti-vaccination movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Anti-Vaxxers: The Privilege of Putting Everyone at Risk If you're doing well enough, your bad decisions will probably only hurt someone else NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace [Hightower, De Niro's wife] and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined,\" De Niro said (via Variety). \"In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However, this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening Vaxxed. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Wakefield, the doctor-turned-documentarian behind Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, argues that vaccinations given to infants could lead to autism, a claim that the Centers for Disease Control has long denied. Wakefield's research papers on the subject have been attacked and discredited, and while his bio page on the Tribeca site mentions his work in the field, it doesn't mention that he's been accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information. Wakefield was also stripped of his medical license. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR De Niro's statement has sparked even more controversy as the actor's decision to include the documentary as part of the film festival that he helped found represents only one side of the anti-vaccination debate. Filmmaker Penny Lane, who made the documentary Nuts! about a snake oil salesman and medical fraud in general, penned an open letter to the Tribeca Film Festival asking them to reconsider the Vaxxed screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies,\" Lane wrote of Wakefield. \"In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one should have been easy. The anti-vaccination hoax has been completely discredited by now. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the 'vaccines cause autism' hoax; this film is 'directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of now, Vaxxed is scheduled to screen April 24th at the film festival.\nPassage 2:\nMr. De Niro’s statement seemed to suggest that this was the first time he has expressed a preference that a particular film be shown at the festival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace and I have a child with autism,” he wrote, referring to his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, “and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within hours his statement, posted on Facebook, generated hundreds of comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer for the film, filled with dramatic music, opens with the words “Are Our Children Safe?” on a black screen with billowing smoke that appears to be coming from a syringe. The trailer includes the suggestion that a “whistle-blower” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would say that the organization “had committed fraud” and “that they knew that vaccines were actually causing autism.” Mr. Wakefield appears in the trailer saying, “Wow, the C.D.C. had known all along there was this M.M.R. autism risk.”\nPassage 3:\nThe Tribeca Film Festival is facing serious backlash for including anti-vaccination documentary “Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe” from doctor-turned-documentarian Andrew Wakefield into its 2016 lineup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wakefield is a fervent believer in the link between vaccination and autism. He has also been the subject of many controversies, including being accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information as early as 1998 in one of his research papers. Wakefield’s bio on the festival’s page for the documentary mentions the research paper and study but not that it was later discredited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many called for a response about the festival’s decision. Robert DeNiro, co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, defended the choice to include the film, even though he doesn’t endorse the content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Including the film has prompted some to categorized the festival’s decision as “irresponsible” and called out the film for being “dishonest” and “one-sided” in its message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Centers for Disease Control, there is no link between vaccination and Autism Spectrum Disorders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, in a statement on the org’s website says “vaccines are very important” and “parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He adds that, “If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film premieres on April 24 at the Tribeca Film Festival, which will include a conversation with the filmmakers after the screening.\nPassage 4:\nVaxxed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tribeca Film Festival, I love you but you made a very serious mistake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the widely discredited and dangerous anti-vaccination quack Andrew Wakefield tweeted: “Haven’t posted forever. Huge news tomorrow.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps he hadn’t “posted forever” because the media finally stopped giving him a megaphone. Perhaps once people in America and England began dying of measles, journalists finally realized that the “two sides to every story” approach granted Wakefield was literally killing people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last I heard, Wakefield was headlining Conspira-Sea, a seven-day cruise where passengers learn about crop circles, chemtrails, yogic flying, ESP and astrology. Good, I thought, that’s where he belongs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, not so fast. It seems the quack is back. Wakefield’s “huge news” is that he is now a documentary film director, and that his new film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe will premiere at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival this April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your film festival guide suggests that if I’m interested in Vaxxed, I might also be interested in the category of “documentaries.” Well, as a documentary filmmaker who spent eight years making a film about a quack: yes, Tribeca Film Festival, I am very interested in both your choice to screen Vaxxed and in the field of documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have always admired Tribeca’s ambitious and broad documentary programming. I first saw (T)ERROR there, and The Genius of Marian, and Tomorrow We Disappear, and Thank You For Playing, and Give Up Tomorrow, and Let The Fire Burn – and so many other excellent films. And this is what makes your decision all the more pernicious: audiences have come to expect excellence from your documentary programming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When The Los Angeles Times contacted you for comment, they received this response: “Tribeca, as most film festivals, is about dialogue and discussion. Over the years we have presented many films from opposing sides of an issue. We are a forum, not a judge.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here is the problem with your statement: it assumes that Vaxxed is just like any other film taking on an unpopular, controversial or provocative subject. It is not. There is a big difference between advocacy and fraud, between point of view and deception. For you to claim there is no difference helps to perpetuate Wakefield’s fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, it is disingenuous for you to claim you are not a “judge.” You are literally judging when you choose a film, from thousands of submissions, to screen under your banner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A lot of people, including those who buy tickets to see docs at your festival, believe documentary film has become a new and important form of news. But journalists are expected to tell the truth — or at least not knowingly spread dangerous lies. Your choice to include Vaxxed in your documentary lineup — a lineup including films about abortion, Syrian refugees, solitary confinement, the American electoral system, in-vitro fertilization and drone warfare — suggests that you think documentary filmmakers can’t be held even to the latter standard. This threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So yes, I take this personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider how many lies there are in the first 30 seconds of the Vaxxed trailer. Wakefield’s cinematic disregard of the truth means his film should not be called a documentary any more than Loose Change is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one is easy. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the “vaccines cause autism” hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this hoax isn’t cute, or fun, or thought-provoking. Very possibly, some people will walk away from your festival having been convinced, in part because of your good name and the excellence and integrity of your documentary programming, not to vaccinate their children. And very possibly people will die as a result. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s no shame in having been taken in by quack – the reason I made NUTS! is that I wanted to explore just how easy it is to fall for a quack, especially one cloaked in the authority of a documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I believe you were fooled in just this way: taken in by an apparently legitimate “documentary” film, a film which unethically used the tools of my trade toward bad ends. I believe you made a very serious (if human) mistake. But it’s not too late to fix it. You can still apologize for your error and cancel the screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know that some people will say I’m advocating censorship when I say this. I appreciate that concern. The last thing I would want is for festivals to stop being bold, independent tastemakers afraid of controversy. And I would never suggest banning the film is some global sense (as if that were even possible!). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the problem is not that Vaxxed is controversial, or even that it’s deceptive. Honestly, I consider a large number of well-made, popular documentary films fairly deceptive. The problem is that it is dangerous misinformation being legitimized under the banner of your considerable prestige. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Penny Lane (Our Nixon) is a two-time grantee of the Tribeca Film Institute whose most recent film, NUTS! (concerning an infamous, evil quack who was still considerably funnier and nicer than Andrew Wakefield) recently won a special jury award for editing at Sundance and opens at Film Forum on June 22.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nHilary Rosen, a Democratic operative with SKD Knickerbocker, touched off a Twitter storm tonight after she went on CNN and said that Ann Romney has \"never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement was tweeted and retweeted, with a number of people condemning the statement as an attack on the candidate's wife, who was a stay-at-home mom who also raised the couple's five boys, and who has suffered from MS and breast cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, who is widely praised as her husband's most effective surrogate, took to Twitter herself for her first-ever post, saying, \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (See also: 10 things about Hillary Rosen) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of people leapt to her defense, and President Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina and top adviser David Axelrod tweeted out disavowals of a statement that seemed insensitive to stay-at-home moms and sounded like a devaluation of what Ann Romney's life was like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize,” Messina tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive,\" Axelrod tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's firm also employs Anita Dunn, former White House communications director, and worked on the Obama campaign in 2008. Her critics on Twitter described her as an \"Obama adviser,\" just a bit of a stretch in description, but not enough of one for some critics, especially after Democrats have hit Republicans for guilt by association with people like Rush Limbaugh for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, Rosen doubled down — tweeting back at Ann Romney, \"I am raising children too. But most young American women HAVE to BOTH earn a living AND raise children. You know that don't u?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, she tweeted in her own defense, \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! # Truth\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And she went further in a Huffington Post blog item, saying Mitt Romney has to stop hiding behind his wife's \"skirt,\" and condemned the \"faux outrage\" from the right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, according to Dylan Byers, will be on Fox News tomorrow morning, giving the issue fresh life. And Ann Romney is known for giving strong interviews. Her husband is also guaranteed to be asked about it — and if the perception is she is being unfairly attacked, he will have won the cycle, and potentially many more to come. For Romney, who polls show facing a large gender gap with women and who has been trying to move away from social issues conversations, it could help him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flip side is that Rosen's comments are now getting oxygen beyond the Twitterverse (and the CNN-verse), letting Democrats underscore, without doing much to push it out themselves, the notion that Ann Romney, whose husband was a success in business, may not have had a life similar to some swing voters' lives, despite how hard she worked raising her kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also worth noting — Messina's line that family should be \"off limits.\" Given the criticisms that Michele Obama has received over the years, it seems likely that Rosen's comment will be highlighted by Democrats if something comes up in the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: Rosen appears to have rewritten her Huffington Post blog post last night; the line about Romney hiding behind his wife's skirt is no longer there, and now the column mirrors one that ran on CNN's website.\nPassage 2:\n7 years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) - Democratic Strategist Hilary Rosen generated instant bipartisan criticism Wednesday night for her statement that Ann Romney has \"actually never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reaction on Twitter from high level politicos was instant and virtually unanimous: Rosen had gone too far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen: Ann Romney and working moms NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's comment also prompted Ann Romney herself to make her twitter debut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys,\" Romney tweeted. \"Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen, also a CNN political contributor and a working mother, made her comments on CNN's \"AC360.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, 'Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.' Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life,\" Rosen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing, in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why do we worry about their future,\" Rosen continued, adding that Romney \"just seems so old fashioned when it comes to women.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her comments drew instant criticism on Twitter from campaign advisers on both sides of the aisle, as well as one of Romney's sons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh Romney posted that his mother \"is one of the smartest, hardest working woman I know. Could have done anything with her life, chose to raise me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senior adviser to President Barack Obama's reelection bid also took to Twitter to distance the campaign from the comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney,\" David Axelrod wrote. \"They were inappropriate and offensive.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter posted, \"Families must be off limits on campaigns, and I personally believe stay at home moms work harder than most of us do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several press aides to Romney's campaign - Andrea Saul, Ryan Williams, and Amanda Henneberg - posted links tying Obama to Rosen, such as her appointment as a DNC adviser and her appearance at a White House event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney campaign strategist Eric Fehrnstrom wrote: \"Obama adviser Hilary Rosen goes on #CNN to debut their new \"kill Ann\" strategy, and in the process insults hard-working moms.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eric Erickson, a CNN political contributor and editor of a conservative website, appeared on the same panel as Rosen, and tweeted, \"If raising 5 sons through breast cancer and MS isn't a real job, I'm not sure what is.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comment drew criticism from a Republican member of Congress, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who posted, \"Wrong. Being a mom is a full-time job.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen explained her comments in a post on the social networking site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! #Truth,\" she wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She later posted a direct comment to Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Please know, I admire you.

The accusations were flying. I don't know what it means to be a mom (I have 2 children). I obviously don't value the work that a mother does and how hard it is (the hardest job I have ever had); and I absolutely hate anyone who doesn't have the same views as I do (hate is a strong word). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spare me the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women's rights and advancement as a way to score political points. When it comes to supporting policies that would actually help women, their silence has been deafening. I don't need lectures from the RNC on supporting women and fighting to increase opportunities for women; I've been doing it my whole career. If they want to attack me and distract the public's attention away from their nominee's woeful record, it just demonstrates how much they just don't get it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My favorite tweet was from someone who said that Republicans like Ann Romney so much more than Mitt that by attacking her (which I didn't), I got people to defend him in a way they never would. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That last one I can actually understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now let's be clear on one thing. I have no judgements about women who work outside the home vs. women who work in the home raising a family. I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full-time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let's stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why does this even matter? It matters purely because Mitt Romney put the issue of his wife's views squarely on the table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Ruth Marcus noted in her column yesterday in the Washington Post, Romney, when asked last week about the gender gap, twice said he wished his wife could take the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,\" Romney told newspaper editors, \"and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it begs the question, is Ann Romney Mitt's touchstone for women who are struggling economically or not? Nothing in Ann Romney's history as we have heard it -- hardworking mom she may have been -- leads me to believe that Mitt has chosen the right expert to get feedback on this problem he professes to be so concerned about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have nothing against Ann Romney. She seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys, struggled with illness, and handles its long-term effects with grace and dignity. I admire her grit in talking about her illness publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is more important to me and 57% of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women's economic issue because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's put aside for a moment his views on women's health issues -- such as his pledge to repeal funding for Planned Parenthood or repeal title X -- which provides important health services for poor women, and true anecdotes (such as when he was a Bishop in his church, he actually went to a congregant's hospital room and told a young single mother who had just given birth that she was shaming the church and should give her baby away). Let's put those issues of respect and health dignity away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's just focus on his economic record on behalf of women. When Romney ran Bain Capital, less than 10% of the senior workforce were women. And he said in his 1994 Senate race that it was because he had trouble finding qualified women to be executives. Is there a woman alive who believes that? I personally believe that women hate the way our health issues were made a political football by the Republicans in the last several months. But I am pragmatic enough to believe that the economic issues do matter greatly to women and men alike. But the only way that Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the wide gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn't exist.

She likely knew the baby news would spark attention regardless, so she harnessed that platform to remind everyone about the midterms. Honestly, it's perfectly strategic.

Some 25 years later, the marine engineer from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is despondent on being forced to bear the burden of his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years after passing out as a marine engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Noorul Islam University, Saddam Hussain says he has failed to find a job because of his namesake: the former Iraqi ruler executed in 2006. Saddam Hussein was a dictator blamed for atrocities on his subjects until toppled by the US in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People are scared to hire me,” laments Jamshedpur’s Saddam. His job application has been rejected each of the 40-odd times he has appeared for interviews with multinational shipping companies. His batchmates around the world have secured employment, but Saddam remains unemployed despite ranking second in his batch of 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the initial six months, Saddam was unable to decipher why he was being rejected. “I then inquired with the HR departments of the companies and some of them told me my name was the problem,” he recounts. He was told that having a crew member with a name that arouses instant suspicion could be an operational nightmare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A top executive of Delhi-based TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment consultant, agrees. “If the issue involves crossing the borders, then nothing can be done as border patrol and airport authorities are very process-driven and if there is a red flag, they will check out. If the person’s job involves frequent travel abroad, he might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,” he points out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Even Shah Rukh Khan gets detained at US airports. What is this Saddam in comparision?” he asks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting rid of the name is proving to be a bigger nightmare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once it hit him that his name was the impediment, Saddam legally got his name changed into Sajid and procured all relevant documents, including passport, voter ID and driving licence, under the name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his woes did not end there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prospective employers ask for his educational certificates, but his university has refused to change the name until he got his Class 10 and 12 exam certificates changed first. He approached the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for a name change, but the authorities have not acted yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driven to desperation, Saddam, now Sajid, moved the Jharkhand high court with a plea to direct the CBSE to change his name. But since unscrupulous people often abuse the system by frequently changing names, the court acted with caution. Last week, it set the date for a considered hearing on May 5. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saddam remains fond of his grandfather, though he feels he is paying for his folly.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He did well at college, and his classmates have already found jobs, but shipping companies turn him away.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his job applications are still not proceeding smoothly as he cannot provide proof, under his new name, that he went to school - and this is proving to be a time-consuming exercise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another court hearing beckons on 5 May, this time to force authorities to change the name on his secondary school certificates, after which his graduation papers will need amending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sajid is not alone in his plight - but he may feel more aggrieved than the numerous Saddam Husseins of Iraq, who feel cursed with a name that was originally given in tribute to a leader whose legacy is one of a brutal dictator.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nGRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) — Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find was announced Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bureau of Land Management archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Grady called the find \"tantalizing,\" but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he said. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, Thomas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.\nPassage 2:\nPORTLAND, Ore. - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside of Riley in southeast Oregon, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States, officials said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists with the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their discoveries have included a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel (Camelops sp.) that became extinct approximately 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what has the archaeological community most excited is a small stone tool found below a layer of volcanic ash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the bottom of a 12-foot deposit, archaeologists discovered a layer of ash that was identified as volcanic ash from a Mt. St. Helens eruption about 15,800 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beneath the layer of volcanic ash, archaeologists discovered a small orange agate tool believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies,” said Scott Thomas, BLM Burns District archaeologist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presently, Oregon’s Paisley Cave, also managed by the BLM, is considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2008, a team of archaeologists, led by Dr. Dennis Jenkins with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, discovered coprolites - dried feces - containing human DNA dated over 14,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Patrick O’Grady, with the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, has been directing the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter excavations since they began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When we had the volcanic ash identified, we were stunned, because that would make this stone tool one of the oldest artifacts in North America. Given those circumstances and the laws of stratigraphy, this object should be older than the ash,” said O’Grady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While we need more evidence before we can make an irrefutable claim, we plan to expand our excavation this summer and hopefully provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash. That’s the next step,” he added, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers and volunteers invaluable field experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stan McDonald, BLM Oregon/Washington lead archaeologist, explained the potential this discovery has for the archaeological community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For years, many in the archaeological field assumed that the first humans in the western hemisphere were the Clovis people – dating to around 13,000 years ago,\" McDonald said. \"While a handful of archaeological sites older than Clovis cultures have been discovered in the past few decades, there is still considerable scrutiny of any finding that appears older.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “With the recent findings at Rimrock Draw Shelter, we want to assemble indisputable evidence, because these claims will be scrutinized by researchers,\" he said. \"That said, the early discoveries are tantalizing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flickr photo album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/blmoregon/sets/72157651118216896/\n", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

Analysis of the tool—which is made from orange agate not usually found in the area—revealed it had been used to butcher an animal believed to be the extinct buffalo species Bison antiquus, KTVZ reports.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCigarette price hike risks black market - PM NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Adam Ray NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Prime Minister says a huge hike in the cost of cigarettes could encourage a black market for smokers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3 News revealed yesterday that Health Ministry officials think cigarettes need to cost $100 a packet to make New Zealand smoke-free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia says she has a whatever-it-takes attitude to the idea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Felix Five would love to quit, but struggles because he's addicted. He says pumping up the cost of cigarettes won't stop smokers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People still use heroin,” says the smoker. “It is expensive, cocaine is expensive.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One proposal is for prices to increase by around a third every year to reach $100 a packet within eight years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But officials said one shock increase followed by smaller increases is more reasonable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Key says the Government is looking at a range of policies to stop smoking and huge price hikes could fuel black market trading.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ministry of Health wants New Zealand to be smoke free by 2025 and the suggested increase gives the first hint of the drastic measures being discussed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A document released under the Official Information Act to the country's 3 News website features a number of pricing scenarios - with the most extreme showing a single cigarette costing the equivalent of £2.50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One option being considered is a 10% increase on a pack of 20 cigarettes year-on-year from 2013 to 2025, meaning it would cost $40 (£20) a pack by 2024. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a second scenario would see packs at $100 each by 2020, achieved by an immediate shock rise of 30% to 60%, with on-going increases of 30% each year after that.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous Stories: Yonaton Aguilar Case NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four years before, when reports of possible child abuse were reported, Yonotan’s mother Veronica Aguilar, who was a volunteer at the school and attended parenting classes, was able to convince his teachers, counselors, coaches, medical staff and social workers that her son was safe in her home. Then, when Yonotan stopped showing up for school, his mother told people he had gone to live in an institution in Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the court documents, Yonotan’s three siblings and his mother were the only ones in on the secret. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think there was a façade that occurred that took everyone in, including law enforcement,” Browning said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Los Angeles Times, redacted court records indicate Aguilar effectively disappeared in 2012 after he was seen at school with a black eye and school officials said he was hoarding food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aguilar told the boy’s therapist that Yonatan lived with his maternal grandmother until age 3, and he was likely deprived of food during that time and developed the habit of hoarding food, according to the records cited by The Times.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials with county Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) — which had responded to six reports of possible abuse or neglect involving the family from 2009 to 2012 and marked the boy’s risk of abuse “high” four times — had no further contact, according to The Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After claiming allegations of abuse were inconclusive or unfounded, social workers never formally opened a case, according to the records cited by the paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Aguilar told Jose Pinzon, the boy’s stepfather, that he had died.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — Shaun White stood at the top of the halfpipe, the last contestant of the competition, needing a near-perfect run to capture his third consecutive gold medal at the Winter Olympics. He has built an empire on such moments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It felt too perfect, too scripted, even by the standards of storytelling that White has inspired. The crowd hushed in anticipation of another command performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White sped down the hill and crested the leading edge of the massive halfpipe and began what was sure to be a monumental run. And that is when it happened — a hard landing here, a gasp-inducing bobble there, the dominance of the world’s greatest halfpipe snowboarder slipping away with each diagonal weave downhill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White ended up in fourth, a placing probably higher than he deserved, ceding the Olympic throne to someone else for the first time since 2002. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For me to be remembered in the sport, I don’t think tonight makes or breaks my career,” White said. “I’ve been snowboarding for so long, and I love it so much, that I’m happy to take this for what it is and move on and continue to ride.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Slide Show NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Iouri Podladtchikov of Switzerland — I-Pod to his friends — who won the gold medal by doing a trick and a run that White and the others could not match. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It really felt like there was no fighting at all,” Podladtchikov said. “It felt like it was all meant to be. It’s really weird.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than anything, the night felt like the edge of a new era. Ayumu Hirano, a 15-year-old from Japan, won the silver medal, and his countryman Taku Hiraoka won bronze. For the first time since the halfpipe was added to the Olympics in 1998, there were no Americans on the podium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four Americans were in the 40-man field, and three of them advanced to the 12-man final. But Greg Bretz and Danny Davis, two of the snowboarders who had previously beaten White in a halfpipe competition, each fell on both of their runs. Davis finished 10th, Bretz 12th. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I hate not landing two runs,” Davis said. “Especially in this event, with such a big crowd and the amount of media here. But, back to normal life, man.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis called White’s fourth-place score “a gift” from the judges, and said the result was good for the sport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The world knows now that there’s other snowboarders beside Shaun,” Davis said. “It’s great, man. There’s a bunch of good riders in our sport, and they deserve some credit, too.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Podladtchikov, who grew up in Davos but competed for Russia at the 2006 Turin Games, can sometimes match White’s acrobatics. His Yolo (“You Only Live Once”) flip, 1,440 degrees of rotation that includes two aerial somersaults, was a rare trick that White did not master first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Podladtchikov landed it perfectly, anchoring a run that was awarded 94.75 points out of 100. The cheering crowd waved Swiss and Russian flags. Podladtchikov moved to Switzerland from Russia when he was 8, and the merging of time and place hit hard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I love to be here,” he said. “I love to speak Russian. It’s my mother language, and it reminds me of so many things.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Rank Competitor points ● 1 SUI Iouri Podladtchikov 94.75 ● 2 JPN Ayumu Hirano 93.50 ● 3 JPN Taku Hiraoka 92.25 4th USA Shaun White 90.25 5th SUI David Habluetzel 88.50 6th CHN Zhang Yiwei 87.25 7th CHN Shi Wancheng 81.00 8th SLO Tim-Kevin Ravnjak 72.25 9th AUS Kent Callister 68.50 10th USA Danny Davis 53.00 11th SUI Christian Haller 51.50 12th USA Gregory Bretz 26.50 All Fewer Results Expand Results NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six riders had a chance to beat Podladtchikov’s score. Davis was one of them. A near-perfect first run was upended by a stumble in the flat portion of the pipe between the 22-foot walls, a choppy and sugary gutter of uneven snow and ice. (Davis blamed it on a “snow snake.”) His second run was doomed from the start, out of balance until he crashed while landing a trick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suspense built with each rider. Hiraoka elevated into second place. The 5-foot-3, 110-pound Hirano is the rare competitor who can launch himself out of the pipe and reach the heights of White, as if filled with helium. His score, 93.5, put him in second place. There was only one competitor left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White came to Sochi hoping to win two gold medals, having spent a year preparing for the debut of slopestyle, an event he dominated on the snowboarding circuit a decade ago. But after a couple of days of training on the slopestyle course last week, amid concerns over the size and shapes of the jumps, he pulled out to focus on the halfpipe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The American Sage Kotsenburg won the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The slopestyle course had some issues, and I just felt like my best bet was to focus on the halfpipe,” White said Tuesday. “Then the halfpipe had some issues.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The night before the competition, some athletes suggested that the event be postponed because of poor conditions and a lack of practice time. Crews worked overnight honing the shape of the pipe, which tilted downhill for about 250 yards. In the hour before the competition, workers sprinkled salt on its surface to get it to melt slightly and refreeze, and they sprayed it with water from large hoses. The result was not perfection but adequacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few, like Davis, took pratfalls in the gutter of the pipe. Others flew above its walls and crashed hard on the deck. Qualifications weeded the unlikely podium crashers out of the contest. A temperature close to freezing during the prime-time finals helped keep the pipe intact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Afterward, riders were reluctant to place blame on the pipe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Everybody had the same pipe to deal with,” Davis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White looked down at the pipe through his dark goggles. He had mastered the Yolo flip, and sometimes performed it better than Podladtchikov. With the gold medal on the line, he launched himself into the flip on the opposite side from where Podladtchikov performed his. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White’s board hit the lip of the pipe, bending but not breaking. He somehow stayed on his feet and sped across the pipe for his next trick. By then, his chance at winning a third gold medal was gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I went for big tricks that only Iouri and myself are doing,” White said. “I could have played it safe, I guess, and tried to get in a decent score, but I really wanted to win. We came here on a mission, and it just wasn’t my night, which is really tough to say. It’s a big night.”\nPassage 2:\n1 of 35 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Highlights from Day 3 of competition at the 2014 Winter Games View Photos Julia Mancuso wins bronze.

But there was no need for a translator Monday because nobody was mincing words: The Sochi halfpipe is substandard, the top riders in the world agreed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just one day before the Olympic halfpipe competition is scheduled to begin, snowboarders criticized the condition of the pipe, and one former gold medal winner even suggested the event be pushed back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Everyone is not happy right now,” said three-time Olympian Hannah Teter, the 2006 gold medal winner in the event. “I saw everyone take a hard fall today. That never happens. . . . They should push it back is what they should do, and fix it so we can showcase snowboarding the way it needs to be showcased. Not as a junk show, which is what it was looking like right now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men’s halfpipe competition is scheduled for Tuesday night at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park with the women scheduled to compete Wednesday. Officials were planning to work through the night to improve the pipe, after a second straight day of uncharacteristic spills and unrestrained critiques. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaun White, the two-time gold medal winner in the event, didn’t try to hide his frustration following practice Monday night, calling the pipe “disappointing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s hard to get in there and have all the tricks and have everything that you need and not be able to get to the wall,” he said. “I just had a frustrating practice and I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evolving sports of the Winter Olympics See which sports have come and gone NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Practice Monday was originally scheduled for the morning but was postponed so officials could work on the pipe. Later in the evening, riders said as practice progressed, the transitions grew increasingly bumpy, and the flat surface area between the walls deteriorated. Teter likened it to a mogul field. Many riders had trouble staying upright and gathering momentum between tricks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s not what halfpipe is supposed to be like,” Teter said. “People are supposed to be landing their tricks.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowboarders said the pipe was actually improved from Sunday, the first day of practice. The walls and curves received significant work. One U.S. coach said the warm weather Monday helped the snow stick earlier in the day, but riders said after a single practice run the pipe worsened and snowboarders began to fear what conditions would be like during actual competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American Danny Davis stopped short of calling the course dangerous. “It's just not as fun,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With more freestyle events, the Sochi Olympics will look more like the Winter X Games than ever before. (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riders say they’ve been told the course will receive further treatment and grooming overnight, but some were openly considering their options after Monday's practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If all of us got together, and we’re like, ‘We’re not doing it, let’s push it back,’ maybe they would,” Teter said. “I don’t know if that’s going to happen.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teter acknowledged such a protest was unlikely, but she said White’s representatives have expressed concerns. White pulled out of the slopestyle competition last week, calling the course “intimidating” and saying he didn’t want to risk injury before his featured event. While he expressed frustration with the halfpipe course Monday night, he wasn’t certain what changes might occur before the competition begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t know the exact plan,” White said. “I’m sure there will be some sort of coaches’ meeting or something. I don’t really get involved in that. I’m hoping they can do whatever they can to make it a better pipe. It’s hard to get here and see this and feel the pressure. I don’t know.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the current conditions, most said they’d have to alter their planned runs. White said he’d have trouble throwing his cab double cork 1440. “I’m hoping for the best,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Said Davis: “There’s a bunch of kids who can ride well in these conditions. I’m a little bit worried about myself riding so well in these conditions. Like I said, we’re going to ride it anyway.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mountains of the Olympics See why altitude matters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After two days of practices, riders say the Sochi Olympics pipe will force all riders to make adjustments. Many competed in a test event here last year and said the pipe was subpar at the time. A year later, it's still noticeably different from what they see in regular competitions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the U.S., we build the best pipes in the world,” said Peter Foley, the U.S. snowboarding head coach. “We’ve had great contest pipes all year long. . . . That’s the standard; that’s what you like to see.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Competing in her fourth Olympics, Kelly Clark has ridden the best halfpipes in the world. Despite the conditions this week, she said the Sochi pipe is actually an improvement over the one in Vancouver four years ago because of its steeper walls and a longer run. Even if conditions aren’t perfect this week, she said the best riders in the world should be good enough to deal with the adversity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you’re making a mistake, it’s going to be amplified,” said Clark, who won gold at the 2002 Games. “The strongest rider is still going to come out on top.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though tricks will be thrown and medals handed out, the event deserves better, Teter said, particularly on an Olympic stage with the whole world watching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You want everybody to see snowboarding as it should be, looking phenomenal with everybody doing what they know how to do,” she said. “Hopefully, they can pull it together.”\n", "answers": ["Snowboarders in Sochi have been raising serious concerns about the state of the Olympic halfpipe, the scene of actual competition today: \"Everyone is not happy right now,\" 2006 US gold medalist Hannah Teter told the Washington Post after yesterday's practice.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nResources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cause for concern NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That’s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keeping an eye on the big picture NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water—about $11.3 billion—as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For further information, please visit: pewenvironment.org/pacificfish NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Write the Pacific Fishery Management Council at: pfmc.comments@noaa.gov\nPassage 2:\nThe sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,\" Hanson said. \"Not very well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,\" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it collapsed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.\n", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 1551, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f7a80199602fd125d0170e159ef8cf03b2850f0261096690"}

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nDuring Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, all of us living in besieged West Beirut were aware that the Israeli military was seeking to eliminate the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and had no qualms about killing large numbers of civilians in the process. We knew this from the aerial bombardment of the area around Beirut's Arab University, where the PLO had many of its offices. Dozens of apartment buildings there had been reduced to rubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toward the end of Israel's ten-week bombardment and siege of Beirut, a building that housed refugees located several blocks from my home in the Sanayeh neighborhood was entirely destroyed from the air, killing dozens. Immediately after the attack, I surveyed the carnage with a friend. After leaving him to return home, I heard another huge explosion -- it was a car bomb, presumably set off close to the destroyed building in order to kill those trying to rescue survivors. My friend barely escaped with his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This and other examples of the handiwork of the architects of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, preeminent among whom was Ariel Sharon, failed to make it into most of the hagiographic coverage of the man's passing in the American and Israeli media. We were instead told that Sharon was \"controversial,\" and that Palestinians had criticisms of him, but that he was a \"hero,\" a \"staunch defender of Israel's security,\" and most grotesquely, \"a peacemaker.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September 2012, the New York Times published an op-ed on the 30th anniversary of the Sabra and Shatila massacres, during which the Israeli military stood by while their right-wing Lebanese allies murdered nearly 1,400 defenseless Palestinian and Lebanese civilians in a Beirut refugee camp. The article, which was based on newly uncovered documents in the Israel State Archives, revealed new details on Sharon's role in, and indirect American diplomatic responsibility for, these atrocities. The New York Times did not, however, feature this account in its coverage of Sharon's death. Instead, it re-ran online a 1983 apologia by Sharon for his invasion of Lebanon, during which there were nearly 50,000 casualties, most of them civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lebanon war that Sharon, then the defense minister, did more than anyone else to launch was an unmitigated catastrophe for the Palestinians, the Lebanese, and in the view of most Israelis at the time, Israel itself. Israel's subsequent occupation of South Lebanon until 2000, the consequent intensification of the Lebanese civil war, the slaughter of untold numbers of innocents, and the deaths of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and thousands of other combatants should all be laid in large part at Sharon's feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon's profound impact on the Middle East stretched far beyond Lebanon. If the creation of a truly sovereign, independent, contiguous, and viable Palestinian state is not possible today -- as most sober observers believe -- this is largely his achievement. From his appointment as agriculture minister in 1977 until his passing from the Israeli political scene after his stroke in 2006, he probably did more than any other Israeli leader to make Israel's colonization of the occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem an astonishing success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon flew over the region in a helicopter to select sites for new colonies, all the while pioneering novel means of stealing land from its Palestinian owners. As prime minister, he continued this expansion process, which has turned the occupied West Bank into a Swiss cheese patchwork thoroughly dominated by lush Israeli settlements on what seems to be every hilltop. Simultaneously, he engineered a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while retaining draconian control over it from without, thereby turning it into the world's largest open-air prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vice President Joe Biden eulogized Sharon today as a \"historic leader\" who was dedicated to the pursuit of peace. The very idea is ludicrous. Sharon began his career as a military commander renowned for ruthless assaults on innocent civilians -- like the slaughter in the West Bank village of Qibya in 1953, when commandos of his Unit 101 blew up homes over the heads of their residents, killing 69 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attack led to the first ever U.N. Security Council condemnation of Israel. It was not an isolated incident: Indeed, it established a pattern of dozens of \"eyes for an eye,\" and of the Israeli leadership's systematic deception about what was actually happening on the ground. This approach has characterized Israel's response to any resistance to its expansion since the foundation of the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon was emblematic of the Israeli refusal to accept that Palestinian resistance was an inevitable response to the forcible establishment of a Jewish state and the concomitant expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. In later years, he became one of the most sophisticated employers of the trope of \"terrorism\" to demean this resistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The characterization not only of those who took up arms against Israel, but of all Palestinians, as \"terrorists\" can be seen in the transcript of a meeting between Sharon, other Israeli ministers, and U.S. envoy Morris Draper on Sept. 17, 1982, in the midst of the Sabra and Shatila massacres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morris Draper: The hostile people will say, sure the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps. Ariel Sharon: So we'll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism [sic]. MD: We are not interested in saving any of these people. AS: If you don't want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone present at this meeting, American and Israelis, knew that there were no PLO fighters in the camps. More than 15,000 PLO personnel had been evacuated from Beirut weeks earlier in a deal brokered by the United States. Had any number of these hardened combatants -- who had resisted the Israeli siege of Beirut for nearly two months -- been present, the perpetrators of these massacres would not have been able to operate with total impunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, during this 90-minute meeting with Draper, Sharon repeated the canard that thousands of \"terrorists\" had remained behind after the PLO evacuation. He used the term \"terrorist\" 39 times, as part of a ceaseless browbeating of Draper, who had been told to demand that the Israelis immediately withdraw their forces from West Beirut. Instead of complying with Draper's request, Sharon stonewalled, giving the butchers inside the camps many more hours to complete their gruesome work under the glow of star shells fired by Israeli troops to illuminate the killing ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, the American and Israeli media are celebrating this very same man. It is hard to imagine this kind of kid-glove treatment of anyone else with such a list of atrocities to his name. But apparently, such inconvenient facts are not welcome. In a more just world, he would have ended up facing the International Criminal Court in The Hague. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yoav Lemmer-Pool/Getty Images\nPassage 2:\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that Ariel Sharon “withdrew troops from southern Lebanon.” Then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak withdrew Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000. The following version has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry A. Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arik Sharon started as a warrior. He ended his career on the way to being a peacemaker. On that journey from fighting in every one of Israel’s wars to lying comatose for eight years in a Jerusalem hospital, he symbolized the anguish and dilemmas of Israel. A people who had come to their historic homeland had established themselves, surrounded by a culture that never acquiesced in ceding what it considered Islamic patrimony. Even before the proclamation of the Jewish state, Israel found itself in a state of war that has never ended. It has always lacked the essential prerequisite for peaceful coexistence with its neighbors: their recognition of its existence, which everywhere else is the precondition of diplomacy, not its outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This state of affairs produced two aspects of the Israeli psyche: a hair-trigger response to security threats and an attitude toward the peace process both grudging and nostalgic. Israel’s margin of survival has been so narrow that its leaders felt they could not run risks about emerging military capabilities of countries that refused to accept and daily castigated the Jewish state. When threatened, preemption became its style of warfare. And it viewed the peace process both with reluctance to give up territory in an environment so rife with denunciation and with a definition of peace so sweeping as to be very difficult to achieve in a single negotiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he was struck down by a stroke in 2006 , Sharon as prime minister was in the process of putting before his people a vision of coexistence with the Palestinians. Many visionaries of peace in Israel were military men: Yitzhak Rabin won the 1967 war. Shimon Peres, though not a military man, went the same route: a hawk in his early career, a passionate advocate of the peace process in recent decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon had to undertake the longest journey to reach this insight. A daring commander, he conducted the battle that reversed the tide of the 1973 war; he was the principal advocate of the operations in Lebanon. For many years, he deplored America’s decision in 1973 to bring about a negotiated end of the war. I was secretary of state at the time, and he missed few opportunities to chide me.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States acted as it did then because we were convinced that, however vast the margin of victory, it would leave Israel with its historic challenge: how to translate victories over threats to its security into political coexistence with the societies it lived among. The Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, seemed to offer such a prospect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our many discussions, I always respected, then grew to admire and eventually develop affection for, this dedicated man living on a farm at the edge of the Negev desert, a kind of symbolic outpost. I looked forward to his visits while he was out of office; he would arrive at our meetings with maps under his arm that he used to explain the minimum requirements of Israel’s survival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As prime minister, Sharon unexpectedly broadened his definition of security. He sought to bridge the gap between physical and political security with the same courage and decisiveness that had brought him victory in battle. He volunteered the largest withdrawal in Israel’s history. He ended the Israeli occupation of Gaza and returned it to Arab self-rule as a unilateral act without reciprocity, abandoning even the Jewish settlements that had been established there. These gestures were conceived as a test case for a negotiation about the future of the West Bank, which Sharon once had viewed as a permanent Israeli outpost. The man who had identified security with the acquisition of territory became willing to cede territory for an outcome to fulfill the hopes for peace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It cannot be said that the result justified this act of faith. Israel was threatened by missile attacks from non-state actors: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza. Politically, Sharon’s vision was under attack from all sides: from those in Israel who insisted on a larger state, from Arab leaders who denied Israel the right to exist altogether, and from non-state terrorist groups. Still, Sharon’s vision reflected an essential first step; it was a sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace — to which both sides must make a contribution by taking concrete steps and not by largely symbolic acts alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With another peace process underway, one needs to respect the courage of those who are willing to brave it in light of so many disappointments. It must be conducted both with commitment to the process and with a recollection of unfulfilled hopes. The vision of peace must be coupled with a determination not to permit the peace process to be turned into another form of warfare. An outcome must not only draw lines of territorial divisions but also bring a meaningful acceptance of the Jewish state by its negotiating partner as well as by key Arab states.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n[Full Text]This HRC study examines key factors in people’s decisions to either adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet, and the first set of findings being released compares individuals who currently eat a vegetarian or vegan diet with those who have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but now consume meat. The findings of the study offer some potentially disappointing but illuminating conclusions that could inform advocacy and outreach strategies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the US, the population of current vegetarians/vegans sits at approximately 2%, while approximately 10% of the population are former vegetarians/vegans and about 88% have never been veg. This study, published by HRC, looks closely at that 12% of the population that identifies as either current or former vegetarians/vegans, and tries to better understand what makes people lapse, and in turn, what factors might help keep people veg. The findings presented here offer a lot of possible avenues for new strategic thinking in veg advocacy, and how we might move the vegetarian/vegan diet from the margins more towards the center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though there is rarely just one reason for people adopting or giving up a veg diet, it is not completely clear if lapses are due more to social pressures (eating a diet that seems unusual or outside the norm), or based on some other difficulty inherent to the diet itself. That being said, the findings do illuminate some things that many lapsed vegetarians/vegans have in common, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings. The study also shows that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This phase of release is part of a larger study of U.S. vegetarians and vegans. You can read more about the key findings, as well as the see the tables and methodologies, in the attached PDFs.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1995 I decided to stop eating meat. I could never really quite explain why, I think it was something to do with watching a documentary where they cooked a cat and partly because I had a really crap job working for Wolves Poly and felt my life was slipping away. It definitely wasn't anything to do with any 'vegetarian month'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I did a number of weird things. I experimented with stopping washing my hair (it got greasy), I stopped watching TV after catching Newsnight really stoned and deciding that Jeremy Paxman was fundamentally a comedian so there was little difference between the news and Beadle's About. I also stopped eating meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First it was just red meat. I said goodbye in a Birmingham Burger King; the sandwich was greasy and unpleasant and I thought 'good riddance'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I found eating only white meat was hard. People didn't know what to cook for me - they'd tell me I was just being awkward. They were right, so there was only one thing for it, cutting out all meat altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So I simply stopped putting it in my mouth. It was that simple. I didn't feel any different and what I cooked didn't really change as I was a complete povvo and didn't bother buying much meat anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be honest, I was the world's worst vegetarian. You see - I didn't really like vegetables very much. I'd spent most of my childhood terrified of them - horrid bland mushy things. It's only as an adult I realise that part of the problem is my mother's cooking - she hates using salt and has a tendency to over boil things. Thanks, Mum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So there we are. A vegetarian who hates vegetables and mostly lives on pasta and cheese. Healthy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fast-forward nearly 15 years and I'm a father of two and increasingly aware of my diet. My wife stopped her vegetarian ways when pregnancy brought cravings for meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With her help (this makes her sound like my sponsor in Fussy Eaters Anonymous) I'd managed to eat more vegetables - by the time our second child was in the womb she was having spinach cravings and I didn't complain once about having to eat boiled green leaves every day. For six months. So I was doing better with a wider diet but still no drinking from the meaty cup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My four-year-old son has the restricted palate that children often have. He mostly refuses to eat anything that isn't sausages or fruit, so dining out was becoming difficult. There was the small circle of cheesy carbs I'd eat, and the intersection with the circle of sausages that my son wants to eat was - well, if you understand your Venn diagrams you'll know there wasn't much in the middle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a trip to Hastings that finally did it. At a fish 'n' chip shop pretty much the only thing on the menu I could eat was a microwaved cheese pasty. I simply couldn't face it and ordered fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can't say I particularly enjoyed it. I found the portion of thick white flesh alarmingly large and I didn't want to think about the skin at all. However it did leave me feeling satisfied in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. Every cell in my body screaming \"protein - that's what you need.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My wife was very impressed with me. She asked me what I wanted to try next and the thing that had been filling my thoughts since deciding to allow meat back into my life was pepperoni pizza. Those little toasted cups of fat that make for a party in the mouth everyone can afford. Although to ponce it up a bit we ate it in Hampstead. Lardy dah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacon. Let's talk about bacon. There's no meat more glorious than bacon. You can add it to pasta instead of cheese. You can stick it in a sandwich, er ... instead of cheese. Or even rub it on to attract men (a top tip there ladies). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On telling my friends I was eating meat, one looked proud and said, \"Welcome back to Man Club.\" Although my new macho credentials were severely dented by the admission that largely I'd been eating chicken - \"Chicken? Why, us men class chicken as a vegetable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I still haven't tried real meat. I can do a spag bog or even a burger but no steaks. I'm still a bit frightened of them. All too fleshy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people must have had a similar experience. If you're a lapsed vegetarian (or a resurgent meat eater), what was it that made you fall off the vegetarian wagon?\nPassage 3:\nAfter decades of a growing appetite for meat, U.S. consumption is finally dropping after hitting \"peak meat\" a decade ago. But while many people are eating less meat, giving it up totally is much harder. Few people stick with their decision to become vegetarian or vegan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an attempt to move animal-free diets \"from the margins more towards the center,\" the Humane Research Council just put out the first study to put numbers to the lapsed vegetarian phenomenon. Their main takeaway is essentially what people have said for years: getting people to reduce their meat and dairy intake will be more effective overall than demanding \"purity,\" or complete elimination of animal products from their diet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to their research, drawn from a representative sample of more than 11,000 adults over age 17 in the U.S., while only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% used to be. Put another way, they found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet; a full 84% eventually revert back to eating meat or other animal products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study also shows how and why many people lapse. Most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) said they first transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that perhaps a slower approach leads to longer-lasting results. They also found that the \"window of opportunity is limited,\" when it comes to getting people to stick to their diets: A third-of people abandoned their animal-free diets in three months or less, and more than half abandoned it within the first year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reasons for quitting varied, but perhaps intuitively, a lot comes down to relationships. A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarians or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study also found that current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for being vegetarian—such as animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health—while many former vegetarians (58%) cited health as the main motivator. In other words, from the advocacy group’s perspective, health can be an effective \"foot in the door\" approach to increasing the number of vegetarians and vegans, but often not enough to keep people animal-free for the long-term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Humane Research Council also says advocates need to change the culture around being vegetarian or vegan and acknowledge its challenges. More than 60% of former vegetarians/vegans disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity. Nearly 50% said they found it too difficult to maintain a \"pure diet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The latest findings once again show that a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption,\" the report says. \"Advocates would be well advised to soften their appeals to avoid suggesting the choice is all or nothing.\"\n", "answers": ["It seems becoming a vegetarian and staying a vegetarian are two very different things.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "length": 1889, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3fca42831fd78b50edcecd41b56417aeca908a1fdffc7a3a"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nYouTube’s top trending content at the moment isn’t an advertisement, music video, or movie trailer. It is not a viral challenge video, nor is it something about Fortnite. Instead, it’s a shockingly raw breakup video featuring two of YouTube’s biggest comedy vloggers, Liza Koshy and David Dobrik. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liza Koshy, 22, is best known for going to stores and causing improvisational mischief, often featuring random items that anyone can buy. David Dobrik, 21, has also made a name for himself through funny vlogs, many of which feature his relationship with Koshy. Combined, the two have over 21 million subscribers, making them one of the most visible power couples on the platform. Except that the two broke up six months ago, according to a video uploaded yesterday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The split may come as a surprise to some fans, given that the two have been uploading videos with each other this entire time. Just two weeks ago, Dobrik shared footage of him surprising Koshy with a puppy, and before that, there was another video in which he brings her a monkey. But according to the pair, the two had grown apart enough that staying in a relationship just didn’t make sense anymore: they were leading separate lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ”Liza broke up with me because she felt like we’ve been kinda distant, because we’ve just been so busy, period,” Dobrik said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video’s popularity is not entirely thanks to the viewers who normally follow the everyday minutia of their favorite YouTubers. It’s gone viral because of how obvious it is that the two deeply care for one another. They joke around, they crack up, they cry. They sing each other’s praises and talk about how they’re still best friends. They make jabs about future boyfriends and girlfriends. When Koshy says that she is going through something and that she needs to love herself before she can love someone else, she knows it’s cliché — so you believe her. It helps that she pokes fun at herself. “This is gonna sound so lame, but I really want to spread love but I have to have it first, you know?,” Koshy says, laughing. “It’s like saying you’re gonna spread mayonnaise when you only have mustard.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point, breakups are their own genre of video on YouTube, and plenty of couples have announced a separation in front of the camera. Where before partners might consider joining things like banking accounts or bills, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge your brand with someone else’s. You don’t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another. To what degree should you own your relationship online? How will that relationship define you in the eyes of others on the internet? Even a simple tagged photo carries a much bigger meaning for some of us. You don’t want to give people the wrong idea about where things stand with certain people — or maybe you do want to send a very specific message out there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While most of us can simply stop tagging an ex on our social media accounts, YouTubers with channels revolving around their lives don’t have that luxury. Their entire livelihoods could be at risk if they disappoint or upset the audience following them. As ridiculous as it might sound, there’s a real need for disclosure regarding where they stand with those regularly featured in their videos. If nothing else, airing everything out this publicly is a preventative measure that could minimize the chance that either person will get harassed by fans who believe one person ought to be blamed for the breakup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Koshy and Dobrik know they’re operating within this strange space. They waited a long time to tell YouTube fans because they were both angry that they grew apart in the first place. And while we all know that what influencers show us is just a well-edited sliver of a much bigger picture, there’s a subtext of realness here. Koshy jokes that she could have wiped away her tears and fix up her appearance, but that wouldn’t be authentic. You believe her. More than that: you can’t help but watch and think, Man, I wish I had had a breakup as healthy as this one.\nPassage 2:\nThis was a very very stupid idea.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBEIJING — The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies, two largest consumers of energy, and two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Together we account for about 40 percent of the world’s emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to solve this problem together because neither one of us can solve it alone. Even if the United States somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it still wouldn’t be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. Likewise, even if China went down to zero emissions, it wouldn’t make enough of a difference if the United States and the rest of the world didn’t change direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s the reality of what we’re up against. That’s why it matters that the world’s most consequential relationship has just produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are jointly announcing targets to reduce carbon emissions in the post-2020 period. By doing this – together, and well before the deadline established by the international community – we are encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets soon and to overcome traditional divisions so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement in 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in less than three weeks in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in our own countries, and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris, sends an important signal that we must get this agreement done, that we can get it done, and that we will get it done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is also a milestone in the United States-China relationship, the outcome of a concerted effort that began last year in Beijing, when State Councilor Yang Jiechi and I started the United States-China Climate Change Working Group. It was an effort inspired not just by our shared concern about the impact of climate change, but by our belief that the world’s largest economies, energy consumers and carbon emitters have a responsibility to lead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The targets themselves are also important. Ambitious action by our countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change. The United States intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 – a target that is both ambitious and feasible. It roughly doubles the pace of carbon reductions in the period from 2020 to 2025 as compared to the period from 2005 to 2020. It puts us on a path to transform our economy, with emissions reductions on the order of 80 percent by 2050. It is grounded in an extensive analysis of the potential to reduce emissions in all sectors of our economy, with significant added benefits for health, clean air, and energy security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our target builds on the ambitious goal President Obama set in 2009 to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. We are on track to meet that goal, while creating jobs and growing the economy, with the help of a burgeoning clean energy sector. Since the president took office, wind energy production has tripled and solar energy has increased by a factor of ten. This summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, which account for a third of United States carbon pollution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chinese targets also represent a major advance. For the first time China is announcing a peak year for its carbon emissions – around 2030 – along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. That matters because over the past 15 years, China has accounted for roughly 60 percent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions world-wide. We are confident that China can and will reach peak emissions before 2030, in light of President Xi’s commitments to restructure the economy, dramatically reduce air pollution and stimulate an energy revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 – an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let’s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.\nPassage 2:\nThe United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What both countries are announcing, according to the White House: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UNITED STATES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by the year 2025, compared to what the U.S. was emitting in 2005. Previously, Obama had committed to cutting emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, and officials say the U.S. is on track to meet that goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that nations hope to finalize later in 2015 in Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHINA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Expand the share of China's energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20 percent by 2030. The U.S. says that would require China to develop up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind and solar.\n", "answers": ["The US and China rank as the world's two largest polluters, but a surprise deal is turning them into the world's two largest pollution fighters: The nations announced that they'll be working in tandem on long-term greenhouse-gas controls that would cut emissions by nearly a third over the next 15 years or so, CNN reports. \"As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers, and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,\" President Obama said in a joint press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping today at the end of the APEC summit. The move, which was months in the making, came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope, the Wall Street Journal reports. Calling it a \"game changer,\" Mother Jones notes that it could heavily influence next year's climate talks in Paris. Key mandates include the US reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by the year 2025 (compared to the year 2005), as well as doubling the rate of emissions reduction each year between 2020 and 2025 to an average 2.3% to 2.8%, the AP reports. China is pledging to stop increasing emissions by 2030 (even earlier, if possible), as well as increase energy from zero-emission sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear to 20% by 2030.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR #more# NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TO: Interested Parties NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FROM: Neil Newhouse, Romney for President Pollster NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RE: State of the Race NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DATE: September 10, 2012 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don’t get too worked up about the latest polling. While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama’s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, “It’s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race…He’s going to have to make the case that we wouldn’t even be at 8 percent if it weren’t for him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider the following points: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President’s failed policies – combined with Mitt Romney’s vision to strengthen the middle class – are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race. Next, the battlefield has actually expanded, not contracted. Note that Wisconsin is now in play and our campaign is now up with ads in that state, while the latest poll numbers from the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico show the race closing there. And this tightening is not an anomaly. Consider the traditional Democratic strongholds of New Jersey and Connecticut, won by President Obama in 2008 by margins of 15 points and 22 points, respectively. In both states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama’s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign’s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign’s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a “one-size-fits-all-campaign” effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC’s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are “extremely” or “very” excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being “extremely” or “very” excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney’s Ground Game: During last weekend’s “Super Saturday,” we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State.

The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6.\nPassage 2:\nAP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama \"has seen a bounce from his convention\" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to \"get too worked up about the latest polling.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as \"a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions\" and argued that the \"basic structure of the race has not changed significantly\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nNEW YORK (AP) — In the annals of film festival flops — from unexpected boos to red-carpet gaffes — the premiere of the Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart comedy \"Get Hard\" will go down as a doozy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this image released by Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Kevin Hart, right, and Will Ferrell appear in a scene from \"Get Hard.\" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Patti Perret) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this image released by Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Kevin Hart, top, and Will Ferrell appear in a scene from \"Get Hard.\" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Patti Perret) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the film premiered last week at the South By Southwest Film Festival, during a Q&A with director Ethan Cohen, an audience member voiced not so much a question as a harsh judgment. \"This film seems racist,\" he said, using an expletive. Another audience member also asked if the film, about a hedge fund manager (Ferrell) who witlessly hires a law-abiding acquaintance (Hart) to prepare him for maximum security prison after being sentenced for fraud, was perpetuating stereotypes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That sound you might have heard emanating from Austin was the loud cursing of marketing executives for the film, which opens Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though film festival Q&As are often filled with questionable observations, these atypically blunt rebukes received outsized attention, drawing headlines from The Los Angeles Times and others. The damage continued with early reviews that also questioned the movie's handling of homosexuality in various scenes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of the film's comedy rests on the Ferrell character's fears of being raped in prison, and among his preparations is an attempt to have oral sex with a gay man in a bathroom stall. A critic for The Guardian wrote that future viewers \"will be astonished that such a negative portrayal of homosexuality persisted in the mainstream in 2015.\" Variety wrote that the film was \"undone by some of the ugliest gay-panic humor to befoul a studio release in recent memory.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After initially seeking to avoid the controversy (Cohen, Ferrell and Hart cancelled interviews with The Associated Press before Ferrell and Hart rescheduled them), the film's stars and producers are vigorously defending their comedy as not a representation of stereotypes but a satire of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Any time you're going to do an R-rated comedy, you're going to offend someone,\" said Ferrell in an interview alongside Hart. He continued: \"But that's kind of what we do. We provoke. We prod. We also show a mirror to what's already existing out there. We're playing fictitious characters who are articulating some of the attitudes and misconceptions that already exist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Get Hard\" was written by Cohen along with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, writing-producers from the sketch comedy show \"Key and Peele.\" This is Cohen's directorial debut after penning screenplays to films like \"Idiocracy\" and \"Tropic Thunder,\" a film that memorably flirted with racially sensitive territory in Robert Downey Jr.'s lampoon, in black face, of a Method actor run amok. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In many ways, the comedy of \"Get Hard\" works similarly. Just as the humor of Downey's actor wasn't in his favor but about his own self-obsessive, racist delusions, Ferrell's character is a parody of the narrow perspective of the elitist one percent. He hires Hart's carwash owner and family man under the mistaken presumption that he's been to prison, that he's \"hard.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're looking at two characters that judged each other by their cover,\" said Hart. \"And after peeling off some of the layers to their onion, they realize that, 'Oh my God, this isn't the person I thought it was from the jump. It's a completely different person.' And that road to friendship ensues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Get Hard\" was conceived as a way to pair Hart and Ferrell, two of the most popular and bankable stars in comedy. Whether the film succeeds on its own terms or not, it's an attempt (one generally uncommon in wide-release studio films) to comment on contemporary issues of inequality and race within the context of a broad, often crude comedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adam McKay, Ferrell's longtime collaborator and a producer of \"Get Hard,\" said any backlash has been overinflated by \"lazy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given that we're a country with runaway income inequality, more people in jail than any other country, this is what people are crowing about? Trying to in a funny way deal with these issues?\" said McKay in a phone interview with fellow producer Chris Henchy. \"It really kind of got me mad. It's just cheap is what it is.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKay said the film was fashioned as \"a silly, filthy comedy\" on the outside, but a satire of income inequality underneath. Seeing the film as racist, he says, is \"kind of ridiculous and disheartening,\" since its intention is to parody those who live in bubbles of wealth and prejudice. To claims of homophobia he protested: \"Any individual going to maximum security prison would be afraid of violence and sexual assault. To equate that with homosexuality is ridiculous.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others have agreed, albeit more skeptically. In reviewing the movie for Vanity Fair, Eric D. Snider wrote that the film wasn't offensive to him as a homosexual; it's just not funny enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's not mean-spirited, and it's panicky straight guys, not gays, who are the target,\" wrote Snider. \"It's just disappointing, that's all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any bad buzz for \"Get Hard\" has likely been partially alleviated by the goodwill both Ferrell and Hart have in storage, as well as the distraction of Ferrell's dependably entertaining late-night appearances. The NAACP and GLAAD have not commented on the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Here's the beautiful thing about Will and myself: You're looking at two guys that are no strangers to criticism,\" said Hart. \"The critic's job is to critique. I don't think I've ever had a great review on a film that I've done. Not one. Everybody always has had something to say. And if they're not talking, then you have a problem.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the talking around \"Get Hard\" will affect it at the box office remains to be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People will go see it and there probably will be some people who are offended. It's definitely a very dirty movie and it's harsh,\" says McKay. \"It's a good-hearted movie at its root. Everything comes out in the wash with movies because they hang around for, like 78 years. You always end up seeing what a movie really is in the long run.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lennox reported from Los Angeles.\nPassage 2:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nImportance The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria set a goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020, but the extent of inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use is unknown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Objective To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults and children in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Design, Setting, and Participants Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and population-adjusted rates with 95% confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exposures Ambulatory care visits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Main Outcomes and Measures Based on national guidelines and regional variation in prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results Of the 184 032 sampled visits, 12.6% of visits (95% CI, 12.0%-13.3%) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusions and Relevance In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.\nPassage 2:\nMAY 02, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Allison Gilchrist, Associate Editor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions written in the United States are inappropriate, a new CDC study suggests.CDC researchers used data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to determine the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by patient age and diagnosis, as well as the estimated amount of antibiotic use that could be considered inappropriate.Of the 184,032 outpatient visits included in the data, 12.6% resulted in an antibiotic prescription. The researchers estimated that 353 of the 506 antibiotic prescriptions written annually per 1000 population were appropriate.Broken down further, the data revealed that sinusitis diagnoses resulted in the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56), followed by ear infections (47), and pharyngitis (43).“Half of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions may have been unnecessary, representing 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annually,” the researchers wrote. “Collectively across all conditions, an estimated 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions may have been inappropriate.”Last fall, the President signed an Executive Order on “detecting, preventing, and controlling antibiotic-resistant microbes” as part of the White House’s 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the current study results, a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary in order to meet that goal, the researchers noted.Because antibiotic overprescribing contributes to drug resistance, curbing the practice is a major public health care priority. Failure to do so could have grim consequences, as the CDC already estimates that 2 million individuals are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, and 23,000 of them die from these infections annually.In one of the more notorious examples , UCLA Health indicated that 179 patients might have been infected with “ superbug ” carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center during “complex endoscopic procedures that took place between October 2014 and January 2015.”“Health professionals generally know when antibiotics are and are not needed,” lead study author Katherine Fleming-Dutra, MD, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC’s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship, explained to Pharmacy Times. “Often, clinicians are worried about patient satisfaction. They think that a patient wants antibiotics…sometimes leading them to prescribe when they shouldn’t.”Pharmacists can help prevent this by providing patients with information about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use.“Pharmacists are the last health professional to see a patient when an antibiotic is prescribed,” Dr. Fleming-Dutra said. “When dispensing antibiotics, pharmacists can educate patients about properly taking antibiotics and about potential harms from antibiotics such as allergies, adverse events, and antibiotic resistance.”Beyond treating infections, other studies have found that as many as 1 in 10 health care providers prescribe antibiotics for almost every patient they see with a cold or bronchitis, despite the fact that antibiotics aren’t effective against viral infections.“It is important for all health professionals in all regions seeing patients of all ages to only prescribe antibiotics when they are needed, and if needed, select the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration,” Dr. Fleming-Dutra advised.The current study results appeared in the May 3, 2016, edition of JAMA.\nPassage 3:\nWASHINGTON—The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released today a first-of-its kind analysis of antibiotic use in doctors’ offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States. The analysis, conducted in partnership with a panel of leading antibiotic use experts, identifies acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse in human health care and establishes data-driven targets for eliminating the approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions issued in outpatient facilities across the country every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings are outlined in two documents released today: Pew’s report “Antibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings” and “Prevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among U.S. Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011,” an article authored by experts from Pew, CDC, and members of the panel, appearing in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. They outline the baseline analysis and condition-specific targets, as well as practical strategies to improve prescribing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This report provides the most in-depth picture to date of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. and will serve as a benchmark in measuring progress moving forward,” said David Hyun, M.D., a senior officer with Pew’s antibiotic resistance project, who focuses on research and policy development pertaining to the stewardship of antibiotics in health care settings. “While our estimates of unnecessary antibiotic use are conservative, it is clear that a small number of health conditions constitute the lion’s share of unwarranted antibiotic prescriptions in this country. These detailed data will help health care providers target stewardship efforts where they can do the most good.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings in the United States are unnecessary, according to the report. The majority are prescribed for acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The more antibiotics are used, the less effective they become. Reducing the needless use of antibiotics will slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, so-called superbugs, which are among the most urgent public health threats of our time,” said Kathy Talkington, director of Pew’s antibiotic resistance project. “Patients and health care providers must work together to understand when antibiotics will help and when they won’t, and help preserve these lifesaving drugs for patients who really need them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antibiotic use in outpatient settings represents the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics for human health care in the United States, and outpatient providers are often the first place patients go for health care when suffering from a cold, flu, sore throat, or other common condition for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The analysis concludes that: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Approximately 13 percent of all outpatient office visits in the United States, or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription; about 30 percent of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forty-four percent of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections (i.e., the common cold), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, allergies, influenza, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, the White House released a national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance, which included the goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent by 2020. Based on the panel’s estimate of unnecessary prescribing, this goal would be reached by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The panel outlined actions that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole can take to reach the targets, including: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individual outpatient health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing habits as well as implement stewardship activities in their practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health systems can provide expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health plans can assist in data collection and analysis—evaluating the antibiotic prescribing habits of their providers and providing feedback that highlights potential areas for improvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local health agencies can help provide outpatient facilities with information on best practices for implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and help develop regional partnerships between various health care stakeholders, such as providers, health plans, and health systems, in order to better coordinate stewardship activities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal agencies can track antibiotic prescribing at the national level, identifying areas for further improvement and providing technical assistance to stakeholders interested in implementing stewardship efforts of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance that develop standards to assess the quality of health care services can establish metrics to assess the antibiotic prescribing habits of health care providers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health care professional societies can provide expert guidance to their members on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and incorporating diagnostics to aid in prescribing decision-making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Prescribing unnecessary antibiotics is just one element of inappropriate use of antibiotics,” said Lauri Hicks, D.O., director of the CDC’s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. “Health care providers can also prescribe antibiotics at the wrong dose or for the wrong duration, amplifying the extent of inappropriate use. Setting a national target to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use is the first step, and we must work together across the health care continuum to reach this goal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pew, CDC, and the expert panel are preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing. It will set national targets for reducing unnecessary use in hospitals and will be released in 2017.

In 2013, CDC published a comprehensive analysis outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., titled Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 (AR Threats Report). The report sounded the alarm to the danger of antibiotic resistance, stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report ranked the 18 threats (bacteria and fungi) into three categories based on level of concern to human health—urgent, serious, and concerning—and identified: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minimum estimates of morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People at especially high risk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaps in knowledge about antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Core actions to prevent infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and slow spread of resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What CDC was doing at that time to combat the threat of antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data below is pulled from the 2013 Threats Report. CDC is working towards releasing an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\nPassage 5:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR iStock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This post has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed, according to the most in-depth study yet to examine the use and misuse of these life-saving drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding, which has implications for antibiotics' diminished efficacy, translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year across the country to children and adults. Most of these are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although health officials have been warning for decades about the overuse of antibiotics and its contribution to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pew Charitable Trust is the first to quantify the depth of the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've all been hearing, 'This is a problem, this is problem,' and we all understood the general concept that there is a lot of antibiotic use,\" said David Hyun, a senior officer with Pew's antibiotic resistance project and one of the authors of the report published Tuesday in JAMA. Pew also published a companion report using the same data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why this study is so important: It actually provides concrete numbers,\" Hyun said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [CDC warns that Americans may be overmedicating young children with ADHD] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study analyzed data for all antibiotic use in the three settings as collected from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011. Antibiotic prescriptions written there represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in this country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Antibiotics are life-saving drugs, and if we continue down the road of inappropriate use we’ll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden. “Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants and save victims of burns and trauma.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [‘Looming catastrophe’: These 7 emergency surgeries account for 80 percent of deaths and costs] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the key findings: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • About 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States -- about 154 million visits annually -- result in an antibiotic prescription. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • More than four in 10 (44 percent) of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors often wind up prescribing antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents, said Katherine Fleming-Dutra, a CDC medical epidemiologist and report's lead author. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clinicians are concerned about patient satisfaction and the patient demand for antibiotics,\" she said. But the majority of individuals do trust their doctors to make the right diagnosis, and better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial in JAMA noted that the numbers provided in the report likely are an undercount because they don't include the times antibiotics are given when patients talk to doctors' offices over the telephone, or when patients seek medical care at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies and dentists' offices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also not included are prescriptions written by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even relatively simple steps, such as displaying a poster in patient waiting rooms can cut down on antibiotic prescribing, the editorial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overuse of antibiotics has led to the frightening rise of drug-resistant superbugs in recent years. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, the White House announced an aggressive plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which already cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year just in the United States. The administration set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 3153, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4f9fb40ba3a4ea202edfe8c7c1c19c80a5afa8f0ffb8d9a2"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seven-year-old Grayson Powell bowled the game of his life to win his team of three a youth bowling tournament in the Newfoundland city of St John’s on Saturday. But shortly after his 171-point game propelled Riverdale to the title, Grayson was disqualified, and was unable to collect his prize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason? He wore the wrong trousers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The rule is you have to wear black pants,” Todd Powell, Grayson’s father, explained to CBC. Grayson was wearing faded black jeans – which were evidently not black enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So as Grayson waited in line to collect his gold medal, Gord Davis, the provincial director at Youth Bowl Canada, informed Grayson’s parents that their son was to be disqualified for his sartorial breach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Powell Sr said he was distinctly unimpressed with Davis’s ruling. “If this is what sport is about when it comes to kids … shame on them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Davis’s organisation insists it did nothing wrong, and said the dress code for Provincial A tournaments had been in place “for decades”. In an impassioned defence on Facebook that ran to 2,600 words and seemed to have been written by Davis, Newfoundland & Labrador YBC rejected accusations of wrongdoing and said simply: rules were rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr Todd Powell knew full aware of the dress code, and sent his child to Provincials knowing that it was against the rules,” the post read. “Why is NL YBC in the wrong here, when parents knowingly broke the rules, and we are the bad guys?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal, there would be no backlash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior Justice Department and FBI officials said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they were shocked by the development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought the FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, here's Jim,\" Trump said in January. \"He's become more famous than me.\"\nPassage 3:\nCalls to appoint an independent prosecutor have simmered for months, but until now, they had been voiced almost entirely by Democrats.

Payroll taxes increase for many employers across USA NORFOLK, Va.  Last year was the worst Don Miller had seen in more than 20 years of running a graphic printing business here. Business slumped 15%, and he had to lay off two of the three workers who helped him print stickers and signs for Navy ships. Miller hopes to bring them back, but hiring will be more expensive for all Virginia business owners this year. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. In 2009, the average business owner paid $95 per employee. This year, the tax will be $171, according to estimates by the state workforce agency. \"It's another added expense to hiring somebody,\" Miller says. \"Everything's going up, and business is going down.\" Similar tax increases are hitting employers nationwide this year as states struggle to pay the 5.5 million Americans currently collecting state jobless benefits. So far, high unemployment and, in many cases, poor planning have prompted 25 states to borrow more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. In other states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling. Nine more states likely will be borrowing by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis of state revenue and benefits. Tax on businesses Business owners in 36 states face tax increases ranging from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. Six states are scaling back or freezing benefits for the unemployed: • Jobless Pennsylvania workers will get 2.3% less in benefits starting this month, while the average tax this year for businesses will increase to $432 from $384 per worker. • Hawaii's employers face an average increase to $1,070 from $90 per worker. The state also proposes decreasing the maximum benefit by as much as a third — about $190 per week. • Texas, where the trust fund is $1.4 billion in the red, has increased the average tax on employers to about $165 from $89 per worker. Instead of fulfilling the unemployment insurance system's purpose of stimulating the economy, these measures may contribute to joblessness, says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" Burtless says. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\" Workers are being hurt in another way — through benefit cuts. In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly unemploymentbenefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. \"I was devastated when I read it,\" Hay says. \"I thought, 'Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?' \" Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off. Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. \"We'll just have to do whatever we can do,\" he says. \"I hope and pray we'll be all right.\" States borrow heavily The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, \"undermines the fundamental goals of the program — boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.\" Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the U.S. Labor Department recommends. Virginia had to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. \"I have angst for people who are unemployed,\" he says. \"But our trust fund is busted — it's gone.\" Pierce reports for ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom based in New York.

Brian Joyce “violated the public’s trust” and “decided to take the path of greed” by using his office for personal profit to accept up to $1 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for official actions, federal investigators said Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, a longtime attorney and Milton Democrat who was arrested Friday, is accused of then hiding that money by creating a shell company and disguising it as “legal fees.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe Mr. Joyce was greedy, plain and simple,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Hank Shaw said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal authorities arrested Joyce, 55, at his Westport home on Friday. Joyce pleaded not guilty to the charges before a federal magistrate in Worcester Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment against Joyce, stemming from a two-year investigation, includes charges of racketeering, extortion, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the IRS and money laundering. His lawyer, Howard Cooper, said in an email to The Associated Press that he is still reviewing the charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR READ: THE FULL INDICTMENT AGAINST BRIAN JOYCE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment alleges that Joyce secretly profited from his position as state senator by accepting “a stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks” that included a free Jeep and hundreds of pounds of Dunkin Donuts coffee, in exchange for official actions before the state Legislature. He is accused of pressuring state and municipal officials to take official action on government matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Joyce, who as a state senator represented more than 100,000 constituents across Milton, Randolph, Avon, Canton, Stoughton, West Bridgewater and parts of Braintree, East Bridgewater and Sharon, ran his public office as a “criminal enterprise.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He had a duty to serve (his constituents) honestly, and he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action,” Weinreb said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In February 2016, the FBI and IRS raided Joyce’s Canton law office. Months later, Joyce reportedly sold his Milton home and also sold his family burial plot in Milton, where he grew up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of participating in a number of complex schemes dating back to 2010 that netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars and concealing the payments by using his law office as a “money laundering conduit.” Prosecutors say he also lied to the state’s ethics commission and used the panel as a “cloak of legitimacy for his corrupt schemes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one case, prosecutors alleged Joyce used his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and formed a shell company to collect secret kickbacks from the firm. In another scheme, prosecutors say Joyce pressured the Milton Planning Board to approve a waiver sought by a developer, who gave Joyce a Jeep from one of the developer’s car dealerships. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also accuses Joyce of taking legislative action to aid a Dunkin Donuts franchise whose owner was paying him tens of thousands of dollars for “purported legal fees” and providing him with hundreds of pounds of free coffee. Investigators allege Joyce took steps to conceal this by submitting backdated checks to the State Ethics Commission and instructed the franchise owner and his relative to falsely represent to the Ethics Commission that they had agreed to provide Joyce coffee in exchange for legal services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also alleges that Joyce attempted to use his Senate position to collect money for “legal work” from representatives of a Philadelphia solar company who sought Joyce’s assistance with local permitting and pending legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also charged with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his purchase of more than $470,000 in common stock from the energy brokerage firm and falsely reporting the stock purchase as a tax-exempt retirement account rollover in his personal tax return. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weinreb would not say whether charges would be brought against any of the companies accused to be involved in the schemes but said the investigation remains ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, who had served as assistant majority leader, announced last year that he would not seek re-election in 2017. He had represented his district since 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 1980 graduate of Milton High School, Joyce received a bachelor’s degree from Boston College School of Management and a law degree from Suffolk University Law School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a state legislator, Joyce served as chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Government Expenditures and the Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Redistricting. He was also a member of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy as well as the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg asked the ethics commission to review Joyce’s conduct after The Boston Globe reported on potential conflicts of interest focusing on whether he used his position to boost his law practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an unrelated case last year, Joyce agreed to pay nearly $5,000 to resolve issues raised by state campaign finance regulators, including using campaign funds for his son’s 2014 high school graduation party. Joyce said there had been no finding of wrongdoing on his part in that case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arrest is the second blow to the state Senate in the past week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg announced Monday he was stepping aside as president of the chamber during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the circumstances surrounding reported sexual misconduct allegations by several men against his husband, Bryon Hefner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harriette Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who is serving as acting Senate president, said in a statement about Joyce that she’s confident the “justice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the allegations against Joyce disturbing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People in public life need to respect the offices they hold and that means not using them for personal gain, and if the feds believe there’s enough there to justify an indictment then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly,” Baker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, after federal authorities raided Joyce’s law office in Canton, Baker poked fun at then-Sen. Joyce at the annual St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast in Boston.

He nodded to his wife and other family members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing before US Magistrate Judge David Hennessy, Joyce pleaded not guilty to all the charges before he was released on $250,000 secured bond. The case was continued until a status hearing on Feb. 23. Joyce must surrender his passport, and his travel is restricted to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You just heard former senator Joyce declare in a very loud and affirmative voice in federal court that he is innocent of all these charges and he expects that’s what will happen in court,” said Joyce’s attorney, Howard Cooper, outside the courtroom as Joyce stood by his side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment describes Joyce as someone who considered his duties as an elected public official secondary to his goal of secretly amassing wealth, a goal he would achieve by using the power of his Senate office to help those who allegedly provided bribes and kickbacks to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Defendant Joyce’s objective in conducting and participating in the affairs of the Senate Office . . . was to secretly profit from his position as State Senator [by] . . . accepting a stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks from private individuals and entities in exchange for his official action as specific opportunities arose,’’ the indictment reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of using his law office, the Joyce Law Group in Canton, “as a money laundering conduit for the corrupt payments” by labeling the bribes and kickbacks as legal referral fees and consulting fees for working on real estate issues, and by using the “corrupt payments” to buy a 2014 Jeep, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David L. Ryan/Globe Staff US Attorney William D. Weinreb addressed the media about the Joyce indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A developer seeking help with Milton town officials is accused of handing over the Jeep to Joyce without demanding he pay the $20,000 due on the purchase price, authorities allege. The developer, John Morrill, who owns two car dealerships, has been a longtime political supporter of Joyce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under one scheme, federal authorities allege, Joyce spent $471,250 to purchase 65,000 shares in a company, Energi, whose business activities he was actively supporting on Beacon Hill. But Joyce never disclosed his financial ties to the company and falsely claimed the money he used to buy the stock came from a tax-free rollover of an IRA account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Defendant Joyce created sham retirement accounts for himself and his spouse in order to conceal his stock ownership from the Ethics Commission and to defraud the IRS,’’ the indictment alleges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also accused of collecting hundreds of pounds of coffee — along with $125,089 in “purported legal fees” — from a Carlos Andrade, a major Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee who sits on the Dunkin’ Donuts foundation board of directors. On one occasion in 2015, he collected 504 pounds of coffee, worth an estimated $4,278, for free, authorities allege. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Globe asked Joyce how he obtained the free coffee in 2015, he had someone else make up a fake invoice and backdate it, the indictment alleges. At the time, his lawyer insisted Joyce had paid full retail price, like anyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Governor Charlie Baker told the Globe that the charges against Joyce should be a warning to anyone in public office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People in public life need to respect the offices they hold, and that means not using them for personal gain,’’ he said Friday. “And, if the feds believe there is enough there to justify an indictment, then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting Senate President Harriette Chandler issued a brief statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Law enforcement has done its job today. This case now moves to the courts, and I am confident that the justice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce had been an early supporter of then Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who appointed him assistant majority leader in 2015 and made him chairman of the committee that decided which bills would come up for a vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, Joyce is facing more than 100 criminal charges, outpacing the corruption counts leveled against other politicians in recent years, including former House speaker Sal DiMasi and former state senator Dianne Wilkerson, who was charged with one count of bribery. DiMasi was sentenced to eight years after he was convicted of helping a software company win multimillion-dollar state contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Wilkerson was sentenced to three and a half years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If convicted on all counts, Joyce could face far more jail time. Some of the counts in the indictment carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Joyce’s attorney Cooper suggested that the charges against his client are the work of overzealous federal prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I should add that, in the last few years, it has been very apparent across the country that the federal government has brought a number of cases against public officials, which have either gone nowhere, or have been rejected by juries, or have been highly criticized by the courts,” Cooper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges against Joyce represent a stunning fall from grace over the past two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, 55, decided not to run for reelection in 2016 — and moved out of Milton, his longtime hometown — after the FBI and IRS raided his Canton law office. The raid followed a series of stories published by the Globe describing some of the ways in which he appeared to use his public position to get private benefits for himself and his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce aroused suspicions by repeatedly receiving discounted and sometimes free goods and services, often from businesses in his legislative district. For instance, when he was angling for a Senate leadership position in late 2014, he gave his Senate colleagues expensive sunglasses that he got at a significant discount from a company in his district, as well as pounds of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. Joyce also received free dry cleaning from a Randolph dry cleaner for more than a decade, services worth thousands of dollars. Neither the sunglasses nor the dry cleaning were mentioned in the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through his attorney, Joyce denied any wrongdoing. He said he bartered the dry cleaning for legal work and paid for coffee and sunglasses the same price as anyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Globe also wrote extensively about Joyce’s relationship with Energi, the Peabody company that is the subject of much of the indictment. The company, which sells insurance to the energy industry, hired Joyce and his law firm to do legal work and to handle regulatory matters before the state Division of Insurance. Between 2010 and 2015, the company paid the Joyce Law Group $377,169 in fees, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, Joyce apparently wanted more legal business and fees in return for his help with a bill promoted by the company. He filed the bill and spoke at a symposium sponsored by Energi promoting the bill — never disclosing his ties to the company. Energi put him on retainer, paying him $5,000 a month for approximately five months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We intend to cooperate fully with the government . . . and we regret that we too were victimized by Mr. Joyce,” said Brian Kelly, a lawyer who represents Energi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also describes Joyce’s relationship with a company that sells solar credits, Power Management, referred to in the indictment as the “energy broker.” The company paid him “secret kickbacks” for his help in landing the company energy consulting work with the towns of Randolph, Easton, East Bridgewater, Southbridge, and Holbrook, the indictment said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He created a shell company, “Windswept LLC,” where he deposited the kickbacks, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Milton, where he lived until this year, he allegedly approached developer John Morrill about buying and redeveloping the Milton Women’s Club, a historic building that had fallen into disrepair, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce pressured the planning board to allow Morrill to take actions that would allow Morrill to build four houses on the site. In return, the indictment says, Morrill agreed to pay Joyce a kickback — a 2014 Jeep from one of his dealerships. Morrill also agreed that Joyce’s wife, Mary, a local realtor, would be a sales broker for the homes built on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce was also accused of using his position to try to extract a $25,000 fee from a Philadelphia-based solar company, Tecta Solar. The company was looking for help with legislation and permitting for a project in West Bridgewater. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Yeah, I can get the permit for you,” Joyce told Tecta officials. “It would be through my law firm, and our fee would be $25,000 . . .’ according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Company officials told the Globe in 2015 that they were stunned by his request and declined to hire him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was suggested we could retain him, but we never pursued it. It was certainly not our intent and it was twisted in a completely different direction,” said Samir Dube, who was then the company’s managing director.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nDetails Published on November 20, 2013 Written by Amanda H. Miller Hits: 1763 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing fixed-mount solar panels west instead of south could produce more electricity during peak demand according to a new study from Pecan Street Research, which debunks the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south when installed on homes in the northern hemisphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research firm, based at the University of Texas's Austin campus, concentrates on testing and developing new technology and business models in advanced energy management systems. The company tested 50 Austin homes with solar panels, some with south-facing installations. Pecan Street used a financial incentive to convince others to install west-facing solar panels for the sake of the study, which is the first of its kind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While advanced modeling and research used by installers suggest homeowners could lose up to 30 percent of their energy production by facing solar panels west instead of south, the Pecan Street study found otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Austin homes with west-facing solar panels produced 2 percent more electricity during the course of a normal day than homeowners with south-facing panels. Beyond that, they produced 49 percent more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm. Homeowners with south-facing solar panels reduced their peak energy usage by 54 percent, while those with west-facing panels cut their power draws by 65 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s no other residential demand response tool generating 60 percent reductions,” Brewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street, told Green Tech Media. “Those are pretty extraordinary peak reductions.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This research has the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market. While homeowners with east-west roof pitches have historically thought they would not be good candidates for solar, it turns out their west-facing roof could be an even better spot for solar than their neighbor’s south-facing roof. It essentially opens the solar market up to every homeowner who doesn’t have significant shading issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also means homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels - even if they do have a south-facing roof -especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's important to note, however, that the Austin study was conducted during the summer months. It’s hard to predict what the overall outcome of the same study would be if winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, were included. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comments:\nPassage 2:\nConventional wisdom says that if you put solar panels on your roof in the Northern Hemisphere, you should point them within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy in the course of a year. But a new study by Pecan Street Research Institute, an Austin, Texas-based research and development organization, suggests that most people may do better at covering their own electrical use and reducing stress on utility grids during summertime peak demand periods if they aim the panels westward instead. (See related quiz: What You Don’t Know About Solar Power.”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the study has not been released publicly, Pecan Street provided a copy to National Geographic News. It analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area, looking not just at the amount of electricity generated by the panels, but at the impact on homeowners’ electricity use and the utility grid during periods of summer peak electrical demand, which generally occur between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. (See related post: “Solar Researchers Dig Deeper Into Snow Issue.”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent. Homes with the conventional true-south orientation, in comparison, achieved a 54 percent reduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pecan Street chief executive and study co-author Brewster McCracken explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because of their lifestyles. West-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which also happens to be the time that most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer, he said. So homeowners with panels facing in that direction are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, McCracken said, using a west orientation for panels means that less electricity will go unused by the homeowners who generated it, and end up as surplus electricity being put back into the grid. That makes things easier for utility companies. “They’re not structured to handle high levels of electricity being sent back to the grid,” he said. “If they have to do that, it becomes a challenge to maintain electric reliability in an area.” (See related story: “New ‘Flexible’ Power Plants Sway to Keep Up With Renewables.”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb, and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south, McCracken said. He’s hoping that the study will prompt them to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pecan Street study isn’t the first to show that west-facing panels may be more effective. A California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were “significantly better” at offsetting peak load that south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Solar Energy Industries Association spokesperson Samantha Page declined comment on the study. A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that the utility continues to recommend a conventional south orientation for solar panels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Mooney, laboratory program manager for solar R&D portfolio at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, said that Pecan Street’s findings weren’t a surprise, but hoped that the more precise quantification would motivate both consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mooney said that the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation would vary, depending upon the region, and that no single prescription necessarily fits all places. “In Colorado, for example, we tend to have clouds rolling in off the mountains in the west in the summer, so west-facing arrays would produce the least electricity,” he said. “You would want to have a southern or eastern orientation here to get the most electricity, and that wouldn’t necessarily align with the utility company’s peak demand.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mooney also noted that the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies figures into how consumers chose to orient their panels. His own utility provider in Colorado, for example, offers incentives that reward optimum output over the year, rather than the amount of electricity generated during periods of peak demand. “I get no benefit from shaving their peak demand, so there’s no motivation to do it,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vote and comment: “What Energy Solution Should We Develop Next?“)\nPassage 3:\nConventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere is to face solar panels south so they get the most light all day. Architects and panel installers implement this approach all the time, especially on homes. But a new study indicates that panels facing west may actually get more juice from the sun, and at more convenient times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers at the Pecan Street Research Institute did a study of homes with solar panels in Austin, Texas and found that when homeowners faced solar panels west they were able to generate 2% more electricity in a day. And they also generated more electricity in the afternoon, when power grids experience peak demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though a 2% increase in electricity generation isn't enormous, it would certainly add up over the life of solar panels. And the rise in afternoon performance, reducing grid dependance during peak hours by 65% as opposed to 54% for south-facing panels, could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's only one study so nothing is definitive yet, but if nothing else the research raises a good point about testing solar panel performance in practice instead of just assuming that angling south is always the way to go.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the attacks by the teardrop rapist continued, Vargas fought for his release from behind bars. He filed appeal after appeal and unsuccessfully petitioned the state Supreme Court to look at his case. In December 2012, aided by the California Innocence Project, he filed a request to examine DNA collected from the jean shorts and underwear of one of the victims he was convicted of attacking, according to court documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tests found genetic material from at least two people, including the victim and the teardrop rapist, Vargas' lawyers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the recent letter to the court, the district attorney's office said the sophisticated technology used to exclude Vargas' DNA did not exist back in the late-1990s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The office said the victims who positively identified him at trial hadn't been as certain of their identifications during earlier lineups. And prosecutors also noted a discrepancy in the victims' descriptions: Two victims said their attacker had two teardrops tattooed near his left eye. Vargas has only one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl who was raped, now a woman, stood by her identification of Vargas when she was recently interviewed by investigators. Prosecutors said they believe she \"honestly but mistakenly identified Vargas at trial as her assailant.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A D.A. spokeswoman said the office did a \"very careful, extensive review, because there was only DNA from one victim,\" before deciding to approve of Vargas' release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the hearing Monday, Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan ordered Vargas' immediate release but noted that he first would be transferred to federal custody. There is an immigration hold on him, Vargas' attorneys said, because their client, who was born in Mexico, was a legal resident at the time of his arrest. They said they were hopeful he would be released soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargas' 26-year-old daughter, Crystal Nuñez-Vargas, said she felt a weight lift from her shoulders inside the courtroom Monday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She got married recently, Nuñez-Vargas said, but only on paper. She's holding off on a big church celebration until after her father's release.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On December 7, 1999, just before being sentenced for three crimes he did not commit, Luis Vargas addressed the Los Angeles Superior Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargas stated, “…I will pray for God’s mercy on all of you…but as far as I’m concerned, as far as I’m concerned [the] individual [who] really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, might really be killing someone out there.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge then handed Luis a sentence of fifty-five years to life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfortunately for Luis and the people of Los Angeles, Luis was right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unbeknownst to the public at the time, a methodical serial rapist known only as the “Tear Drop Rapist” was committing eerily similar crimes. Sadly, it would take almost fifteen years, dozens of sexual assaults, and many advances in DNA science for anyone to see Luis was speaking the truth on December 7, 1999. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luis Vargas’s case originally caught the attention of the California Innocence Project (CIP) staff in 2011. His case was riddled with textbook post-conviction red flags. The most prominent red flag of all: eyewitness misidentification. In fact, the prosecution’s entire case relied on the wavering identifications of three traumatized young ladies. Vargas was convicted solely on the victims’ accounts of the savage attacks. Furthermore, the prosecution was beyond adamant the same person committed all three of the assaults. Perhaps one of the most disturbing legal issues in Vargas’s story is that, despite the prosecution’s weak, one dimensional case, the defense chose not to proffer an eyewitness identification expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargas wrote a letter to CIP and included an article from the L.A. Times, chronicling the sadistic serial rape spree of the Tear Drop Rapist. The Tear Drop Rapist was described as a middle aged, small build, Hispanic male. The Tear Drop Rapist was given his moniker due to the fact that he was often described by his victims as having one or two teardrop tattoos under his eye. This was eerily the same description given by the three victims in the Vargas case. In contrast, Vargas had one faded, barely visible teardrop tattoo that he received as a homeless thirteen-year-old youth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tear Drop Rapist committed over 30 attacks in the last decade, all within a 1.6 mile radius of the three attacks in the Vargas case. As if these facts were not enough, CIP noticed that reading the FBI’s published description of the Tear Drop Rapist’s modus operandi (see here) was like reading a carbon copy of the District Attorney’s 1999 closing argument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2013, CIP decided to test the only remaining physical evidence available in Vargas’s case: the rape kit and clothing from one of the victims. The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office agreed to test the requested items. CIP filed a California Penal Code Section 1405 motion for post- conviction DNA testing. The DNA test results revealed Vargas did not commit the rape, but the Tear Drop Rapist did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tear Drop Rapist is attributed to having committed 35 attacks; not including the three attacks for which Vargas was convicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 23, 2015, Luis Vargas was exonerated of all three sexual assaults. Through cooperation with the district attorney’s office, Judge Ryan of the Los Angeles Superior Court threw out the convictions against Vargas. Vargas is the California Innocence Project’s 3rd DNA exoneration and 20th freed client overall.\n", "answers": ["A California man imprisoned for 16 years for sexual assault was exonerated Monday after DNA tests showed another man committed the crimes, USA Today reports. Luis Vargas, 46, broke down when an LA Superior Court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes. The move came after DNA evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the Teardrop Rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the AP notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Search and rescue documents obtained by The Tribune yesterday indicate debris and a life raft spotted on the eastern side of Cat Island is now “not believed” to be associated with the Sanco investigation. Authorities are working to determine what exactly happened to Forrest and Donna Sanco while en route to Rum Cay on September 26, one day after the pair flew their private aircraft from Houston, Texas; through Florida and then Freeport, Grand Bahama where the couple reportedly cleared customs and spent the night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bahamas Air and Sea Rescue Association (BASRA) Operations Manager Chris Lloyd on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Sanco officially closed his flight plan at 4:58pm on September 26, signalling to air traffic controllers that he was nearing his destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, according to his family members and caretakers in Rum Cay, the pair never arrived. The Sanco couple were renting a holiday home from Pat and Earl Lambert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No reports were made about the missing couple until Friday, October 6 – roughly 10 days after the couple was originally scheduled to turn up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tribune understands it was at this time reports of the missing couple were disseminated to the United States Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United States Coast Guard has stressed the RBDF is leading all efforts on the matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forrest Sanco’s niece, 23-year-old LeeAnn Burger initially tried to raise $10,000 through a Go Fund Me campaign to hire private crews and pilots to find the couple.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nView Images NASA's Curiosity rover has delivered some cool findings from its trips across the red planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars for almost a year and a half now, just delivered its largest and most important downlink so far of findings, discoveries, and conclusions. (Also see video: \"Mission to Mars.\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the six papers released by the journal Science report on different aspects of Mars and do it from different scientific perspectives, together they present the beginnings of a new understanding of the red planet, especially in its early epochs, three to four billion years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Mars, it has become increasingly apparent, was in many important ways similar to Earth. (See also \"Did Life on Earth Come From Mars?\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you put together all that we're learning about Gale Crater and Mars, you really begin to chip away the rock and the sculpture inside emerges,\" said Pan Conrad, an astrobiologist with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and a co-author on several of the papers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As described in the six Science papers, that hidden but slowly materializing landscape looks something like this: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After concluding that rivers and streams once flowed into Gale Crater, the Curiosity team has now reported that a lake existed there as well. That surface water, as well as groundwater that likely went down hundreds of meters, possessed all that was needed to support microbial life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The period when Gale Crater was warmer, wetter, and habitable was broadly between 3.5 and 4 billion or more years ago. That period is when life on Earth is understood to have arisen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was Mars once home to primitive extraterrestrial life? Curiosity can't and won't make that determination, but its discoveries have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Water once flowed on many parts of Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that water was there at times and in forms that scientists didn't believe to be possible not long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the major achievements of Curiosity so far has been to \"ground-truth\" observations made in recent years by the satellites orbiting the planet. Those instruments found strong hints that Mars had a watery past, and at Gale Crater they were found to be on target. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, the mission has given greater credibility to the view that thousands of additional fossil formations of what appear to be ancient streams, channels, deltas, and lakes likely are just what they appeared to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. \"Follow the carbon\" has been vindicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds—one of the major goals of the Curiosity mission—has been and will continue to be complicated and trying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far by the miniature chemistry lab called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), their origin remain unclear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's no doubt that SAM has identified organics, but we can't say with confidence yet that they are Martian in origin,\" said Douglas Ming of NASA's Johnson Space Center, and author of one of the six Curiosity papers in Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are at least two sources of the confounding results: The presence on Mars of a chlorine-based compound that, when heated in the SAM oven with any organic material, largely destroys the compounds. And the leak into the SAM ovens of an organic solvent brought to Mars as part of a wet chemistry experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian organics is nonetheless making progress. With each collection of Martian sand or rock, the number of organics found and their concentration has increased—suggesting that different samples of Martian material are leading to different results. If the organics were all contaminants from Earth, those concentrations would likely be more steady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"SAM is probably the most complex and important instrument ever brought to another planet,\" Ming said. \"Inevitably, it has taken time to figure out how best to work with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mars gets pounded by radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions bombard Mars, and their high-energy particles break the bonds that allow organisms to survive. The Radiation Assessment Detector on Curiosity has made the first measurements ever of radiation on the surface of Mars, and the results are sobering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another Science paper, RAD principal investigator Donald Hassler reports that the radiation would almost certainly be fatal within a few million years to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The RAD team used as their model the terrestrial bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, which is capable of withstanding enormous doses of radiation, to make that assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notwithstanding the high levels of radiation, Hassler reported that life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances. If a bacteria similar to D. radiodurans appeared when early Mars was wetter, warmer, and had a more protective atmosphere, he wrote, it could have survived over the epochs through long periods of dormancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mars radiation also damages normal chemistry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many on the Curiosity team point to radiation damage of all carbon chemistry on Mars as a major reason why it has been so difficult to identify organics on the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That effort, however, may have gotten a significant boost from one of the most unexpected developments to come out of the mission so far―a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using measurements of radioactive decay also employed on Earth, Kenneth Farley of the California Institute of Technology reports that the surface of Yellowknife Bay has been exposed for some 80 million years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery points to a method for finding places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Essentially, Farley said, the team has to look for cliffs or overhangs being undercut by the surface wind―as happened in Yellowknife Bay―and where radiation would be blocked by the rocks above. \"If we find that kind of formation,\" he said, \"drill there.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. Detours sometimes turn out to be interesting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Curiosity rover was scheduled to head for the scientifically alluring Mount Sharp in the center of Gale Crater soon after landing. More than 480 days into the mission, the rover is still months away from its prime destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The detour to Yellowknife Bay is the main reason why, and it has turned out to be a gold mine of data. But now the rover is on what is called the \"rapid transit route\" to three-mile-high Mount Sharp, driving most of the time and passing many potentially interesting sites.\nPassage 2:\nMastcam mosaic of the Yellowknife Bay formation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches — perhaps millions of years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This long and skinny freshwater lake likely existed about 3.7 billion years ago, researchers said, suggesting that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Quite honestly, it just looks very Earth-like,\" said Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. [Ancient Mars Could Have Supported Life (Photos)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You've got an alluvial fan, which is being fed by streams that originate in mountains, that accumulates a body of water,\" Grotzinger told SPACE.com. \"That probably was not unlike what happened during the last glacial maximum in the Western U.S.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake once covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, which the 1-ton Curiosity rover has been exploring since touching down on the Red Planet in August 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - The Red Planet is teeming with tiny microbes, we just haven't found them yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - An advanced civilization lives below the surface, where we can't detect them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Life never existed on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Mars once had life, but those organisms are long dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main task of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team achieved that goal months ago, announcing in March that a spot near Curiosity's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results, which are reported today (Dec. 9) in six separate papers in the journal Science, confirm and extend Curiosity's landmark discovery, painting a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture emerged from Curiosity's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The rover obtained powdered samples of these rocks by drilling into Yellowknife Bay outcrops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of an ancient freshwater lake, researchers said. Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. Here on Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy,\" Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College London, co-author of one of the new papers, said in a statement.

How much do you know about Curiosity and its mission? 0 of questions complete NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shallow ancient lake may have been about 30 miles long by 3 miles wide (50 by 5 kilometers), Grotzinger said. Based on the thickness of the sedimentary deposits, the research team estimates that the lake existed for at least tens of thousands of years — and perhaps much longer, albeit on a possibly on-and-off basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking into account the broader geological context, \"you could wind up with an assemblage of rocks that represent streams, lakes and ancient groundwater systems — so for times when the lake might have been dry, the groundwater's still there. This could have gone on for millions or tens of millions of years,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, he added, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis. But such conditions wouldn't be much of a deterrent to hardy microbes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These are entirely viable habitable environments for chemolithoautotrophs,\" Grotzinger said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some believed Christine Elliott may have been a stronger, safer candidate who appealed to other voters and demographics not enamoured of Ford.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wynne’s party, in power since her predecessor Dalton McGuinty defeated the Tories in 2003, was reduced to a tiny rump, falling short of the eight seats required for official status in the legislature. Ontario’s first female premier, who succeeded McGuinty in February 2013, took the unusual step of conceding defeat last Saturday in a desperate attempt to salvage Liberal seats. “This is a difficult night,” said Wynne, 65, who is stepping down as Liberal leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ontario PC leader Doug Ford reacts after winning the Ontario Provincial election to become the new premier in Toronto, on Thursday, June 7, 2018 ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is another generation and I am passing the torch to that generation,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there are few to grasp it — numerous members of Wynne’s cabinet were defeated, including Finance Minister Charles Sousa.

In some ways, Ford is an accidental premier. Until Brown’s departure, he planned on a rematch this October against Toronto Mayor John Tory, who beat him municipally in 2014. But the most eventful provincial campaign in decades was upended Jan. 24 when CTV News aired a report alleging sexual impropriety against Brown involving two women. While he denied the allegations — and is now suing CTV, which stands by its story, for $8 million — he was forced to resign early on Jan. 25. That triggered an expedited Tory leadership race that Christine Elliott, who had finished second to Brown in 2015 and third in the 2009 contest, was expected to win. Even though Elliott received the most votes and won more ridings at the party’s chaotic March 10 convention, Ford narrowly edged her in the party’s convoluted “points” tally. It was a stunning rebuke of the party elites by an outsider that Brown’s Tories had not even wanted as a local candidate.

His staunch supporters praise him as a political outsider sure to shake things up at Queen's Park. (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They felt his reputation at Toronto city hall, where he was a key figure in the tumultuous mayoralty of his controversial late brother, Rob Ford, would undermine the modern, inclusive party they were building. At the PC policy convention last November, the one-term Toronto councillor was a solitary figure hovering alone at the back of the hall during the then leader’s speech. But since taking the reins, he has brought Elliott into the fold along with another former leadership rival, Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Both women will sit at Ford’s cabinet table. Also expected to be ministers are the newly elected Rod Phillips and Peter Bethlenfalvy and MPPs Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, Steve Clark, and John Yakabuski. Having what was seen as a deep potential ministerial bench was critical to Ford’s success. After Horwath narrowed the gap in public opinion polls following his shaky performance in the three leaders’ debates last month, he scrambled to showcase his team, which he maintained was “ready to govern” in contrast to the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many New Democratic candidates, he insisted, were “radical downtown Toronto elites,” who should not be given the keys to Queen’s Park. However, voters may have handed Ford a blank cheque. He has promised to cut spending by $6 billion and vowed to do it painlessly without slashing even one public-sector job. “Not one,” he repeatedly said without specifying where he would find such massive “efficiencies.” His platform, never fully costed despite promises it would be, consisted of a series of populist planks like a 10 cents a litre reduction in gasoline taxes, lowering the floor price of beer to $1, selling beer and wine in convenience stores, and reducing personal and corporate taxes. On the campaign trail, his handlers limited media exposure and the freewheeling Ford from Toronto city hall was recast as a carefully scripted politician behind a teleprompter. Still, he weathered a bevy of problems, including revelations he attended a political fundraiser in April even though that’s against the new campaign finance law, that he appeared to have flouted PC rules to sell memberships for candidate Kinga Surma, and that one of his former candidates was linked to the alleged data breach at the 407 ETR that compromised the personal information of 60,000 motorists. As well, Rob Ford’s widow filed a $16.5 million lawsuit Friday alleging Doug Ford and older brother, Randy Ford, had cheated her and her children out of her late husband’s inheritance. Doug Ford denied Renata Ford’s allegations, which have not been proven in court. Yet none of these potential landmines hurt the first victorious Tory campaign since Mike Harris was re-elected in 1999. For Wynne, defeat appeared to have been preordained with Liberal insiders pointing to 2015 as the year when the wheels began to fall off. That was the year of the Sudbury byelection debacle that saw Wynne’s deputy chief of staff charged with bribery and then exonerated in 2017. It was also when the premier decided to sell the majority share in Hydro One, the provincial transmission utility, using the proceeds to bankroll transportation infrastructure. Both Ford and Horwath successfully conflated the partial privatization with rising electricity bills even though that is a separate issue. Ford has even promised to fire Mayo Schmidt, the highly paid Hydro One CEO he derided as “the six million dollar man.” And in 2015, Wynne injected herself into the federal election campaign, helping Justin Trudeau defeat Stephen Harper to become prime minister, but appearing in the public’s eyes as just another partisan politician. “Our (poll) numbers started to decline then and we never recovered,” confided one senior Liberal, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal strategy. While Wynne returned to her social-justice roots, raising the minimum wage to $14 an hour from $11.60 — and promised to make it $15 next year, a raise Ford has said he will cancel — as well as introducing free prescription drug coverage for everyone under 25, it was not enough to save the Liberals.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCredit: (left) UZH; (right) 120/Creative Commons NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Europe's best-known mummy wasn't just a medical mess; he also had terrible teeth, according to a new study. Ötzi (inset photo), a Stone Age man who died atop a glacier about 5300 years ago, suffered from severe gum disease and cavities. His teeth, back and front, were also heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and use as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting. When Ötzi was discovered atop a glacier on the Austro-Italian border, his frozen corpse was intensively studied. But no one took a close look at his teeth until now. Using 3D computer tomography (a CAT scan), the hunter's mouth could be examined for clues as to the life he led. The results, published this week in the European Journal of Oral Sciences, suggest that Ötzi didn't have it easy. A fall or other accident killed one of his front teeth, still discolored millennia later. And he may have had a small stone, gone unnoticed in his whole-grain bread or gruel, to thank for a broken molar. That gruel may be the culprit behind Ötzi's cavities and gum disease, too. (An arrow on the right in CAT scan above marks places where the bone is eaten away by infection, the left arrow points at deep cavities.) In the late Stone Age, humans were increasingly incorporating coarsely ground grain into their diets. The uptick in starches, the researchers suggest, could explain the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time—a problem that's been with us ever since. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See more ScienceShots.\nPassage 2:\nFew of our ancestors have been so thoroughly poked and prodded as Neolithic Tyrolean Iceman \"Ötzi,\" discovered melting out of an Alpine glacier in 1991. Researchers have probed his stomach and bowels for traces of his last meal and analyzed his teeth for cavities. Now, an international team has sequenced his entire genome, and it turns out Ötzi still has some surprises in store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier computer scans had revealed Ötzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. But the new analysis shows that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to the condition, despite the fact that as a hunter-gatherer he had none of what are currently believed to be the relevant risk factors, such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. \"This new data suggests that we might be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we believed,\" notes cardiologist and mummy expert Gregory Thomas of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the new work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about Ötzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed Ötzi's mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his Y chromosome places him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era, roughly 1000 years before Ötzi himself lived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ötzi's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia, says geneticist Angela Graefen of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy, one of the principal researchers on the paper. That doesn't mean that Ötzi was Sardinian or Corsican, Graefen notes, but that those populations may be the closest living genetic matches to the hunter-gatherers who originally migrated into Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The genome analysis, published this week in Nature Communications, also helps flesh out our picture of Ötzi the man: Researchers now know he had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease: the sequencing yielded genes from the disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Although scientists can't know whether Lyme disease actually made Ötzi sick during his lifetime, the discovery of 60% of a B. burgdorferi genome from a Neolithic carrier shows that this pathogen has plagued humans for thousands of years. Until researchers compare the B. burgdorferi genome from Ötzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen, they won't have a clear picture of how Lyme disease evolves. \"But depending on the research other scientists are doing over the next few years, we could be gaining a lot more insights from Ötzi's genome,\" Graefen says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new paper adds to our knowledge of Neolithic life, says mummy expert Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. \"Of course Ötzi is only one individual, but he's a very well-preserved, well-described individual, whom we have a lot of additional information about already.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This report is an affirmation of what we know—that the Greater Mekong offers unparalleled diversity in nature—and what must be done,” said Rebecca Ng of WWF’s Greater Mekong Program. “The rich natural treasures of the region could be lost if regional governments don’t recognize that protecting biodiversity is an investment to ensure long-term sustainability, especially in the face of global environmental change.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The six leaders from the Greater Mekong Sub-region are meeting in Myanmar from December 19-20. WWF is calling upon them to put the benefits of biodiversity, and the costs of losing it, at the center of decision-making and regional cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 2:\nConservationists have discovered a big batch of new — and interesting-sounding — creatures in Southeast Asia, including a psychedelic gecko and a monkey with something resembling Elvis’ hairstyle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Huffington Post reports that the WWF made the finds, 208 creatures in total, in a biodiverse region straddling the Mekong River threatened by habitat loss, deforestation, climate change and overdevelopment. China, Burma (also known as Myanmar), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam all share — uneasily at times — the Mekong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (MORE: Saving the World’s Endangered Species) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the picks of the new discoveries: a nose-less monkey swinging from the trees of a remote province of northeast Burma. “While this species, sporting an Elvis-like hairstyle, is new to science, the local people of Myanmar know it well,” the Switzerland-based group said in its report released Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The remote Mekong region, part of the Golden Triangle infamous for drug trafficking, plays host to some of earth’s most endangered species, such as tigers, Asian elephants, Mekong dolphins and Mekong giant catfish, according to the WWF. The organization announced in October that the Javan rhinoceros became extinct in Vietnam and the 40 to 60 that remain can only be found now in Indonesia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a region of extraordinary richness in terms of biodiversity but also one that is extremely fragile,” said Sarah Bladen, communications director for WWF Greater Mekong. “It’s losing biodiversity at a tragic rate.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: 10 Species Near Extinction\n", "answers": ["It's a region that produces a new species every other day: Carnivorous plants that can eat mice, birds, and lizards.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMorley Safer CBS News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer, the CBS newsman who changed war reporting forever when he showed U.S. Marines burning the huts of Vietnamese villagers and went on to become the iconic 60 Minutes correspondent whose stylish stories on America's most-watched news program made him one of television's most enduring stars, died today in Manhattan. He was 84. He had homes in Manhattan and Chester, Conn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was in declining health when he announced his retirement last week; CBS News broadcast a long-planned special hour to honor the occasion on Sunday May 15 that he watched in his home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge presence on 60 Minutes for 46 years -- Safer enjoyed the longest run anyone ever had on primetime network television. Though he cut back a decade ago, he still appeared regularly until recently, captivating audiences with his signature stories on art, science and culture. A dashing figure in his checked shirt, polka dot tie and pocket square, Morley Safer -- even his name had panache -- was in his true element playing pool with Jackie Gleason, delivering one of his elegant essays aboard the Orient Express or riffing on Anna Wintour, but he also asked the tough questions and did the big stories. In 2011, over 18.5 million people watched him ask Ruth Madoff how she could not have known her husband Bernard was running a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The interview was headline news and water cooler talk for days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some of his later 60 Minutes pieces, Safer profiled the cartoonists of The New Yorker, interviewed the founder and staff of Wikipedia and reported on a billion-dollar art trove discovered in a Munich apartment. In his last story broadcast on March 13, he profiled the visionary architect Bjarke Ingels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley was one of the most important journalists in any medium, ever,\" said CBS Chairman and CEO, Leslie Moonves. \"He broke ground in war reporting and made a name that will forever be synonymous with 60 Minutes. He was also a gentleman, a scholar, a great raconteur - all of those things and much more to generations of colleagues, his legion of friends, and his family, to whom all of us at CBS offer our sincerest condolences over the loss of one of CBS' and journalism's greatest treasures.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways. He was a master storyteller, a gentleman and a wonderful friend. We will miss him very much,\" said Jeff Fager, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and Safer's close friend and one-time 60 Minutes producer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President David Rhodes said, \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture. His writing alone defined original reporting. Everyone at CBS News will sorely miss Morley.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was a familiar reporter to millions when he replaced Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes in 1970. A much-honored foreign correspondent, Safer was the first U.S. network newsman to film a report inside Communist China. He appeared regularly on the CBS Evening News from all over the world, especially Vietnam, where his controversial reporting earned him peer praise and government condemnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's piece from the Vietnamese hamlet of Cam Ne in August of 1965 showing U.S. Marines burning the villagers' thatched huts was cited by New York University as one of the 20th century's best pieces of American journalism. Some believe this report freed other journalists to stop censoring themselves and tell the raw truth about war. The controversial report on the \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" earned Safer a George Polk award and angered President Lyndon Johnson so much, he reportedly called CBS President Frank Stanton and said, \"Your boys shat on the American flag yesterday.\" Some Marines are said to have threatened Safer, but others thanked him for exposing a cruel tactic. Safer said that the pentagon treated him with contempt for the rest of his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spent three tours (1964-'66) as head of the CBS Saigon bureau. His helicopter was shot down in a 1965 battle, after which Safer continued to report under fire. In 1990, he penned a memoir of his Vietnam experience, \"Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam\" (Random House), in which he goes back to reminisce and to interview the enemy's veterans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he joined Mike Wallace at the beginning of 60 Minutes' third season, they toiled to put stories on the air for a program that dodged cancellation each season. But their work was immediately recognized with an Emmy for Safer's 1971 investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America's war in Vietnam. The two pressed on for five years, moving the broadcast from the bottom fourth to the middle of the rankings. Then in August 1975, with a new Sunday evening timeslot, Safer put 60 Minutes on the national stage. Interviewing Betty Ford, the first lady shocked many Americans by saying she would think it normal if her 18-year-old daughter were having sex. The historic sit-down also included frank talk about pot and abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 1978, the broadcast was in Nielsen's Top 10. Safer's eloquent, sometimes quirky features balanced out the program's \"gotcha\" interviews and investigations, perfecting the news magazine's recipe. It became the number-one program for the 1979-'80 season - a crown it won five times. 60 Minutes remained in the top 10 for an unprecedented 23 straight seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was another Safer story that would become one of the program's most honored and important. \"Lenell Geter's in Jail,\" about a young black man serving life for armed robbery in Texas, overturned Geter's conviction 10 days after the December 1983 segment exposed a sloppy rush to injustice. Safer and 60 Minutes were honored with the industry's highest accolades: the Peabody, Emmy and duPont-Columbia University awards. 60 Minutes founder Don Hewitt often pointed to the story as the program's finest work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer's Pick: Lenell Geter's in Jail NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer hit more journalistic home runs, but sought out the odd stories that piqued his curiosity. The offbeat tales were more suited to his raconteur style and cultural sensibility. He found esoteric subjects all over the world and here in the U.S., ranging from a tiny Pacific island nation economically dependent on guano to the strange choice of tango dancing as a national hobby for the shy people of Finland to the strange yet harmonious stew of cowboys and artists in the Texas town of Marfa -- all narrated in his drolly delivered and precise prose. His conversational wit with his subjects was just as sharp as his written word. In a profile of the prim Martha Stewart, a smirking Safer passed her livestock pen and said to the domestic diva, \"Your barnyard? It's remarkably odor-free.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of these features had national impact, however, like his November 1991 report, \"The French Paradox,\" which connected red wine consumption to lower incidents of heart disease among the free-eating French. Wine merchants say this report was single-handedly responsible for starting the red wine boom in America. His 1993 segment \"Yes, But is it Art?\" enraged the modern art community when it criticized expensive, contemporary installations featuring household items like toilets and vacuums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City may have held a grudge; years later, it refused to allow Safer onto its premises to review a Jackson Pollock retrospective for CBS Sunday Morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's life was a work of art into which 60 Minutes fit seamlessly. He vacationed in Europe, often combining field trips for his stories. He made a regular pilgrimage to The American Academy in Rome to hone his painting skills, a hobby he began from an early age. He mounted a small exhibition of his paintings in 1985. He also had a special affinity for cars and did 60 Minutes segments on England's Rolls Royce and Italy's legendary Lamborghini. He owned a silver 1985 Ferrari convertible, which he had raced occasionally and also owned a Bentley when he lived in London, bought with his winnings from a card game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other highlights from Safer's 60 Minutes work include a poignant segment in 1978 called \"The Music of Auschwitz,\" about an inmate who played in an orchestra to avoid the Nazi gas chambers; his 1979 profile of Katharine Hepburn; \"The Beeb,\" a 1985 Emmy-winning take on BBC Radio; \"The Enemy,\" the 1989 story for which Safer returned to Vietnam; and in 1979, \"Marva,\" about Chicago teacher Marva Collins, whose alternative school for disadvantaged kids proved such students could excel. Safer's follow-up on \"Marva\" in 1996, in which he debunked a subsequent book that claimed Collins' students would not succeed in the long run, earned him his fourth duPont-Columbia University award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the four duPonts, Safer won every major award, including the Paul White Award from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1966 when he was only 35 -- an award usually given for lifetime achievement. The other awards given to Safer over his long career include three Peabody awards, three Overseas Press Club awards, two George Polk Memorial awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism first prize for domestic television, the Fred Friendly First Amendment award, 12 Emmys and a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News hired the Canadian-born Safer in 1964 in London, where he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He got the job in an odd turn of events. One of Safer's CBC colleagues seeking a job with CBS sent a demo tape of a roundtable he anchored that included Safer. CBS news executives liked Safer better and gave him a job in the London Bureau. The young correspondent took over his new job behind the desk once occupied by another CBS legend, the late Edward R. Murrow. After a year, he was asked to open the Saigon Bureau to report on the simmering conflict in Vietnam. He was then named bureau chief in London in 1967 and reported on a variety of foreign stories beyond Britain, many of them risky assignments, including the Nigerian-Biafran War, the Middle East conflict and the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During this period he also filmed the historic CBS News Special Report \"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\" (August 1967), the first broadcast by a U.S. network news team from inside Communist China. Safer's Canadian citizenship helped get him into the country posing as a tourist interested in archeology. He and his cameraman, John Peters, were able to film the everyday lives of Chinese with a home movie camera. In a close call, suspicious authorities took Safer and Peters to meet an archeologist, who tested his knowledge. Safer knew enough about China's archeological periods to avoid arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's reporting and writing also appeared on the CBS News documentary series, \"CBS Reports.\" He had a regular feature on CBS Radio, \"Morley Safer's Journal,\" that ran in 1970s. In May 1994, he hosted \"One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer,\" a CBS News special marking Kuralt's retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was born Nov. 8, 1931 in Toronto and eventually became an American citizen, holding a dual citizenship. Telling MacLeans he felt \"stateless,\" he believed this status was an advantage. \"I bring a different perspective and I have no vested interests,\" he told the magazine in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growing up, he was influenced by the writing of Ernest Hemingway and decided he would be a foreign correspondent. He attended the University of Western Ontario for only a few weeks when he dropped out to begin writing for newspapers. He first wrote for the rural Woodstock Sentinel-Review before landing a job with the much larger London (Ontario) Free-Press. He then went on to England with the help of the Commonwealth Press Union, which promised to place him in a job there. After a short stint on the Oxford Mail and Times, Reuters hired Safer in London in 1955. When he returned late that year, he found work as an editor and reporter in the Toronto headquarters of the CBC. He was chosen to produce \"CBC News Magazine\" in 1956, on which he also occasionally appeared . His first on-camera work was on assignment for the CBC covering the Suez Crisis in November 1956. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CBC sent him back to London in 1961, from which he covered major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the war for Algerian Independence, until he joined CBS. He was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin the night the Communists began building the Berlin Wall in August 1961. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was asked to characterize his legacy as a journalist in a November 2000 interview with the American Archive of Television. \"I have a pretty solid body of work that emphasized the words, emphasized ideas and the craft of writing for this medium. It's not literary, I wouldn't presume to suggest that. But I think you can elevate it a little bit sometimes with the most important part of the medium, which is what people are saying -- whether they're the people being interviewed or the guy who's telling the story. It's not literature, but it can be very classy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jane, one daughter, Sarah Bakal, her husband, Alexander Bakal, three grandchildren, a sister, and brother, both of Toronto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.\nPassage 2:\nMorley Safer, 60 Minutes' longest-serving correspondent, died this week at age 84. Last week, the broadcast aired a tribute in honor of his retirement after 46 years on the broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To celebrate Safer's remarkable tenure, executive producer Jeff Fager called on an in-house dream team -- editor Warren Lustig and producers David Browning, Katy Textor and Michelle St. John -- to create the tribute that aired Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But how do you condense five decades -- that included more than 900 stories -- into a one-hour broadcast? That was the enormous challenge they faced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the simplest terms, we set out to capture Morley,\" says Browning, Safer's longtime producer, in the 60 Minutes Overtime video above. \"You want to make sure that what you're showing is representative of his work and the great variety of work that he's done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That work included a groundbreaking 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, where Safer showed U.S. Marines torching villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man in Texas wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated as a result of Safer's report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were countless stories, on every imaginable topic, each tale uniquely his own. \"They were works of art almost,\" Fager explains. \"What makes a story a Morley story is his original voice. And by that I mean not just the timbre, but [also] the quality of the storytelling, his writing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fager recalls working as Safer's producer and bringing him the first draft of a script. Safer would look at it, stare out the window for a few seconds, and then quickly scroll a piece of paper into his trusty typewriter and rework it to his own satisfaction. Textor showed Overtime one of her scripts with a yellow piece of paper taped on where Safer had added his own better-written line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He simply had this ability to take it to the next level,\" Browning explains. \"There's an old saying of Mark Twain's that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. And that's what Morley did. He was lightning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Safer claims his stories were aimed more at the ear than the eye, Fager says the correspondent's genius was his ability to link the two. \"You see lines. You hear lines. You experience while you're watching a connection with his writing to the picture,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer didn't take himself too seriously, his colleagues say, and liked to entertain his viewers. \"Morley's advice was always: if you can get them to laugh, you're home free,\" recalls Textor. \"He knew that if he could get a chuckle, you were pretty good. You were going to be okay.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had an eye for the absurd. An amateur artist in his spare time, Safer got a kick out of ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world, even if it meant gently mocking collectors as they showed him around. \"Morley has always had a great sense of smoking out phonies and smoking out phony stories and things that just aren't right,\" Browing says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Safer's most memorable pieces were offbeat - or downright bizarre: A story on the popularity of tango in Finland, for instance, or a tale of crime and punishment on Furudu, a tiny island in the Maldives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley discovered [that] a story could be essentially what you made it to be,\" says Browning. \"If you found an interesting place to go and an interesting cast of characters, it really didn't matter if there was a huge headline there. As we say in the broadcast, the journey was really the story.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a journey Safer enjoyed immensely. \"I've led a charmed life,\" he said in an interview. \"I mean, in every respect, I've led a charmed life as a reporter, as an individual. A lot of it is, as I said, blood, sweat, toil, and tears, but a lot of it is pure, unadulterated luck, and I've been a very lucky guy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos courtesy of CBS News, CBS Photo Archive and Morley Safer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando and Will Croxton.\n", "answers": ["Just days after retiring from 60 Minutes, Morley Safer is dead at age 84, reports CBS News.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What did trouble him, she said, was his growing status as a narco-legend and his inability to control his own story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guzman had long wanted to collaborate on a film about his life, in part to counter what he viewed as untruths and sensationalism. \"To put exactly how things are and everything that has happened until now, told by him,\" she explains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, known for her role as a female drug kingpin in a popular telenovela, was exploring such a film project after Guzman, an admirer, reached out to her. It was Del Castillo who teamed up with Sean Penn, the Hollywood actor and director, on a clandestine visit to Guzman last year while the drug trafficker was still on the run. Penn wrote a colorful story for Rolling Stone about the encounter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What drew Coronel's wrath — and that of her husband, she believes — is a video posted with the article in which Guzman, sitting in front of a fence in a country setting, acknowledges he has worked in the drug trade since he was 15 — drawn to it because of the poverty in the rural mountains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coronel said that publishing the video, whose rights were granted not by Penn but by Del Castillo's company, was a \"betrayal.\" Her husband, she said, believed that the footage would be used only as background information for a text article.

What she's saying doesn't make any sense.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then there was the affectionate exchange of messages between her husband and Del Castillo, leaked to the Mexican publication Milenio after his latest arrest. \"You are so beautiful, my friend, in every way,\" Guzman told the actress in one of them. \"I will take care of you more than I do my own eyes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coronel said she did not find the exchanges troubling. \"I think it was the first time they met.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCell phones in Broadway theaters: What are people thinking? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now we know, sort of, thanks to a publicity-stunt press conference during which one cell phone offender — the guy who tried to charge his phone by plugging it in to an onstage outlet at play “Hand to God” — spoke out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I downed a few drinks, and I think that clearly impaired my judgment,” said Nick Silvestri, a 19-year-old from Long Island. “I guess I wasn’t really thinking.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Producers of “Hand to God” held the press conference July 10 to capitalize on the flurry of attention recently given to what has been a source of long-simmering tension among theatergoers. For years, stage folks have decried the regular mid-show disruptions wrought by the advent of the mobile phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue has reached something of a tipping point recently, with Patti LuPone making headlines earlier this week for snatching away the phone of a texting audience member at the Off Broadway show in which she stars, “Shows for Days” — and doing it without ever breaking character. (The phone was returned to its owner after the show.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just a few days before that, Silvestri earned the ire of the theater community when, minutes before a performance of “Hand to God,” he leapt onto the stage and plugged his phone into what turned out to be a fake electrical outlet. Cast members chronicled it on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A guy jumped on the stage and plugged his phone into the fake outlet on our set just before we started. @HandtoGodBway #fullmoon or #idiot ? — Sarah Stiles (@Lulubellestiles) July 3, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this spring, Madonna attracted disapproval for reportedly texting during hot-ticket musical “Hamilton.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dust-ups highlight the complaints that arise with increasing frequency as texting, ringtones and phone calls intrude on what’s long been the traditional theater etiquette of a dark, quiet auditorium. It’s a regular occurrence at Broadway shows these days, thanks to the omnipresence of mobile devices, not to mention the increasing presence of tourists and young audiences — some of whom have never been to a Broadway show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t go to plays very much, and I didn’t realize that the stage is considered off limits,” Silvestri said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s something of a generational divide, too, between the traditionally older-skewing theatergoing demographic and the younger audiences who have grown up in the digital, mobile era — for whom mobile device usage is akin to a basic civil right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press conference with Silvestri, held in front of the Booth Theater, took advantage of the cell-phone incident (which was not a stunt, Silvestri assured people) to lend a little publicity to “Hand to God,” the Broadway comedy that earned strong reviews (and five Tony nominations) but has largely struggled to gain momentum at the box office. The event also gave Silvestri the chance to apologize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve learned a lot about the theater in the past few days — theater people are really passionate and have been very willing to educate me,” he said. “I would like to sincerely apologize to the Broadway community.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might not be enough for LuPone, who’s famously tough on folks who use cell phones during her shows. During the 2008 run of “Gypsy,” she stopped the show when someone was taking pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We work hard on stage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones,” LuPone said after the July 8 incident at “Shows for Days.” “I am so defeated by this issue that I seriously question whether I want to work on stage anymore. Now I’m putting battle gear on over my costume to marshal the audience as well as perform.”\nPassage 2:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IN PERSON (Jen Chung/Gothamist) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Long Island lacrosse-playing college student who burst into Broadway history as the first, social media-documented idiot to barge onto a stage to charge his precious cellphone faced the press today. Nick Silvestri, 19, read a statement before a group of reporters admitting, \"I don’t go to plays very much, and I didn’t realize that the stage is considered off limits. I’ve learned a lot about the theater in the past few days—theater people are really passionate and have been very willing to educate me. I can assure you that I won’t be setting foot on a stage ever again, unless I decide to become an actor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Publicists for Hand to God, the \"hilarious and disturbing\" play that transferred from off-Broadway and earned numerous Tony nominations, had initially said the press conference would start at 2 p.m., but Silvestri, who attends Nassau Community College, didn't surface until 2:30. He then gamely read a statement (see text below) but he stumbled over the word \"theatergoer\" and was immediately bombarded with questions from the skeptical press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For instance, were he and Hand to God producers in cahoots to draw attention for the play? Especially considering that it's struggling at the box office? Silvestri seemed confused, and insisted that he wasn't part of a viral marketing stunt, telling reporters, \"Take it as it is. It's fun. It's a joke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even though he said in his statement that he had been drinking, reporters pointed out that he's underage. He then became vague about the drinking, denying drinking in NYC, and a publicist for the show kept Silvestri from answering our probing questions, such as \"Do you have the phone?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems possible that a drunken Silvestri was dared to go charge his phone onstage by a friend who then filmed him. When reports of the \"Juice Jackal\" surfaced the next day, his friend proceeded to post the video on YouTube. Virality was instantly achieved, and Silvestri is clearly relishing the attention: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just wanna give a huge shoutout to all my fans and followers. This wouldn't be possible it it wasn't for u guys xoxoxox #muchlove — nick silvestri (@NickSilvestri2) July 10, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you watch the video, you'll see Silvestri's friend snickering in the background throughout the press conference.

On July 2 he entered Broadway legend by doing something nearly all of us do every day: he plugged in his cell phone charger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What made Silvestri different is that he plugged it into a prop outlet on the stage set of the Broadway comedy Hand to God. Witnesses turned to social media. Twitter lit up. When a video appeared on YouTube, it lit up further and got more than 140,000 hits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 19-year-old lacrosse-playing Nassau Community College student said he is not seeking publicity. He did not volunteer himself to Playbill.com. Our staff tracked him down through Twitter and he was hesitant at first about allowing his name to be used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, to answer your questions, he said the incident was not a dare. It was not intended as a joke. His iPhone 6 was just low on juice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why did he do it? What was the emergency? \"Girls were calling all day. What would you do?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silvestri had had a busy day. He was in town with his family, his neighbors and his cousins from California. \"We go to see shows maybe once a year and we heard this play was supposed to be funny.\" They ate beforehand at a restaurant about a half block from the Booth Theatre where Hand to God is playing. They had a few drinks, and he admits \"we were a little banged up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he noticed his phone was down to two bars of power, he tried to plug it into the USB port on the big-screen TV in the lounge at the back of the restaurant, but \"I got yelled at by the manager.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By time the meal was over he had about 5 percent left on his battery, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silvestri's group headed to the Booth Theatre, and they were seated in the orchestra section. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's when he saw the outlet on Beowulf Boritt's church basement set. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he said. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hand to God Set Designer Tells How He Made an Electrical Outlet So Realistic, Someone Tried to Charge a Cell Phone On It NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reaction was immediate. Members of the audience shouted, and \"about five security guards came running down. So I hopped off the stage. They were pretty mad. They said, 'What were you thinking?' I said, 'Hey, buddy, what's the problem?'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silvestri then asked the guards if he could jump back on the stage and retrieve his phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They said, 'Are you crazy?,'\" and one of them went up and got the phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silvestri returned to his seat with his smart phone, but the drama wasn't over yet. \"The head guy came down and started yelling at me in front of my family and the whole place. My mother kept saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' and they finally let us us stay and watch the play.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And what did he think of Hand to God? \"We enjoyed the show. I'm not much of a play guy, but it wasn't bad.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Did he ever get to charge his phone? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silvestri said he became aware of his growing online celebrity within a few days. \"The next day my friend sent me a link to Facebook. Somebody was saying 'some kid jumped on stage.' 'Moron jumps on stage.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What did he think of that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, hilarious.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In retrospect, what would he say to the cast? \"Hey, I'm sorry if I delayed your show five minutes. But you got a lot of attention from this, so maybe I made your show a little better [better known].\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We've Got the Footage! Audience Member Tries to Use Stage Outlet to Charge Phone at Hand to God\nPassage 4:\nArt met reality this week when Patti LuPone, without breaking character, walked offstage at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater with the phone of a texting audience member in her hand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider this a standing ovation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LuPone, who plays a small-town theater diva in the comedy “Shows for Days,” was already teed up after ringtones disrupted that day’s matinee — creating, she told The New York Times, “a cacophony of noise.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So when a woman seated at the end of the second row took to texting throughout the evening show, LuPone took matters into her own hands — literally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tony-winner usually shakes hands with an audience member as the second act’s first scene ends. This time, she made off with the phone — while staying in character. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actress told Playbill: “We work hard onstage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones. . . When a phone goes off or when a LED screen can be seen in the dark, it ruins the experience for everyone else.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, the message still hasn’t gotten through: Despite LuPone’s personal request before Thursday’s performance, another phone rang near the musical’s climax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Have some respect, folks. If you can’t put your (muted) phone away for the length of a show, don’t go.\nPassage 5:\nAt a performance of her new play, Shows for Days, on Wednesday night, theater legend Patti LuPone found herself vexed by an audience member texting. According to a report from Playbill, LuPone snatched the device right out of the audience member's hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I saw Patti LuPone deliver her scene exit line tonight at Lincoln Center & SNATCH A CELL PHONE OUT OF AN AUDIENCE MEMBER'S HAND,” another audience member wrote on Twitter. As news of the incident began to make the rounds on Thursday, Lupone redoubled her feelings in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We work hard on stage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones,\" LuPone said. She went on to despair, \"I am so defeated by this issue that I seriously question whether I want to work on stage anymore. Now I’m putting battle gear on over my costume to marshal the audience as well as perform.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is why we can't have nice things, theater audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time that LuPone has struck a blow for performers in their ongoing war against audience rudeness and technology. In 2009, during the run of her Tony-winning performance in Gypsy, LuPone stopped the show cold to upbraid an audience member for taking pictures. The righteous tirade—ironically captured on audio by a different outlaw audience member—quickly became the stuff of viral legend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week‘s adventure in cell-phone rudeness came mere days after reports of a mind-boggling incident at Hand to God, where an audience member took the stage to try and plug his phone into an on-set (fake) outlet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This kind of audience behavior isn't new. In 2011, Frances McDormand stopped a performance of Good People in its tracks when an audience member answered their ringing phone at a crucial moment of the second act, an incident chronicled for posterity by the Village Voice's Michael Musto, thank goodness. (Coincidentally, this VF.com correspondent was also in attendance that night.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incidents like these, beyond being delicious anecdotes for show goers and ornamental to the legends of the performers who fight back, offer proof that, even if our movie theaters are slowly succumbing to the inevitability of omnipresent cell phones, the theater community may well choose to die on this hill. And that they've got one thing going for them their two- and even three-dimensional show business cousins don't: the ability to fight back.\n", "answers": ["Cell phones in theaters: After two high-profile incidents on Broadway, things seem to have reached a \"tipping point,\" observes Variety. The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — A species of snake that had been \"lost\" for almost 80 years has been re-discovered on a remote Mexican island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a study published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, the Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error and the snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, noted the islands change a lot from season to season, so they timed the expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps as they looked for the snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations and is largely active at night. And they used Beebe's original field notes as a guide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Basically, following those directions, we essentially put ourselves in his place,\" Martinez Gomez said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Martinez Gomez said the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patricia Escalante, a biologist who curates bird collections at Mexico's National Autonomous University and who was not involved in the snake project, said the re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake was \"very interesting\" and significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One inhabitant of the Revillagigedo Islands, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The museum said that researcher Daniel Mulcahy, working with an expert from a Mexican institute, carried out an expedition to Clarion Island where their team identified 11 snakes matching Beebe's description. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake was indeed genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The museum said the snake species is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts. It is now recognised as a full species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" Mr Mulcahy said in a museum statement.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 18-page Presidential Policy Directive 20, issued in October last year but never published, states that what it calls Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) \"can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance US national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It says the government will \"identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The directive also contemplates the possible use of cyber actions inside the US, though it specifies that no such domestic operations can be conducted without the prior order of the president, except in cases of emergency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aim of the document was \"to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions\" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration published some declassified talking points from the directive in January 2013, but those did not mention the stepping up of America's offensive capability and the drawing up of a target list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's move to establish a potentially aggressive cyber warfare doctrine will heighten fears over the increasing militarization of the internet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The directive's publication comes as the president plans to confront his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a summit in California on Friday over alleged Chinese attacks on western targets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even before the publication of the directive, Beijing had hit back against US criticism, with a senior official claiming to have \"mountains of data\" on American cyber-attacks he claimed were every bit as serious as those China was accused of having carried out against the US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presidential Policy Directive 20 defines OCEO as \"operations and related programs or activities … conducted by or on behalf of the United States Government, in or through cyberspace, that are intended to enable or produce cyber effects outside United States government networks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the stepping up of US offensive capabilities outlined in the directive, a senior administration official said: \"Once humans develop the capacity to build boats, we build navies. Once you build airplanes, we build air forces.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official added: \"As a citizen, you expect your government to plan for scenarios. We're very interested in having a discussion with our international partners about what the appropriate boundaries are.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The document includes caveats and precautions stating that all US cyber operations should conform to US and international law, and that any operations \"reasonably likely to result in significant consequences require specific presidential approval\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The document says that agencies should consider the consequences of any cyber-action. They include the impact on intelligence-gathering; the risk of retaliation; the impact on the stability and security of the internet itself; the balance of political risks versus gains; and the establishment of unwelcome norms of international behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the possible \"significant consequences\" are loss of life; responsive actions against the US; damage to property; serious adverse foreign policy or economic impacts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US is understood to have already participated in at least one major cyber attack, the use of the Stuxnet computer worm targeted on Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges, the legality of which has been the subject of controversy. US reports citing high-level sources within the intelligence services said the US and Israel were responsible for the worm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the presidential directive, the criteria for offensive cyber operations in the directive is not limited to retaliatory action but vaguely framed as advancing \"US national objectives around the world\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation that the US is preparing a specific target list for offensive cyber-action is likely to reignite previously raised concerns of security researchers and academics, several of whom have warned that large-scale cyber operations could easily escalate into full-scale military conflict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sean Lawson, assistant professor in the department of communication at the University of Utah, argues: \"When militarist cyber rhetoric results in use of offensive cyber attack it is likely that those attacks will escalate into physical, kinetic uses of force.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An intelligence source with extensive knowledge of the National Security Agency's systems told the Guardian the US complaints again China were hypocritical, because America had participated in offensive cyber operations and widespread hacking – breaking into foreign computer systems to mine information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Provided anonymity to speak critically about classified practices, the source said: \"We hack everyone everywhere. We like to make a distinction between us and the others. But we are in almost every country in the world.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US likes to haul China before the international court of public opinion for \"doing what we do every day\", the source added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the unclassified points released by the administration in January stated: \"It is our policy that we shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats and that we will prioritize network defense and law enforcement as preferred courses of action.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The full classified directive repeatedly emphasizes that all cyber-operations must be conducted in accordance with US law and only as a complement to diplomatic and military options. But it also makes clear how both offensive and defensive cyber operations are central to US strategy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the heading \"Policy Reviews and Preparation\", a section marked \"TS/NF\" - top secret/no foreign - states: \"The secretary of defense, the DNI [Director of National Intelligence], and the director of the CIA … shall prepare for approval by the president through the National Security Advisor a plan that identifies potential systems, processes and infrastructure against which the United States should establish and maintain OCEO capabilities…\" The deadline for the plan is six months after the approval of the directive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The directive provides that any cyber-operations \"intended or likely to produce cyber effects within the United States\" require the approval of the president, except in the case of an \"emergency cyber action\". When such an emergency arises, several departments, including the department of defense, are authorized to conduct such domestic operations without presidential approval. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama further authorized the use of offensive cyber attacks in foreign nations without their government's consent whenever \"US national interests and equities\" require such nonconsensual attacks. It expressly reserves the right to use cyber tactics as part of what it calls \"anticipatory action taken against imminent threats\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The directive makes multiple references to the use of offensive cyber attacks by the US military. It states several times that cyber operations are to be used only in conjunction with other national tools and within the confines of law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the directive was first reported, lawyers with the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a Freedom of Information Act request for it to be made public. The NSA, in a statement, refused to disclose the directive on the ground that it was classified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, the Pentagon announced a major expansion of its Cyber Command Unit, under the command of General Keith Alexander, who is also the director of the NSA. That unit is responsible for executing both offensive and defensive cyber operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this year, the Pentagon publicly accused China for the first time of being behind attacks on the US. The Washington Post reported last month that Chinese hackers had gained access to the Pentagon's most advanced military programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, identified cyber threats in general as the top national security threat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama officials have repeatedly cited the threat of cyber-attacks to advocate new legislation that would vest the US government with greater powers to monitor and control the internet as a means of guarding against such threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One such bill currently pending in Congress, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (Cispa), has prompted serious concerns from privacy groups, who say that it would further erode online privacy while doing little to enhance cyber security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, Caitlin Hayden, national security council spokeswoman, said: \"We have not seen the document the Guardian has obtained, as they did not share it with us. However, as we have already publicly acknowledged, last year the president signed a classified presidential directive relating to cyber operations, updating a similar directive dating back to 2004. This step is part of the administration's focus on cybersecurity as a top priority. The cyber threat has evolved, and we have new experiences to take into account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This directive establishes principles and processes for the use of cyber operations so that cyber tools are integrated with the full array of national security tools we have at our disposal. It provides a whole-of-government approach consistent with the values that we promote domestically and internationally as we have previously articulated in the International Strategy for Cyberspace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This directive will establish principles and processes that can enable more effective planning, development, and use of our capabilities. It enables us to be flexible, while also exercising restraint in dealing with the threats we face. It continues to be our policy that we shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats and that we will prioritize network defense and law enforcement as the preferred courses of action. The procedures outlined in this directive are consistent with the US Constitution, including the president's role as commander in chief, and other applicable law and policies.\"\nPassage 2:\nThe Obama administration is refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter evolving threats of electronic assaults against the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Friday a directive signed by President Barack Obama last year calls for government cyber tools to be \"integrated with the full array of national security tools we have at our disposal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hayden was responding a report in the British newspaper The Guardian that says Obama has ordered national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential cyber targets overseas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian report comes as Obama was about to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with alleged Chinese hacking against the U.S. to be one of the main topics of discussion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the newspaper report offers details about Obama's directive that had not been made public before, the White House released a declassified summary of the directive in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, the Pentagon acknowledged in March that it was setting up a series of cyber teams charged with carrying out offensive operations to combat the threat of an electronic assault on the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gen. Keith Alexander, the top officer at U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, testified March 12 before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the potential for an attack against the nation's electric grid and other essential systems is real and that the federal government needed to take more aggressive steps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, Alexander said 13 cyber teams were being formed to guard the nation against destructive attacks in cyberspace, stressing that their role would be offensive. He also said the teams would work outside the United States, but he did not say where. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This directive will establish principles and processes that can enable more effective planning, development and use of our capabilities,\" Hayden said in a statement Friday. \"It enables us to be flexible, while also exercising restraint in dealing with the threats we face. It continues to be our policy that we shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats and that we will prioritize network defense and law enforcement as the preferred courses of action.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The timing of Friday's report coincides with Obama's two days of meetings with Xi at a California retreat. Top issues are cybersecurity and North Korea's nuclear threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian's report is the third significant leak of classified information this week. Following other revelations, the Obama administration has conceded that it has been secretly seizing phone records from millions of Americans and scouring U.S. Internet data for evidence of potential terrorist plotting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama himself weighed in Friday, defending the counterterrorism measures and noting that they are authorized and reviewed by Congress. He also said the Internet surveillance program does not apply to U.S. citizens or to people living in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't welcome leaks, because there's a reason why these programs are classified,\" Obama said, before the latest Guardian report. \"In our modern history, there are a whole range of programs that have been classified because, when it comes to, for example, fighting terror, our goal is to stop folks from doing us harm, and if every step that we're taking to try to prevent a terrorist act is on the front page of the newspapers or on television, then presumably the people who are trying to do us harm are going to be able to get around our preventive measures.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ____ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\nPassage 3:\nPresident Obama wants to strike up a friendly tone with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet today in California but the issues on the table are anything but informal.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama and China's new leader, Xi Jinping, made broad commitments Friday to work together on cybersecurity and to improve military-to-military relations as the two leaders wound up a first round of talks during an informal summit at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese and U.S. officials are both hoping that the informal format of the meeting—the two leaders' first since Mr. Xi became president in March—will give them the time and the right atmosphere to forge a personal rapport and reverse a downward spiral in relations that many analysts fear could lead to conflict.

But the Obama administration also had a long list of economic and security concerns, many of which it has confronted China with for years, with mixed results. They include Chinese cyberespionage, North Korea's nuclear program, Beijing's maritime disputes in Asia and Chinese market reforms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Xi, too, had much at stake, bringing with him a proposal to redefine the relationship with the U.S. as one of equal \"great powers,\"–a personal initiative that is part of his broader campaign to promote a \"Chinese dream\" of a strong nation reclaiming the position in the world that it held until the Opium Wars of the 19th Century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the first round of talks, the two leaders—both wearing white dress shirts with open collars and no ties—walked together on the grounds of the estate in the 115-degree heat, and shook hands in front of the cameras. They each made brief statements calling for a new era of bilateral relations, although Mr. Obama stopped short of echoing Mr. Xi's \"great power\" formula. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news conference was dominated by cybersecurity, talks on which could be complicated by the recent disclosures on electronic surveillance by Mr. Obama's own government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What both President Xi and I recognize is that because of these incredible advances in technology, that the issue of cybersecurity and the need for rules and common approaches to cybersecurity are going to be increasingly important as part of bilateral relationships and multilateral relationships,\" Mr. Obama said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In some ways these are uncharted waters and you don't have the kinds of protocols that cover military issues for example and arms issues where nations have a lot of experiencing in trying to negotiate what's acceptable and what's not.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Obama sought to draw a distinction between activities such as hacking or cyber-theft, and the kind of surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency. He also noted that cybersecurity wasn't just a concern for the U.S. and China, and that problems were often caused by nonstate actors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're going to have to work very hard to build a system of defense and protections both in the private sector and in public sector even as we negotiate with other countries around the world in setting up common rules of the road,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Xi also said the two sides should improve military to military relations, as well as cooperation on trade and the environment. He said he looked forward to maintaining close communication with President Obama, who he invited to visit China for a similar summit \"at an appropriate time\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Obama said the two sides would \"institutionalize and regularize\" military-to-military talks that have often been suspended in the past, and which aren't yet formally part of a regular U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the latest round of which takes place next month.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Xi didn't appear to be using notes during either the news conference or his earlier statement with Mr. Obama—demonstrating a confidence in his own abilities and in his standing within the Communist Party that his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never displayed during his 10 years in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials said Mr. Xi pushed for the summit and agreed to the informal format despite Chinese leaders' usual preference for highly scripted talking points approved in advance by China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Xi himself drew parallels with the 1972 meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and President Richard Nixon in Beijing, which laid the ground for the normalization of relations six years later. Comparisons have also been made with a visit to the U.S. by Deng Xiaoping in 1979, signaling a return to personal diplomacy in the bilateral relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with expectations in China running so high, analysts say that if Mr. Xi fails to demonstrate a rapport with Mr. Obama—and entice the U.S. to reciprocate his overtures—he could face criticism at home for spurning a Chinese trend of consensus-based decision-making in favor of concentrating more power in his own hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese media are already portraying the Sunnylands summit as a historic victory for Mr. Xi's \"new-type great power\" initiative—a formula designed to prevent the military conflict that has often arisen between a rising power and an established one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"China and the United States must find a new path, one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past,\" Mr. Xi said. \"And that is to say the two sides must work together to build a new model of major country relationship.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Xi sought to allay U.S. concerns that his talk of national rejuvenation implied that China seeks to displace the U.S. as the dominant military power in Asia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I stated very clearly to President Obama that China will be firmly committed to the path of peaceful development,\" he said. \"By the Chinese dream we seek to have economic prosperity, national renewal and people's well-being.…It is connected to the American dream and the beautiful dreams people in other countries may have.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Obama responded by saying he welcomed China's continued \"peaceful rise\"--echoing a term coined by Mr. Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, that has been used less frequently by Chinese officials since Mr. Xi took power.

Annenberg, built in the Southern California desert would become, after their deaths, “Camp David West” for American presidents — a place both to relax and to parley with world leaders, preferably those from Pacific powers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And both Annenbergs, associates say, wanted their Sunnylands estate to shed its reputation as a retreat only for Republican elites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, nearly 11 years after Mr. Annenberg’s death and four years after his wife’s, President Obama begins to realize the couple’s dream by welcoming President Xi Jinping of China at Sunnylands on Friday. By its unusual informality, the presidents’ two-day meeting is already being interpreted as a milestone in their nations’ often tense and generally stilted four-decade diplomatic history. Mr. Obama will sleep at the estate, presumably in the canary yellow master bedroom where speakers pipe in the songs of the birds outdoors; Chinese officials and their leader, reportedly fearful of eavesdropping bugs, have opted for a nearby hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This meeting fits the Annenbergs’ conception to a T,” said George P. Shultz, who as a member of both the Nixon and Reagan cabinets often joined those presidents at Sunnylands, along with their spouses and celebrities like Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet as properties go, Sunnylands is no Camp David. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp David, the wooded retreat of presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the Maryland mountains near Washington, is plenty nice for those who favor rustic chic and cabins. Sunnylands, by contrast, is a 25,000-square-foot structure of postwar Modernist design near Palm Springs, with 22 guest bedrooms and a sprawling living room with walls of windows that look out to the surrounding San Jacinto Mountains. The house sits on 200 acres that include a nine-hole golf course, 11 artificial lakes, three guest cottages, a tennis court and landscaped grounds with sculptures and groves of olive trees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside, and certain to make the guests from Beijing feel more at home, are ancient Chinese porcelain, sculptures and cloisonné pieces. But there also are paintings by Picasso and sculptures by Rodin and Giacometti, among others. The home’s 52 Impressionist and post-Impressionist works, by Cezanne, Manet, Monet and more, are digitized copies of the real things; the originals are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art because of a billion-dollar bequest from the Annenbergs after Mr. Annenberg’s death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sunnylands remains much as it was in past decades, Mr. Shultz said. “It’s a magical place, and a wonderful place to sit and talk,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he and Mr. Reagan were on their feet and golfing one year, he said, playing their traditional pre-party New Year’s Eve game, when the president asked Mr. Shultz, his secretary of state, if he had any good economic policy ideas. Mr. Shultz, who had been Treasury secretary to Mr. Nixon, passed along a tax proposal he had heard from a friend. That was the idea that led to the landmark 1986 law overhauling the tax code. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Annenbergs broke ground for Sunnylands 50 years ago, and it was three years under construction before the couple, who also had residences in Pennsylvania, New York, Washington and Sun Valley, Idaho, began spending the winter months at the desert oasis. When they were in residence, so were others: Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower enjoyed post-presidency getaways. Richard M. Nixon, who is still revered in China for opening relations between the two countries, was a frequent guest and escaped here after his resignation as president, writing in the Annenbergs’ guest book, “When you’re down, you find out who your real friends are.” Gerald and Betty Ford visited repeatedly, as did George and Barbara Bush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1975, Mr. Annenberg, who had been Mr. Nixon’s ambassador to Britain, wrote to Margaret Thatcher, who was then the opposition leader in the House of Commons, to arrange a meeting with Mr. Reagan at the latter’s request; it soon took place in London, just a few years before each would take power and forge a trans-Atlantic alliance. Mrs. Thatcher, the former prime minister, who died in April, visited Sunnylands a number of times, as has Queen Elizabeth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first President Bush set the precedent for incumbent world leaders conferring at Sunnylands, 22 years before the estate would open for that purpose in 2012. In 1990 he held a state dinner for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, and the two men had talks to avert a trade crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1988, a casually dressed Mr. Reagan signed the first free-trade pact with Canada in Mr. Annenberg’s office at Sunnylands, communicating by phone with the Canadian prime minister. According to Geoffrey Cowan, the president of the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, the office is now called “the president’s office,” and, he added, “It will be President Obama’s office.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Obama will be the eighth president to stay at the estate, and the third Democrat. Both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have been guests, if not such frequent visitors and Annenberg friends as the Republican presidents. Both Annenbergs “really liked the Clintons,” Mr. Cowan said, “and that I know from my own conversations with them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 21-minute video created for the trust, called “A Place Called Sunnylands,” is rich with footage of the estate’s Republican heritage. But it closes with Mr. Clinton, who expresses hope that Sunnylands will become a meeting place for world leaders in the 21st century.\n", "answers": ["Cyber-spying, trade, North Korea, US military maneuvers—there's no shortage of big issues for President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping to tackle tonight and tomorrow during their informal summit in Southern California.

The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it. As the summit opened this evening, Obama said he hoped it would establish a \"new model of cooperation\" between the nations, and Xi used the phrase \"a new model of major country relations,\" reports Politico.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was down in the dumps over the latest allegations that he had abused Taylor. I told him people don’t believe everything they read and he told me, ‘It’s funny how a reality show can ruin your entire life,’” Armstrong’s friend Tom Vickers told RadarOnline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple’s relationship has often been rocky, and, through it all, the cameras have been rollilng. Responding to Taylor’s claims that he had been an abusive husband while she was filing for divorce on July 15, Armstrong told People Magazine, “Did I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russell and Taylor are not the first reality TV couple whose marriage faltered on screen. Jon and Kate Gosselin, who starred together with their eight children in ‘Jon and Kate Plus 8’, ended their 10-year marriage in 2009. From then on, the show was called ‘Kate Plus 8.' It was just canceled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Industry insiders say that \"reality\" TV is often far from an accurate presentation of events. Small slights are exaggerated, peacemaking is ignored or left on the cutting room floor in the pursuit of a dramatic narrative. So, it's not clear that what the audiences saw – or even what the \"actors\" said about the show – bears much resemblance to the truth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Mark Andrejevic, University of Iowa associate professor of communications studies, has said that keeping people on the threshold of mental breakdown is a tactic that has been used on some reality television shows. In a United Press International article on Aug. 2, 2009, Prof. Andrejevic said that “The bread and butter of reality television is to get people into a state where they are tired, stressed and emotionally vulnerable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He wasn't talking about ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,’ which only debuted in 2010. But one doesn't have to go far to find the destructive effects of living in a celebrity culture.

[the] essentials for surviving celebrity are the same as for everyone else, he says: “You need a life to keep you grounded … someone to make you take out the garbage.” Next, he says is spiritual values. He points to musician Bono, who he he says has been married for 27 years and is a devout Roman Catholic, as the “perfect” celebrity. The Irish rocker also has a cause that is much higher than himself – Africa – and longtime friends, his band mates who will tell him when he’s being stupid – the last two tools for navigating fame. “If you have these in place, as Bono does,” adds Boteach, “you have a chance at a real, meaningful life.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Armstrong leaves behind a daughter, Kennedy, and two sons from previous relationships.\nPassage 2:\nObituary NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russell Armstrong, estranged husband of Taylor Armstrong of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” was found dead last night, an apparent suicide.

This show has literally pushed us to the limit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The divorce petition filed by Taylor Armstrong on July 15 in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court makes no mention of abuse or domestic violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the show’s first season, Russell had been seen as a grumpy-at-best partner, with Taylor often lamenting the sadness in their marriage to other cast members. “My marriage is the worst it’s ever been,” she said to the cameras. “I just feel that something has to change.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, Russell Armstrong talked to The Daily Beast for a story about the husbands of Real Housewives, “I didn’t really understand what we were getting into.” He said that times when he was shown leaving parties, disappointing his wife, were in fact late at night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He agreed that his decision to stay in the background of the show “backfired.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m going to be more engaging next season,” Armstrong said. In person, he appeared more at ease than he had on camera and seemed eager to show reporters speaking with him at a party that he was kinder than audiences had seen him being. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the same interview with The Daily Beast, he cited financial pressures and working all the time as things that added to his stress. Armstrong had filed for bankruptcy in 2005, and recent reports indicated that he was again in financial trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a reunion special for the show, broadcast in early February, Armstrong responded to questions about what it was like watching his marital troubles on television. “It was difficult,” he said. “The last three years have been very challenging for the entire country. I, candidly, have been working 80-hour weeks. It’s very easy to get preoccupied with kids and business and the day-to-day grind.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show’s first season ended with Russell and Taylor Armstrong trying to reconcile. “We definitely agreed that we wanted to keep our family together,” she said during the reunion, which had been filmed in early January. On the Beverly Hills reunion, Taylor’s cast mate Lisa Vanderpump said of Russell, “I have been quite honest that I don’t connect to him on any level at all. He seems quite cut off. And I think that must be very difficult to be married to.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Russell Armstrong’s attorney Ronald Richards said the marriage suffered damage at the hands of the TV production. Richards represented him in the divorce and in a $1.5-million lawsuit filed against the couple last month alleging they had bilked people in an Internet medical scam. “People start making financial decisions based upon what’s best for the TV show instead of what’s best for them,” Richards told The Daily Beast. “So it creates a horrible cycle of bad decisions that start to pile upon one another. At this point, they were set on getting divorced.” Richards recalled Russell Armstrong as “a very nice guy who was very compassionate about the support of Taylor’s career. He was instrumental in getting her a lot of the brand licensing deals that she’s currently dealing with.” Richards talked to Russell Armstrong regularly and said that when he spoke to him two days ago he seemed depressed about his divorce and the pending lawsuit, but not at a level that worried Richards. “He had the normal depression that you would expect based on being in a lawsuit and a divorce but nothing beyond the ordinary,” Richards said. “I was not concerned. This is very tough on all levels. He had a very good relationship with all of his kids.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the news of Armstrong’s death broke on Tuesday, Andy Cohen, Bravo’s executive vice president of original programming and development, who also hosts the channel’s talk show Watch What Happens: Live, tweeted, “I am so very sad about today’s news. My prayers and thoughts are with Taylor Armstrong and her family.” The network issued a similar statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through her manager, Robert Thorne, Taylor Armstrong issued this statement: “Taylor Armstrong is devastated by the tragic events that have unfolded. She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter. Her thoughts and prayers are also with Russell’s 11- and 13-year-old sons.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bravo launched the successful Real Housewives franchise in 2006 with The Real Housewives of Orange County. In subsequent years, the show expanded to New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Miami, and Beverly Hills. Before cameras, women in the casts have experienced divorce, problems with their children, foreclosure, and bankruptcy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thom Beers, executive producer of several testosterone-fueled documentary-style programs that follow men whose livelihoods force them to confront death on a regular basis, has dealt with the passing of three cast members over the course of his career. The death that garnered the most attention was the sudden passing of Capt. Phil Harris on Discovery’s Deadliest Catch in 2010, who appeared to be recovering from a stroke he suffered while filming. Harris asked for production to continue, which allowed the cameras to capture his unexpected death and earned the series an Emmy nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What happened on Housewives is a tragedy,” Beers said Tuesday. “The challenge is that when it happens, the shows are already in the can. It casts a pall over the whole production because the shows start airing, and there’s nothing you can do.

You’re having a nervous breakdown.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Daily Beast emailed Bravo for a response to Russell Armstrong’s attorney’s accusation that being on the show created undue financial pressure on the couple, and to ask whether the season premiere will air as planned, how much the dissolution of the Armstrong marriage would be featured during the season, and whether the show would be changed or reedited at all because of the news. A network spokesperson said no decisions have been made as of yet.\nPassage 3:\nUnscripted NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two weeks before the season-two premiere of 'Beverly Hills,’ Taylor Armstrong’s estranged husband, Russell, is dead in a suicide. Kate Aurthur and Maria Elena Fernandez on the couple’s money woes and on-camera unraveling—and Bravo’s plans for the show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: On Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office confirmed the police department's early findings that Armstrong hanged himself. Toxicology results are pending, the spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women of Bravo’s phenomenally successful Real Housewives reality TV franchise have experienced—on camera—divorce, problems with their children, foreclosure, and bankruptcy. Off camera there have been three deaths as well: the fiancé of Gretchen Rossi and the ex-husband of Tammy Knickerbocker, both of Orange County, died of natural causes; and the ex-fiancé of Atlanta’s Kandi Burruss was beaten to death in a fight at a club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now there has been an apparent suicide. Russell Armstrong, the 47-year-old husband of Taylor Armstrong, 40, of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, was found dead Monday night, two weeks before the premiere of the show’s second season. He had been staying in West Los Angeles on Mulholland Drive with a friend, who discovered Armstrong hanged in his bedroom, according to a detective from the Los Angeles Police Department who spoke with The Daily Beast. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, a police spokesman said. A representative from the Los Angeles County coroner’s office said Armstrong’s death does appear to be a suicide but that an autopsy will be conducted within two days. The news was first reported by TMZ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the first season of Beverly Hills, Russell was portrayed as a grumpy-at-best partner, leaving parties in a sulk, buying his daughter a dog she was allergic to without seeming to care, and coming across as cold and uncomfortable. Taylor often talked about the sadness in her marriage to other cast members. “My marriage is the worst it’s ever been,” she told the cameras. “I just feel that something has to change.” The season ended with the couple trying to work out their problems. “We definitely agreed that we wanted to keep our family together,” Taylor said during a reunion of the cast, filmed in early January. The couple had been married for six years and had a 5-year-old daughter, Kennedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the reconciliation did not last. Taylor filed for divorce on July 15, citing irreconcilable differences. In an interview with People magazine around the same time, she said that her husband had physically abused her. Russell told People: “Did I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.” (The divorce petition filed in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court, viewed by The Daily Beast on Tuesday, makes no mention of abuse or domestic violence.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Season two of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills—part of a franchise that has expanded since the 2006 launch of Orange County to New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Miami—is scheduled to premiere on Sept. 5. Asked whether the show will air as planned, how much the dissolution of the Armstrong marriage will be featured during the season, and whether the show will be changed or reedited in the wake of Russell’s death, a network spokesperson said no decisions have been made. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the channel’s executives plan to wait “at least 24 hours to make a decision about whether they’ll postpone the show.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russell does not appear in the premiere, which has already been sent out to the press. “He was not happy about how he thought the show would portray him,” Russell Armstrong’s attorney, Ronald Richards, reached on Tuesday, told The Daily Beast. But the couple’s marital problems are front and center, plot-wise. In her first scene, Taylor goes shopping for lingerie with friends in order to “spice up my love life” with Russell. She says they are in couple's therapy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The therapy comes up again later in the episode under more fraught circumstances. At a dinner party with the whole cast and their spouses—except for Russell—Taylor feels that Ken Todd, the husband of Lisa Vanderpump, is judging her for needing professional help to save her marriage. She breaks down in tears and leaves the table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she returns, the confrontation continues. “We were at the end of our rope,” she tells Todd. “I’m really fragile right now. I’m going through so much—it’s a lot.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In confessional interviews to the camera, fan favorites Ken and Lisa do not appear to be sympathetic to Taylor. Ken says, “It seems to me that Taylor can turn on the waterworks whenever she wants to.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Taylor’s very manipulative,” Lisa says. She later adds, “Her mood goes up and down like the whore’s drawers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a trailer for the upcoming season, Taylor appears to be crying several times, at one point tearfully saying to cast mate Adrienne Maloof, “I feel like I’m breaking.” Adrienne responds: “You are. You’re having a nervous breakdown.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reality television has faced dilemmas over whether to air tragedies before. In 1994, MTV’s third season of The Real World cast the HIV-positive Pedro Zamora, and his death that same year was memorialized in a special tribute program. At the opposite end of the spectrum, when in 2009 Ryan Jenkins, a contestant on VH1’s dating show Megan Wants a Millionaire, murdered his wife and then committed suicide rather than be arrested, the network pulled the show off the air and scrapped it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thom Beers, executive producer of several testosterone-fueled documentary-style programs that follow men whose livelihoods force them to confront death on a regular basis, has dealt with the passing of three cast members. The sudden death, on camera, of Capt. Phil Harris of Discovery’s Deadliest Catch in 2010 garnered the most attention. Harris, who appeared to be recovering from a stroke he suffered while filming, asked for production to continue, allowing the cameras to capture his unexpected death. The series earned an Emmy nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What happened on Housewives is a tragedy,” Beers said Tuesday. “It casts a pall over the whole production because the shows start airing, and there’s nothing you can do … It really affects the spirit of the entire production.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Richards, the venture capitalist was suffering from financial difficulties made worse by lavish spending he and his wife felt was required by the show. Richards was representing him in the divorce and in a $1.5 million lawsuit filed against the couple last month, alleging they had bilked people in an Internet medical scam. “People start making financial decisions based upon what’s best for the TV show instead of what’s best for them,” Richards told The Daily Beast. “So it creates a horrible cycle of bad decisions that start to pile upon one another.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He had the normal depression that you would expect based on being in a lawsuit and a divorce, but nothing beyond the ordinary,” he said. “I was not concerned.

Her thoughts and prayers are also with Russell’s 11- and 13-year-old sons.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, Russell Armstrong talked to The Daily Beast for a story about the husbands of Real Housewives. “I didn’t really understand what we were getting into,” he said at the time. “I don’t really watch reality television.”\nPassage 4:\nOn Bravo's \"Real Housewives\" franchise, a main character is affluence. It takes many forms: private planes, posh mansions, thousand-dollar shopping sprees. And it seemed Russell Armstrong and his wife, Taylor, who appeared on \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" had been living up to the lifestyle. Last season, Taylor threw a $60,000 party for their then-4-year-old daughter, frequently conferred with a private stylist and devoted much of her free time to philanthropy.On Monday night, Russell Armstrong, 47, was found dead in an apparent suicide, and facts began to emerge Tuesday that raise questions about how the program presented the couple and whether the resulting glare of publicity played any role in his death.For one, it appears the Armstrongs were far less wealthy than viewers might have surmised. Russell Armstrong, who described himself as a venture capitalist, was a struggling entrepreneur who racked up $12 million in debts in the tech bust and was recently sued with his wife for allegedly diverting investors' money to redecorate a Bel-Air mansion and hobnob with the truly wealthy.\" 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,' I think, was [Russell's] downfall. The TV show put a lot of pressure on him to produce financially. You're on a show with a couple like the Maloofs, who are verifiable billionaires, and you're not,\" said friend William Ratner, referring to \"Housewives\" personality Adrienne Maloof, whose family owns the Sacramento Kings and their home arena as well as Las Vegas' Palms casino resort.In July, Taylor Armstrong, 40, filed for divorce from her husband (the difficulties in the couple's marriage were evident in the show's first season). As a result, he had been staying with a friend at his home on the 1400 block of Mulholland Drive. On Monday night, the friend discovered Russell Armstrong's body: He had hanged himself and left no suicide note behind, according to authorities.A statement released by Taylor Armstrong's publicist said she was \"devastated by the tragic events that have unfolded. She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter.\"The second season of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" is scheduled to premiere Sept. 5, according to Bravo, the cable network that airs the program. At press time, a Bravo representative said a decision had not yet been made on whether the season will be postponed or episodes re-edited.The \"Real Housewives\" franchise, which launched in 2006 and followed five women living in Orange County, has become one of Bravo's most lucrative brands, expanding into multiple locations including New Jersey, New York City and Atlanta. Much of its appeal centers on its protagonists' opulent lifestyles and the over-the-top drama surrounding them. Though many of the women on the shows boast about their rich and seemingly picture-perfect lives, in the tabloids, another reality has often been revealed: At least half a dozen \"Housewives\" have begun divorce proceedings and roughly the same number have filed for bankruptcy since signing on to the show.The first season of the \"Beverly Hills\" edition came to a close in January, when its finale episode drew an impressive 2.76 million viewers. In the series, Russell was portrayed as the strait-laced husband — he left parties early and his wife complained he was unaffectionate, which seemed to be at the core of the couple's struggles. Taylor, at one point, referred to their marriage as a \"business partnership.\"Much of the second season was supposed to document her struggle to keep the marriage intact. In the upcoming season premiere, which already has been made available to the television media, Taylor is shown buying lingerie in an attempt to spice up their love life and discussing their attempt at couples therapy; Russell is the only husband not shown in the episode.Ratner, a Los Angeles restaurant investor, said he last saw Armstrong in June and that his friend already knew a divorce was coming.\"I went in and talked with him, and he said, 'I don't know why she's doing this. Why can't she do this off the show?' He said there were still two weeks left of shooting and he didn't want to be in it,\" Ratner explained. \"He said the producers at Bravo told Russell and Taylor that they picked them as the 'disaster couple,' and if they weren't going to have drama in the second season, they would cut them and replace them with someone else.\"Asked to respond to Ratner's assertions, a Bravo representative said \"Production has assured us that there is no truth to these claims.\" A network statement expressed sympathy for the Armstrong family \"at this difficult time.\"But Ronald Richards, the attorney who is representing Russell Armstrong in the divorce and in previous litigation, agreed that his client's behavior changed once he became a part of a show — something he did in an effort to help build his wife's \"brand.\"\"He helped build the brand and the show, and it's unfortunate how things worked out because right when her brand became valuable and he thought he could get endorsements for different products, this happened,\" he said. \"When you join these shows, you end up trying to support an imaginary lifestyle that's on the show. He was forced to do that because a character loses their brand value if they don't and diverts the segment on to other characters.\"In a July interview with People magazine , Taylor Armstrong said that Russell was verbally and physically abusive, sometimes \"grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.\" (None of these allegations was included in her divorce filing.)\"Did I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were,\" Russell Armstrong responded in the article. \"This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\"However, in March 1998, Russell Armstrong pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery involving his first wife. He was sentenced to three days in county jail, 50 hours community service and 36 months summary probation.\nPassage 5:\nBy Radar Staff NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russell Armstrong broke down just days before he committed suicide and admitted to a friend that reality TV had destroyed his life.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nOriginal Contribution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2011.90 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Axillary Dissection vs No Axillary Dissection in Women With Invasive Breast Cancer and Sentinel Node Metastasis NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Randomized Clinical Trial NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next Section Abstract Context Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival. Objective To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected. Interventions All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point. Results Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00003855 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been part of breast cancer surgery since the description of the radical mastectomy.1 ALND reliably identifies nodal metastases and maintains regional control,2,3 but the contribution of local therapy to breast cancer survival is controversial.4,5 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group synthesized findings from 78 randomized controlled trials, concluding that local control of breast cancer was associated with improved disease-specific survival.6 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ALND, as a means for achieving local disease control, carries an indisputable and often unacceptable risk of complications such as seroma, infection, and lymphedema.7,8,9 Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) was therefore developed to accurately stage tumor-draining axillary nodes with less morbidity than ALND.10 SLND alone is the accepted management for patients whose sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are histologically free of tumor, while ALND remains the standard of care for patients whose SLNs contain metastases.11 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cancer biology is much better understood now than it was when ALND was introduced. Biological factors may affect the predilection of some malignant cells to selectively invade lymph nodes rather than visceral organs, just as certain tumor types metastasize to certain organs and not others.12 Recognition of the complexity of tumor biology has changed cancer treatment, with more liberal use of systemic therapy to treat occult cancer cells wherever they may be in the body. Consequently, the decision to administer systemic therapy is influenced by a variety of patient- and tumor-related factors, with lymph node tumor status influencing13,14 but not necessarily dictating the use of chemotherapy.15,16,17,18 Other factors, such as early cancer detection by screening mammography, have led to earlier intervention in breast cancer, reducing the incidence of nodal metastases and even the number of tumor-involved lymph nodes.19 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These evolving concepts have called into question the need for ALND.20,21 A variety of algorithms have been developed to help clinicians decide which patients would benefit from ALND.22,23,24 Review of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data has shown that the use of ALND for SLN metastases has decreased in recent years.25 No study has conclusively demonstrated a survival benefit or detriment for omitting ALND when metastatic breast cancer is identified by SLND. In the late 1990s, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group designed and began the multicenter Z0011 trial. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of ALND on overall survival in patients with SLN metastases treated in the contemporary era with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field radiation therapy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous Section Next Section METHODS Patient Characteristics This multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial was registered with the National Cancer Institute and approved by the institutional review boards of participating centers. All patients provided written informed consent. Adult women with histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma clinically 5 cm or less, no palpable adenopathy, and an SLN containing metastatic breast cancer documented by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section were eligible for participation. Patients with metastases identified initially or solely with immunohistochemical staining were ineligible. Treatment with lumpectomy to negative margins (no tumor at ink) was required. Women were ineligible if they had 3 or more positive SLNs, matted nodes, or gross extranodal disease, or if they had received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Study Design and Treatment Before randomization, all women underwent SLND and were stratified according to age (≤50 and >50 years), estrogen-receptor status, and tumor size (≤1 cm, >1 cm and ≤2 cm, or >2 cm). Eligible women were randomly assigned to ALND or no further axillary-specific intervention—specifically, no third-field nodal irradiation. ALND was defined as an anatomical level I and II dissection including at least 10 nodes. All women were to receive whole-breast opposing tangential-field radiation therapy. The use of adjuvant systemic therapy was determined by the treating physician and was not specified in the protocol. Patients most commonly entered the study post-SLND following identification of metastases on final pathology report. However, of the 891 registered patients, 287 were registered pre-SLND and assigned to treatment after intraoperative documentation of SLN metastases. Patients in this group subsequently found to have 3 or more tumor-involved lymph nodes were included in the analysis. Patients were assessed for disease recurrence according to standard clinical practice. History and physical examination were performed every 6 months for the first 36 months and yearly thereafter. Annual mammography was required; other testing was based on symptoms and investigator preference. Study End Points The primary end point was overall survival, defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. A short-term primary end point was occurrence of surgical morbidities. The study plan was to report surgical morbidities following the completion of accrual and prior to overall survival reporting after receiving permission from the data and safety monitoring committee. These morbidities have been reported.10 A secondary end point was disease-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to death or first documented recurrence of breast cancer. Breast cancer recurrence was categorized as locoregional disease (tumor in the breast or ipsilateral supraclavicular, subclavicular, internal mammary, or axillary nodes) or distant metastases. Disease-free survival and its components (locoregional disease and distant metastases) are reported instead of the protocol-specified secondary end point (eg, distant disease–free survival) to facilitate comparison with other studies. Statistical Analysis The primary end point was overall survival as a measure of noninferiority of no further axillary specified interventions (SLND-alone group) compared with the ALND group. Based on the literature at the time of study design, we hypothesized that overall survival was 80% at 5 years for optimally treated women with positive nodes.26,27,28 Clinical noninferiority was defined as the SLND-alone group having a 5-year survival of not less than 75% of that observed in the ALND group. Noninferiority of the SLND-alone treatment was also considered if the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was less than 1.3 when compared with ALND. An estimated 500 deaths were needed for the study to have 90% power to confirm noninferiority of SLND alone compared with ALND, with the use of a 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the HR from a Cox regression model.29 Specifically, if the 90% CI for the HR was below 1.3, this would indicate that patients undergoing SLND alone do not have an unacceptably worse overall survival than patients undergoing SLND plus ALND. The use of a 2-sided 90% CI corresponds to a 1-sided significance level of .05.30 The enrollment of 1900 patients in 4 years with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years was initially planned. Four formal interim analyses and 1 final analysis were planned for overall survival, and the O’Brien-Flemming α-spending strategy was used to generate stopping boundaries for each planned analysis. The overall study significance was maintained at .05. However, none of the planned interim analyses were performed before the study was closed based on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. Because of this, a single terminal hypothesis test with an α of .05 is applied to the data, which makes it consistent with the planned overall significance level of .05 in the original study plan. Ineligible patients were retained in all analyses (ie, both the intent-to-treat analyses and the treatment-received analyses). Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared by log-rank test. The unadjusted HR (and 90% CI) was calculated using a Cox regression analysis, and noninferiority P values are reported. As a secondary analysis, known prognostic factors including adjuvant treatment were included in the Cox regression model to generate an adjusted HR for overall survival (with a 90% CI and noninferiority P values). Disease-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses with 95% CIs. The fact that there were only 94 deaths limited the number of variables that could be used in a multivariable model without affecting model stability. We created a base model that included the treatment group (SLND alone vs ALND), age (≤50 vs >50 years), and whether the patient received adjuvant therapy (yes vs no) and added prognostic variables to this model individually. Only variables obtained on 90% or more of the patients were included in the multivariable analysis. Locoregional recurrence rates were compared with the Fisher exact test. Each analysis, other than analysis for the primary end point of overall survival, was performed with 2-sided P values, 5% significance, and a 95% CI; all analyses were performed using SAS release 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous Section Next Section RESULTS Patient Characteristics The first patient was enrolled in May 1999, and accrual closed in December 2004 based on a recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring committee because of concerns regarding the extremely low mortality rate. Even if the trial had accrued the targeted 1900 patients, it would have taken more than 20 years of follow-up to observe 500 deaths at the realized event rate. At the time of the decision to terminate the study there had been no formal analysis comparing the survival experience between the 2 groups; the decision was based solely on the observed mortality rate for pooled data from the 2 groups. The date of last follow-up for this analysis was March 4, 2010. Patients were enrolled from 115 institutions, which included affiliates of the Cancer Trials Support Unit and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Of 891 patients, 445 were randomly assigned to the ALND group and 446 to the SLND-alone group (Figure 1). Thirty-five patients were excluded after withdrawing consent prior to surgery. The 103 ineligible patients were included in the analyses reported here. Because this was a noninferiority trial, a more conservative analysis was performed on the treatment-received sample (n = 813 patients); 32 patients in the ALND group did not have ALND, and 11 patients in the SLND-alone group had ALND. No qualitative differences were observed between treatment-received sample and intent-to-treat sample analyses, so only intent-to-treat results are reported. Disease characteristics at baseline were well balanced between the 2 groups (Table 1). View larger version: Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 1.

Baseline Patient and Tumor Characteristics by Study Group Treatment Results There was an expected difference between ALND and SLND-alone treatment groups in total number of removed lymph nodes and total number of tumor-involved nodes; the median total number of nodes removed was 17 (interquartile range [IQR], 13-22) in the ALND group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the SLND-alone group.31 The median total number of nodes with histologically demonstrated tumor involvement (including SLNs) in the ALND group and SLND-alone group was equal (1 [IQR, 1-2] for both groups). Hematoxylin-eosin–stained tumor deposits no larger than 2 mm were defined as micrometastases and were identified in SLNs of 137 of 365 patients (37.5%) in the ALND group compared with 164 of 366 (44.8%) in the SLND-alone group (P = .05). In the ALND group, 97 of 355 patients (27.3%) had additional metastasis in lymph nodes removed by ALND, including 10% of patients with SLN micrometastasis who had macroscopically involved non-SLNs removed. Total nodal involvement is summarized in Table 1; 21.0% of patients undergoing ALND had 3 or more involved nodes compared with 3.7% undergoing SLND alone. Four or more involved nodes were seen in 13.7% of patients receiving ALND and 1.0% of those receiving SLND alone. Adjuvant systemic therapy was delivered to 403 women (96.0%) in the ALND group and 423 women (97.0%) in the SLND-alone group.31 No differences in the proportion of women receiving endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or both were observed. The type of chemotherapy administered was similar in the 2 groups; anthracycline- and taxane-based combination regimens were the most common. The majority of the women (n = 605) received whole-breast radiation therapy: 263 of 296 (88.9%) in the ALND group and 277 of 309 (89.6%) in the SLND-alone group. Overall Survival At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (IQR, 5.2-7.7), there were 94 deaths (SLND-alone group, 42; ALND group, 52). The use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not appear to result in statistically inferior survival (Figure 2) (P = .008 for noninferiority). The unadjusted HR comparing overall survival between the SLND-alone group and the ALND group was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.10), which did not cross the specified boundary of 1.3 (Figure 3). The 5-year overall survival rates were 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) in the SLND-alone group and 91.8% (95% CI, 89.1%-94.5%) in the ALND group. This was substantially greater than the 80% anticipated at protocol design. The HR for overall survival adjusting for adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or radiation therapy) and age for the SLND-alone group compared with the ALND group was 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23). The adjusted HRs comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group in the other multivariable models ranged from 0.86 to 0.92 (Table 2), all similar to the unadjusted rate of 0.79. An exploratory analysis revealed that treatment with ALND vs SLND alone produced no statistically significant difference in outcome among patients grouped by receptor status of the primary tumor (ER+/PR+ or ER−/PR−).

Adjusted Hazard Ratios for Overall Survival Comparing SLND-Alone vs ALND Groups Disease-Free Survival Disease-free survival (Figure 2) did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The 5-year disease-free survival was 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) for the SLND-alone group and 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) for the ALND group (P = .14). The unadjusted HR comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.58-1.17), and the HR adjusted for adjuvant treatment and age was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.62-1.25) (Table 3). The adjusted HRs comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group in the other multivariable models ranged from 0.84 to 0.89 (Table 3), all similar to the unadjusted rate of 0.82. Locoregional recurrence and its correlates have been previously reported.31 The 5-year rates of local recurrence were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.3%) in the SLND-alone group and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-5.2%) in the ALND group (P = .11). Locoregional recurrence–free survival at 5 years was 96.7% (95% CI, 94.7%-98.6%) in the SLND-alone group and 95.7% (95% CI, 93.6%-97.9%) in the ALND group (P = .28). View this table: Download as PowerPoint Slide Table 3. Adjusted Hazard Ratios for Disease-Free Survival Comparing SLND-Alone vs ALND Groups Surgical Morbidities Paresthesias, shoulder pain, weakness, lymphedema, and axillary web syndrome are recognized morbidities of ALND.7,8,9 As previously reported,10 the rate of wound infections, axillary seromas, and paresthesias among patients in the Z0011 trial was higher for the ALND group than for the SLND-alone group (70% vs 25%, P < .001). Lymphedema in the ALND group was significantly more common by subjective report (P < .001) and also tended to be higher by objective assessment of arm circumference. These findings are in accordance with other randomized comparisons of SLND with vs without ALND.32,33 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous Section Next Section COMMENT In the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 randomized trial, ALND did not significantly affect overall or disease-free survival of patients with clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and a positive SLN who were treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field whole-breast radiation therapy. These survival findings are consistent with those of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B04 trial, in which women with clinically negative nodes were randomized to treatment by radical mastectomy, total mastectomy plus nodal irradiation, or total mastectomy with delayed ALND if nodal recurrence was observed.4 Initially and at each interim analysis for up to 25 years of follow-up, no statistically significant survival differences were observed between any of the groups. For patients treated in the modern era, the relevance of the B04 study, which included patients with larger tumors undergoing mastectomy without adjuvant systemic therapy, is uncertain, because an axillary recurrence after SLND in patients with a lower risk of death from distant disease might negatively affect survival. The findings from Z0011 document the high rate of locoregional control achieved with modern multimodality therapy, even without ALND. In contrast to B04, in which about 40% of patients in the radical mastectomy group were node-positive and the same number in the total mastectomy group were assumed to be node-positive and 5-year overall survival was only about 60%, 100% of patients in Z0011 had nodal involvement; yet the 5-year overall survival was more than 90%. Furthermore, a 19% rate of axillary first failure was observed in B04,4 whereas the axillary nodal recurrence rate was only 0.9% in the SLND-alone group in Z0011.31 The excellent local and distant outcomes in this study highlight the effects of multiple changes in breast cancer management during the interval between the 2 studies. These changes, which include improved imaging, more detailed pathological evaluation, improved planning of surgical and radiation approaches, and more effective systemic therapy, emphasize the need for ongoing reevaluation of “standard” local therapy. The well-documented morbidity from ALND has led other investigators to explore alternative methods of axillary treatment in patients with clinically negative nodes, including radiation, systemic therapy, and axillary observation. These have consistently demonstrated low axillary failure rates, with no significant differences in survival.34,35 The International Breast Cancer Study Group trial of ALND vs observation is noteworthy because more than half of the patients did not receive breast or axillary radiotherapy. In women 60 years and older receiving adjuvant tamoxifen but no axillary treatment, the rate of axillary recurrence was only 3%, and overall survival was 73% at a median follow-up of 6.6 years.36 The low rates of locoregional recurrence at 5 years and the nearly identical overall and disease-free survival between treatment groups in Z0011 would suggest that differences in survival between study groups are unlikely to emerge with longer follow-up, because ALND would only affect survival by virtue of improved locoregional control. In the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview, statistically significant survival differences between treatments at 15 years were seen only when differences in locoregional recurrence between treatments were greater than 10% at 5 years.6 Axillary recurrence is usually an early event, occurring at a median of 14.8 months in B04; in that trial, only 7 of 68 axillary recurrences occurred more than 5 years after study entry.4 Greco et al37 reported that median time to axillary recurrence was 30.6 months for 401 patients who underwent breast-conserving procedures and radiation therapy with no axillary surgery. Recent reports of long-term follow-up in randomized trials confirm these findings.38,39 Because the total locoregional recurrence rate in the Z0011 SLND-alone group at 5 years is only 2.5% compared with 3.6% in the ALND group, it is unlikely that further follow-up would result in enough additional recurrences to generate a clinically meaningful survival difference between groups. The absolute difference in 5-year overall survival between the treatment groups in Z0011 is 0.7%, numerically favoring the SLND-alone group. The HR for overall survival comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.10). The worst HR (1.10) is less than 1.3, which was hypothesized as the inferiority margin threshold. In essence, this means that the 5-year overall survival for the SLND-alone group might be as low as 90.3% if the true 5-year overall survival for the ALND group was 91.8% and the HR as high as 1.10. Most importantly, there is no suggestion that rates of locoregional recurrence, the mechanism by which variations in local therapy result in survival differences, differ between groups to the extent needed to produce survival differences or are likely to do so in the future. Taken together, this suggests that contemporary women may sustain the morbidity of ALND without any meaningful improvement in survival rates. Limitations of the study, such as failure to achieve target accrual and possible randomization imbalance favoring the SLND-alone group, must be considered. However, even in high-risk women (ER−/PR−) in Z0011, preliminary analysis suggests no effect of elimination of ALND on survival. Despite limitations of the Z0011 trial, its findings could have important implications for clinical practice. Examination of the regional nodes with SLND can identify hematoxylin-eosin–detected metastases that would indicate a higher risk for systemic disease and the need for systemic therapy to reduce that risk. Results from Z0011 indicate that women with a positive SLN and clinical T1-T2 tumors undergoing lumpectomy with radiation therapy followed by systemic therapy do not benefit from the addition of ALND in terms of local control, disease-free survival, or overall survival. The only additional information gained from ALND is the number of nodes containing metastases. This prognostic information is unlikely to change systemic therapy decisions and is obtained at the cost of a significant increase in morbidity.10 The only rationale for ALND in these patients would be if the finding of additional nodal metastases would result in changes in systemic therapy. Because current guidelines do not support differences in adjuvant systemic therapy based on the number of positive lymph nodes, except in some uncommon select subgroups,40 ALND does not appear to be warranted in this patient population. The Z0011 trial did not include patients undergoing mastectomy, those undergoing lumpectomy without radiotherapy, those treated with partial-breast irradiation, those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and those receiving whole-breast irradiation in the prone position, in which the low axilla is not treated. In those patients, ALND remains standard practice when SLND identifies a positive SLN. However, ALND may no longer be justified for women who have clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and hematoxylin-eosin–detected metastasis in the SLN and who are treated with breast-conserving surgery, whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Implementation of this practice change would improve clinical outcomes in thousands of women each year by reducing the complications associated with ALND and improving quality of life with no diminution in survival.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery turns standard medical practice on its head. Surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years, believing it would prolong women’s lives by keeping the cancer from spreading or coming back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, researchers report that for women who meet certain criteria — about 20 percent of patients, or 40,000 women a year in the United States — taking out cancerous nodes has no advantage. It does not change the treatment plan, improve survival or make the cancer less likely to recur. And it can cause complications like infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm that ranges from mild to disabling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Removing the cancerous lymph nodes proved unnecessary because the women in the study had chemotherapy and radiation, which probably wiped out any disease in the nodes, the researchers said. Those treatments are now standard for women with breast cancer in the lymph nodes, based on the realization that once the disease reaches the nodes, it has the potential to spread to vital organs and cannot be eliminated by surgery alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts say that the new findings, combined with similar ones from earlier studies, should change medical practice for many patients. Some centers have already acted on the new information. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan changed its practice in September, because doctors knew the study results before they were published. But more widespread change may take time, experts say, because the belief in removing nodes is so deeply ingrained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is such a radical change in thought that it’s been hard for many people to get their heads around it,” said Dr. Monica Morrow, chief of the breast service at Sloan-Kettering and an author of the study, which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The National Cancer Institute paid for the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of mastectomy, removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after lumpectomy and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could “get it all” — eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors — because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy — and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the initial node biopsy, the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one lymph node removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said: “It shouldn’t come as a big surprise, but it will. It’s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don’t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University, and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, “I have a feeling we’ve been doing a lot of harm.”\n", "answers": ["A new study has the potential to make breast cancer treatment easier for a sizable number of women, the New York Times reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men took the backpack \"because they thought it was of some value,\" walked for a bit, then saw wires and a pipe, dropped the package and notified Elizabeth police, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bollwage told reporters the explosives were originally found in the trash can about 300 feet from the door of Willy's Place near the train station in the city of about 125,000, which is also the Union County seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" Bollwage told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bollwage said the Elizabeth devices did not contain a cell phone or any other electronic detonators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the items were found, Union County's Bomb Squad was called in and used a drone to examine the backpack, the mayor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The drone indicated it could be suspicious and it could be a live bomb,\" Bollwage said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked if he ever thought Elizabeth would be the target of such an attack, Bollwage said he was not sure the city was the intended target and that the devices could have instead been dumped by a person who realized he or she was being investigated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not willing to admit Elizabeth is a terror target,\" Bollwage said. \"Because of the location, it's very possible someone was trying to get rid of package as opposed to set it off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bollwage said FBI agents are reviewing surveillance footage from the restaurant near the trash can where the backpack was first found by the two men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reached after midnight on Monday morning, a spokesman for the FBI in Newark, Special Agent Michael Whitaker, said only that his agency had responded to the scene, and declined to provide any details of the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI asked anyone with information to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police cordoned off the station and many streets surrounding it. The investigation halted train service on the busy Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coastline commuter rail lines. Later, officials said service would resume at 5:30 Monday, with delays expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tickets and passes on both rail lines are being cross-honored on PATH along with NJ Transit and private buses, according to the transit agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amtrak service was also suspended near Elizabeth, spokesman Craig Schulz said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and will resume service as soon as it is safe to do so,\" the spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Approximately 2,400 Amtrak passengers were impacted by the service suspension, the spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Robust security measures are in place at stations, on trains and along the tracks and Amtrak Police remain in close contact with local, state and federal partner agencies to coordinate and share intelligence information,\" the statement said. \"At this time there are no specific or credible threats against Amtrak.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not immediately clear if the Elizabeth incident was linked to a bombing Saturday night in New York City that injured 29 people or another pipe-bomb style device that went off near a military charity race in Seaside Park also on Saturday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You will see a very substantial NYPD presence this week, bigger than ever,” de Blasio said during a press conference just after noon Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR De Blasio said all 29 victims of the explosion, which rocked a crowded and popular Manhattan neighborhood, have been released from area hospitals. Another possibly-explosive device discovered blocks away was safely removed early Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sources told CBS New York Sunday evening that the FBI made a car stop on the Belt Parkway near the Verrzano Bridge. There are several people in custody. It’s unknown the reasons for the car stop or whether its in regards to Chelsea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI said in a statement that at 8:45 p.m., the FBI and NYPD conducted a traffic stop of a vehicle of interest in the investigation into Saturday’s bombing in Manhattan. No one has been charged with any crime. The investigation is continuing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials said there’s no evidence currently linking the explosion to terrorism, and said the incident appeared to be unrelated to a pipe bomb explosion earlier Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey near the start line of a charity run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We know from everything we’ve seen so far that this was an intentional act. Again we do not know the nature of it, we do not know the motivation,” de Blasio said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a press conference earlier on Sunday morning, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had spoken with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and so far the explosives did not appear to be similar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Atlhough Cuomo on Sunday referred to the explosion as an act of “terrorism,” NYPD, FBI and other NYC officials were hesitant to use the phrase until a suspect or motive could be established. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Rep. Peter King, R- N.Y., said it could still well turnout to be a terrorist act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We had the Times Square bombing back in New York in 2011,” King said. “It took several days before we realized that that was coming out of the Taliban and Pakistan.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roselyn Olivares, who lives on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, said the blast did damage to her fourth floor apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My bedroom window was blown out,” she told 1010 WINS Radio. “We didn’t know what it was.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the U.N. General Assembly, New York typically increases police presence, but officials said Sunday law enforcement would be on particularly high alert in the city this week, as a result of the explosion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cuomo said 1,000 additional law enforcement officers were being deployed after the Saturday night blast in Chelsea, a primarily residential neighborhood on Manhattan’s west side that’s known for its art galleries and large gay population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, told CBS News’ Pamela Falk that more than 14,000 passes have been issued for dignitaries, their aides, and additional press for the U.N. General Assembly this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Security inside the United Nations is being assessed on a constant basis. Outside of the UN, security is the responsibility of the host country. We receive great cooperation and appreciate the support from the federal authorities and the NYPD throughout the year, and especially during the General Assembly to keep staff, delegates and visitors safe,” Dujarric said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was unclear who was behind the blasts in New York and New Jersey, and what motivated them. A law enforcement source tells CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that while no suspect nor motive has been established, terrorism has not definitively been ruled out as a possibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second device that officers investigated four blocks from the Chelsea scene was a pressure cooker with a cellphone and wires attached, and was found in a plastic bag. The device was removed with a robot and taken to a department firing range in the Bronx. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An NYPD official tells CBS News they were successfully able to pull the device apart. They did not have to blow it up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two law enforcement sources tell CBS News the device that exploded appears to also have been a pressure cooker bomb. One source said officials believe it was set off with a cellphone signal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill said at Sunday afternoon press conference that a bomb squad was still investigating the device. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have one person on surveillance video seen planting at least one of bombs in Manhattan, CBS News learned Sunday night. This individual has not been identified. Authorities stress that he may or may not be the person who did this, but it is a solid lead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source tells CBS News that they have not yet definitively made the connection between the blast in Chelsea, and the blast in Seaside. However, the source says both the Chelsea bombs and the Seaside Park bombs use cellphones as triggers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Times reports the second device appeared to be similar to the devices used in the Boston Marathon bombing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Homemade pressure cooker bombs were used in the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013 that killed three people and injured more than 260. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The explosion that rocked a bustling Chelsea neighborhood appeared to have come from a construction toolbox in front of a building. Photos from the scene show a twisted and crumpled black metal box. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a very dense area, the whole block is restaurants and residences and this area on a warm Saturday night is an area swarming with people,” New York City Councilman Cory Johnson told CBS New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blast happened on West 23rd Street, in front of a residence for the blind, near a major thoroughfare with many restaurants and a Trader Joe’s supermarket. Witnesses said the explosion at about 8:30 p.m. blew out the windows of businesses and scattered debris in the area. Officials said no evacuations were necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday, a team of five FBI agents searched an Uber driver’s vehicle that had been damaged in the Manhattan blast, ripping off the door panels inside as they examined it for evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The driver, MD Alam, of Brooklyn, had just picked up three passengers and was driving along 23rd Street when the explosion occurred, shattering the car’s windows and leaving gaping holes in the rear passenger-side door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was so loud,” the 32-year-old Alam said. “I was so scared. There was a loud boom and then smoke and I just drove away.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alam said he hit the gas and tried to take his passengers to their destination in Queens, but pulled over along Madison Avenue and 39th Street. He went to a local police precinct to file a report for his insurance company and police contacted the FBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York City subway routes were affected by the explosion, which rattled some New Yorkers and visitors on the heels of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Cuomo said mass transit in the area would resume as early as Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Los Angeles, Police Chief Charlie Beck asked Emmys attendees to remain vigilant in the wake of explosions in New York City and New Jersey. Beck said there were no known credible threats to security in Los Angeles, but those attending Sunday’s Emmys in downtown Los Angeles were asked to report any suspicious activity.\nPassage 3:\nELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) — A suspicious device found in a trash can near a New Jersey train station exploded early Monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said that the FBI was working to disarm one of five devices found in the same bag, which was discovered in a trash can by two men around 8:30 p.m. Sunday, near the Elizabeth train station on New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor rail line. The men had reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package, Bollwage said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was no immediate report of injuries or damage. A message left with the FBI wasn't immediately returned. The mayor warned that other explosions were expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NJ Transit service was suspended early Monday between Newark Liberty Airport and Elizabeth, and New Jersey-bound Amtrak trains were being held at New York Penn Station, officials said, while New York-bound Amtrak trains were being held in Trenton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Train passengers reported being stuck on Amtrak and NJ Transit trains for hours Sunday night, while some trains moved in reverse to let passengers off at other stations. Amtrak said 2,400 passengers were affected and that trains were being brought into other stations for people to get other transportation. It wasn't clear when the Elizabeth station would be open, a threat to cause major issues on the Monday morning commute into New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery of the suspicious package comes a day after an explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people, and an unexploded pressure-cooker device was found four blocks away. Also Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded about an hour from the Elizabeth train station in Seaside Park, New Jersey, forcing the cancellation of a military charity 5K run. Officials said it didn't appear that those two incidents were connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators didn't immediately comment on whether they thought the Elizabeth incident was connected to either of the two blasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bollwage said that he wasn't willing to say that Elizabeth had become a target, and that it was possible that someone worried about the authorities was trying to get rid of the package. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm extremely concerned for the residents of the community, but more importantly extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt,\" Bollwage said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This story has been corrected to show that the bag was found around 8:30 p.m., not 9:30 p.m.\nPassage 4:\nThe discovery of a bag containing explosive devices near a train station in Elizabeth was causing big headaches for commuters. NJ Transit service was partially suspended and Amtrak trains weren't able to travel from New York Penn Station to Newark Penn Station. Checkey Beckford reports. (Published Monday, Sept. 19, 2016) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What to Know Five people were taken into custody by the FBI Sunday for questioning after a traffic stop on the Verrazano Bridge NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As that was happening, a suspicious package was discovered at the Elizabeth train station in New Jersey NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trains were halted between EWR and Elizabeth, halting traffic on the busy North East Corridor ahead of the morning rush NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Commuting will be a struggle Monday for thousands of NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters as authorities continue their investigations into a series of explosions and incendiary devices in New York City and New Jersey over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Jersey Transit warned trains on multiple lines were subject to delays of up to an hour amid the ongoing police investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Service on all Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast lines resumed Monday morning. It had been suspended in both directions late Sunday night after a device found inside a bag near the NJ Transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, exploded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NJ Transit said commuters should expect residual delays and service changes as the investigation in Elizabeth continues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All New Jersey-bound Amtrak trains were also held at New York Penn Station after the bag was discovered in Elizabeth, hampering travel on the busy North East Corridor. Trains began moving out of New York Penn around 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amtrak said that Acela Express, Northeast Regional and other services will operate Monday with some schedule modifications. The railroad service said that passengers should expect cancellations and delays throughout the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Manhattan, West 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues reopened by 9 p.m. Monday after police spent the weekend investigating the blast there. Other roads that were initially closed for the investigation -- including parts of Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and West 14th to West 23rd streets -- were reopened earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PATH trains are skipping 23rd Street in Manhattan. PATH will cross-honor NJT passengers at NWK, HOB, WTC and 33rd Street stations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 1 train has resumed making normal stops at its 23rd and 28th street stations, though the northeast stairway at the 23rd Street station remains closed, according to @NYCTSubway. The E and F trains are also stopping again at 23rd Street stations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Due to the 23rd Street closure, MTA buses M5, M7, M23 and X1 are detoured in both directions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news of the suspicious bag at the Elizabeth station in New Jersey was first reported late Sunday night, around the same time that the FBI said it had taken five people from Elizabeth, New Jersey into custody for questioning after a traffic stop on the Verrazano Bridge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI confirmed that the 8:45 p.m. Verrazano traffic stop was part of an investigation into Saturday's bombing in Manhattan that injured 29 people. None of them have been charged with a crime and the investigation is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The devices in Elizabeth apparently looked similar to what detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday morning ahead of a race. No one was injured in the Seaside Park explosion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hunt for Clues in 'Intentional' Chelsea Explosion\nPassage 5:\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday were looking into whether an Afghan-born American citizen charged with carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey acted alone or had help as the city’s top federal public defender sought access to the suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police in New York City said they had not yet been permitted by doctors to speak to Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, who was arrested on Monday after being wounded in a gunfight with police in Linden, New Jersey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rahami has been charged with wounding 31 people in a bombing in New York on Saturday that authorities called a “terrorist act.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a photo of two men who found a second, unexploded pressure cooker device they say Rahami left in a piece of luggage in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men, who took the bag but left the improvised bomb on the street are not suspects, officials said, but investigators want to interview them as witnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As far as whether he’s a lone actor, that’s still the path we are following, but we are keeping all the options open,” William Sweeney, the FBI’s assistant director in New York, told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rahami is also charged with planting a bomb that exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, but did not injure anyone and planting explosive devices in his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, which did not detonate. He faces charges from federal prosecutors in both states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal prosecutors portray Rahami, who came to the United States at age 7 and became a naturalized citizen, as embracing militant Islamic views, begging for martyrdom and expressing outrage at the U.S. “slaughter” of Muslim fighters in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators were also probing Rahami’s history of travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and looking for evidence that he may have picked up radical views or trained in bomb-making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both government and pro-Taliban sources in Pakistan on Wednesday said they had no knowledge of Rahami having met with prominent people connected to the Taliban or other religious groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors plan to move Rahami to New York from the New Jersey hospital where he is being treated as soon as his medical condition allows, said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Policemen place in an ambulance a man they identified as Ahmad Khan Rahami, who is wanted for questioning in connection with an explosion in New York City, in Linden, New Jersey, in this still image taken from video September 19, 2016. REUTERS/Anthony Genaro NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DEFENSE LAWYER DEMANDS COURT APPEARANCE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rahami’s wife met with U.S. law enforcement officials while in the United Arab Emirates and voluntarily gave a statement, a law enforcement official said on Wednesday. She was not in custody. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A New Jersey U.S. congressman previously said Rahami had emailed his office in 2014 for help in getting her a visa to enter the United States from Pakistan when she was pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rahami’s defense attorney, David Patton, on Wednesday demanded that his first court appearance to be scheduled as soon as possible, even if it occurs in his hospital bed, saying that the defendant had a constitutional right to a lawyer and a court appearance within two days of his arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill told a news conference that investigators had not yet received doctors’ clearance to interview Rahami, adding, “That may happen in the next 24 hours, pending the doctors’ approval.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal prosecutors in New York noted that while they had filed charges against Rahami, he remained in the custody of state officials in New Jersey, who initially arrested him after Monday’s gunfight. They said that makes Patton’s request for access premature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patton, in a subsequent filing, shot back that such delays were unacceptable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Rahami was arrested more than 48 hours ago. His bail in New Jersey was set without any appointment of counsel or court appearance. He still has not been provided counsel. He does not have a scheduled court appearance in New Jersey until next week,” Patton said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slideshow (21 Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attacks in New York and New Jersey were the latest in a series in the United States inspired by Islamic militant groups including al Qaeda and Islamic State. A pair of ethnic Chechen brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 at the 2013 Boston Marathon with homemade pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in this weekend’s attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rahami, in other parts of a journal that prosecutors said he was carrying when he was arrested, praised “Brother” Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader slain in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan; Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim cleric and leading al Qaeda propagandist who was killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen; and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, house Homeland Security Committee chairman, told CNN that Rahami’s writings in a journal showed that his actions had been inspired by Islamic State as “his guidance came from the lead ISIS spokesman.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What that tells me as a counterterrorism expert that now we can definitively say this was an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack.”\nPassage 6:\n(CNN) Three attacks in 12 hours -- explosions on New York and New Jersey streets and a stabbing spree in a Minnesota mall -- combined for tumultuous weekend, afflicting injury and moments of alarm and leaving investigators scrambling for answers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Monday's sunrise approached, New York City ramped up security not only because of the bombing that injured 29 people in Manhattan and the discovery of a mysterious device blocks away, but also because world leaders are gathering at the United Nations for debate at the General Assembly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions abounded about Saturday's incidents, including: What, exactly, were the motives? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were hints in the Minnesota attack, with ISIS claiming that a man who injured nine people in stabbings in St. Cloud before an off-duty police officer killed him was a \"soldier of the Islamic State,\" though there was no immediate evidence he'd had contact with the terror group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A recap of the three incidents, all of which authorities said were being investigated as possible terror acts: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Around 9:30 a.m. in Seaside Park, New Jersey, one of three pipe-bomb-type devices that were wired together detonated in a garbage can, tearing apart the container but injuring no one; the other two didn't explode, federal law enforcement officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials said the blast probably was timed to disrupt a Marine Corps charity run, but no one was near the blast because registration problems delayed the race. Officials said the device had a cell phone as a timer; no one has claimed responsibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Around 8:30 p.m. in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion rocked 23rd Street and 6th Avenue, injuring 29 people and sending panicked people scrambling for cover. A law enforcement source said it came from a device planted in or near a dumpster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators found an intact pressure cooker blocks away. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the pressure cooker and the exploded device in Chelsea were similar, and other officials said both devices had cell phones as apparent timers. No one has claimed responsibility. Investigators found similarities between the explosives used in both states, according to multiple law enforcement officials, but authorities said they have not concluded the incidents are linked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • About 9 p.m. ET (8 p.m. CT) in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a man wearing a security uniform entered Crossroads mall, made a reference to Allah and stabbed nine people before an off-duty police officer shot him dead, police said. He asked at least one person whether he or she was a Muslim before he attacked, witnesses said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Mayor: Off-duty officer who shot attacker a hero Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mayor: Off-duty officer who shot attacker a hero 01:18 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police did not immediately release the attacker's name, and CNN hasn't independently verified ISIS' claim that he was linked to the group. St. Cloud's police chief said investigators were \"trying to get to the bottom of his motivations.\" No official has suggested ties between the mall attack and the explosions in New Jersey and New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NYC police presence 'bigger than ever' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Yorkers already were going to see a big police presence in the city because of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, about a 2-mile drive from the Chelsea blast site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An explosion in New York City injured 29. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Saturday's explosion means the police presence will be even more intense, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You should know you will see a very substantial NYPD presence this week -- bigger than ever,\" he said NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Cuomo said 1,000 additional New York State Police officers and National Guard troops will be deployed to patrol bus terminals, airports and subway stations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'This is a new era' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday's incidents follow a few other mass attacks that happened on US soil in the past year, including the deadly December shootings in San Bernardino, California, and the deadly June shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In both of those incidents, the attackers claimed an affinity for ISIS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Threat of Islamist attacks alone has kept federal investigators busy -- the FBI has said that it is mounting 900 investigations of suspected Islamist militants in all 50 states. FBI Director James Comey said in July that ISIS terrorists may be dispersed in the West as the terror group loses territory in Iraq and Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Comey isn't worried just about Islamist terror threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our focus now is on a much more disparate threat that's hard to see -- unpredictable, motivated, and driven by people who are just disturbed,\" he said in an interview posted Friday on the FBI's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York isn't the only metropolis to take notice of Saturday's attacks. On the other coast, Los Angeles' police were gearing up for two high-profile events Sunday: the Emmy Awards and the Los Angeles Rams' first home game since their return from two decades in St. Louis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As you wake up this morning to the troubling events in New York and New Jersey, please rest assured we have been monitoring the situation throughout the night,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement released on Twitter. He said police had taken steps to ensure the Emmys and the football game would be safe, and asked people to be vigilant. Both events took place without incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US Rep. Charlie Rangel, a Democrat who represents Manhattan, told CNN that Saturday's attacks -- and a level of vigilance needed to combat them -- represent \"a new norm.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a new era, and everyone just has to be alert,\" he said Sunday.

As a precaution, local rail and bus service was suspended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After two men spotted the suspicious package, which had wires and a pipe but no apparent timing devices, they reported it to authorities. The FBI's bomb squad then deployed a robot to examine the devices. The suspicious package exploded after the bomb robot cut a wire in an effort to disarm the device. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities do not know if the Elizabeth explosion has ties to the Chelsea bombing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'The entire neighborhood is real scared' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many in Chelsea were rattled by Saturday's bombing.

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast—which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "length": 6707, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "43d11cc5e60d30b11191af188cbee9b4ed98d327b381d7ae"}

Her security detail suggests that it’s probably not a paparazzo because there’s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift’s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for “Wildest Dreams,” including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I’ve ever met. “I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,” she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, The Secret Conversations. Her premise for the video (co-starring Clint Eastwood’s son) is that—since social media did not exist in the ’50s—it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled A Girl Named Girl, and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. (It’s about a mother who wants a son but instead has a girl.) If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they’d never moved and if she’d never become an artist. “I would still be involved with music in my spare time,” she says. “But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.” She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for 1989. Antonoff’s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. “Oh, my God. Justin Timberlake?” Her surprise does not seem artificial. “Can I take this?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she’s driving to her house, but that she can’t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. “Have you ever seen the movie The Money Pit?” asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can’t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conversation lasts almost 15 minutes (which is a little weird, since I’m just sitting there beside her, openly taking notes). “You’re never going to get old,” Swift assures Timberlake. “That’s scientific fact. That’s medical.” Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he’s calling is because he wants to perform the song “Mirrors” with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. (Late in every concert, Swift brings a surprise guest onstage.) She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, “This is so crazy. This is so crazy.” She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why wouldn’t Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I’d have been much more surprised if he’d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing (and interpreting) how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who’d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is (indeed) “so crazy,” and what’s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So Taylor Swift is right again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you don’t take Swift seriously, you don’t take contemporary music seriously. With the (arguable) exceptions of Kanye West and Beyoncé Knowles, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel—she’s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as 1989 had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of Thriller. There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what’s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. (A 2011 New Yorker piece conceded that Swift’s reviews are “almost uniformly positive.”) She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There’s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It’s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it’s absolutely new. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even within the most high-minded considerations of Swift’s music, there is inevitably some analysis (or speculation) about her personal life. She’s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often (and not without justification), that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it’s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she’s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift clearly knows this is happening. But she can’t directly admit it, because it’s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She’s careful how she describes the process, because you don’t become who she is by describing things carelessly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I don’t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I’ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say—even if that isn’t true, and even if I don’t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I’ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I’m holding. So if you’re going to look at your life and say, “I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine”—this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it’s covered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But I’m not asking if it’s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I’m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Shake It Off” is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Have you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. Some of the things I write about on a song like “Blank Space” are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like I get drunk on jealousy but you’ll come back each time you leave, ’cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream. That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who’s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. “A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,” Swift says, “and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear ‘Blank Space’ and say, See, we were right about her. And at that point, I just figure if you don’t get the joke, you don’t deserve to get the joke.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s a long tradition of musicians expressing (or pretending to express) a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,” she recalls. “This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You’re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they’re 22. It’s fine, right?’ Nope. Not when you’re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there’s an overriding opinion that doesn’t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn’t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what’s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public’s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I’ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was She’s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good? And then in 2013, it was She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She’s boy-crazy. She’s a problematic person. It will probably be something else again this year.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “To me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I’m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How you view this level of consciousness is proportional to how you feel about Swift as a public figure. There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what’s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I used to watch Behind the Music every day,” she says. (Her favorite episode was the one about the Bangles.) “When other kids were watching normal shows, I’d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I’d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It’s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of 1989 is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label (the Nashville-based Big Machine) tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Even calling this record 1989 was a risk,” she says. “I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they’d all gotten together and decided, ‘We gotta talk some sense into her. She’s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.’ But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I’m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I’d read a review of [2012’s] Red that said it wasn’t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on 1989: an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I’d go into the label office, and they were like, ‘Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on ‘Shake It Off’ to service country radio?’ I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: ‘Let’s capitalize on both markets.’ No, let’s not. Let’s choose a lane.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like almost all famous people, Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she’s actively shaping the interview—optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed (even when that’s impossible). The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself (chin slightly down, brow slightly furrowed, timbre slightly deeper). The first way is how she talks when she’s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either (a) this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or (b) she can tell I’m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late in our lunch, I mention something that happened several years ago: By chance, I’d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift’s who offhandedly described her as “calculating.” This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See Taylor Swift’s Stunning GQ Photo Shoot NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the ’90s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (“the ectomorph model,” “the inventive indie artist,” “the informed third-wave feminist,” etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. “I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,” she says. “Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Popular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn’t go. Eventually, Swift’s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria’s Secret. “I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, We’re going to King of Prussia Mall. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song “The Best Day,” a connection she doesn’t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a (very real) memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So is it unfair to categorize Swift as calculating? Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her guileless would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art (“The lyrics are what I want you to focus on,” she asserts), so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over “Bad Blood,” a single universally assumed to be about Katy Perry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you’re writing about, aren’t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that “Bad Blood” is about a specific person, aren’t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, “Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.” And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him—or his family—to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, “That was about losing a friend.” And that’s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But nobody thinks that song is about a guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they would have. So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, “And that’s basically all you say,” she’s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy’s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking of accidents, here’s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I’m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the (comically undisguised) song “Innocent.” But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer’s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy. She’ll probably serve as Secretary of the Interior when he becomes president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift was lauded for handling West’s ’09 intrusion with grace and composure, but her personal memories of the event dwell on the bewilderment. When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. “When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. “I’m around people so much,” she says. “Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it’s 150 people. Before that, it’s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it’s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I’ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don’t feel lonely. I’ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That’s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical Behind the Music episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does she not see the irony? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oh, she sees it. But that doesn’t mean it’s real. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is such a thing as having enough,” she says in her non-TV voice. “You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I’m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn’t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who’s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you’re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is ‘Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.’ That’s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taylor Swift is 25. But she’s older than you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck Klosterman (@CKlosterman) is the author of eight books, most recently I Wear the Black Hat: Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined).\nPassage 3:\nIn GQ’s annual Eye Roll Issue, the human version of Nermal from Garfield talks about all sorts of shit including how “Bad Blood” isn’t about Katy Perry and how she hates when people think she’s calculating. That’s such a calculating thing for a calculating person to say! There’s also a little story she tells about the days when she wasn’t the popular Homecoming Queen of Celebrity High. When Taylor was younger and not famous, she invited a bunch of girls to the mall and they all said they had something else to do. So Taylor’s mom took her and when they strolled through the mall, she found all those girls shopping at Victoria’s Secret. I really hope that Taylor tracked down those girls who rejected her and went to their house one by one with her Victoria’s Secret model friends to say, “Big mistake! Big! HUGE!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During Chuck Klosterman’s GQ interview with Taylor, he brought up how he had dinner with a former acquaintance of her’s and that former acquaintance described her as calculating. (I’m going to take a wild guess and say that former acquaintance was Ed Droste of Grizzy Bear.) Chuck writes that it was the only time in their interview that Taylor seemed tripped up and flustered. Tay Tay can’t believe that anybody would ever think that she, a person who collects friends based on how many Instagram likes posting their picture will get her, is calculated. How dare all of you! She says “calculating” like it’s a bad thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode. “Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck also brought up how everyone thinks that “Bad Blood” is about one specific person (Katy Perry). Taylor says that when Rolling Stone asked her who that song was about, she only said it was about losing a friend. According to her, her policy is to never say who her songs are about, but she said that, because she didn’t want anyone to think it’s about an ex-boyfriend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck called her out and let her know that nobody thought it was about a dude: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But they would have. So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santo dios! It’s a pop song. She acts like she wrote the damn Da Vinci Code. We all know it’s about Katy Perry. Taylor Swift basically said it was about Katy Perry. Katy Perry thinks it’s about Katy Perry. If I played that song for my old auntie who barely knows english, she’d say, “Eso es Katy Perry.” The only reason why she called it “Bad Blood” is because her label thought that the title “Fuck That Cunt Katy Perry” was just a teensy bit off-brand for the album.\nPassage 4:\nThere’s a lot to unpack from Taylor Swift’s first-ever cover story for GQ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking with famed author Chuck Klosterman, the singer opens up about her personal life and how it intertwines with her career. Defending herself from claims that she’s “calculating” and her good deeds are “self-serving,” Swift argues that she’s more self-aware than manipulative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also says that, because all everyone seemingly wants to write about is her is her love life, she banned herself from the internet in 2013 despite telling her interviewer minutes later that she closely monitors what people say about her. Okay, Tay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CREDIT: GQ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are other things the 25-year-old wants you to know, including who “Bad Blood” is really about (even though Klosterman himself later admits her answer has a “more than a few molecules of bullshit”). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On not reading about herself online… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs. This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You’re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they’re 22. It’s fine, right?’ Nope. Not when you’re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there’s an overriding opinion that doesn’t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn’t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what’s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public’s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On why she may seem calculated to you… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When other kids were watching normal shows, I’d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I’d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It’s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Grizzly Bear’s Ed Droste claiming he had who “hand experience” of Swift’s alleged “calculating” ways… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On why she’s so obsessed with collecting friendships making her squad happen… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now. Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On outing who “Bad Blood” is about… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, “Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.” And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him—or his family—to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, “That was about losing a friend.” And that’s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On crying after Kanye West famously crashed her VMAs speech… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On loneliness… NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m around people so much. Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it’s 150 people. Before that, it’s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it’s 30 or 40 more people.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chloe Goins, will make a full statement to police over the attack, a chilling sexual assault she has described to MailOnline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The allegation is the latest to hit the comedian, 77, who has seen his reputation as one of America's most significant comedy figures eviscerated in recent weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is now facing more than 20 separate allegations of rape or sexual assault – many dating back 30 or 40 years - but until now all appeared to be covered by statutes of limitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Los Angeles Police Department has opened an inquiry into allegations that the star drugged and raped Judy Huth at the Playboy mansion in 1974 when she was aged just 15, but that had appeared to be covered by the statue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins, however, says she was attacked in 2008, well inside the statue of limitations in California.

However her case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Venue: Cosby has long been a regular at the Playboy Mansion in Beverley Hills, where Hugh Hefner, his longtime friend, has been holding parties since the 1960s NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She claims Cosby spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom in the Playboy mansion where he sexually assaulted her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins says she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In California sexual assault carries a maximum 48 months jail sentence, as well as a possible $10,000 fine, depending on mitigating and aggravating factors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins' lawyer has told MailOnline has already made contact with the LAPD and Goins will likely meet with detectives to give a statement in the coming days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins, a model and lap dancer originally from San Diego but currently working in Las Vegas, says she felt compelled to come forward to add her voice to the dozens of women who have already made allegations against Cosby, 78. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said reading some of the victim's accounts in the media brought back the chilling memories of that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This weekend Cosby broke his silence to say that he wants the 'black media' to 'stay neutral' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' Cosby told Page Six. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also praised his wife for her 'love and strength'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However he now faces fresh allegations of recent misconduct which are being made to the LAPD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Goins, now 24, said she was attacked after a girlfriend invited her to one of Hugh Hefner's infamous summer parties in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both were living in Las Vegas at the time and traveled to Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friends: Hefner and Cosby have been close since the 1960s but last weekend the Playboy creator issued a statement distancing himself from the comedian, saying of the allegations: 'The mere thought is saddening.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She recalls: 'My girlfriend got an invite to a Playboy party and asked me to go with her. I remember being excited about it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We stayed at the W Hotel in Hollywood which is one of my favorites and were both looking forward to the party. We got all dressed up, we were going to the Playboy mansion after all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was a wearing a cute little red dress and my friend was wearing a strapless tan dress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I remember we got to the house and it was like a bigger party so there was a lot going on, lots of girls wearing not very much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'They checked our ID at the door so I knew drinking was off limits.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins says the party was in full swing when they arrived at the mansion at around 11pm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within a few minutes of walking in they were introduced to Hugh Hefner himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We were running late but we were quickly introduced to Hef when we got there. It was the first time I had met him, I was excited and all focus was on him. Me and my friend were two cute blondes, he liked us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We were talking to Hef for a while and that's when Bill Cosby walked up. I kind of recognized him from TV, I know he was on a TV show where he played a family guy, but he was a little bit before my time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Hef introduced him as his good friend, they seemed really close. He seemed like a really nice guy, really funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We were talking, laughing and having fun.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police: Chloe Goins is to make a statement to detectives after her lawyer made contact with the Los Angeles Police Department. She said she feels all the woman affected by Cosby deserve 'justice' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under pressure: Cosby has now been accused by 25 women of attacking him. One also alleged that he also attacked 12 Playboy Bunnies who have not come forward in public NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the conversation began to flow Goins remembers Cosby giving her lots of attention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then when Hef was in the middle of telling a story, Cosby slipped away and came back with two drinks for the girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins said: 'He kind of just left and we were talking and he came back with drinks. He gave me a vodka mixer I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I wasn't really supposed to drink because of my age but I was like, 'okay, cool'. I thought I'd got a drink on the side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I remember the drink being kind of strong but it didn't taste funny or anything like that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I think I finished most of it, I didn't set my glass down I was holding it the whole time.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then out of nowhere Chloe claims she began to feel 'dizzy' and unsteady on her feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Everything kind of went a little foggy, I started feeling sick to my stomach, and just dizzy,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I started telling my friend and I was like where's the bathroom, but I could tell my friend just wanted to hang out, we were still talking to Hef.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that point Hefner, realizing Goins wasn't feeling well, offered the use of one of his many spare bedrooms so she could lie down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins said: 'Then Bill offered to show me the room, he said he knew the way. He seemed nice and I don't remember feeling nervous or that it was weird. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He had his arm around me to show me the way and I did notice he had been paying me a little more attention than my friend, but never thought anything of it.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the last thing Goins remembers. She doesn't recall entering the room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She claims she woke up completely naked on a bed and alleges Cosby was hunched over her licking her toes. She knew she was still in the Playboy mansion because she could hear music playing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disturbingly, Goins said the then 70-year-old had his trousers around his ankles and was pleasuring himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was butt naked lying on my back on a bed and didn't have any idea where I was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attack: The Playboy Mansion is where Chloe Goins alleges she was molested in a bedroom by Cosby. She says she was first handed a drugged drink at a party by the comedian, who she thought was a kindly older man NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long association: Hefner and Cosby together. However the Playboy creator has distanced himself from his friend NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was in a bedroom and presumed it was in the mansion because I could hear music, I don't think it was Hef's room, it was just a nice room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I came to and remember seeing this big man crouched over me. It was Bill Cosby and he was at my feet, kind of licking and kissing them and I think he bit my toe as that's what woke me up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I kind of thank God for that because that's what woke me up and I came to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was shocked, I said, 'hey, what's going on', he didn't really say anything, didn't explain anything or give a reason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He jumped up, pulled his pants back up quickly and left. He had seen that I was alert and bolted out of there, I was left in the room by myself.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins said she is sure Cosby had been licking her breasts and groping her body as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: 'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He wasn't on my breasts when I woke, but I could feel, you know, the saliva on them and that he'd been licking on me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Party time: Another 2008 party at the mansion, with Hefner posing with female guests NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins says she doesn't think she had been raped or molested in any other way, but added: 'I can't be 100% sure what he did to me, I was completely out of it.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins admits she was in a daze when she came around in the bedroom but says she is sure that the man molesting her was comedy legend Bill Cosby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she hadn't been drinking that night other than the vodka drink Cosby had given her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also said she had not taken any kind of drugs or medication that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Someone spiked my drink, I have no doubt about that, it was my first drink of the night,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Cosby left the room Goins picked herself off the bed and got dressed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I found my dress but I couldn't find my panties anywhere, I don't know if he had them or not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I just got out of there as fast as I could and found my girlfriend downstairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'She looked at me and said I didn't seem right so she was like, 'let's go'. I think she could tell something was wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the way back to the hotel Chloe confided in her friend and told her what had happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I told her I was scared and didn't know what to do, I told her I didn't think I had been raped, but what happened to me wasn't right, at the very least he was groping and molesting me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'She consoled me and said she felt bad about it, but neither of us thought about telling anyone.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins said she had always wanted to be a model and singer from a young age and had aspired to appear in Playboy magazine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy victim: Former Playboy bunny Carla Ferrigno in circa 1980 in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. She claims Cosby assaulted her too NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Playboy victim: Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy Playmate in 1963, has come out to say Bill Cosby raped her as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We were young, we wanted to be Playboy models. I was scared about saying anything about what happened, especially as it was at the Playboy mansion because it's known for naughty stuff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I didn't want to get in trouble and maybe ruin my modeling career and nor did my friend as she was getting the invites to the parties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Bill Cosby was on TV and had a family man image, I thought to hurt that, he would come after me, try to ruin me.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unsurprisingly, Goins has never been back to the Playboy mansion since. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She says the experience changed her view of men and she finds it hard to trust. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself, but I saw all the women who had come forward, over 20 women and it grossed me out. I feel he needs to pay for it, he deserves to pay for it. I don't think he raped me so I am one of the lucky ones, but at the same time it was a f***ed up situation.' Chloe Goins NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins said: 'It's definitely messed up my sexuality and how I look at men, I have a very hard time trusting them, so yes it has traumatized me.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goins says she feels strongly that her and other women should have the courage to come forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I confided in a friend one night and he said I should come forward,' she explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I never really thought about it before, but I definitely want to give a statement to the police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself, but I saw all the women who had come forward, over 20 women and it grossed me out. I feel he needs to pay for it, he deserves to pay for it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Unlike many of those women, I don't think he raped me so I am one of the lucky ones, but at the same time it was a f***ed up situation.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The MailOnline has interviewed the friend who was with Goins at the Playboy mansion that night and she has confirmed Goins' version of events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The friend has asked not to be identified for this article. She said it was her who had invited Goins to the party in LA as her plus one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The friend, who is a few years older than Goins and was also an aspiring model, recalled: 'I had been to the mansion before and I invited Chloe this time. Through my friends we were talking with Hef and that's when Bill Cosby came over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He got us drinks and we were talking away and that's when Chloe started to feel unwell.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The friend says Hefner said he had a room which Goins could use to have a lie down. When she agreed to go to the room Cosby piped up and offered to show her where it was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The friend said: 'Even though I've been there a few times I don't know the mansion very well, but Bill Cosby seemed like he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He was being nice, he was very old, I thought he was taking care of her and Hef was good with it so I thought, 'wow, that's nice, he's a big celebrity and he's taking care of my friend'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The friend says 45 minutes to an hour passed but she never thought for a second Goins was in danger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'When she came back I knew there was something wrong, that's when I got her out of there and she told me what he did to her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I can't say what happened in that room, I wasn't there, but Chloe is a good friend.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: 'I feel bad about the whole thing, I'm the one who took her there. I feel bad because I didn't take care of her that night.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved Hugh Hefner last weekend NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby is currently being investigated by police over rape and drug allegations as one of his 20 accusers filed a police report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two detectives met with Judy Huth who claims the revered entertainer drugged and raped her at Hugh Hefner's mansion in 1974 when she was 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her accusation prompted Cosby's lawyers to file a lawsuit against Huth branding her a liar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But earlier this month the now-55-year-old responded by filing a police report which has sparked an LAPD investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huth is not the only accuser to claim she was attacked at the Playboy mansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten claimed she was given a drugged drink and raped by Cosby at the Playboy Club in Chicago in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Masten said she believes there are other former Bunnies who are too ashamed to come forward with their own stories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, Hugh Hefner released a statement about the allegations against Cosby and his personal connection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening,' Hefner said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.'

Playboy did not respond to a request for comment either.\n", "answers": ["A pair of witnesses support a woman's claim that Bill Cosby sexually abused her when she was 15, her lawyer says in a court filing. Lawyer Marc Strecker says he's seen pictures of his client, Judy Huth, at the Playboy Mansion with Bill Cosby in the 1970s, reports the Hollywood Reporter, information that matches her story. The filing doesn't offer specifics of what the witnesses know, the AP reports, but it does contain a psychologist's assessment that there's \"a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.\" Cosby, whose wife recently reacted to sex assault reports against him, isn't named in the psychological assessment. Meanwhile, yet another woman has come forward with allegations against Cosby, saying he drugged her at another Playboy Mansion party just six years ago, when she was 18. The timing means Cosby could still be criminally charged for the incident, the Hollywood Reporter notes. Chloe Goins plans to report the incident to police, the Daily Mail reports. She says she went to a party at the mansion, where she was introduced to Cosby, who gave her a drink, though she was underage. Feeling dizzy, she lay down in a room offered by Hugh Hefner, she says. Cosby allegedly guided her to the room, and when she woke up, she says, she was naked and he was licking her toes and masturbating. \"This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself,\" she says, but after so many women have come forward, \"I feel he needs to pay for it.\""], "length": 4603, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e241ae9461f4dee7da1f0cd651b3364af6804feb3e4cb2be"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nEven before the final results are known, there are more than a few indicators of how the evening will go on caucus night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Performance in key counties is revealing, and turnout, weather, and energy all play a role, too. As the evening progresses, there will also be signs of who has the endurance and support to go beyond Iowa once the voting is over — and who doesn’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Gearing up for caucus day Branstad: Iowa will winnow field NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Below is POLITICO’s list of five things to watch on caucus night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1) How high can Mitt go? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is the most important question of the evening, after months of a primary season that has been, in one way or another, all about Mitt Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former Massachusetts governor is, by all accounts, within striking distance of a win in Iowa. His crowds have been big and, just as important, energetic. Romney has seemed relaxed and confident about his chances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His backers have argued that he doesn’t need to win outright in order to be a winner, and that may prove true — but after closing-day polls showed him either winning or essentially tied for first place, anything lower than a close second will be tough to spin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further, if Romney can’t climb higher than the mid-20s — like Bob Dole in 1996 — it will keep alive the lingering questions about whether he can win over the leery Republican base. If he doesn’t get 28 percent, it will be a tough night for Romney, many insiders believe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2) Turnout, turnout, turnout NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Every election comes down to turnout and which side gets their supporters out. Tuesday night is no exception. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But not all ground games are equal. Romney and Ron Paul are the only two with the resources to turn out their supporters. Rick Santorum is running a shoestring operation based on momentum and, if he’s lucky, a late-breaking movement of the 2008 Mike Huckabee coalition in his direction — most notably social conservatives, evangelical voters, and home-schoolers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the weather is bad, the wide perception is that it will favor Paul, whose supporters are generally seen as more motivated than anyone else. The days leading up to the caucuses have been cold but dry (and manageable), meaning it’s possible that older voters could turn out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there has been a general enthusiasm gap among voters about a field that’s widely been panned as weak, and it remains to be seen if they’ll turn out in meaningful numbers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A major question is whether Paul’s army has the depth to compete — and whether the results will be treated as legitimate. If entrance polling shows a high number of Democrats and independents showed up and switched registration at the door to caucus for Paul, some top GOP-ers — already fearful of what a Paul victory would do to the legacy of the Iowa caucuses — will use that as evidence to suggest it’s not a true win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another question is whether any of the mega-churches mobilize for Santorum. And aside from that, there is the matter of the broader role of evangelical voters — will they dominate or will the more secular question of electability, which is Romney’s calling card, end up ruling the day? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If turnout is high, it’s seen as favoring Romney. Lower turnout would benefit Paul and Santorum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The turnout for the caucuses in 2008 was just under 120,000. Given the historic opportunity that Republicans see to beat President Barack Obama, anything less than that bar will add to the sense of restlessness that voters have about the field.\nPassage 2:\nLooking for news you can trust? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subscribe to our free newsletters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, after 13 debates, five different front-runners, and one unforgettable Gloria Allred press conference, the GOP presidential race will finally take its first, tentative steps toward clarity when upwards of 100,000 Iowans participate in the first-in-the-nation caucuses. A win on Tuesday isn’t exactly a ticket to the White House—no Republican caucus victor has gone on to win the presidency in the modern era—but a poor performance will almost certainly mark the end of the road for candidates like Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Sen. Rick Santorum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s how it works: As in any election, each voter is assigned to a precinct. A city like Waterloo would have multiple precincts; a flyspeck town in northwest Iowa might have just one (there are 1,774 in all). To participate, you show up at 7 p.m. and, after listening to speeches from fellow precinct members on behalf of their favored candidates, cast your ballot. Often, the speakers are respected community leaders whose words carry some weight; revered former Iowa State wrestling coach Jim Gibbons, for instance, told me he might speak on behalf of Santorum at his precinct. Democratic caucuses usually entail multiple ballots, but Republicans will vote just once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what should you watch for? Here’s a quick look at where the candidates stand, and how they’ve spent their final week before the big vote: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rick Santorum‘s final pitch to Iowa voters on Monday centered, as you would expect, on social issues. In Polk City, a farming community north of Des Moines, he was joined by 13 of the 21 Duggars—stars of the TLC reality show 19 Kids and Counting, and celebrities among conservative home-schoolers. It was folks like the Duggars who pushed Mike Huckabee over the top in 2008. By the numbers: Number of Iowa counties visited, out of 99: 99; number of Pizza Ranch franchises visited: 33; number of sleeves on his sweater of choice: 0; number of members of his immediate family, out of 9, who do not belong to the National Rifle Association: 1; percentage of supporters who say they will definitely show up for their caucus: 76. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As my colleague Gavin Aronsen reports, Ron Paul’s path to victory depends heavily on an army of college activists who flew into the Hawkeye State for winter break. Over the last few weeks, GOP opponents have hit him hard for publishing a racist and anti-Semitic newsletter in the late ’80s and early ’90s, but he’s managed to climb toward the top of the polls and has saturated the airwaves with flashy ads touting his pro-life credentials and Chevy-truck-style consistency. By the numbers: Number of babies delivered, according to his campaign literature: ~4,000; number of volunteers his campaign paid to house at the YMCA camp in Boone: ~500; percent decrease in favorability ratings over the final week of the campaign, according to Public Polling Polling: 21. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After her triumph at the Ames Straw Poll in August, Michele Bachmann looked like a serious contender for the Republican nomination, but her campaign has since fallen apart. Bachmann’s top Iowa aide switched his support to Ron Paul late last week in a move that underscored just how dysfunctional her organization in the state was. She says she’s in the race for the long haul, but barring a miracle, she’s pretty much done. By the numbers: Percentage of Iowa Republicans who said they’d caucus for her on July 10: 25; percentage of Iowa Republicans who said the same on January 1: 7; salary paid to former top strategist Ed Rollins, who now says he never would have worked for her if had just Googled her: $90,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rick Perry entered the race in August as a cocky, angry, anti-Obama candidate, but in the last week before the caucuses he’s resorted to taking shots—and cutting Jeopardy!-style radio ads—blasting Rick Santorum for helping secure funding for a teapot museum in North Carolina. He’s also more or less abandoned his original pitch as an economic miracle worker, and refocused his campaign around cracking down on gay and reproductive rights. Oh, and he still thinks gay sex should be illegal. By the numbers: Number of YouTube “dislikes” for his web ad, “Strong,” which lamented the end of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell: 731,755; number of likes: 24,813; points fallen in the polls in Iowa since August 21: 41. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a moment—a brief, eminently fascinating moment—Newt Gingrich looked like he might be the next Republican nominee. But after being swamped by negative ads from Ron Paul and a pro-Romney super-PAC, Gingrich has fallen back to earth hard. In Atlantic, Iowa, he was put on the defensive by his own supporters, who were concerned about his past support for global warming legislation, and his quasi-lobbying work for Freddie Mac (among other things). Gingrich is hoping outrage over a nonexistent EPA dust-regulation campaign will translate into support at the caucuses. By the numbers: Percentage points dropped from mid-December high-water mark: 20; number of days in between the launch of his campaign and the opening of a campaign office in Iowa: 183; date on which he told ABC’s Jake Tapper “I’m going to be the nominee”: January December 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then there’s Mitt Romney, who stands to all but lock up the Republican nomination with a win tonight. He’d be in pretty good shape with a loss, too, provided he at least outperforms a couple of key rivals. After initially keeping his distance from Iowa, the former Massachusetts governor poured considerable resources into the state over the last month of the race and plans to spend Tuesday night in Des Moines—a sign he expects to do well. As one Romney aide told Politico’s Roger Simon, “Iowa is about eliminating Gingrich and Perry without us having to spend a lot of money to do so.” By the numbers: Number of different Republican rivals he has trailed in the polls in Iowa at some point or another: 5; amount, in millions, spent by his super-PAC on ads targeting Newt Gingrich: $3.5; number of staffers it takes to hold his chair in place; 1; number of chemicals it takes to hold his hair in place: 0; percentage of Iowa voters who said they’d vote for him on July 11: 18; percent who said they’d vote for him on January 1: 18. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How to watch: Check this space, and Twitter, for updates. Gavin Aronsen (@garonsen) and I (@timothypmurphy) will be reporting from Iowa all day. By 10 p.m., we should have some idea of how the night will turn out.\nPassage 3:\nIowa became the stage for electrifying political theater on caucus eve as six GOP presidential candidates tried to make a last-minute connection with voters — all while hounded by hundreds of reporters who documented their every move in mini messages on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An expected 115,000 to 120,000 Iowa Republicans will record their choices tonight, GOP strategist John Stineman of West Des Moines estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The race has shaped up as a three-way dead heat among Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, according to The Des Moines Register’s Iowa Poll, conducted last week. But in a sign of how unsettled the race remains, 41 percent of those who have a first choice could still be persuaded to change their minds, the poll found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After 354 days of campaigning and more than 900 events, from the sweaty heat of the Iowa State Fair to skin-biting wind on Monday, the candidates are making their final arguments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They spent the final full day of campaigning before the first-in-the-nation vote in one last-gasp scramble, traveling from town to city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The words “mob scene” cropped up on Twitter throughout the day Monday to describe campaign events, but it was all relative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Callista and I are overwhelmed by the turnout this week,” tweeted Newt Gingrich, who drew 125 in Independence, then 225 in Walford. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A tiny cafe in Polk City, with a 49-person capacity, was quickly jammed for Santorum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our woman in IA, @ShushWalshe reports huge crowds at Santorum events. Like body-surfing huge. Get crushed in stampede huge,” ABC News’ @AmyEWalter tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 200 people were there, inside and outside, with a heavy load of reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a supply warehouse in Dubuque, 600 people were treated to “Eye of the Tiger” and “Born Free” as they waited to see Romney. And before more than 600 in Marion, an upbeat Romney declared: “We’re going to win this thing.” (Aides said later he was referring to the nomination.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The frenetic politicking will continue yet tonight. All 4,000 to 6,000 caucusgoers in Black Hawk County will gather under one roof — inside the UNI-Dome, Black Hawk County GOP Chairman Mac McDonald said. They will be divided into precincts to vote, with cameras from Fox News and CNN watching, he said. At least two candidates — Michele Bachmann and Gingrich — are expected to make personal pitches there about 6 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s how the final day before the Iowa caucuses went down, per Twitter and Des Moines Register reporters on the scene: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MITT ROMNEY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the road from Davenport (crowd of more than 300), one of Romney’s sons posted a Twitter photo of his father on the campaign bus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One of the vents on the bus is blowing cold air, so the mittster is duct taping it closed. Typical dad,” Tagg Romney tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney held rallies in four cities Monday, more campaigning than he’s done in Iowa on a single day since the 2008 cycle. The leader in the Iowa Poll is banking on his electability as a key to success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ron Breitbach, 51, of Dubuque, who caucused for Romney in 2008 and plans to do so again tonight, said: “He’s a problem-solver. He’s a leader.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breitbach, who owns a golf course and sports center, added: “He’s had so much success, and that’s what we need — we need someone with success for people to rally around.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RON PAUL NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul, who tweaks reporters for discounting him, descended into their lair Monday, the Marriott in downtown Des Moines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Ron Paul no fool,” tweeted @RogerPolitico. “Holding rally in hotel where 400 reporters are staying. I think all of them are here.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the bigfoots: Maggie Haberman of Politico, Joe Klein of Time, Soledad O’Brien of CNN, Dan Balz of the Washington Post, Carl Cameron of Fox News and Chris Matthews of MSNBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hundreds of people packed the hotel meeting room. Paul also drew 200 in Cedar Falls and 300 in Cedar Rapids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The TV camera crews beelined to the men in the Des Moines audience with heavy facial hair, tattoos and nose rings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aaron Lea, a 34-year-old painter from Des Moines with a grunge look, was pressed for interviews by three news agencies within minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You wouldn’t see people like this at a Bachmann or Mitt Romney rally, so it makes it a point of interest,” said Lea, an independent who will register as a Republican at the caucuses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Huffington Post’s @mlcalderone: “Sign at Paul’s Marriott event: ‘A Ron Paul win will discredit the mainstream media.’ ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul, a libertarian-leaning Texas congressman in second place in the Iowa Poll, often starts out his speeches by attacking the sacred cow of military spending and predicts a looming global financial collapse. On Monday, he boiled down his message to one word: liberty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RICK SANTORUM NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santorum, a Christian conservative from Pennsylvania, said at the Reising Sun Cafe in Polk City that he has raised more money in the last few days than he did in the last few months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Register’s latest Iowa Poll shows Santorum in third place, and rising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glenn Larson, a retired insurance underwriter from Clive, said Santorum represents his values: opposed to abortion, in favor of balancing the budget. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think he has been neglected and pushed aside by the liberal news media because they think he can beat Obama. They don’t want him to win,” Larson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santorum knocked his rivals a bit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We aren’t looking for a chief executive officer. We’re looking for a commander in chief,” said @JimAcostaCNN, who caught the jab at Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A bus with “Santorum for President” on the side appeared on the trail Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Chuck Laudner says when Rick Santorum saw the big bus festooned with his name … he said ‘I’m not paying for THAT!’ ” the Los Angeles Times’ @RAbcarian said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The RV is just on loan, driven by the Duggar family of Arkansas, anti-abortion activists with 19 children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santorum drew more than 200 at the Pizza Ranch in Boone, including Fox News’ Bret Baier. Later, 400 people chanted “We pick Rick!” at an Altoona Pizza Ranch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Young woman just fainted at Santorum event it is so crowded,” reported the Register’s @WilliamPetroski from Boone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWT GINGRICH NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gingrich, who last month declared certain victory in the nominating contest, talked again Monday about what he said was the unfair influence of negative ads in Iowa, and sounded a note of caucus defeat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Newt on IA: ‘I don’t think I’m going to win … I think the volume of negativity has done enough damage,’ ” @SarahH_CBSNJ tweeted as Gingrich talked to reporters in Independence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker, said: “It has nothing to do with governing America and solving our problems. It has everything to do with a very cheap and I think a very, very destructive model of politics, which is part of why Washington is sick today.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a later stop, he called the comment a mistake in wording, and pinned his hopes on the voters who say they could still change their minds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ed Larson and his wife, Janet, shook Gingrich’s hand, but they said they were not sure how they would caucus, since much of what happens depends on the consensus of their neighbors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Larsons downplayed Gingrich’s fourth-place ranking in the Iowa Poll. “It isn’t a concern because the polls are media-generated, and it changes every hour,” Ed Larson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RICK PERRY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Perry press corp traveling 375 miles on the last day of the Iowa bus tour, ending the day with the stop we’ve all waited for — Perry, IA,” tweeted ABC News’ @ArletteSaenz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Texas governor was introduced in Sioux City as the “next governor of the United States,” the crowd laughed. That got tweets with #oops hashtags. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perry, who is fifth in the Iowa Poll, made a final plea to the crowd of 100: Decide by conscience, not poll numbers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A voter asks Perry what she can do to make him seem more electable in next 30 hours,” the Register’s @JoshHafner tweeted. “Perry says #iacaucus is just ‘mile one’ in a marathon.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perry said his campaign has the organizational endurance to win the nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jan Hansen, a teacher from Le Mars, decided in Sioux City that she’s caucusing for him. “I hear people saying all the time we need to choose the candidate that we feel is the most electable,” she said. “Vote your heart. That’s what he said.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MICHELE BACHMANN NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Vote for a strong Iowa woman!” Bachmann told one backer amid a crush of people at Paula’s, a small restaurant in West Des Moines’ Valley Junction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You got a camera? We should take a picture. And then go home and Facebook it. Tell everybody to come out and caucus,” the Minnesota congresswoman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crowd was in the dozens rather than hundreds. A team of 22 juniors and seniors from Blake School in Minneapolis was on a school-sponsored trip to witness the caucuses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mostly Obama fans. No love for hometown Bachmann,” messaged the Register’s @JasonNoble1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bachmann, who had a horde of reporters turn up (Tucker Carlson, Andrea Mitchell and David Brooks),wandered to the Diggity Dog puppy treat shop, where her husband, Marcus, bought gifts for the family dog, Boomer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bachmann was up at dawn for TV appearances on “The Early Show” on CBS and “Morning Joe” on MSNBC. She ended her day with a 9 p.m. rally at campaign headquarters in Urbandale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing on a pickup truck tailgate, Bachmann thanked perhaps 150 volunteers for their work on her behalf.

But Waterloo is the city where Michele Bachmann was born — and it might also be said to be the place where her campaign went off the rails after Rick Perry outshined her at the county GOP dinner there the day after the Ames Straw Poll. In 2008, it was Mike Huckabee territory, with the Arkansas governor winning 35 percent to Romney’s 27 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dallas County NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A suburb of Des Moines, Dallas County is Iowa’s fastest-growing county. Mitt Romney and Huckabee battled to a near-tie here in 2008 — just 4 votes separated the two candidates, with Romney squeaking to victory. That made Dallas County something of an anomaly, since it was the only county in the Des Moines metro area to vote for Romney over Huckabee. Caucus turnout tends to be very high here; in 2008, it posted one of the highest turnout levels in the state at 30 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dubuque County NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was Romney country in 2008, a place where he ran strong (41 percent) and Huckabee ran poorly (15 percent) — it was the only county in the state where the Arkansas governor failed to finish either first or second. But northeastern Iowa is the most heavily Roman Catholic part of the state, and the city of Dubuque is also home to a large concentration of Catholics who might find the candidacies of Rick Santorum and converted Catholic Newt Gingrich appealing. Still, if Romney’s not winning here, he’s probably in trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson County NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even this liberal enclave, home to Iowa City and the University of Iowa, matters to the outcome Tuesday evening: It’s still home to more Republicans that most counties in Iowa. Four years ago, it handed Romney a 360-vote victory, and there’s no reason he can’t carry it again. But keep an eye on Ron Paul — his anti-war and anti-establishment views are popular with college students and he ran 5 percentage points higher than his statewide average here in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Linn County NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Home to Cedar Rapids, the second-largest city in Iowa after Des Moines, Linn County counts healthy contingents of both moderates and social conservatives. Like much of eastern Iowa, this was Romney turf in 2008: He captured 31 percent here, 6 percentage points above his statewide average, while Huckabee won 26 percent, 8 points below his statewide performance.\n", "answers": ["Tonight’s the night!

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marburg virus was first identified in 1967, when 31 people became sick in Germany and Yugoslavia in an outbreak that was eventually traced back to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then the virus has appeared sporadically, with just a dozen outbreaks on record, many -- including the current situation -- involving just a single patient. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. The death rate runs as high as 80 percent, although it was significantly lower in the initial outbreak when patients were cared for in relatively modern, European hospitals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most recent outbreak, also in Uganda, in 2012, killed four out of 15 patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I mention this, because oftentimes in public health, what gets noticed is what happens and it's hard to see what doesn't happen,\" Frieden continued, noting that there have so far been no additional cases. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa.\"\nPassage 5:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marburg virus is closely related to Ebola. (C. Bickel/Science Translational Medicine) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 30-year-old hospital technician died of the Marburg virus this weekend in Uganda, health officials there announced Sunday. Marburg, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever. It's rare but severe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to NBC's Monday report, officials in Uganda have quarantined about 80 people who came into contact with the victim, one of whom — the man's brother — has developed the early symptoms of the disease. Sixty of those quarantined are health-care workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Uganda's Ministry of Health said in an emailed statement that testing on 11 potential cases of Marburg came back negative, including that of the victim's brother. Those who still show symptoms similar to Marburg three days from now will be re-tested at that time, the ministry added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As with Ebola, there is no cure for the virus. And like Ebola, Marburg can have a high death rate for those infected. That's leading many to wonder whether the Marburg case will begin yet another deadly outbreak of a terrifying disease in Africa, even though the bulk of the evidence suggests otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is Marburg — and what are the symptoms? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ebola and Marburg are the exclusive members of the Filovirus family of hemorrhagic fevers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After that, infected individuals can develop a severe headache, myalgia, a fever and chills. Like Ebola, those initial symptoms are similar to many other diseases, including malaria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a few days, the symptoms worsen. They can include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and a rash. Eventually, severe cases progress to \"jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging and multi-organ dysfunction,\" the CDC explains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's a huge range in the disease's fatality rate in previous outbreaks, from 23 percent to 90 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How do you catch it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marbug, like Ebola, is not an airborne virus. The disease is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues or bodily fluids of an infected person or, as has happened in many cases before, an infected primate or fruit bat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Marburg seems to have its origin in and around Uganda, the first outbreak was actually in Europe: In 1967, laboratory workers in Germany and what was then Yugoslavia fell ill after handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda. There were 31 reported human cases and seven deaths, according to the CDC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other outbreaks have originated with travelers who visited caves inhabited by likely vectors of the disease, like the Kitum Cave in Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya. It's believed that fruit bat guano is responsible for passing the disease along to humans in multiple instances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1998, a larger-scale outbreak of Marburg infected 154 people, killing 128. Most of those infected were young males working in a gold mine there, according to the CDC. Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once a human catches the disease from an animal vector, it spreads person to person through direct contact. Often, as with Ebola, the people who care for human victims of Marburg are at the highest risk of becoming infected themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What's the treatment? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no specific treatment for Marburg, nor is there a proven vaccine or cure. Hospitalized patients should receive \"general supportive therapy,\" the World Health Organization notes. That includes treating any complicating infections, balancing fluids and electrolytes and replacing any blood loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of Marburg's close relation to Ebola, there are experimental treatments being developed by some of the same companies working on Ebola drugs. Tekmira pharmaceutical announced that it had tested a drug on lab monkeys infected with a particularly deadly strain of Marburg. Many of the animals treated with the drug, even after the onset of symptoms, recovered, according to Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tekmira makes TKM-Ebola, one of a handful of experimental Ebola treatments used on Americans who caught Ebola in West Africa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will the Marburg virus be at the center of the next terrifying outbreak? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We can't predict the future, but this seems extremely unlikely.

So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for Marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear. And those symptoms might sound familiar if you've been following the Ebola situation: Both viruses are members of the Filovirus family and manifest in similar ways, including fever, severe headache, and major bleeding, the Washington Post reports. Although many of the outbreaks recorded since Marburg was IDed in 1967 have been single cases, the fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90% (if you discount those single-case years), the CDC notes. Perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over Ebola after Thomas Duncan's death in Texas this week, CDC Director Thomas Frieden has been talking up efforts the CDC has undertaken in Uganda and emphasized that no further Marburg cases have been documented. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa,\" he says, per CNN.

The researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes or whole grains may help lower gestational diabetes risk. The findings appear in The BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gestational diabetes is a common pregnancy complication that causes high blood sugar levels in the mother. The disorder can lead to future health problems for mother and child. Previous studies have linked foods with a high glycemic index, a measure of the ability to raise blood sugar levels, to a higher risk of gestational or type 2 diabetes. However, until the current study, the effect of potatoes, a common, high-glycemic food, on the development of gestational diabetes was unknown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and Harvard University evaluated more than 15,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. They analyzed records from 1991 to 2001 of women who had no history of illness before pregnancy and had not had gestational diabetes before. Every four years, the women filled out a questionnaire on the kinds of foods they had eaten during the previous year. For potatoes, the women were asked if they had consumed baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries or potato chips, with possible responses ranging from \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that women who ate more potatoes had a higher risk of gestational diabetes.

Methods This prospective cohort study included 15 632 women from the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991-2001). They had no previous GDM or chronic diseases before pregnancy. Consumption of potatoes and other foods was assessed every four years. Incident first time GDM was ascertained from self reports of a physician diagnosis of GDM, which was previously validated by medical records. Study answer and limitations Over the 10 year follow-up there were 854 incident cases of GDM among 21 693 singleton pregnancies. After adjustment for age, parity, and dietary and non-dietary factors, women who consumed more potatoes before pregnancy had higher rates of developing GDM. Substitution of two servings a week of total potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, and whole grain foods was significantly associated with a 9-12% lower risk of GDM. Consumption and diabetes were self reported, and severity of diabetes was unknown. More than 90% of women were white. A causal association cannot be assumed. What this paper adds Higher levels of potato consumption before pregnancy are associated with greater risk of GDM, and substitution of potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods might lower the risk. Funding, competing interests, data sharing Funding was received from the Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Diabetes Association (No 7-12-MN-34). The authors have no competing interests or additional data to share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introduction Potatoes are the third most commonly consumed food crop in the world, after rice and wheat.1 In the United States, about 35% of women of reproductive age (that is, aged 19-50) consume potatoes daily, accounting for 8% of daily total energy intake.2 The health effects of potatoes are inconclusive,1 3 and there have been longstanding debates on the appropriate placement of potatoes in dietary guidance.4 5 6 Nonetheless, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans continue to include potatoes in the vegetable food group and encourage consumption.7 Though potatoes are rich in vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber, and some phytochemicals,6 unlike other vegetables they can have detrimental effects on glucose metabolism because they contain large amounts of rapidly absorbable starch.3 Indeed, several epidemiologic studies have linked higher potato consumption to increased concentrations of fasting plasma glucose,8 insulin resistance,8 and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.9 10 Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy characterized by glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.11 GDM is not only associated with adverse perinatal outcomes,12 it is also related to increased long term cardiometabolic risk in both mothers and their offspring.11 13 It is therefore crucial to identify modifiable risk factors that could contribute to the prevention of GDM. Previous studies have found that a diet with a higher glycemic index is related to higher plasma glucose and HbA1c concentrations during pregnancy14 15 and could increase the risk of GDM.16 The association between consumption of potatoes, a commonly consumed food with a high glycemic index, and GDM risk, remains unknown. Using data from a large prospective cohort study, we examined the association between potato consumption before pregnancy and risk of incident GDM. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methods Study population The Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 116 430 female nurses aged 24-44 at study inception in 1989.17 The participants received a biennial questionnaire regarding disease outcomes and lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking status and medication use. Follow-up for each questionnaire cycle was greater than 90%.18 We included participants from NHSII in this analysis if they reported at least one incident singleton pregnancy that lasted more than six months. The 1991 questionnaire was the first time dietary information was captured. We therefore set this year as the baseline for this analysis and included only pregnancies occurring after the return of 1991 questionnaire. The 2001 questionnaire was the last time GDM was ascertained as most participants had passed reproductive age by then; thus, length follow-up of GDM was up to the return of the 2001 questionnaire. Individual pregnancies were eligible if the woman did not report GDM in a previous pregnancy and had no prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. We excluded pregnancies if the woman did not return at least one pre-pregnancy food frequency questionnaire, left more than 70 questionnaire items blank, or reported unrealistic total energy intake (< 2510 or > 14 644 kJ/day, equivalent to <600 or >3500 kcal/day). We excluded women with GDM in a previous pregnancy because they might change their diet and lifestyle during the next pregnancy to prevent recurrence. Assessment of exposure Beginning in 1991 and every four years thereafter, study participants reported their usual food intake during the previous year on a food frequency questionnaire. The validity and reproducibility of the questionnaire are documented elsewhere.19 20 21 For potato consumption, we asked each participant how often, on average, they had consumed baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes (serving size: one baked or boiled or 237 mL (equivalent to one cup) mashed) or French fries (serving size 113 g) during the previous year. The possible responses of frequency ranged from never or less than once/month to six or more times a day. In a previous validation study, the corrected correlations between the food frequency questionnaire and the diet records were 0.66 for potatoes and 0.60 for French fries.21 We summed consumptions of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and French fries as total potato consumption. In addition, we asked the participants their frequency of consumption of potato chips or corn chips (combined) during the previous year (serving size 28 g or small bag). Ascertainment of outcomes The NHSII participants reported incident GDM on each biennial questionnaire through 2001. For women who reported more than one pregnancy lasting more than six months within a two year questionnaire period, GDM status was attributed to the first pregnancy. In a prior validation study among a subgroup of the NHSII cohort, 94% of GDM self reports were confirmed by medical records.17 In a random sample of parous women without GDM, 83% reported undergoing a glucose screening test during pregnancy and 100% reported frequent prenatal urine screenings, which indicated a high level of GDM surveillance in this cohort.17 During the period that GDM events were reported in the present study (1991-2001), the National Diabetes Data Group criteria22 have been widely adopted for GDM diagnosis. Assessment of covariates Participants reported their height and weight in 1989 and updated their weight on each biennial questionnaire. In a previous validation study, self reported weight was highly correlated with weight measured by a technician (r=0.97).23 Body mass index (BMI) was computed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Total physical activity was ascertained by frequency of engaging in common recreational activities, from which metabolic equivalent hours per week were derived. A prior validation study showed that questionnaire based estimates correlated well with detailed activity diaries (r=0.56).24 To account for potential confounding by the participants’ overall quality of diet, we derived a diet score—the alternate healthy eating index 2010 (AHEI-2010)—for each participant, as previously described.25 In brief, we allotted 0 to 10 points for intake of each of the following components, with adherence to dietary recommendations receiving 10 points: vegetables (servings/day), fruits (servings/day), whole grains (g/day), sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice (inversely scored, servings/day), nuts and legumes (servings/day), red/processed meat (inversely scored, servings/day), trans fat (inversely scored, % of energy), long chain n-3 fats (mg/day), polyunsaturated fat (% of energy), sodium (inversely scored, mg/day), and alcohol (drinks/day; we assigned the highest score to moderate (0.5-1.5 drinks/day) and the worst score to heavy (≥2.5 drinks/day) alcohol consumers). The overall AHEI-2010 ranged from 0 to 110 points, with a higher score indicating a better quality of diet and associated with a lower risk of incident chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.25 Statistical analysis We calculated a cumulative average intake of potato consumption before pregnancy for each individual at each time period to reduce variation within individuals and to represent long term habitual pre-pregnancy diet.26 For instance, the 1991 intake was used for the follow-up between 1991 and 1995, the average of the 1991 and 1995 intake was used for the follow-up between 1995 and 1999, and so on. Descriptive statistics at baseline are presented as means (standard deviations) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. To compare categories of pre-pregnancy potato consumption, we used analysis of variance test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. We used log-binomials models27 with generalized estimating equations to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Generalized estimating equations allowed us to account for correlations among repeated observations (pregnancies) contributed by a single participant.28 In a few instances, the log-binomials models did not converge, and we used log-Poisson models,29 which provide consistent but not fully efficient risk estimates. Pre-pregnancy covariates in the multivariable models included age (continuous), parity (0, 1, 2, and ≥3 pregnancies lasting six or more months), race/ethnicity (white, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, other, and missing/not reported), family history of diabetes (yes, no), cigarette smoking (never, past, current, and missing/not reported), physical activity (fourths), total energy intake (fourths), and overall diet quality as represented by the AHEI-2010 dietary pattern score (fourths). We additionally adjusted for biennially updated measures of BMI (<21, 21-22.9, 23.0-24.9, 25.0-26.9, 27.0-28.9, 29.0-30.9, 31.0-32.9, 33.0-34.9, ≥35.0). BMI was entered into the model separately because it can also be an intermediate on the pathway between potato consumption and GDM risk. We derived covariates from the questionnaire preceding each pregnancy, except race/ethnicity and family history of diabetes, which were reported in 1989. Categorical covariates included an indicator variable for missing data, if necessary. To tests for linear trends across categories of potato consumption we assigned the median intake for each category and fitted this as continuous variable in the models. In a sensitivity analysis for the tests of linear trends, we used the actual continuous amount of total potato consumption in the analysis. We estimated the effect of substituting two servings/week of total potatoes with the same serving amount of alternative foods (that is, other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods) by including both as continuous variables in the same multivariable model, which also contained non-dietary covariates and dietary covariates including total energy intake. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the substitution associations by computing the difference in their β coefficients and in their own variances and covariance.30 To evaluate effect modification, we performed stratified analyses according to age (<35 v ≥35), parity (nulliparous v parous), family history of diabetes (yes v no), physical activity before pregnancy (<median v ≥median), overall quality of diet (AHEI-2010 dietary pattern score; <median v ≥median), and overweight status before pregnancy (BMI <25 v ≥25). We tested interactions between these factors and potato consumption by adding multiplicative interaction terms of the binary effect modifiers and continuous linear trend variables in the multivariable models. To assess the robustness of our findings, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses by using different modeling approaches. For instance, in a sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for individual food items related to diabetes (such as red meat, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sugar sweetened beverages), instead of the AHEI diet quality score that represents a combination of individual food items as a dietary pattern.25 In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the most recent data for potato consumption before pregnancy instead of the cumulative average intake as the exposure variable. We also conducted sensitivity analyses by adjusting for major covariates as more refined categories (such as tenths) or as continuous variables. Among the participants included in this analysis, less than 3% of covariate data were missing for a given variable. Collectively, only 4.5% of the total participants had at least one missing variable in the covariates. To examine the impact of incomplete data in our analysis, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by omitting those participants with incomplete covariate data. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute). P<0.05 was considered significant. Patient involvement No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design and implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results During the 10 years of follow-up, we documented 854 incident pregnancies affected by GDM among 21 693 eligible singleton pregnancies from 15 632 women (6061 women with more than one pregnancy). At baseline in 1991, women with higher potato consumption were younger, less likely to be nulliparous, and more likely to be current smokers (table 1⇓). They had a higher BMI, performed less physical activity, consumed greater total energy, and had a lower quality of overall diet as represented by the AHEI-2010 dietary pattern score. Table 1 Age standardized characteristics of study population (n=15 632) from Nurses’ Health Study II in 1991, according to categories of total potato consumption before pregnancy. Figures are numbers (age standardized percentage*) unless stated otherwise. All comparisons were significant across categories except family history of diabetes View this table: Higher total potato consumption was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM (table 2⇓). After adjustment for age, parity, dietary and non-dietary factors, the relative risks of GDM for total potato consumption of 1, 2-4, and ≥5 servings/week, compared with <1 serving/week, were 1.21 (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.50), 1.34 (1.10 to 1.64), and 1.62 (1.24 to 2.13), respectively (P<0.001 for trend). The association was modestly attenuated but remained significant after additional adjustment for BMI, with the corresponding relative risks of 1.20 (0.97 to 1.48), 1.27 (1.04 to 1.55), and 1.50 (1.15 to 1.96), respectively (P=0.006 for trend). Additional adjustment for glycemic index did not alter the association between consumption and risk. In addition, associations did not differ by other risk factors for GDM, such as age, parity, family history of diabetes, physical activity, overall diet quality, or overweight status (data not shown). Substitution of two servings per week of total potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, and whole grain foods was significantly associated with a lower risk of GDM: 9% (0.91, 0.85 to 0.97) lower risk for other vegetables, 10% (0.90, 0.83 to 0.99) for legumes, and 12% (0.88, 0.83 to 0.94) for whole grain foods (fig 1⇓). Table 2 Relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for gestational diabetes mellitus according to total potato consumption before pregnancy View this table: Fig 1 Risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) associated with substitution of all vegetables (not including potatoes), legumes, or whole grain foods for potatoes at same serving amount (two servings/week). Adjusted for age (months), parity (0, 1, 2, ≥3), race/ethnicity (white, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, others), family history of diabetes (yes, no), cigarette smoking (never, past, current), physical activity (fourths), total energy intake (fourths), alternate healthy eating index 2010 (fourths), and pre-pregnancy BMI (nine categories: <21, 21-22.9, 23.0-24.9, 25.0-26.9, 27.0-28.9, 29.0-30.9, 31.0-32.9, 33.0-34.9 and ≥35.0) We also examined the association between risk of GDM and different types of potato preparations (tables 3 and 4⇓). The multivariable adjusted relative risks for GDM for baked, boiled, or mashed potato consumption of 1, 2-4, and ≥5 servings/week, compared with <1 serving/week, were 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.39), 1.30 (1.08 to 1.57), and 1.57 (1.14 to 2.15), respectively (P=0.001 for trend). The association remained significant after additional adjustment for BMI. For French fries, the multivariable adjusted relative risks for GDM for consumption at 1-3 servings/month, 1 serving/week, and ≥2 servings/week, compared with no consumption or consumption <1 serving/month, were 1.07 (0.88 to 1.29), 1.25 (1.00 to 1.55), and 1.31 (1.00 to 1.70), respectively (P=0.03 for trend). The association was attenuated and no longer significant after additional adjustment for BMI. We observed a significant and positive correlation between the consumption of different types of potato preparations (that is, baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, and French fries); the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.18 (P<0.001). This indicates that a woman who ate more baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was more likely to eat more French fries, and vice versa. To examine the independent associations between different types of potato preparations and GDM, we included both types simultaneously in the same multivariable model and observed almost identical magnitude of the associations with risk. The mutually adjusted relative risks for GDM associated with each increment of one serving/week consumption were 1.08 (1.03 to 1.14) for baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and 1.08 (1.03 to 1.14) for French fries. For potato chips or corn chips combined, we found no significant association with risk; the multivariable adjusted relative risks for GDM for consumption at 1-3 servings/month, 1 serving/week, and ≥2 servings/week, compared with no consumption or consumption <1 serving/month, were 0.97 (0.81 to 1.16), 1.02 (0.83 to 1.25), and 1.00 (0.80 to 1.24), respectively (P=0.87 for trend). Table 3 Relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for gestational diabetes mellitus according to consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes before pregnancy View this table: Table 4 Relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for gestational diabetes mellitus according to consumption of French fries before pregnancy View this table: The association between potato consumption between pregnancy and risk of GDM was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. First, we observed similar results when we adjusted for individual food items related to diabetes (such as red meat, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sugar sweetened beverages), instead of the AHEI diet quality score in the multivariable model (appendix table A). The adjusted relative risks for GDM for total potato consumption of 1, 2-4, and ≥5 servings/week, compared with <1 serving/week, were 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.45), 1.21 (0.99 to 1.48), and 1.40 (1.08 to 1.83), respectively (P=0.03 for trend). Second, a sensitivity analysis in which we used the actual continuous amount of total potato consumption, instead of the median level of each category of total potato consumption, in the test of linear trend analysis, yielded almost the same results as those in our main analysis (appendix table B). Third, we observed similar results in a sensitivity analysis that omitted participants with incomplete covariate data, which comprised 4.5% of the total participants (appendix table C). The adjusted relative risks for GDM for total potato consumption of 1, 2-4, and ≥5 servings/week, compared with <1 serving/week, were 1.21 (0.97 to 1.50), 1.28 (1.04 to 1.57), and 1.51 (1.14 to 1.98), respectively (P=0.007 for trend). Fourth, we also observed similar results in a sensitivity analysis using the most recent pre-pregnancy potato consumption, rather than the cumulative average intake of potatoes, as the exposure variable (appendix table D). The adjusted relative risks for GDM for total potato consumption of 1, 2-4, and ≥5 servings/week, compared with <1 serving/week, were 1.17 (0.95 to 1.44), 1.27 (1.04 to 1.55), and 1.35 (1.04 to 1.75), respectively (P=0.02 for trend). In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses by adjusting for major covariates (such as physical activity levels, BMI) as more refined categories (that is, tenths) or as continuous variables (appendix tables E-G). The significant association between total potato consumption and risk of GDM persisted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussion In this large prospective cohort study, we found that higher pre-pregnancy consumption of potatoes was significantly associated with a greater risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), even after adjustment for other major risk factors for GDM such as age, family history of diabetes, physical activity, overall diet quality, and BMI. We estimated that substitution of total potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods was significantly associated with a lower risk of GDM. Results in relation to other studies and implications of findings Although the association between potato consumption and risk of GDM has not been previously investigated, higher potato consumption has been associated with markers of altered glucose metabolism, including increased fasting plasma glucose concentrations and insulin resistance, in people at high risk.8 In addition, our results were in line with those from several previous studies,9 10 although not all,31 32 on the associations of potato consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. For instance, a previous study in women who were not pregnant found that higher consumptions of potatoes and French fries was associated with a moderately increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus after adjustment for age and dietary and non-dietary factors; women with the highest fifth of consumptions of potatoes and French fries, compared with those with the lowest fifth, had a 14% and 21% higher risk, respectively.9 Potatoes are widely consumed worldwide. Understanding of the association between consumption and risk of GDM, a common complication of pregnancy that has adverse impacts on the health of women and their children, has important clinical and public health implications. In the US, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans includes potatoes in the vegetable food group,7 whereas the United Kingdom’s national dietary guidelines classifies potatoes in the starchy food group.33 Both guidelines, however, advise people to consume plenty of potatoes as either vegetables or starchy foods. Findings from the present study raise concerns about such guidance. Our findings, together with data from other studies,34 35 36 37 38 further highlight the potential role of pre-pregnancy diet in the development of GDM. Future intervention studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Possible explanations of findings Higher consumption of potatoes, in particular French fries, could be an indicator of a low quality diet. We therefore adjusted for quality of overall diet in our analysis. The associations with risk of GDM were moderately attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for overall diet quality. We observed similar results when we adjusted major food groups related to diabetes (that is, red meat, vegetable and fruit, and whole grain foods) and sugar sweetened beverages in place of overall diet quality score (appendix table A).These data suggest that the association between total potato consumption and risk of GDM could be independent of other dietary risk factors for GDM. Our findings are biologically plausible, though the detailed underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Potatoes are a food with a high glycaemic index because of the large amount of starch that is absorbed rapidly after ingestion.3 High potato consumption can result in a sharp postprandial rise in blood glucose concentrations and induce oxidative stress to pancreatic β cells and subsequently β cell dysfunction or β cell exhaustion.39 40 41 Beyond the high glycemic index, French fries also contain altered fatty acid composition and an increased amount of degradation products from the frying oil and dietary advanced glycation end products that are generated during the frying process.42 43 These changes in fried food have previously been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes.44 45 In contrast, other vegetables, legumes, and whole grain foods typically have a low glycemic index, in addition to their richness in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and bioactive phytochemicals; therefore, substitution of potatoes with these foods could lower the risk of GDM. The association between French fries and risk of GDM was substantially attenuated after additional adjustment for BMI, indicating that the association might be largely explained by BMI. This is not surprising because frying with oil can increase the energy density of food,46 and studies have found an increased risk of obesity associated with higher consumption of fried food.47 48 A previous study has shown a significant association between potato consumption and long term weight gain in the general population.49 It is possible that eating more potatoes is related to higher gestational weight gain and, subsequently, an increased risk of GDM. Unfortunately, we did not have data on gestational weight gain to further explore the potential mechanism. Strengths and potential limitations The strengths of this study include the prospective design with a long follow-up that establishes the temporal direction of the associations, the large number of cases of GDM that ensures sufficient statistical power, and the repeated and comprehensive assessment of many dietary and lifestyle variables that allows us to assess potential confounding and effect modification. We acknowledge that there were also several potential limitations. First, like other observational studies, measurement error in self reported exposures (potato consumption) is possible. As the pre-pregnancy dietary information was captured prospectively, the random error within an individual would most likely be non-differential, which could have attenuated the observed associations toward null. Furthermore, the use of cumulative averages of dietary intakes for participants who filled in more than one pre-pregnancy food frequency questionnaire reduces random error within an individual.26 Second, cases of GDM were self reported in this study. Our previous validation study indicated a high degree of accuracy of self reported GDM in this cohort compared with medical record review.17 The rate of GDM (5.5%) in this study was in the upper range of the usual reported rates (range 3-6%) in the US based on the NDDG (National Diabetes Data Group) criteria during the same period.50 51 This rate likely reflected the high rate of screening in this cohort, which is composed of health professionals. Third, we do not have data on the severity of GDM in this cohort. Whether higher habitual consumption of potatoes is associated with increasing severity of GDM warrants future investigation. Fourth, our study population consisted mostly of white American women. Thus, the generalizability of the observed associations might be limited to similar populations. The relative homogeneity of the study population, however, reduces potential confounding due to unmeasured socioeconomic variability. Fifth, although we adjusted for many potential confounders, we are unable to fully rule out the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured factors. Finally, because of the observational nature of our study, we cannot establish a causal relation between potato consumption and risk of GDM. A carefully conducted observational study, however, could provide a reasonable approach to evaluate the association. In addition, we controlled for major risk factors of GDM to minimize confounding. Conclusion In summary, in this large prospective cohort study, pre-pregnancy potato consumption was significantly and positively associated with the risk of incident GDM. Substitution of potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods was associated with a lower risk of GDM. These findings should be confirmed in intervention studies and randomized controlled trials.

Some researchers suggest that may be a good idea, since a new study finds that women who eat more potatoes before conceiving may face a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes while pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gestational diabetes - a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy - can affect the health of both an expecting mom and her baby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the study, researchers from the National Institutes of Health's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Harvard University analyzed data from more than 15,000 women taking part in the Nurses' Health Study II from 1991 to 2001. The scientists tracked consumption of potatoes and other foods every four years. They also tracked pregnancies. Over the ten-year period, out of 21,693 pregnancies, there were 854 cases of gestational diabetes. The women had not had diabetes or other chronic illnesses before becoming pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We found that a diet with a higher level of potato consumption before pregnancy was related to a greater risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy,\" said study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang, senior investigator in the Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It's estimated that about four to eight percent of pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes, said Zhang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous studies have linked foods with a high glycemic index, a measure of the impact on blood sugar levels, to a higher risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Potatoes elevate blood sugar in people more than just about any other type of food,\" Dr. Aldo Palmieri of UCLA Santa Monica Hospital told CBS News. \"They are carbohydrates, and all carbohydrates have that potential.\" He said the study reinforces the importance of moderation in what we eat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our next question was, 'What are we going to recommend women to eat instead?' which is why we did the substitution,\" Zhang said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The authors also found that when two servings per week of potatoes were dropped in favor of other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods, women had a nine to 12 percent lower risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By substituting the following foods for two servings of potatoes per week, they estimated reductions in gestational diabetes risk by: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9 percent for other vegetables NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10 percent for legumes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 12 percent for whole grain foods NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zhang recommended swapping in green leafy vegetables for potatoes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They have less starch, less carbohydrate, but are high in fiber and vitamins and minerals. And the same for whole grains. They are lower on the glycemic index and have higher levels of healthful nutrients and minerals and micronutrients,\" she told CBS News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Minisha Sood, director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said the findings did not surprise her. She found the study's approach of looking at one high-glycemic food interesting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And then when they showed the substitutions, that's essentially advocating for the Mediterranean-type diet, which we know has benefits in terms of weight loss and insulin resistance,\" Sood told CBS News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it comes to finding alternatives for potatoes on your dinner plate, Sood said mashed cauliflower can be a satisfying substitute for mashed potatoes and it's low on the glycemic index. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a vegetable. It's a great substitution. You can almost handle it and mash it the same way, with a little butter and salt, and get the same idea. It's a little closer to potato than kale would be,\" Sood said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People craving potato chips can look for healthier versions, such as quinoa chips and lentil chips, which may have a little more fiber and be lower on the glycemic index compared to regular chips, said Sood. They tend to be baked, so they will also have less fat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Women looking to become pregnant or who are already pregnant don't need to chop potatoes off of the menu altogether, but no more than one serving a week is best, Zhang said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A potato does contain healthful nutrients. Vitamin C and potassium and a small amount of dietary fiber. But it's all about the dose. I think moderate consumption is still fine but not too high,\" she said. \"From our data, we show if they consume one serving per week then they're still okay, but if they consume two or more servings, there's an increased risk for gestational diabetes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study's limitations included lack of diversity - 90 percent of the participants were white and a generally healthy population of nurses, said Zhang. Also, diet details and diabetes diagnosis were self-reported, and the severity of diabetes was unknown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The authors also noted that the research was not designed to prove cause and effect, and their results don't prove that potato consumption directly leads to gestational diabetes. More research on the subject is needed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zhang suspects a larger, more general study population would show more risk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said, \"Women need to know, not all vegetables are 'healthy.'\"\n", "answers": ["If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)"], "length": 7447, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3909b39ee589824733bcbab63b1b3949577bb2f71ee2116d"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe play, ironically, started with defense, a hand extended into the passing lane. It was midway through the second half of that Final Four game between Houston and Louisville. Benny Anders, a shoot-first-pass-maybe swingman for Houston, reached in and stole the ball near the free throw line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is an article from the issue NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The play that followed took place 30 years ago this month, but it's etched in my memory. Anders slalomed through traffic and headed upcourt, his spectacular Jheri curl trailing him like tails on a kite. He passed half-court, picking up speed. A defender from Louisville (I had to spark up YouTube to I.D. Charles Jones) tried to cut off his angle to the basket. No matter. Anders elevated for what looked to be a conventional layup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except that Anders always seemed to have a deep-seated grudge against convention. He splayed his thick legs, sausaged into a comically tight pair of shorts, cocked his arm and threw down a vicious dunk, nearly beheading Jones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Michael Jordan was a sophomore on the North Carolina team that had won the previous NCAA championship, Houston was the It Program that season, a traveling road show whose aerial performance art took on mythical dimensions. The Cougars, led by future top 50 alltime NBAers Clyde Drexler and Akeem (the H came later) Olajuwon, had been nicknamed Phi Slamma Jamma, a nod to the quantity and quality of their dunks. But none was as extravagant as this particular throwdown by Anders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One reason was aesthetic. But another was the blithe disregard that Anders, a sophomore reserve, had betrayed: for the defender occluding his path and fouling him, in turn making the dunk all the more remarkable; for the rules of physics and geometry that should have served as discouragement; for the fact that his team was trailing in this, the most important game of the season and of Anders's career. And I wasn't the only one struck by that Anders dunk against Louisville. In his 2009 book, Eating the Dinosaur, Chuck Klosterman recalled the moment perfectly as \"a midair shark attack.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galvanized by the play, Houston eventually pulled away, but Anders wasn't done yet. His team ahead by eight points in the final 30 seconds, Anders was at half-court with no defender in his path and a teammate ahead of him. Anders declined to pass or dribble out the clock. Instead he achieved cruising altitude, cuffed the ball with his right hand and threw down a nasty reverse dunk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move may have been imprudent—\"the most selfish play I've seen in all my years of basketball,\" his teammate Reid Gettys would later tell ESPN—but it was the essence of Anders. Here was a player who summed up his game as \"Take it to the rack and stick it on them.\" Which was not even his best line that season. For years his admonishment to Olajuwon—\"When I drop a dime to the big Swahili, he got to put it in the hole\"—endured as the gold standard for sports quotes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that's all that endured. Despite his athleticism and flair, Anders never made as big an impact again. He floundered at Houston and failed to ascend to the NBA. Then he disappeared. Not metaphorically disappeared, as in, fell out of the public eye and now leads a life of pleasant seclusion. He literally disappeared, as in, whereabouts unknown. Vanished. Evaporated. Gone. A Jheri-curled Yeti. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Where in the world is Benny Anders?\" became a parlor game in the hoops ecosystem. Mention Anders's name to Drexler, and he whistles, smiles and says, \"Benny Anders is a mystery. Probably the '90s is the last time anyone heard from him.\" The University of Houston's sports information department claims it's been at least that long. As Michael Young, another Phi Slamma Jamma alumnus, told the Houston Chronicle in 2011, \"Nobody knows where Benny Anders is. We've been trying to find him for years.\" Other former teammates joke about his having entered the witness protection program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A decade ago Grant Wahl, covering college basketball for SI, was asked about what ever happened to Anders by a reader. Grant called the only Anders listed in the directory of Bernice, La., Benny's hometown. He reached Anders's grandmother, who could only lament, \"If you find him, tell him I'd love to hear from him.\" How could an athlete with such staggering presence leave behind such a staggering absence? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And thus began a ... well, what? I wouldn't dramatize it as an obsession or white whale or even personal quest, but maybe as something closer to an abiding interest in finding Benny Anders. He had to be out there somewhere, right? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anders was the kind of figure I gravitated toward as a journalist, the embodiment of all those c words: charismatic, colorful, combustible, candid. But in 1983, as a kid in elementary school, I thought of him as the avatar of another c word: cool. He had subversive appeal, a funkadelic soulfulness. If Olajuwon and Drexler were the polished performers who played the big stage, Anders was the alterna-band rocker, all authenticity. He was a cowboy baller, with a personality to match. And I didn't even know the half of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In high school, known as Bennie Anders, he was a star in tiny Bernice and played on the same AAU team as Joe Dumars, Karl Malone and John (Hot Rod) Williams. \"Benny always had a big personality,\" says Dumars. \"He was the most spirited guy on our teams.\" While the other three players were content to go to smaller, in-state colleges—McNeese State, Louisiana Tech and Tulane, respectively—Anders was hell-bent on playing for a big-time program. On his recruiting visit to LSU, however, he showed up wearing a shirt that read THE OUTLAW, his high school nickname. When LSU's coach, Dale Brown, asked about the phrase, Anders embellished. \"I'd go from town to town, causing disturbances.\" LSU passed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two days after Anders helped Houston defeat Louisville, he was on the floor in the waning seconds of the championship game against North Carolina State. Anders gambled for a steal at half-court. Of course he did. He missed, freeing Wolfpack guard Dereck Whittenburg to throw up a long jump shot, which ended in the hands of teammate Lorenzo Charles, who dunked the ball at the buzzer, consummating one of the great upsets in college hoops history. Jim Valvano's scramble to find someone to hug? It doesn't happen without Anders's unbridled nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next season Anders, and his comparably eccentric teammate forward Braxton Clark, quit the team after clashing with the coach, Guy Lewis, over their banishment to the bench. \"Heavy pine time,\" Anders called it. When Alex Wolff of SI visited the campus for a story and took Clark and Anders to the local Bennigan's, the players thought nothing of ordering drinks. As they stewed over their Long Island iced teas (Clark) and Heinekens (Anders), they couldn't resist issuing gems like this one from Clark: \"There are two fraternities. There's Phi Slamma Jamma on the court and Phi Slamma Clappa on the bench. And once you're in Phi Slamma Clappa, you're finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Anders wasn't. He rejoined the team a few weeks later. Drexler had departed to the NBA, but the big Swahili was still receiving dimes. With Olajuwon dominating, Houston again reached the NCAA final. Again, the Cougars lost, this time to Georgetown. Again, Anders solidified his cult status. He showed up in Seattle wearing a pink bow tie and cummerbund. He didn't play in the semifinal game against Kentucky because, he told reporters, he'd worn \"the wrong brand of sneakers.\" He played sparingly in the final. \"How can [Lewis] forget the athletes he has on the bench?\" Anders wondered aloud. \"I could have scored at will.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a story by Mark Bradley in the Hendersonville Times-News, a Kentucky fan named John Gambill had become enamored by Anders, and at the final game he and some pals held up a sign reading BENNY ANDERS FOR PRESIDENT. Afterward Gambill and crew went to the Cougars' hotel and found Anders, who invited them to the Houston team party. Wrote Bradley, \"The night ended with Gambill and a friend riding around Seattle in a Jaguar with Anders and teammate Reid Gettys.\" A week later Gambill received a package in the mail. It contained Anders's Phi Slamma Jamma warmup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anders missed the following season with a knee injury. That spring he argued with a classmate at the campus field house. The other student threw a sprinter's starting block at Anders, who went to his car and, as self-proclaimed outlaws are wont to do, returned with a gun. Anders was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading no contest to possessing a firearm on school property. He was kicked off the team. He played briefly in the Philippines and South America, and that was it. He was gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first stumbling block to finding Benny Anders was a simple SEO annoyance. Benny Andersson, a founding member of ABBA and executive producer of the Broadway musical Mamma Mia!, kept intruding on searches. While that was easily corrected, I was having no success in my quest. A search of the usual databases did not turn up a Benny Anders born in October 1963 and living in the U.S. There was a Benny Anders living in Sweden. When reached by phone, that Benny quickly grew confused. When I mentioned Phi Slamma Jamma, he responded plaintively in a heavy Scandinavian accent, \"I don't speak the good English.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Often when there's no residential address for someone, there's a good chance he's in prison. But there was no recent record of Anders in the Louisiana criminal justice system, nor in those of surrounding states. Though his arrest record from the campus gun offense showed up in databases, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported no Benny Anders incarcerated in a U.S. facility. Another records search revealed that in March 1997 Anders took out a personal loan of almost $21,000 from the Community Trust Bank in Bernice, which he has yet to repay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talking to those who once knew Anders left only a cold trail of rumors. Benny Anders was a truck driver. He was living in Asia. He was living in Louisiana but going by his middle name, Michael. It was even suggested that he had undergone a sex change. There is an @BennyAnders on Twitter, but the profile reads: \"17, lifeguard, waiter, studying at south devon, Living the devon dream!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I told a friend about my search, he referred me to a friend of his, a private investigator in New York City. The gumshoe had recollections of Anders at Houston, and he offered to help. A day later he called me back, impressed: \"Not much on this guy at all. He knows how to hide!\" He did find a record indicating that Anders had worked in the late '90s for a security firm, J.R. Nell & Son Security, in Flint, Mich. There was, however, no current record of a B. Anders, a Benny Anders or even an M. Anders living in Flint. Nor was there a record of J.R. Nell. The Michigan Department of Licensing claimed to have no information showing that the firm ever existed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A poster on Coogfans.com, the Houston athletic message board, had a lead on Anders: \"I found this on Google: Prison Ministry. Every Monday and Thursday we have groups that serve at the Clifton Prison teaching Bible Studies, leading Worship Services, and serving Family Outreach. If you are interested in more information or in volunteering, please contact Benny Anders or the church office.\" A follow-up revealed that this Benny Anders was not African-American. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even in his absence, the legend of Anders grew. When the 2011 Final Four was held in Houston, it triggered the typical \"Where are they now?\" chatter about Phi Slamma Jamma. Inevitably Anders's mysterious disappearance came up. A story that Gettys earlier recounted to the journalist Robert Weintraub made the rounds: \"An agent who places players overseas told me ... he had set up a tryout camp in Louisiana a few years ago. He started with 150 players, narrowed it to 75, then down to 15, then held a full-court scrimmage. So one dude, he's about 300 pounds, is just killing guys. Just busting them up. The agent knew he was too heavy to interest anyone but had to know more about this guy, and asked him his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"'I'm Benny Anders,' the guy said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The agent was shocked. 'The Benny Anders? What do you weigh?' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"'Two ninety-two.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Shaking his head, the agent asked, 'What are you doing weighing 292 pounds?' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"'I'm down from 350,' Benny said.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was another classic tale in a compendium so, well, fat that it could be serialized. But it was of little help. No one could recall the site of the tryout camp, the name of the agent or even the league auditioning the players. I sympathized with Charles Jones, the hapless Louisville defender in the '83 Final Four. I thought I had an angle on Anders; he remained one step ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About a year ago, I had a speaking engagement in Little Rock and finagled a side trip to Bernice. Driving the single-lane roads that thread the Louisiana countryside was a little like traveling back in time: cell service was sporadic, women sold vegetables out of the backs of their trucks, roadside motels advertised FREE HBO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pulling into town, I steered my rental car down the main drag and turned onto a dirt road. I found the address of Anders's boyhood home. No one currently resides there. At the Bernice Town Hall a woman in charge of records thought she had recently seen Anders and called a friend for more intel. My pulse quickened as she nodded with the receiver affixed to her ear. Then she made a sour face. She'd confused Anders with Willis Reed, who lives a few towns away and is, supposedly, Anders's distant cousin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I drove by Bernice High, where the Outlaw had been based. It's now an elementary school, though Anders's name still adorns the gym wall. But no one had seen Anders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally I ventured to the address listed for the only Anders in the directory that seemed like it could have a link to Benny. A mobile home rested on bricks several feet off the ground, a bedsheet hung over the door. An elderly woman who emerged claimed not to have seen Anders in years: \"Ya'll keep looking for him, but he ain't here!\" I presumed that this was Anders's Aunt Gracie but could not confirm it because in the most unambiguous of terms she asked me to leave the property. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe a month later I came upon an old blurb on thecabin.net, a newspaper's website in Conway, Ark., noting, \"Ethel and James Lewis McClure Sr. are celebrating their 11th wedding anniversary this weekend with a trip to Sam's Town in Tunica, Miss. They were married April 12, 1993, at the Faulkner County Courthouse.\" The item mentioned that \"the McClures have seven children,\" among them \"Benny Anders of Flint, Mich.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aha! Not only did this support the private investigator's assertion that Anders was living in Flint, but it also gave the name of Anders's father, which had been elusive. A records search revealed that McClure was born in 1946, which meant he would have been young when he fathered Benny in 1963, but it was possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I called James McClure, he spoke genially, if nervously, but denied being Anders's father. He was \"more like an uncle,\" he said, and besides, he hadn't seen Anders in years. I left my phone number, and maybe an hour later I received a call from a blocked number. The woman on the other end would not identify herself but wondered why I had just called Mr. McClure. When I explained my search to find Anders, she shot back, \"Benny don't want to talk to nobody.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But he's alive?\" I said. \"He's doing O.K.?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Click. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now I had multiple references to Anders living in Flint. And in Bernice, a resident provided a name for Anders's biological father that matched with an address in Flint. I thought it was somehow fitting that Anders might be living in a city that was strong in another era but now deteriorating, a shell of its former self. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it was that last Wednesday I flew to Detroit and drove an hour north. The Flint home corresponding to the address is a brick ranch house on a main drag, not far from a GM plant and not far from a golf course. There was a dark blue H2 in the driveway and an old Lincoln shrouded in a tarp. A basketball rim, rusted and bent upward, was affixed to the garage. The house appeared to be divided into two residences. A light was on in one kitchen. So far, so good. But my knocks went unanswered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I wondered if Benny was playing hoops, so I ventured to the Flint YMCA. Jeff Grayer, a former NBA player, was there finishing a pickup game. He smiled when asked about Anders. \"Benny Anders! We used to see him around, but that was a long time ago,\" said Grayer. \"When you find him, let me know.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I returned to the home and, in stinging cold, stood on the doorstep, feeling pathetic and somewhat guilty intruding on the privacy of a man who hadn't been heard from in a quarter century. When my knocks again yielded no answer, I was almost relieved. I left a note and a business card in the mail slot, but the gesture was pro forma. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's entirely possible that Benny is alive and well, that there's a simple explanation for his disappearance. His family's concern? His teammates' cracks—which have become less funny through the years—about witness protection? It might all be a misunderstanding, and he's teaching gym in Birmingham or running a Subway franchise in the Chicago suburbs or working in a cubicle in Bangkok. But someone else will have to find him. I failed. And now I'm done looking. Benny Anders remained a step ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps, ideally, he should remain there. As it stands, Benny exists as a series of brazen quotes, a flash of pink cummerbund, and astounding dunks, one in a pivotal game—a fleeting vision of athletic perfection and personal cult. Out, out brief candle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A man named Benny Anders, once the Phi Beta Kappa of Phi Slamma Jamma, is now outside the reach of social media, geocoding, voting records and satellite maps. Outside the hazy memories and unquenched desires of people like me. The Outlaw persists, and I'm O.K. with that.

CARTER SMITH/AP DREAM TEAMMATE Olajuwon (left) lobbied to get Anders reinstated to the team after clashes with the coach made him walk away in '84. With Anders, the Cougars again made the NCAA final.\nPassage 2:\nThere he is, endearing as ever. He’s not in the Philippines or Switzerland or Swaziland (much less in prison or dead) as had all been rumored. No, he’s on the sidewalk in suburban Detroit, on his way to work at a restaurant. He looks good, too, weighing far less than 350 pounds, as was rumored. He still has a knack for the one-liner. Sitting in all black, his face shrouded by sunglasses, he says at the end of the new documentary, Phi Slama Jama: “A brotherly love is a very powerful thing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A dutiful account of the endearing, anti-gravitational Houston Cougars of the 80s— who dunked their way to three straight Final Fours—Phi Slama Jama is a forthcoming “30 for 30.” And it succeeds as a piece of filmmaking. Aided mightily by recollections from the program’s former PA announcer, Jim Nantz, the film’s director Chip Rives gives the viewer plenty of backstory about this unlikely dynasty. (Discussion for another time: can a team that won zero NCAA championships still be dynastic? We think this qualifies as an exception.) We get the Phi Slama Jama fraternity history, an explanation for how this collection of mostly local recruits—a 7-foot Nigerian notwithstanding—came to prominence. We end up with a heightened regard for Guy Lewis, a twanging proto-Tarkanian, who gambled with talent and tactics and usually won. Until he didn’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the documentary’s great revelation is the existence of Anders, thereby solving one of college basketball’s enduring mysteries, a conundrum that had confounded everyone from Anders’ former Houston teammates to his own family. (And yours truly: more on this later.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Clyde Drexler and Hakeem (then Akeem) Olajuwon were the Otter and Boon of Phil Slama Jama, Anders was Blutarsky, the ungovernable life of the party who added so much color to this cast. A heroic dunker, Anders also had flamboyance to cast. He was peerless as a quote. (His warning to Olajuwon—\"When I drop a dime to the big Swahili, he got to put it in the hole\"—set a gold standard for sports lines.) This was a guy who showed up to the 1984 Final Four wearing a pink tux. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anders was called the Outlaw. It was even the personalized license plate on his new Camaro. And it was less a cute nickname than an accurate characterization. He operated on the margins, under his set of rules. Relegated to Houston’s bench in 1985, he complained that he didn’t “want to play for no Phil Slama Clappa” and quit the team. While he was eventually allowed back, his career effectively ended when he pulled a gun on a classmate after a pick-up game dispute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that, he disappeared. Not it the way we usually discuss it in sports. He didn’t retreat to his hometown to reinvent himself outside of sports. He vanished. His whereabouts were unknown. Among his teammates. Among his relatives in is hometown of Bernice, La. In basketball circles. He was a jheri-curled version of a phantom. As a former Houston teammate puts it in the film, “It’s like he turned the lights out on his existence.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was remarkable on a number of levels. For one, it’s a feat to remain anonymous in a time of geotagging and IP addresses and status updates. Also, if you were going to pick an athlete to seek utter anonymity, Anders would have been your last choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know this firsthand. Having recalled Anders from when I was a kid, I wondered a few years ago what had happened to him. When I realized that “Where is Benny?” was already a parlor game, I joined in. And then got sucked in, venturing to multiple states in search of the guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR F. Carter Smith/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After I published a story on Anders in Sports Illustrated in March, 2013, I received various tips. Benny was using the name “Michael.” He was living in Europe. He had facial reconstruction surgery so no one would recognize him. I also had various middlemen contact me about Anders, claiming they could furnish him. The hitch: there was a request for payment. In one recent case, having explained that paying a source violates a cardinal rule of journalism, I was approached with a counter-offer. In exchange for an audience with Anders, could SI barter a page of advertising for an AAU team Anders was looking to launch? Ah, the Outlaw. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rives and I talked about his project a few years ago and he went through a similar drill. Rightly, Rives reached the conclusion that finding Anders was a pre-requirement for a Phi Slama Jama documentary. (Full disclosure: I spoke with Rives on camera and appear periodically in the film.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rives gathered enough clues to conclude that Anders was in Michigan, where his father lived. With the help of Houston teammate Eric Davis, a former Chicago police officer, Anders was traced to a rental apartment in a neighborhood between Detroit and Flint. A stakeout led them to find and then confront Anders on his way to work. (Rives also confirms that Anders was paid an appearance fee after he was found.) Mystery solved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions still remain. We never learn precisely why one of college hoops’ great cult figures chose to live in the shadows for decades. Or what precisely he is doing now. Or what he recalls from his Phi Slama Jama days. Still, the appearance of Anders in the flesh—the confirmation that he’s alive—is the fitting capstone for a soaring film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As one of Anders’ associates joked to me the other day, “Y’all will have to find a new player from the 80s to go track down!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fennis Dembo, you’re on warning, pal.\nPassage 3:\nPhi Slama Jama member Benny Anders found after hiatus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo: Courtesy Of UH Athletics Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Image 1 of 4 Benny Anders Anders played in 76 games for the Cougars from 1981-84.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ESPN Films is expected to air the film, titled \"Phi Slama Jama\" and directed by Houston native Chip Rives, later this fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anders, one of the more flamboyant members of the flamboyant UH squad that played in three Final Fours, was found in Michigan by Rives with the help of former UH player Eric Davis, a former Chicago police officer, according to a story published Monday on Sports Illustrated's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only details about Anders' current circumstances mentioned in the Monday story is that he works at a restaurant in the Detroit area and that he \"looks good.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Filmmakers, understandably reserving much of the Anders material for revelation in the upcoming film, told SI that Anders ends the film with the line, \"A brotherly love is a very powerful thing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SI also reported that Anders was paid for his appearance in the upcoming documentary.\n", "answers": ["In the 1980s, the University of Houston's Cougars basketball team—aka the Phi Slama Jamas—made their way into three Final Fours.

Sports Illustrated reports on Benny \"the Outlaw\" Anders, the subject of an ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary directed by Chip Rives to come out later this fall, and it's such a shocking development that the SI headline reads: \"Benny Anders is alive!\" Anders was one of college basketball's \"enduring mysteries\" after he was benched in 1985, quit the team, came back a few weeks later, and then fell off the map after whipping out a gun during a fight with a classmate; he was sentenced to three years' probation for that incident, per a 2013 SI article.

Instead, he became what SI says was \"a jheri-curled version of a phantom.\" \"It's like he turned the lights out on his existence,\" an ex-Houston player says in the documentary. But Rives, with the help of former teammate and ex-Chicago cop Eric Davis, followed a bunch of leads until they tracked him down in a rental apartment outside of Detroit.

They have been co-ordinating aid efforts from the island of Cebu, 360 miles south of Manila. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have started a fund for donation and we managed to raise around 30,000,\" said Ms Agarwal. \"The island is relatively small, with about 7,000 people. But the situation there is very devastating.\"\nPassage 2:\nMajor relief packages have continued to pour into the typhoon-devastated city of Tacloban – from food aid to medicine and search-and-rescue teams – on the second day of a ramped-up effort by the Philippines government to reach those hardest hit by the super storm that many fear has killed more than 10,000 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aid comes amid heightened insecurity and tension in the city, where reports of gunshots, stabbings and ambushes have caused many residents and aid workers to fear for their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local and American military C-130 planes were flying in with supplies on Thursday, while the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier that can accommodate the landing of helicopters, was expected to arrive off the coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An American medical ship has been ordered but would not arrive for another few weeks. British digger maker JCB announced it would send heavy machinery and generators to help clear up the debris that still lines the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the arrival of aid and a concerted effort by the military to restore order to the town, thousands of stricken residents still crammed the crumbling airport desperate for a way out of the city that has borne the brunt of the storm and its aftermath. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday night the Tacloban mayor, Alfred Romualdez, led a mass burial in a graveyard just outside the city. Officials said every effort had been made to ensure those buried could be identified in the weeks to come. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official death toll of 2,357 is a considerably lower figure than that estimated by aid workers, who say the lack of information coming from various areas – some 29 municipalities in all are affected – could mean that the devastation is far greater than yet realised. Most casualties seem to have been around the islands of Samar and Leyte, where the storm first made landfall at 195mph on Friday morning, with accompanying sea surges of up to 20ft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The resulting damage in the region – a coastal flatland that has seen whole villages blown apart by the storm's heavy winds and rain – has created a state of pandemonium in Tacloban, where survivors have had to loot shops and malls for water, while others have resorted to scavenging for food among the bloated bodies of the dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday stories of heightened violence and tension circulated around the city as eight were killed after stampeding a rice warehouse looking for food. A Philippine Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men who were later shot dead by police, and a 13-year-old boy was knifed in the neck and stomach by unknown men, AFP reported. There were unverified reports that prisoners from the local jail, who had successfully broken out of their cells after the storm, were ambushing people carrying supplies across San Juanico bridge, which connects Tacloban with Samar island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Facebook status warning of traffickers posing as relief workers and targeting women and children circulated on Thursday but the Guardian was not able to verify the report. Officials urged people to stay calm and not believe everything they heard. \"There have been so many reports of looting and rape which have turned out not to be correct,\" Ricky Caradang, a spokesman for President Benigno Aquino III, told the local ABS-CBN TV channel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A nighttime curfew has been in place since Monday and in a televised report on Wednesday the BBC correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes said Tacloban had turned into a \"war zone\". Footage showed tanks rolling through the centre of the devastated town and soldiers crouching behind walls with automatic rifles. Just what the threat was to the city had not been made clear, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some aid agencies, fearing for the safety of their employees, have ordered teams to evacuate. Plan International has withdrawn all 15 of its employees – normally permanently based in Tacloban – until security is restored in the city, according to spokesman Ian Wishart. The fact that many aid workers had arrived in Tacloban but little aid had yet been distributed was creating a security concern, one aid worker told the Guardian. A memo was circulating among relief workers advising them not to move around in Tacloban as some UN staff had already been pulled out for security reasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But officials have pointed to an increased presence of police and military, and the arrival of aid, as a turning point for the ravaged city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carandang said 26 of 138 barangays (neighbourhoods) in Tacloban had received aid, with many of the roads previously blocked by fallen trees and debris now cleared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oxfam has sent enough emergency water supplies for 20,000 families in Tacloban on a first-run delivery of effort, although the charity added that delivery was dependent on a stable security situation in the town itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plans are to provide half a million people affected by the super storm with emergency shelter, water and construction materials to rebuild their homes and boats. The World Food Programme successfully delivered nearly 25 tonnes of high-energy biscuits on Wednesday and another 10 tonnes were on their way, the UN body said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of the devastation wrought by Haiyan occurred in the Philippines' agricultural belt, with the majority of residents in Leyte and Samar working on farms or as fishermen.\nPassage 3:\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: \"Progress is being made\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The relief operation in the central Philippines to help those affected by Typhoon Haiyan is making progress following the arrival of a US aircraft carrier and its escort of two cruisers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Food, water and medical help are beginning to reach residents of Tacloban as soldiers clear roads blocked by debris.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Philippine Health Minister Enrique Ona told the BBC that international criticism of the government's relief efforts was \"unkind\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the final death toll was likely to be \"significantly lower\" than an early estimate of 10,000, but warned that it was unlikely all victims would be identified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Looting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The full extent of what is needed to help survivors has yet to emerge as aid workers struggle to reach more isolated areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guiuan, a town of 45,000, was heavily damaged by the typhoon. French aid charity MSF described the situation there as bleak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the BBC's Andrew Harding, reporting from near Guiuan, says after earlier problems with looting, some supplies are now getting in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other countries have also pledged help in the shape of financial aid, relief supplies or emergency teams.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very little aid has arrived in the city because of clogged roads, broken bridges and ports, and an airport that until today was not able to operate at night given the electricity went out on the Friday that the typhoon hit and has not been restored. Power generators were flooded as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the aid is stuck in Manila and the nearby airport of Cebu, a 45-minute flight away.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eight people were crushed to death when a huge crowd stormed a rice warehouse near Tacloban, one of the worst-hit cities, authorities said. More than 100,000 bags of rice were carted away in the melee, according to news reports Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere, residents dug up underground pipes and smashed them open to get water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official death toll stood at 2,275, but aid workers feared it would continue to grow. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people were affected by the storm, one of the most powerful ever to make landfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As concerns grew about rampant looting and lawlessness, Philippine security forces sent reinforcements and imposed a nighttime curfew in Tacloban. Armed assailants have been holding up aid convoys headed to the city. On Tuesday, troops killed two suspected communist rebels who attacked one such convoy, the military said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local officials said bands of looters, having cleaned out shops in Tacloban, were beginning to break into the homes of people who had died or fled the city. But there were reports that newly arrived troops were restoring order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flights delivering aid from around the world are arriving at the airport in Cebu, which has been turned into a logistics hub for the relief effort. The many donations included a field hospital from Belgium and a portable purification plant from Germany, according to European officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the end of the day Wednesday, the United States had delivered nearly 274,000 pounds of supplies to Tacloban, about 100 miles northeast of Cebu, said two senior Obama administration officials who briefed reporters in Washington on condition of anonymity. The shipments included plastic tarps, hygiene kits, blankets and medical supplies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. military personnel had also evacuated about 800 people from Tacloban to Manila for medical treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Philippine welfare personnel loaded up packages of rice and canned food provided by the World Food Program and distributed them to nearly 50,000 Tacloban residents. But even there, where the bulk of assistance has been delivered, bodies still lined the streets because, authorities said, there were not enough hands to remove them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hundreds of additional Marines are expected to arrive in the Philippines by week's end to bolster the relief effort, which has struggled against logistical hurdles and the scale of the devastation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aid has yet to reach many victims of the typhoon, known by Filipinos as Yolanda, particularly on outlying islands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The major challenge is logistics,\" said Mathias Eick, a regional spokesman for the European Commission's humanitarian aid directorate. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities — military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross — trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the logistical problems eased Wednesday, as remote airstrips and major roads were cleared of debris. However, fuel shortages and lack of power remain problems in rural areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The longer the aid takes to arrive, the more people try to leave. Every day, desperate residents gather at Tacloban airport hoping for a spot on one of the departing supply planes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a very natural decision to take,\" Eick said. \"However, that of course makes it difficult for aid agencies to find out where people are going to, where people are staying, and how much is needed in the various towns.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With much of the aid headed to Tacloban, on the island of Leyte, concern is growing for other hard-hit communities, such as the port of Ormoc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is enough food in Ormoc for about two or three days, but if aid doesn't come through soon ... the situation could descend into chaos,\" said Julien Anseau, a spokesman for the U.S.-based aid group ChildFund International. \"What we are seeing is aid coming into Ormoc, but it's not staying in Ormoc, it's going on to Tacloban.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An assessment team from the international aid group Doctors Without Borders visited Guiuan, in Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon first made landfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The village has been flattened — houses, medical facilities, rice fields, fishing boats, all destroyed. People are living out in the open; there are no roofs left standing in the whole of Guiuan,\" team leader Alexis Moens said in a statement. \"The needs are immense, and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organizations.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defending the relief effort, Philippine Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras said Wednesday that major roads have been cleared of debris and authorities have reached all but four affected areas to assess the needs. Additional logistics hubs are being established in Ormoc and at an airstrip in Guiuan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aid deliveries will accelerate, Almendras told reporters. \"It's just we have not seen anything on the magnitude that we are talking now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid the devastation, there were heartwarming moments of resilience. Daryl Dano flew from Manila to Tacloban to search for her family, whom she found alive. When she arrived in the morning, she said residents were busy sifting through the vast fields of debris for anything they could salvage. But at night, she said, she was amazed to see people light a bonfire and gather in a circle to sing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They were sitting like Boy Scouts, sharing survival stories and what they did,\" she said. \"They were sometimes even making jokes about the destruction around them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I asked them why or how they could laugh?\" she said. A person replied, \"I just have to think happy thoughts. This is my second life.

A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached.

Many of these elaborate contraptions include all bells and whistles -- sometimes literally -- to prevent such mistakes.

In the gentlemen's own words: \"(T)he features of the dead can be viewed at any time without removing the cover. This enables friends of the deceased who may have been absent at the time of the death and funeral to view the said deceased at any time they may wish. This construction also enables the body to be watched for any desired length of time, in cases where there may be doubt as to whether the body may be dead or in a trance state, until it revives or all doubt is removed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out that \"effectually adjusting and closing the eyelids of corpses in such manner as to impart thereto an undisturbed or natural appearance,\" was a difficult feat to perform in 1891 when J.M. Spear applied for a patent for his \"Corpse Eye Closer.\" Spear's contraption, a rounded piece of metal with sharp, angled teeth, is meant to be slipped between the eyeball and the eyelid of the deceased. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can a torch of burning sulfur really keep a body from decomposing? Graham Hamrick thought so. In 1888, Hamrick devised a complicated process of embalming that included a plethora of chemicals and a burning sulfur torch that needed to be relit on a regular basis. The record shows it took more than four years for his patent to be approved, but Hamrick defended his process: \"Subjects preserved by my procedure above set forth involving treatment for the longer period of about 40 days have been kept for many months through the hottest weather, in the open air, in a perfectly natural condition, and without any decomposition. I am unable to assign any limit to the continual preservation of such embalmed bodies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Improvement in Poison Bottles: James W. Bowles; Oct. 10, 1876 During the 19th century, losing your poison among the assortment of other -- non-lethal -- liquids and tonics in your collection was evidently a common mishap. Or at least James W. Bowles thought as much, so he set out to solve that problem in 1876 with his coffin-shaped bottles. Bowles explains in his patent: \"(T)he peculiar shape of the bottle serves as a warning against the careless use of the contents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A decade before the turn of the century, John H. Chambers submitted a patent to systematically remove decomposition fluid from caskets -- which no longer needed to be buried, given his upright, contained design: \"I am aware that it is not new to provide for the removal from the coffin of the fluid in a matter created by the decomposition of the body, and I do not seek to cover such, broadly. Neither do I claim, broadly, the process of embalming, as I am aware that it has long been the practice to embalm bodies after death; but so far as I am aware it never has been proposed to embalm the body and then provide for the exclusion of the air and the removal of the fluid matter from the coffin. This is important. I also attach importance to the employment of the disinfecting-trap in the outlet-pipe to the coffin.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Decomposing human bodies have a unique smell — one that distinguishes them from other rotting animals, according to new research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Specifically, human corpses emit a unique five-chemical cocktail — comprised of 3-methylbutyl pentanoate, 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate — that separates them from the rest of the animal kingdom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These five chemicals are part of a group of molecules called esters, which are also responsible for the strong, sharp smells emitted by fruits like pineapples and raspberries, reports The Guardian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Death Photos of Infamous and Controversial Leaders NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The human smell of death, in other words, is a little bit fruity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In collecting gases off of six humans and 26 different animals, researchers identified 452 distinct chemical compounds. Eight of those were specific to humans and pigs, and the five esters were unique to humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The esters are produced by degrading muscles, carbohydrates and fat tissues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pigs and humans share biological similarities, from growing similar hair to having the same gut flora. For that reason, pigs have been used in most previous decomposition studies. The new research is the first to look at how the two similar animals decompose in the same conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding might seem ghoulishly superfluous, but the information has value. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Patenting Death NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The mixture of (these) compounds might be used in the future to more specifically train cadaver dogs,” analytical chemist Eva Cuypers told Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It may also be useful in assisting party planning for the living: Increasingly elaborate Halloween parties have started to incorporate the smell of death as part of the Halloween experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With advancements in the science of the smell of death, then, holiday terror can come in the form of the faint hint of pineapple — as well as a toothless man in an orange jumpsuit accosting you from behind a hay bale.\nPassage 2:\nIn the aftermath of California’s recent forest fires, cadaver dogs sniffed beyond burning homes, charred forest, and even other dead animals to pick up the unique scent of human victims. A new study reveals how they might have done it: Decomposing humans seem to release a singular chemical cocktail, one that scientists might be able to use to better train cadaver dogs and even develop machines that could do the same job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers have been trying to understand the “smell of death” for more than a decade. Two papers kicked off the effort in 2004, one from a Tennessee research station called the Body Farm that evaluated gases released late in decomposition, and the other from Greece, which looked at the early stages of the process. Since then, the list of carbon-based, or organic, compounds given off during decay has grown quite long, but there have been conflicting reports about which ones are emitted only by humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2010 the Belgian Disaster Victim Identification Team asked analytical chemist Eva Cuypers and her forensic toxicology lab at the University of Leuven in Belgium for help finding the best way to train cadaver dogs to pick out human scents. Cuypers’s graduate student Elien Rosier started by putting tissue samples and organs from six autopsied corpses in jars in a lab closet. The jars’ screw caps, which let in some air, had stoppered holes that allowed her to periodically take samples of the gases building up inside. She set up other jars with pig, mouce, mole, rabbit, turtle, frog, sturgeon, or bird remains. Pig remains in particular have often been used in past decomposition studies because of their similarities to human bodies (which are often hard to come by): They have the same microbes in their guts, the same percentage of body fat, and similar hair as people. But it was not clear whether the decomposition process was the same because the two species had never been studied under identical conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosier identified the compounds in the collected gases and compared them among species. Over 6 months, she found 452 organic compounds. At first, sulfur-containing compounds seemed to distinguish the different species, but they were not unique to humans or even present in all humans. Further, they disappeared over time. Compounds called esters, a big component of animal fat, looked more promising. Ultimately, eight compounds distinguished pig and human remains from those of other animals, and five esters separated pigs from humans, the researchers report this month in PLOS ONE. “The mixture of [these] compounds might be used in the future to more specifically train cadaver dogs,” Cuypers says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding is important because “so far there [hasn’t been] any study based on monitoring human and pig carcasses under exactly the same conditions,” says Agapios Agapiou, an analytical chemist at the University of Cyprus in Nicosia who was not involved with the work. “But there are still many steps before creating a synthetic substance to train cadaver dogs.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think there’s one specific thing that says it’s human,” adds John Sagebiel, an analytical chemist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was also uninvolved in the study. He says relying solely on analytical chemistry to determine what cadaver dogs are sniffing out is too limited. It would be better to work with the dogs themselves to figure that out, he adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Arpad Vass, who is associated with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Body Farm and has compiled a list of compounds released by decomposing humans, points out that the use of specific tissues—versus a whole body—and the isolation of those tissues in jars means the researchers are looking at just a subset of the bacteria and other environmental factors that influence decomposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cuypers says her team plans to address some of these shortfalls in future studies. “The next step in our research is to see whether the same compounds are found in buried, full decomposing bodies in the field and to see whether dogs trained on the mixture respond more specific[ally] to human decomposing bodies.” If this cocktail passes muster, the find could pave the way for developing an electronic nose that can do what dogs do, she adds.\nPassage 3:\nIn this study, a validated method using a thermal desorber combined with a gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment during a period of 6 months. 452 compounds were identified. Among them a human specific marker was sought using principle component analysis. We found a combination of 8 compounds (ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, pyridine, diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide and 3-methylthio-1-propanol) that led to the distinction of human and pig remains from other animal remains. Furthermore, it was possible to separate the pig remains from human remains based on 5 esters (3-methylbutyl pentanoate, 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate). Further research in the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and search for one or more human specific markers. These markers would allow a more efficiently training of cadaver dogs or portable detection devices could be developed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decomposition can be influenced by many environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil type, submersion of the body [ 23 ]. Therefore, it is difficult to compare results of research groups that study the decomposing remains outdoors. In this study, we sampled the headspace of 6 human and 26 animal remains that decomposed for 6 months. This study was conducted in glass jars in laboratory environment to pre-concentrate and therefore easily sample the released VOCs. It is also a manner to standardize the methodology with control of the parameters such as temperature and moisture, as much as possible. These samples were collected and analyzed with a validated method using thermal desorber combined with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) [ 12 ]. When the VOC-profiles of human and animal remains were identified, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the results to search for (a) human specific marker(s). The aim of our study was to identify VOCs specific for human decomposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, a variety of forensic disciplines could benefit from these human specific markers. Mainly in the search of human bodies or remains. Thanks to their good olfactory capacity, cadaver dogs are able to locate bodies [ 17 , 21 ]. At this moment, mostly nonspecific compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine are used to train these dogs. They can find human cadavers with this training, but the use of artificial scents is highly debated. Cadaver dogs trained with these scents did not always react on real cadaver samples (data derived from dog handlers of the Federal Police in Belgium). Training aids appear to be an oversimplification of the decomposition odor [ 22 ]. A human specific marker can be used to train cadaver dogs more efficiently and therefore win time to locate a body. Moreover, when a human specific marker is found, it might be possible to develop a portable device that is sensitive enough to locate human remains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the decomposition of human and animal remains, a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is emitted in the environment. The past few years, the research to characterize this ‘smell of death’ has increased and a wide variety of compounds has already been identified: alkanes, alcohols, acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic, sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds [ 1 – 19 ]. Pig remains are often used as human analogues ( Table 1 ) because of their similarity in hair coverage, weight, fat to muscle ratio, gut fauna and biochemistry [ 5 , 16 , 20 ]. However, the VOC-profiles of human and animal remains were hardly compared, notwithstanding the fact that they could be interesting to find a human specific marker. The following research groups compared human and animal remains. Degreeff et al. reported that phenylethene and methyl benzoate were more specific for human than animal remains [ 3 ]. Cablk et al. compared their experimental results of animal remains with literature results of human remains. They found 11 compounds published on human research which they could not detect in their animal study [ 2 ]. Vass suggested that carbon tetrachloride, pentane, decane and undecane appeared to be human specific. Additionally, he saw that 2-methylbutanal was always greater than 3-methylbutanal in the animal remains he studied (pig, deer, dog, cat, squirrel and sheep). However, in human remains he noted that this phenomenon was reversed or that both compounds were equal to each other [ 19 ]. Clearly, there are still inconsistencies in literature of the human specific compounds and more research has to be done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The compounds were identified in every sample and collected in spreadsheets. Based on these tables, the frequency of detection for every compound over a period of one, three or six months was calculated as a percentage for every species. The number of compounds for each chemical class (e.g. in 10 samples we saw 3 different alkanes) was expressed as a percentage of the total number of identified compounds. Based on these percentages a PCA-test was performed. The number of observations for each chemical class was also expressed as a percentage of the total observations (e.g. in 10 samples we saw 20 times an alkane). A PCA-test was conducted on these percentages too. Both tests were done after one, three and six months of sampling. After conducting these two PCA’s, the chemical classes (loadings) that were responsible for differences between human and animal remains were further investigated. In this PCA, the VOCs within the chemical class were analyzed using the prevalence of a VOC during the sampling period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To better understand all the data from the species gathered during six months of sampling and to determine if there were differences between human and animal remains, PCA was conducted by The Unscrambler X (CAMO Software). PCA is a multivariate data analysis that can be used when dimensionality of the data is high and where the possibility of replication is low [ 7 ]. The information is projected in principal components (PC). Multiple PC’s can be used. For every PC, every component that is analyzed in the PCA receives a loading. This loading represents how important this component is in a PC to give variation in the scores (in this study, the species). PC-1 contains the greatest source of information, PC-2 gives less information than PC-1, …. Every PC receives a percentage that indicates how much of the variance in the scores is explained using this PC. PC’s can be plotted in a bi- or tri-dimensional system to visualize all the information of a complex dataset. In this study, PC-1 was always plotted with PC-2. In the score-plot, similarities and differences can be detected in the scores, this means for this study: similarities and differences between human and animal remains. The closer the scores are to each other, the more similar they are with respect to the PC’s used. A score-plot has to be interpreted together with a loading-plot. In this loading-plot, the loadings or variables (in this study the VOCs) that are responsible for differences between scores can be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The VOCs were analyzed using a validated TD-GC/MS method (Turbomatrix 150: Perkin Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium; 6890N-GC and 5975B-MS: Agilent Technologies, Diegem, Belgium) [ 12 ]. The TD was used to desorb the VOCs from the sorbent tubes. The sorbent tube was heated to 300°C for 30 min in the primary desorption. The VOCs were transported to a Tenax-coated cold trap, held at 0°C, due to a continuous flow of helium (40 mL/min). The VOCs are pre-concentrated on the cold trap. Secondary desorption was accomplished by heating the trap to 250°C at a temperature rate of 99°C/s and this temperature was maintained for 25 min. The VOCs were injected onto the GC-column (VF-624ms, 60 m x 0.25 mm x 1.4 μm) via a transfer line at 250°C. The temperature of the GC oven was held at 40°C for 1 min, increased to 80°C at 1°C/min, to 120°C at 3°C/min, to 250°C at 5°C/min and maintained this latter temperature for 10 min with a total GC-runtime of 90,33 minutes. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant pressure of 29 psi. The GC/MS interface was kept at a constant temperature of 280°C. The electron impact ion source was used in positive mode at a temperature of 230°C. The quadrupole mass analyzer was kept at 150°C. Full scan spectra were recorded in a mass range of 15–400 amu. The VOCs were identified using NIST98 mass spectral library. For correct identification, the MS spectra match factor was minimum 70%. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The air above the samples was drawn through sorbent tubes (prepacked Tenax TA tubes; 200 mg, 89 mm x 6.4 mm o.d.; Camsco, Houston, Texas) for 20 min at a rate of 100 mL/min using an ACTI-VOC pump (Markes, Frankfurt, Germany). After sampling, the sorbent tubes were closed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) analytical caps. The air was sampled twice a week for the first month; once a week for the next three months and once a month until the samples had decomposed in the jar for 6 months. The sorbent tubes were conditioned prior to sampling for 1 h at 320°C at a flow rate of 100 mL/min helium (Praxair, Schoten, Belgium). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The human remains samples were collected during autopsies. Autopsy samples were directly received from The Institute of Forensic Medicine, University Hospital of Leuven, Belgium ( https://www.uzleuven.be/en/forensic-medicine ). For our study of human remains, in which no informed consent was necessary because of the donation of anonymous autopsy samples, approval was received from the Medical Ethics Committee of the faculty of Medicine of the University Hospital of Leuven, Belgium. For the animal remains, it was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Leuven, Belgium (P121/2013). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Human and animal remains were allowed to decompose at room temperature in glass jars closed with metal screw caps (1,062 L; Covera Packaging NV, Hoboken, Belgium). In these screw caps, a hole, which was sealed in between sampling, was made to allow headspace sampling. Since the screw caps were not completely air tight, oxygen could enter the glass jar and thus aerobic decomposition was ensured. This study was carried out in laboratory environment to create a concentrated environment and a similar environment between the decomposing remains. In Table 2 , the animal species that are used in this study can be found. These animal remains were chosen based on (1) the availability of dead animals and (2) the wide variety of animals useful in this study. For human and pig remains, different organs were removed and stored in the glass jars ( Table 3 ). The human remains were derived from six different bodies. An empty glass jar was placed in the same closet where all the samples were located. The headspace in the empty jar was sampled as a blank once a week together with the other samples. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deduced from the PCA-plot of the ketones ( S2 Fig ), there is no clear separation of the human remains. They are pulled to the lower part on the score-plot when decomposition is more advanced. This can be explained by a combination of ketones. However, none of these ketones were observed in all human samples neither were they specific for human remains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A PCA was conducted on the esters after one, three and six months ( Fig 7 ). After three and six months, the plot can be divided in two groups. Human and pig remains, moles and frogs are grouped at the right side of the y-axis. Only H c and H f were situated at the left. This separation in two groups is caused by a combination of esters. These esters are not specific for this group, but they had a higher prevalence during the sampling period. Looking at these compounds, the most important esters to search for a human specific marker are ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate and ethyl pentanoate. These esters were commonly found in human and pig remains, except for H c and H f. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the PCA-plot of the alcohols ( S1 Fig ), the human remains dwell to the right side of the y-axis together with other species (Ml, P, F and R b). The alcohols with the highest X-loadings are ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Those are compounds that were seen in almost every species and therefore not human specific. They have higher loadings because they were more frequently observed in these species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Fig 6 , the result of the PCA that was conducted on the nitrogen-containing compounds after six months can be seen. Human remains are situated mostly in the upper left quadrant of the score-plot. Human remains a and c are pulled to the other side of the y-axis by pyrazines (2,5-dimethylpyrazine, trimethylpyrazine and tetramethylpyrazine) that were found in high percentages in these two samples. In the loading-plot indole, pyridine and skatole are found in the upper part. Indole was found in most of the species and was therefore not human specific. Skatole was only found in high percentages in sturgeon and occasionally in rabbits, chicks and human remains d. The prevalence of pyridine in human remains ranged from 53 to 96%. Human remains b was the only sample in which no pyridine was identified. This can be explained by the chromatogram: the peak of pyridine was between the overloaded peak of dimethyl disulfide and the overloaded peak of 3-methyl-1-butanol. There is a possibility that pyridine was under those peaks in the chromatogram of human remains b. Pyridine was only seen occasionally in a few other species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A PCA-plot was performed on the sulphur-containing compounds. In Fig 5 , the score- and loading-plots are shown after six months of sampling. The human remains are situated in the lower part of the score-plot, with the exception of human remains c. The compounds that are causing this variance are 3-methylthio-1-propanol, methylisobutyl disulfide, SO 2 , methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, CS 2 , methyl hexyl disulfide, H 2 S, methanethiol, methylethyl disulfide, methylisopropyl disulfide and 1-methylthioheptane. None of these compounds are uniquely found in human remains, nor are they found in all the human remains. Hence, this shift of the human samples was probably based on a combination of these compounds. However, there are three compounds that are interesting: (1) 3-methylthio-1-propanol was found in four of the six human samples (not in H c and H f), as well in pig, moles and frogs; (2) methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide was detected in five human samples (not in H f) and in pig, rabbits, moles, chicks, woodpecker and unidentified birds; (3) diethyl disulfide was identified in four of six human samples (not in H c and H f) and in the pig remains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After one month, the sulphur-containing compounds are the most important compounds that devide the species in the y-direction in the plot. However, after three months, the sulphur-containing compounds diminished. In Fig 4 , the percentage of nitrogen-containing compounds over time is shown for human remains a and mouse b (these two species can be found in a different quadrant in Figs 2 and 3 ). During the decomposition, the percentage of nitrogen-containing compounds increases. For both species, the loading of the nitrogen-containing compounds in the PCA are similary increasing over time. So this increase is not dependent on the species. When looking at the number of observations of the alcohols, an elevation in loading is observed during time which makes this chemical class interesting. Looking deeper into PC-1 (x-axis), esters and ketones are the chemical classes with the highest loadings and therefore the most important chemical classes that can explain the variance in the score-plot. Therefore, we will go further into these five chemical classes in the search for a human specific compound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Fig 1 , an overview is shown of the number of decomposition days and samples that were taken from every species after one, three and six months. The number of samples varied sometimes because of technical issues whereby samples could not be taken or analyzed. It is important to know that in the first month of sampling, the fresh and bloating stage were ended for every species and they were already in the active or advanced decay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During 6 months, 452 VOCs were found in the headspace of the decomposing remains. Almost every chemical class was represented: alkanes (27), alkenes (28), aromatic compounds (17), cyclic compounds (13), ethers (13), alcohols (44), ketones (55), aldehydes (18), acids (11), esters (66), sulphur-containing compounds (77), nitrogen-containing compounds (71), halogen-containing compounds (7) and others (5). In the blank jar, traces from the laboratory environment (acetic acid, 2-propanone, ethyl ether, dichloromethane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, chloroform) and from the jar itself (triacetin, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) were found. Also degradation products of the sorbent tube were identified (benzaldehyde, acetophenone, higher aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, decanal)). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only three research groups suggested human specific compounds previously in literature. In Table 4, a comparison was made between these compounds and the compounds that were found in our study here. Five compounds were not seen in animal remains and therefore still possible human specific markers. However, they were also not seen in human remains in our study. The setup of the study conducted by Degreeff et al. was different from our study since full bodies were used. Also the sampling method was different in the study of Degreeff et al. and Cablk et al. They used solid phase microextraction (SPME) compared to TD. It is possible that due to differences in setup, sampling and analysis method, these compounds were not released or detected in our study [6, 7, 10]. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our study, it was not possible to separate the human remains from all the animal remains. However, a combination of eight VOCs is suggested to be human and pig specific: diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, 3-methylthio-1-propanol, pyridine, ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate and ethyl pentanoate. When a PCA was conducted using only these eight compounds, the score-plot could be divided in two groups with on the right side the human and pig remains, with the exception of human remains f (Fig 8a). It must be noted that different remains were frozen before decomposition was started. Bacteria species may change since bacteria can be knocked down during freezing. Therefore, VOCs released during the decomposition can differ. For that reason, PCA-plot was done over without the frozen samples (H a, H d, T, Wo, Wa and B a) with five extra human samples from a follow-up experiment (H g-k) (Fig 8b). Already after one month of decomposition, separation of human and pig remains could be seen (with the exception of H f) which corroborate previous results.

The two sulfides, diethyl disulfide and methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide can be formed during the degradation of methionine and cysteine, the sulphur-containing amino acids [4, 9, 16, 26]. Also other well-documented sulfides were detected in high concentrations in this study (dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide). However, the latterly mentioned sulfides were not unique for human remains since they were seen in all animal remains in this study as well as in previous decomposition studies [2–9, 12, 14–19]. Notice that in 2 human remains (H c and H f), these human and pig specific sulphur-containing compounds (3-methylthio-1-propanol, diethyl disulfide and methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide) were not detected. This might be due to the fact that these compounds were only found in very small trace amounts. It could be possible that the smaller amount of muscles in H c and H f, and therefore smaller amount of sulphur-containing amino acids, is responsible for the lower number of sulphur-containing compounds (22 and 17 respectively) than the average human sample (27,6). 3-methylthio-1-propanol and diethyl disulfide were not detected in H c. These remains were already decomposing for three weeks before the samples were taken. Since the sulphur-containing compounds are less important further in time, this can explain why H c is lying in the upper part of the score plot, separated from the other human remains. 3-methylthio-1-propanol was previously only detected by Forbes et al. and Kasper et al. in pig and mice remains respectively [6, 9]. Until now, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide and diethyl disulfide were not detected in other decomposition studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nitrogen-containing compounds are released during the decomposition of proteins and nucleic acids [4, 23]. The most discussed nitrogen-containing VOCs of decomposition are cadaverine and putrescine since they are assumed to be key compounds in cadaver dog alerting [17]. Putrescine and cadaverine are released after decarboxylation of arginine and lysine respectively [15, 26]. Both compounds were not detected in this or other decomposition studies. Probably because of their low volatility or because they are quickly metabolized by bacteria after they are released [4, 15, 17]. Dekeirsschieter et al. suggested that 2-piperidone could be a metabolite of cadaverine. They detected this compound in the headspace of all their decaying pig carcasses [4]. Also in this study, 2-piperidone was found, occasionally in the chicks and once in human remains c. Pyridine was frequently found in all human remains but one. It was also not detected in the pig remains. Pyridine is a solvent and reagent that is often used in a laboratory environment. This could explain the occasionally identifications in other species, however not for the human remains samples since blanks and species that were sampled the same day as human remains samples were negative for pyridine. Therefore, it is unlikely to originate from the laboratory environment. Pyridine is not abundant in nature. It was previously detected by Statheropoulos et al. and Dekeirsschieter et al. in human and pig remains (only in forest environment) respectively [4, 16]. Statheropoulos et al. suggested that pyridine was originating from niacin [16], also called vitamin B3. This is a precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Niacin can be synthesized in the body from tryptophan or it is found in high concentrations in organ meat, fish, whole grain products and legumes [27]. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Esters are described to be degradation products of muscles, fat tissue and carbohydrates [4, 16]. Kasper et al. suggested that esters are derived from the reaction from acids with alcohols. Since butanoic acid is detected during all the stages and the most prominent acid, they especially found esters from butanoic acid [9]. In this study, a lot of esters were also derived from butanoic acid, but other esters were found as well. Ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate and ethyl pentanoate, the suggested human and pig specific markers in this study, were also found in other pig studies [6, 7, 10]. Kasper et al. detected propyl butyrate and ethyl pentanoate in decomposing mice, though it was not found in mice in this study [9]. During the analyses of the esters, the combination of ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, ethyl 3-methylbutyrate and ethyl butyrate were interesting, but not specific for human remains. Most of the time, they were detected in frogs, moles, pig and human remains. When these compounds were used in a PCA, two groups could be defined (Fig 9a). In the group at the right of the y-axis, carnivores and omnivores can be found. It is possible that the diet or bacteria in their intestines differ from herbivores and that this has an influence on the production of these compounds. Only F b, H c and H f were at the left side of the y-axis. The number of esters was also lower in human remains c and f (9 and 14 vs. 24 (average)). Probably because of a lower amount of fat tissue (H c) and muscles (H c and H f) that was decomposing in the samples. Some birds (Sp, St, Ro and Wo) are also carnivores or omnivores. They are not situated on the right of the plot, but there is a difference with the other herbivores (R, M and Wa). Those three esters were already found in pig and human decomposition studies [6–8, 10, 14]. Kasper et al. found ethyl 2-methylbutyrate and ethyl butyrate in mice remains, although they were fed with hay food pellets [9]. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In all the previous PCA’s, pig and human remains are very similar. This supports the use of pig remains as human analogues [1, 4–7, 10, 11, 13, 16]. However, pig remains could be separated from human remains based on five esters (3-methylbutyl pentanoate, 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate) (Fig 9b). To the best of our knowledge, only butyl pentanoate was identified previously in literature, by Dekeirsschieter et al. in pig remains [4]. This separation is based on one sample of pig remains, which could be not representative. Therefore, this aspect will be investigated further to see if human and pig remains can be separated and a human specific marker can be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It should be pointed out however, that there are limitations in our study. Because of the use of glass jars only parts of organs and tissues of humans and pigs could be decomposed. It remains uncertain if other VOCs are released when full bodies are used. However, different tissue (fat tissue, muscle and liver) was sampled, whenever it was possible, to replicate the full body, intestines were added to have the main bacteria that start the decomposition. Using this experimental setup, VOCs could be concentrated in the jars that allowed easy sampling. Another limiting factor of this setup was the absence of environmental parameters that can influence the decomposition and therefore the VOCs that are released. Further investigation in the field with full bodies will have to confirm these results. It should also be noted that using MS identification alone, it is not possible to conclusively identify highly branched esters. However, we could unequivocally identify the human and pig specific compounds when comparing them to the standards (except for methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, 3-methyl butyl pentanoate and 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate; for these compounds, standards were not commercially available). Notwithstanding its limitations, this study is an important step in the search for human specific markers where VOC-profiles of animal and human remains are identified in a same setup with the identical sampling and analysis method and the profiles could be compared.\n", "answers": ["Thanks to a team of researchers from Belgium, we may be close to synthesizing and, yes, possibly even bottling and selling the smell of human death, Discovery reports. Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four things you should know about Antarctica NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antarctica is shedding ice at an accelerating rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Satellites monitoring the state of the White Continent indicate some 200 billion tonnes a year are now being lost to the ocean as a result of melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is pushing up global sea levels by 0.6mm annually - a three-fold increase since 2012 when the last such assessment was undertaken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists report the new numbers in the journal Nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Governments will need to take account of the information and its accelerating trend as they plan future defences to protect low-lying coastal communities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers say the losses are occurring predominantly in the West of the continent, where warm waters are getting under and melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We can't say when it started - we didn't collect measurements in the sea back then,\" explained Prof Andrew Shepherd, who leads the Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (Imbie). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But what we can say is that it's too warm for Antarctica today. It's about half a degree Celsius warmer than the continent can withstand and it's melting about five metres of ice from its base each year, and that's what's triggering the sea-level contribution that we're seeing,\" he told BBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Shepherd: \"The study incorporates 24 independent satellite assessments\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Space agencies have been flying satellites over Antarctica since the early 1990s. Europe, in particular, has an unbroken observation record going back to 1992. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These spacecraft can tell how much ice is present by measuring changes in the height of the ice sheet and the speed at which it moves towards the sea. Specific missions also have the ability to weigh the ice sheet by sensing changes in the pull of gravity as they pass overhead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Imbie's job has been to condense all this information into a single narrative that best describes what is happening on the White Continent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glaciologists usually talk of three distinct regions because they behave slightly differently from each other. In West Antarctica, which is dominated by those marine-terminating glaciers, the assessed losses have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year over the full period from 1992 to 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land that points up to South America, the losses have risen from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. This is largely, say scientists, because the floating ice platforms sitting in front of some glaciers have collapsed, allowing the ice behind to flow faster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR East Antarctica, the greater part of the continent, is the only region to have shown some growth. Much of this region essentially sits out of the ocean and collects its snows over time and is not subject to the same melting forces seen elsewhere. But the gains are likely quite small, running at about five billion tonnes per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the Imbie team stresses that the growth cannot counterbalance what is happening in the West and on the Peninsula. Indeed, it is probable that an unusually big dump of snow in the East just before the last assessment in 2012 made Antarctica as a whole look less negative than the reality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Globally, sea levels are rising by about 3mm a year. This figure is driven by several factors, including the expansion of the oceans as they warm. But what is clear from the latest Imbie assessment is that Antarctica is becoming a significant player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A three-fold increase now puts Antarctica in the frame as one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise,\" said Prof Shepherd, who is affiliated to Leeds University, UK. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The last time we looked at the polar ice sheets, Greenland was the dominant contributor. That's no longer the case.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In total, Antarctica has shed some 2.7 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, corresponding to an increase in global sea level of more than 7.5mm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: European satellites in particular have an unbroken record going back to 1992 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest edition of the journal Nature has a number of studies looking at the state of the continent and how it might change in a warming world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of these papers, led by US and German scientists, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It should lift up - something scientists call isostatic readjustment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New evidence suggests where this process has occurred in the past, it can actually constrain ice losses - as the land rises, it snags on the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's like applying the brakes on a bike,\" said Dr Pippa Whitehouse from Durham University. \"Friction on the bottom of the ice, which was floating but has now grounded again, slows everything and changes the whole dynamic upstream. We do think the rebound (in the future) will be fast, but not fast enough to stop the retreat we've kicked off with today's warming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Ocean warming is going to make the ice too thin for this process to help.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pippa Whitehouse: \"Push a balloon filled with honey - it rebounds when you remove your hand\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Imbie's last assessment, the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-levels was considered to be tracking at the lower end of the projections that computer simulations had made of the possible height of the oceans at the end of the century. The new assessment sees the contribution track the upper end of these projections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At the moment, we have projections going through to 2100, which is sort of on a lifetime of what we can envisage, and actually the sea-level rise we will see is 50/60cm,\" said Dr Whitehouse. \"And that is not only going to impact people who live close to the coast, but actually when we have storms - the repeat time of major storms and flooding events is going to be exacerbated,\" she told BBC News.

In a study released Wednesday, June 13, 2018, an international team of ice experts said the melting of Antarctica is accelerating at an alarming... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — The melting of Antarctica is accelerating at an alarming rate, with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992, an international team of ice experts said in a new study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the last quarter century, the southern-most continent's ice sheet — a key indicator of climate change — melted into enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet (4 meters), scientists calculated. All that water made global oceans rise about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From 1992 to 2011, Antarctica lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice a year (76 billion metric tons). From 2012 to 2017, the melt rate increased to more than 241 billion tons a year (219 billion metric tons), according to the study Wednesday in the journal Nature . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" said University of California Irvine's Isabella Velicogna, one of 88 co-authors. \"Things are happening. They are happening faster than we expected.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Part of West Antarctica, where most of the melting occurred, \"is in a state of collapse,\" said co-author Ian Joughin of the University of Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is the second of assessments planned every several years by a team of scientists working with NASA and the European Space Agency. Their mission is to produce the most comprehensive look at what's happening to the world's vulnerable ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outside experts praised the work as authoritative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike single-measurement studies, this team looks at ice loss in 24 different ways using 10 to 15 satellites, as well as ground and air measurements and computer simulations, said lead author Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's possible that Antarctica alone can add about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century, Shepherd said. Seas also rise from melting land glaciers elsewhere, Greenland's dwindling ice sheet and the fact that warmer water expands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Under natural conditions we don't expect the ice sheet to lose ice at all,\" Shepherd said. \"There are no other plausible signals to be driving this other than climate change.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shepherd cautioned that this is not a formal study that determines human fingerprints on climate events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forces \"that are driving these changes are not going to get any better in a warming climate,\" said University of Colorado ice scientist Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who wasn't part of the study team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Antarctica, it's mostly warmer water causing the melt. The water nibbles at the floating edges of ice sheets from below. Warming of the southern ocean is connected to shifting winds, which are connected to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Shepherd said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 70 percent of the recent melt is in West Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest figures show East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice a year — about 31 tons (28 metric tons) — since 2012. It was gaining ice before 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far scientists are not comfortable saying the trend in East Antarctica will continue. It is likely natural variability, not climate change, and East Antarctica is probably going to be stable for a couple decades, said study co-author Joughin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another study in Nature on Wednesday found that East Antarctic ice sheet didn't retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twila Moon, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who wasn't part of the studies, said \"ice-speaking, the situation is dire.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Less than 24 hours after losing a primary contest to a tea party-backed economist, Cantor announced Wednesday afternoon that he will resign as leader July 31, but keep his seat until his term ends in January. He said that House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) would make an “outstanding” successor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While I may have suffered a personal setback last night, I couldn’t be more optimistic about the future of this country,” Cantor told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “I’m honored that I’ve had the privilege of serving the people of Virginia’s 7th District.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House Republicans plan to hold new leadership elections next Thursday, according to senior aides.

Boehner (R-Ohio) led a Wednesday afternoon meeting of the House Republican conference and thanked Cantor and his staff for their service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a speech I never expected to give,” Boehner said. He was in tears later as Cantor addressed his 232 Republican colleagues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor’s decision to leave his leadership post after losing Tuesday to economist Dave Brat came on a day that Republicans began scrambling to build support and fill the leadership vacuum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCarthy, the next in line after Boehner and Cantor, is preparing to run for majority leader, but will have competition from more conservative colleagues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, began texting colleagues Tuesday night asking to speak with them about his bid for majority leader. His top advisers were actively positioning him for the race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A confident Sessions predicted in an interview that he would beat McCarthy, arguing that his work to elect Republicans during the 2010 elections and his current leadership of powerful Rules Committee makes him ready to manage the House floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll be a majority leader who will be clear-headed about what we’re going to try to accomplish, putting more focus on what we’re trying to sell,” Sessions said, adding that he has a “strong and open” relationship with Boehner. “I know how to win.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The large Texas Republican delegation, which represents 10 percent of the entire House Republican Conference, planned to meet later Wednesday with the possibility of producing a unified front for Sessions or Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to be the Lone Star State’s favorite GOP son for a leadership slot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s unclear when elections would be held to succeed Cantor, something that will be out of his control. Republicans aligned with more establishment figures privately expressed interest in shortening the race, for fear that a seven-week race until the end of July would be an ideological battlefield that tears the caucus apart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next week’s planned leadership elections will allow a transition period for Cantor and his staff to leave his post. Allies of the majority leader described the timing of July 31 as one based largely on helping his staff make their moves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to stepping down as majority leader, Cantor told colleagues Wednesday that he will not run as a write-in candidate in November. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor returned to the Capitol Wednesday morning by sneaking into the building through a back door on the Senate side in hopes of avoiding reporters. He appeared stone-faced and tense, grimacing when asked by The Washington Post whether he would step down from his leadership post or resign from Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor, who has represented the Richmond suburbs since 2001, lost by 11 percentage points to Brat. The 51-year old had been considered the next generation’s GOP leader, who would take over for Boehner, 64,when he retired. In a caucus deeply divided between establishment Republicans and fire-breathing conservatives, these were the two who had shown some ability to keep order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCarthy hesitated even behind closed doors Wednesday morning to say he would run for majority leader, still stunned by the loss of his close friend, Cantor, according to aides not authorized to speak publicly about the unfolding leadership race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCarthy spent the morning in his spacious suite on the first floor of the Capitol, reaching out by telephone to more than 100 members, declining to go into details about his plans while hinting, with his appreciation for the encouragement, that he would run for majority leader. Later, he was seen huddling with several colleagues, including Reps. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.), Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Dennis A. Ross (R-Fla.), as he tries to shore up support and avoid competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A race between McCarthy and Sessions would revive a long-simmering rivalry. They both ran for whip in 2010, with McCarthy besting his older opponent. Ever since, Sessions, 59, has been eager to challenge McCarthy and is telling colleagues that an older, more conservative hand is needed near the top, aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With McCarthy seeking to climb the leadership ranks, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chief deputy whip, announced to his inner circle Wednesday morning that he will run for whip, the third-highest position in leadership, and throw his support behind McCarthy as majority leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roskam told The Washington Post that he would not comment out of respect to Cantor. He was seen heading to a meeting with his allies to discuss his path ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Roskam is expected to face competition from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee and is already privately whipping votes, and possibly Hensarling, according to aides familiar the jockeying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his conversations with colleagues, Scalise is making the case that he would serve as “a red state voice” in leadership ranks currently lacking a hardline conservative. Hensarling was seen huddling on the House floor Wednesday afternoon alongside House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a key conservative broker. Earlier, he had huddled with Reps. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a trio of renegade Republicans who rarely back leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a brief interview, Hensarling was coy, saying that he was still mulling a potential leadership run. But he was upbeat and smiling — somewhat unusual for the taciturn Republican — and enjoying the speculation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid all the activity, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), currently the fourth-ranking Republican as chairman of the House Republican Conference, said Wednesday that she wouldn’t be seeking a higher position, meaning the leadership contest will focus on the majority leader and whip jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner, meanwhile, appeared unfazed by the developments. He chatted Wednesday on the floor with close friends and avoided areas of the floor where McCarthy and others were chatting with colleagues. On Tuesday night, he stuck to his usual routine by hanging out with close friends and aides at an Italian restaurant that he likes near Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fast-paced developments left rank-and-file members stunned as the 233-member caucus began splintering off behind favored candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several conservatives said they were eager to see Cantor replaced by a southern conservative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I just think that there is a geographical area of the country that has not been represented in leadership and I think that could be the determining factor in what happens,” said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, (R-Ga.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked to further clarify which area of the country he thought the next majority leader should hail from, Westmoreland replied: “Get a map.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Rep. Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican close to Boehner, pushed back on suggestions that the next leader needs to be from the south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Where does it say that in the constitution?” he quipped to reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiberi cautioned that the tea party success in ousting Cantor doesn’t necessarily signal an oncoming insurgence of conservatives into the GOP House leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve been around this business for 14 years and I can’t remember when there hasn’t been an anti-Washington feeling,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) suggested that the GOP leadership team should have more equal political representation. “We need to have some people on there from red states as opposed to having all of them from blue states,” he told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a frequent critic of Boehner and Cantor, said he hopes to elect a leader with deeper roots in the conservative base of the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a widespread concern about the Republican establishment not listening to conservatives and so I think it had energized the tea party,” he said. “It’s certainly not dead as we found out last night.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other colleagues, still shellshocked by Tuesday’s stunning turn of events, just expressed condolences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m sorry my friend lost,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brat, meanwhile, appeared to struggle under fresh scrutiny of his upstart campaign. His campaign abruptly cancelled a scheduled news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sorry, we’re kind of flying by the seat-of-our pants today,” a staffer said, explaining that the campaign decided to develop a media strategy before talking again to the press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That decision came after Brat appeared on MSNBC to suggest that Cantor had lost touch with his district. Cantor “has not been present in the district,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was door-knocking, I know what was on the minds of the folks,” he added later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Brat appeared caught off guard by a barrage of policy questions. “I thought we were just going to chat today about the celebratory aspect,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wesley Lowery, Jackie Kucinich and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.\nPassage 2:\nEric Cantor — looking composed and even unusually at ease — went before the press on Wednesday afternoon and announced he’s stepping down as majority leader, ending an 11-year run in Republican leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The No. 2 House Republican called his defeat to an upstart primary challenger a “personal setback,” adding that his campaign team had done everything it could to win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The public appearance came after a closed-door speech to his colleagues earlier in which Cantor said that it “doesn’t have to be a bad day.” He was the recipient of several standing ovations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: The GOP leadership scramble) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Suffering is part of life, misery is a choice,” said Cantor, the only Jewish Republican in the House, quoting a Holocaust survivor. “As conservatives, we aren’t just the party of no. We really do believe in a better way of life.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor then addressed the national press corps, one day after his stunning defeat, dismissing the argument that he had absented himself too frequently from his Seventh District in Richmond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was in my district every week,” Cantor insisted emphatically. “There is a balance between holding a leadership position and serving constituents at home. Never was there a day that I did not put the constituents of the 7th district first and I will continue to do so.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He endorsed California Rep. Kevin McCarthy to succeed him as majority leader. The election will be held June 19, and Cantor plans to leave his post by the end of July. He’ll stay in the House until December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (PHOTOS: Scenes from Eric Cantor HQ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about his future plans, Cantor replied: “That’s probably between my wife and me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Addressing his colleagues earlier, Cantor’s words drove Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to tears. Leadership elections are slated for just eight days away on June 19, according to a source in the room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Winston Churchill once famously said: ‘Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,’” Boehner said, according to a source in the room. “As one who suffered a tough defeat myself in 1998, I can tell you there’s plenty of wisdom in that statement. Eric, we salute you, and we thank you, and your amazing staff as well. We’re losing a leader, but you’ll never stop being our colleague and our friend.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will seek the No. 2 job, which means two slots will open in the leadership hierarchy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: 5 takeaways from Cantor shocker) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor’s resignation as majority leader will be effective July 31. He’s not expected to leave Congress until his term ends in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cantor, who came to Capitol Hill in 2001, lost his primary election Tuesday night to Dave Brat, an economics professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va. — a historic defeat for someone who was assumed to be the next speaker of the House. Just hours after his loss, Cantor’s GOP colleagues began rallying support for leadership races. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy, the Californian who is now majority whip, held a meeting with his close allies to talk strategy about his run for leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCarthy is starting to build establishment support within the GOP Conference. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was seen leaving McCarthy’s office on the first floor of the Capitol. And Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan said in an interview he would support McCarthy for majority leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prior to a 1 p.m. House vote, a sizable group of young Republican lawmakers — including Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida — met to talk about who they would rally behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: Vampire writer challenging Brat) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), a McCarthy rival who chairs the House Rules Committee, has also begun rallying support in calls and text messages. He began Tuesday night, just after Cantor lost, with a mass text message saying he wanted to serve as majority leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sessions had ambitions to be whip following the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, but McCarthy had more support and the Texas Republican instead ended up as Rules chairman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of now, McCarthy is fielding calls, and speaking with many Republican lawmakers, but has not yet engaged in a formal campaign. His strategy will be to make his ascension appear to be the most logical choice for Republicans. He has the whip operation and piles of chits to win the race.\nPassage 3:\nThe jockeying among Republicans to replace Rep. Eric Cantor (Va.) as House majority leader began Wednesday within hours of his stunning primary loss and escalated when he announced he would step down early from his leadership post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambitious Republicans began working the phones, holding meetings and pigeonholing colleagues to line up support for their bids for two potential openings: majority leader and whip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ADVERTISEMENT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Cantor will stay on as majority leader through July 31, the election to replace him will take place on June 19, a week from Thursday, setting off a scramble among possible contenders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The current majority whip, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), faced an immediate challenge from Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) in his expected bid to become majority leader, the second-ranking leadership job behind Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Sessions cited his experience as chairman of the Rules Committee and before that as the House GOP campaign chief as his qualifications for the job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the issue of immigration seen as a factor in Cantor’s defeat, the conservative Texan said he would focus on border security — an indication he would be unlikely to work with Democrats on a broader overhaul to provide citizenship to illegal immigrants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think my strength is that I am a well-known conservative who will push for and want to have an agenda that I will go get the votes that is conservative, that is pro-business and solves the problems of the country,” Sessions said. “And I think that our focus on that will need to start with the border.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet Sessions moved so quickly that he may have irritated some members, who reported receiving a text message from him 20 minutes after Cantor’s defeat became official. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “How about waiting until the body's at the morgue?” one member said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCarthy opted to wait until Cantor had made his decision before campaigning to be the next majority leader, according to a source who was in McCarthy's office late Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “McCarthy said ‘We're not doing anything until Eric does what Eric's going to do, we're going to give him room to make his decision,’” the source told The Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In announcing his decision to step down, Cantor made clear that McCarthy would have his full support if he chooses to run for majority leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fast election could benefit McCarthy, a fellow GOP “Young Gun” who has spent years building up his base of support within the conference. Lawmakers also said they did not want a drawn-out election to distract from their agenda and leave time for outside conservative groups to try to influence the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner is officially neutral, spokesman Michael Steel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have important work to do and need to get the new leadership team in place as soon as possible,” he said. “And he has not endorsed anyone in any race.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside the meeting where Cantor announced his decision, Boehner made clear that he would run for Speaker again in the 114th Congress, lawmakers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Texas conservative, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, was also considering a bid for majority leader. Currently chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Hensarling served in the leadership until 2013 but has frequently voted against Boehner and Cantor in the year-and-a-half since he left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hensarling has played coy in recent weeks when asked whether he might challenge or seek to succeed Boehner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am humbled by the many people who have approached me about serving our Republican Conference in a different capacity in the future,” he said. “There are many ways to advance the causes of freedom and free enterprise, and I am prayerfully considering the best way I can serve in those efforts.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hensarling would have the support of Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a vocal second-term conservative who is gunning to be chairman of the Republican Study Committee in the next Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If McCarthy succeeds in the election to replace Cantor, his position would open up and the race for that potential post also heated up: Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) moved rapidly to challenge Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chief deputy whip who has been eyeing the spot for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s in for the whip’s race,” a source close to Roskam said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scalise is chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, and a GOP aide said on Wednesday that as soon as Cantor’s loss became official, he began receiving calls from colleagues urging him to run for majority whip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Obviously, no one saw Leader Cantor losing yesterday,” the aide said. “It was a tectonic shift that caught everyone off guard.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scalise had been laying the groundwork for the race in the event Boehner decided to retire at year’s end, but he is now prepared to run whenever the opening occurs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Regardless of Leader Cantor’s position, he’s ready to go,” the aide said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R-Ohio), a close Boehner ally, told reporters that the Texas GOP delegation was meeting to discuss leadership possibilities, with both Sessions and Hensarling being discussed as potential Cantor replacements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiberi declined to endorse any candidates, but made it clear he was a fan of McCarthy and Roskam and that they had strong chances to move up the leadership pecking order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They both have a very successful tenure in their positions in leadership, and I think they have a lot of support within the conference generally speaking for the job that they’ve done,” Tiberi said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If McCarthy loses his bid to become majority leader, the position of whip would not open up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid the jockeying, the fourth-ranking Republican, Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), announced Wednesday that she would stay put rather than seek a promotion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After much encouragement from my colleagues, conversations with my family, and many prayers, I have decided to remain conference chair at this time,” said McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking Republican woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also staying out of the races will be Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the House Budget chief and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m not interested,” he told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), another respected conservative and former RSC chairman, also told The Hill he did not plan to run for any of the open positions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emerging battles will pit establishment Republicans close to Boehner like McCarthy and Roskam against conservatives likely to push the party further to the right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawmakers frustrated with the current leadership have spoken for months about the need to have more representation at the top from members who hail from deeply Republican states. Boehner, Cantor, McCarthy and McMorris Rodgers all represent states that President Obama carried in the last two presidential elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that when all of the key leaders are from blue and purple states, and the rank and file are from red states, it creates some tension, or miscommunications, or misunderstandings that occur in our conference right now,” Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said. “So I am hopeful that somewhere in the mix of new leadership there will be a strong red state advocate who is more reflective of the type of Republican that I represent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —This story was updated at 6:29 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Molly K.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new photos peel back another layer of secrecy for a relatively young world religion that has come under scrutiny for some of its beliefs as its numbers swelled in the Internet age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pictures of the smooth, egg-sized rock are part of a new book that also contains photos of the first printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon. Officials with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints unveiled the photos at a news conference in Salt Lake City. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The religion's drive in recent years to open its vaults and clarify sensitive tenets is aimed at filling a void on the Internet for accurate information as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades, Mormon scholars said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Church historian Steven E. Snow acknowledged that dynamic, saying: \"The Internet brings both challenge and opportunities. We're grateful for the opportunity to share much of collection through the use of the Internet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The church's campaign seems aimed at preventing current members from leaving and showing non-Mormons the faith has nothing to hide, said Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion and the James Bostwick chair of English at the University of Richmond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As an American-born religion much younger than most world religions, the origins of Mormonism have come under greater scrutiny and put pressure on the church to prove its stories, Givens said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history,\" Givens said. \"Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists and newspaper reporting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pictures in the new book show different angles of a stone that is dark brown with lighter brown swirls. The photos also show a weathered leather pouch where the stone was stored that is believed to be made by one of Joseph Smith's wives, Emma Smith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during Mormon pioneers' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. But it decided to publish the photos to allow people who prefer visuals to words to better understand the religion's roots, said Richard Turley, assistant church historian. The stone will remain in the vault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The picture brings a kind of tangibility to something that has been previously been talked about just in words,\" Turley said. \"That helps people connect with the past.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mormons believe that 185 years ago, Smith found gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian in upstate New York. They say God helped him translate the text using the stone and other tools, and it became known as the Book of Mormon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manuscript in the new book belongs to the Community of Christ, a faith that was created by early Mormons who stayed behind when most members of the religion moved west to Utah. A Community of Christ leader joined LDS officials at the press event Tuesday in what both said demonstrated the two faiths have moved on from past squabbles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith. It also has issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion's history that it once sidestepped, such as its past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The church paid a price for its past decisions to stay silent on topics or keep key artifacts in the vault, said Richard Bushman, a Mormon historian and emeritus professor at Columbia University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Their faithful members would stumble on information on the Internet. Not having heard about them, they were shocked and disillusioned,\" Bushman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today the church is taking a new approach by saying, \"We can face up to the facts. We don't have to make the picture prettier than it is,\" he said.\nPassage 2:\nHe dictated the narrative to various scribes, including schoolteacher Oliver Cowdery, who took down the LDS leader's words in longhand. Cowdery then painstakingly copied the original manuscript for the printer to set in type. More than 70 percent of that original document suffered water damage. The LDS Church History Library in Salt Lake City has most of what's left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"printer's copy,\" however, remained with Smith's followers who stayed in the Midwest rather than trekking to Utah, and, in 1903, it was purchased by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now the Community of Christ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through the years, tensions simmered between those two wings of Mormonism. But, during the past couple of decades, historians have built scholarly bridges between the Community of Christ and the much-larger, Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Community of Christ officials have been \"careful stewards of the manuscript,\" Snow said Tuesday. \"Both faiths are trying to move forward in sharing their collections.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Community of Christ minister and Seventy Robin Linkhart, who was at the news conference, praised her Utah colleagues for their part in the joint project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two-volume work, Linkhart said, \"truly is an exceptional contribution to the study of LDS history and culture, representing decades of research.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Begun by Mormon scholar Royal Skousen in 1988, she said, \"it's been a long, long journey to the finish line.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Community of Christ long ago accepted the notion that \"revelation includes a human component,\" said Lachlan Mackay, coordinator of the denomination's historic sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Independence, Mo.-based faith published articles about the seer stone as early as the 1960s, he said, but \"it might still be news to some people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm incredibly excited,\" Mackay said Tuesday. \"These efforts have served to unite us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both he and Richard E. Turley Jr., assistant LDS historian, said physical objects \"help us connect to the past, make it more realistic, more tangible.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a recent essay, the LDS Church explained how Smith, according to some accounts, used the seer stone. He peered into a hat, to block out exterior light, and \"read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure,\" the essay said. \"As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith also used two bound stones — known as the Urim and Thummim — as \"interpreters.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates,\" the essay added. \"Most of the accounts speak of Joseph's use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone).\"\nPassage 3:\nJoseph Smith said that the Book of Mormon was “the most correct of any Book on earth & the keystone of our religion & a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other Book.” 1 The Book of Mormon came into the world through a series of miraculous events. Much can be known about the coming forth of the English text of the Book of Mormon through a careful study of statements made by Joseph Smith, his scribes, and others closely associated with the translation of the Book of Mormon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “By the Gift and Power of God” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Smith reported that on the evening of September 21, 1823, while he prayed in the upper room of his parents’ small log home in Palmyra, New York, an angel who called himself Moroni appeared and told Joseph that “God had a work for [you] to do.”2 He informed Joseph that “there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.” The book could be found in a hill not far from the Smith family farm. This was no ordinary history, for it contained “the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior.”3 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The angel charged Joseph Smith to translate the book from the ancient language in which it was written. The young man, however, had very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language, known in the Book of Mormon as “reformed Egyptian.”4 Joseph’s wife Emma insisted that, at the time of translation, Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”5 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph received the plates in September 1827 and the following spring, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, began translating them in earnest, with Emma and his friend Martin Harris serving as his main scribes. The resulting English transcription, known as the Book of Lehi and referred to by Joseph Smith as written on 116 pages, was subsequently lost or stolen. As a result, Joseph Smith was rebuked by the Lord and lost the ability to translate for a short time.6 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph began translating again in 1829, and almost all of the present Book of Mormon text was translated during a three-month period between April and June of that year. His chief scribe during these months was Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher from Vermont who learned about the Book of Mormon while boarding with Joseph’s parents in Palmyra. Called by God in a vision, Cowdery traveled to Harmony to meet Joseph Smith and investigate further. Of his experience as scribe, Cowdery wrote, “These were days never to be forgotten—to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven.”7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manuscript that Joseph Smith dictated to Oliver Cowdery and others is known today as the original manuscript, about 28 percent of which still survives.8 This manuscript corroborates Joseph Smith’s statements that the manuscript was written within a short time frame and that it was dictated from another language. For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript.9 In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.10 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike most dictated drafts, the original manuscript was considered by Joseph Smith to be, in substance, a final product. To assist in the publication of the book, Oliver Cowdery made a handwritten copy of the original manuscript. This copy is known today as the printer’s manuscript. Because Joseph Smith did not call for punctuation, such as periods, commas, or question marks as he dictated, such marks are not in the original manuscript. The typesetter later inserted punctuation marks when he prepared the text for the printer.11 With the exceptions of punctuation, formatting, other elements of typesetting, and minor adjustments required to correct copying and scribal errors, the dictation copy became the text of the first printed edition of the book.12 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Translation Instruments NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many accounts in the Bible show that God transmitted revelations to His prophets in a variety of ways. Elijah learned that God spoke not to him through the wind or fire or earthquake but through a “still small voice.”13 Paul and other early apostles sometimes communicated with angels and, on occasion, with the Lord Jesus Christ.14 At other times, revelation came in the form of dreams or visions, such as the revelation to Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, or through sacred objects like the Urim and Thummim.15 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Smith stands out among God’s prophets, because he was called to render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages, containing doctrine that would deepen and expand the theological understanding of millions of people. For this monumental task, God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Smith and his scribes wrote of two instruments used in translating the Book of Mormon. According to witnesses of the translation, when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English. One instrument, called in the Book of Mormon the “interpreters,” is better known to Latter-day Saints today as the “Urim and Thummim.” Joseph found the interpreters buried in the hill with the plates.16 Those who saw the interpreters described them as a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim. The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device “kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord” and “handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages.”17 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates, was a small oval stone, or “seer stone.”18 As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure.19 As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.20 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two stones bound together to form the interpreters. These two instruments—the interpreters and the seer stone—were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way such that, in the course of time, Joseph Smith and his associates often used the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer to the single stone as well as the interpreters.21 In ancient times, Israelite priests used the Urim and Thummim to assist in receiving divine communications. Although commentators differ on the nature of the instrument, several ancient sources state that the instrument involved stones that lit up or were divinely illumined.22 Latter-day Saints later understood the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer exclusively to the interpreters. Joseph Smith and others, however, seem to have understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people have balked at this claim of physical instruments used in the divine translation process, but such aids to facilitate the communication of God’s power and inspiration are consistent with accounts in scripture. In addition to the Urim and Thummim, the Bible mentions other physical instruments used to access God’s power: the rod of Aaron, a brass serpent, holy anointing oils, the Ark of the Covenant, and even dirt from the ground mixed with saliva to heal the eyes of a blind man.23 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mechanics of Translation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith wrote: “I would inform you that I translated [the book], by the gift and power of God.” When pressed for specifics about the process of translation, Joseph repeated on several occasions that it had been done “by the gift and power of God”24 and once added, “It was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the book of Mormon.”25 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, the scribes and others who observed the translation left numerous accounts that give insight into the process. Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates. Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.26 The process as described brings to mind a passage from the Book of Mormon that speaks of God preparing “a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light.”27 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scribes who assisted with the translation unquestionably believed that Joseph translated by divine power. Joseph’s wife Emma explained that she “frequently wrote day after day” at a small table in their house in Harmony, Pennsylvania. She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.”28 According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.” When asked if Joseph had dictated from the Bible or from a manuscript he had prepared earlier, Emma flatly denied those possibilities: “He had neither manuscript nor book to read from.” Emma told her son Joseph Smith III, “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.”29 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another scribe, Martin Harris sat across the table from Joseph Smith and wrote down the words Joseph dictated. Harris later related that as Joseph used the seer stone to translate, sentences appeared. Joseph read those sentences aloud, and after penning the words, Harris would say, “Written.” An associate who interviewed Harris recorded him saying that Joseph “possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone.”30 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The principal scribe, Oliver Cowdery, testified under oath in 1831 that Joseph Smith “found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates.”31 In the fall of 1830, Cowdery visited Union Village, Ohio, and spoke about the translation of the Book of Mormon. Soon thereafter, a village resident reported that the translation was accomplished by means of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles thro which the translator looked on the engraving.”32 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Smith consistently testified that he translated the Book of Mormon by the “gift and power of God.” His scribes shared that testimony. The angel who brought news of an ancient record on metal plates buried in a hillside and the divine instruments prepared especially for Joseph Smith to translate were all part of what Joseph and his scribes viewed as the miracle of translation. When he sat down in 1832 to write his own history for the first time, he began by promising to include “an account of his marvelous experience.”33 The translation of the Book of Mormon was truly marvelous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The truth of the Book of Mormon and its divine source can be known today. God invites each of us to read the book, remember the mercies of the Lord and ponder them in our hearts, “and ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true.” God promises that “if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”34 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Resources NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilford Woodruff journal, Nov. 28, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.

For example, when Joseph translated the text that is now in 1 Nephi 13:29, the scribe wrote “&” in one place where he should have written “an.” At 1 Nephi 17:48, the scribe wrote “weed” where he should have written “reed.” (See Royal Skousen, “Translating the Book of Mormon: Evidence from the Original Manuscript,” in Noel B.

Joseph Smith seems to have used the terms “interpreters” and “spectacles” interchangeably during the early years of the Church. Nancy Towle, an itinerant Methodist preacher, recounted Joseph Smith telling her about “a pair of ‘interpreters,’ (as he called them,) that resembled spectacles, by looking into which, he could read a writing engraven upon the plates, though to himself, in a tongue unknown” (Nancy Towle, Vicissitudes Illustrated in the Experience of Nancy Towle, in Europe and America [Charleston: James L. Burges, 1832], 138–39.) Joseph’s 1832 history referred to “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith History, ca. summer 1832, in Joseph Smith Histories, 16.) In January 1833, the Latter-day Saint newspaper The Evening and the Morning Star, edited by William W. Phelps, equated “spectacles” and “interpreters” with the term “Urim and Thummim”: the Book of Mormon “was translated by the gift and power of God, by an unlearned man, through the aid of a pair of Interpreters, or spectacles— (known, perhaps, in ancient days as Teraphim, or Urim and Thummim).” (“The Book of Mormon,” The Evening and the Morning Star, January 1833, [2].) By 1835 Joseph Smith most often used the term “Urim and Thummim” when speaking of translation and rarely, if ever, used the terms “interpreters” or “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith, Journal, Nov. 9–11, 1835, in Journals: Volume 1: 1832–1839, 89; Joseph Smith, History, 1834–1836, in Davidson et al., Histories, Volume 1, 116; John W. Welch, “The Miraculous Translation of the Book of Mormon,” in John W. Welch, ed., with Erick B. Carlson, Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820–1844 [Provo, UT, and Salt Lake City: Brigham Young University Press and Deseret Book, 2005], 123–28.) Joseph Smith probably possessed more than one seer stone; he appears to have found one of the stones while digging for a well around 1822. (Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984], 69–70.) According to Martin Harris, an angel commanded Joseph Smith to stop these activities, which he did by 1826. (See Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, 64–76; and Richard Lloyd Anderson, “The Mature Joseph Smith and Treasure Searching,” BYU Studies 24, no. 4 [Fall 1984]: 489–560.) Joseph did not hide his well-known early involvement in treasure seeking. In 1838, he published responses to questions frequently asked of him. “Was not Jo Smith a money digger,” one question read. “Yes,” Joseph answered, “but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.” (Selections from Elders’ Journal, July 1838, 43, available at josephsmithpapers.org.)

Mark Ashurst-McGee, “A Pathway to Prophethood: Joseph Smith Junior as Rodsman, Village Seer, and Judeo-Christian Prophet” (Master's Thesis, Utah State University, 2000). For example, when Joseph Smith showed a seer stone to Wilford Woodruff in late 1841, Woodruff recorded in his journal: “I had the privilege of seeing for the first time in my day the URIM & THUMMIM.” (Wilford Woodruff journal, Dec. 27, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.)

Virtually all of the accounts of the translation process are reproduced in Welch, “Miraculous Translation.” Two accounts of the translation process, including the use of a seer stone, have been written by members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and published in Church magazines. Historians have also written about the seer stone in Church publications, both in the Ensign and in The Joseph Smith Papers. (See Neal A.

A Palmyra newspaper published the earliest known account of the translation in August 1829: Jonathan Hadley, a Palmyra printer who may have spoken with Joseph Smith about translation, claimed that the plates were found with a “huge pair of Spectacles,” and that “by placing the Spectacles in a hat, and looking into it, Smith could (he said so, at least,) interpret these characters.” (“Golden Bible,” Palmyra Freeman, Aug. 11, 1829, [2].) In the winter of 1831, a Shaker in Union Village, Ohio, spoke of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles” through which the translator “looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind.” (Christian Goodwillie, “Shaker Richard McNemar: The Earliest Book of Mormon Reviewer,” Journal of Mormon History 37, no. 2 [Spring 2011]: 143.) “Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” 289–90. “One of the Three Witnesses,” Deseret Evening News, Dec. 13, 1881, 4.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It takes an average of five years to translate and produce the Book of Mormon in another language, according to LDS Church Public Affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet as the Book of Mormon Translation topic page on lds.org states, Joseph Smith translated “almost all of the present Book of Mormon text” from the gold plates in just three months, from April to June of 1829 — long before computers, electronic encyclopedias and the Internet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That “series of miraculous events,” as the topic page refers to it, involved in the translation of the text came to a climax 185 years ago today on March 26, 1830, when the Book of Mormon was first made available for the public to purchase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although all the details of exactly how Joseph translated the Book of Mormon are not known, Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out in a 1997 Ensign article (“By the Gift and Power of God”) that this might have been intentional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Perhaps the Lord wanted to leave the Book of Mormon in the realm of faith, though it is drenched with intrinsic evidence,” he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elder Maxwell indicated, however, that there is value in learning more about the Prophet Joseph, the translation process and those who assisted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our primary focus in studying the Book of Mormon should be on the principles of the gospel anyway, not on the process by which the book came forth,” Elder Maxwell wrote. “Yet because its coming so amply fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy of a ‘marvellous work and a wonder,’ we may find strengthened faith in considering how marvelous and wondrous the translation really was.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'By the gift and power of God' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those who have wondered about the specific details of the Book of Mormon's translation was Hyrum Smith, an older brother of the Prophet Joseph. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to “History of the Church,” Joseph responded to his brother's curiosity by saying that “it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon” and “it was not expedient for him to relate these things.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Thus what we do know about the actual coming forth of the Book of Mormon is adequate, but it is not comprehensive,” Elder Maxwell wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robin Jensen, associate managing historian and project archivist for the Joseph Smith Papers, said in an interview with the Deseret News that because the Prophet Joseph didn’t leave a detailed account of the translation process, historians and members of the church must rely on the reminiscences of scribes and those who witnessed the translation in order to understand the mechanics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jensen said that in his studying of the process, he has come to see the translation as a “development” with multiple “different phases” in which Joseph “grew and developed and better understood his role.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a “monumental task” as Joseph was asked to “render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages,” the lds.org topic page states. So “God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments” to aid in the different phases of the translation process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Book of Mormon tells us the way is prepared for this record to be translated, and that’s a very physical, very mechanical process, much more so than we perhaps might envision that,” Jensen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The topic page refers specifically to two types of instruments. The first, known as the Urim and Thummim, was “a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim” that was found in the Hill Cumorah with the gold plates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device ‘kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord’ and ‘handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages,’” the topic page states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second, known as a seer stone, was a “small oval stone” that Joseph “discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates,” according to the lds.org topic page, that he later learned could be used in the translation process. Jensen said the idea of seer stones was common during Joseph’s time. They were seen as “a way to confront the spiritual, supernatural world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses of the translation process recorded that “when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English,” according to the topic page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph was in his early 20s at the time and had “very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,” according to the topic page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph repeatedly testified that it was “by the gift and power of God” that he was able to complete the translation, a fact his wife, Emma, affirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity — I have not the slightest doubt of it,” Emma told their son Joseph III on one occasion. “I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The topic page also asserts the idea that the original Book of Mormon manuscript, 28 percent of which has survived through the years, also supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript,” the topic page states. “In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Days never to be forgotten’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph may have been the one called to translate the Book of Mormon, but Jensen emphasized that he was not completely alone in the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have a lot of faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon, believed in the power of the Book of Mormon and who were willing to put up with a lot of drudgery, and then of course later in church history, a lot of trial, a lot of hardship,” Jensen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jensen highlighted Joseph's scribes as examples of others who performed “time-intensive” work during the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oliver Cowdery is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, but many others took up a quill to assist Joseph during the translation, according to Jensen. They include Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph’s who later was one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and who financed the printing; Emma Smith; Samuel Smith, one of Joseph’s younger brothers; Reuben Hale, Joseph’s brother-in-law; and Christian Whitmer, one of the sons of the Whitmer family who allowed Joseph to finish translating in their home in Fayette, New York. Christian’s brother John Whitmer also may have served as scribe for a time, and there is handwriting of an additional unidentified scribe found in the original manuscript. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After completing the first manuscript, Joseph also asked Cowdery to take charge on creating a second copy of the text to provide to E.B. Grandin’s printing office in Palmyra, New York. Although Hyrum Smith and another unidentified scribe assisted, Cowdery wrote the bulk of the scripture by hand twice, according to Jensen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Think of the hand cramps that Oliver Cowdery had to endure,” Jensen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Cowdery, the opportunity to assist with the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon was a treasured one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These were days never to be forgotten — to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven,” Cowdery said, according to the translation topic page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The “drudgery” that set the stage for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon extended into the realm of housework and farm chores. One person known for providing assistance with the everyday matters was Mary Whitmer, the mother of the Whitmer family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jensen said Mary Whitmer’s grandson John C. Whitmer told of her being “bogged down” with the additional cooking, cleaning and other house chores that came as a result of Joseph and other visitors staying in her home during the translation process.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From that moment, my grandmother was enabled to perform her household duties with comparative ease, and she felt no more inclination to murmur because her lot was hard,” said John C. Whitmer, as cited in an article Jensen wrote titled “A Bit of Old String” on history.lds.org. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jensen also pointed out that contributions were even made by some who didn’t believe in the Book of Mormon as a book of divine origin, including John H. Gilbert, who was the principal typesetter at Grandin’s printing office. As Joseph dictated the translation to the scribes, he “did not call for punctuation.” Therefore, both the original manuscript and the printer’s manuscript were devoid of it, according to the topic page. The task of punctuating the Book of Mormon and setting the type, letter by letter, was left to Gilbert, a job he “took pride” in later in life, Jensen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Book of Mormon today NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Book of Mormon has gone a long way since it first hit the shelves of Grandin’s bookshop in the small town of Palmyra, New York. More than 168 million copies have been distributed since March 1830, according to LDS Church Public Affairs, and an average of 4.5 million physical copies are distributed each year. With 110 different language translations of the book and digital translations available in 40 different languages on scriptures.lds.org and the Gospel Library app, the Book of Mormon continues to expand the church’s reach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You could very much make the case that the LDS Church was founded on the publication of a book,” Jensen said. “Word of mouth only has a limited radius. It really was the publication of this book, and therefore this dissemination of this information through missionaries and others, that people began to hear about and then believe in Joseph Smith, his prophetic calling and the Restoration.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Email: wbutters@deseretnews.com, Twitter: WhitneyButters\n", "answers": ["To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time.

The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

Bob Corker, retiring Republican senator from Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been earning Twitter plaudits for his sorties against President Trump. He has called the president a toddler on Twitter (134,000 retweets and counting!) and told The New York Times that the president's instability might well put America \"on the path to World War III.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the scripted kabuki theater of American politics, the respected Republican statesman who calls out the president of his own party as reckless or extreme is a stock character, who must always receive loud calls of adulation from the chorus of the press. Bravo! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But why is it, exactly, that anyone should respect Bob Corker's opinion about the president? Should it be more, or less, respected than his endorsement of that same irresponsible toddler for the presidency? His campaign-era praise for the foreign policy thinking of the man who he now warns risks World War III? His jockeying for a spot on the ticket with the toddler? His dismissal of those who, within the Republican Party, were saying exactly the same things, you know, back when something could have been done about it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There has been a very strong correlation between Bob Corker's public comments on Donald Trump and Bob Corker's perceived short-term interests, and his new about-face is no exception. He only started \"uncorking\" (get it?) about Trump once he decided not to run for re-election in a state that Trump carried by 25 points. He has calibrated his retirement announcement to encourage speculation about a 2020 bid, for which his recent comments are clearly useful in positioning him as an establishment primary challenge to Trump. What is it, exactly, that anyone should respect here? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the record, I am not engaging in \"whataboutism.\" I absolutely agree with Corker that the president of the United States behaves like a toddler and in other ways that are grave and alarming. The difference is that I haven't spent the past year obfuscating about that for political gain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's worth expressing some moral outrage about that. Corker was an instrumental part of a Republican establishment that foreswore every opportunity to stop Trump during the campaign for the sake of short-term political gain: refusing to unite behind an anti-Trump candidate, quashing dissent in the run-up to the convention, sucking away the oxygen that might have enabled a non-quixotic third-party conservative bid, comforting themselves with notions that the GOP could \"run the country from Congress\" and so it was okay to put a \"toddler\" in charge of America's nuclear arsenal. Edmund Burke was right: All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. The Bob Corkers of the world bear more responsibility for Donald Trump's election than the Stephen Bannons and Sean Hannitys. Corker's \"toddler\" comment is damning — but less so for Trump (it's not exactly a scoop) than for Corker himself. If Trump is such a toddler, why did Corker enable his rise in the first place? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there is also an important, even fundamental, political point, here. As Talleyrand, that French geopolitical master whom foreign policy hands should be able to quote, would say, \"C'est pire qu'un crime, c'est une faute.\" (\"It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.\") It is well-understood that the United States, and the West in general, is in the grips of a populist insurgency that often has noxious ideas and even more often lacks the competence to turn even its good ideas into policy. It is less well-understood that a main driver of this insurgency's strength is the intellectual and even, arguably, moral bankruptcy of too many in our governing elites, who often speak the language of the common good but seem to believe in little more than that the common good always intersects with their own class interest and that they have a natural right to rule. Bob Corker's sudden rediscovery of principle right at the moment when it stops being risky politically is a darkly comical symbol of this contemptible attitude. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump became president at least in part because large swathes of Republican voters feel screwed by their party, and they feel this way because they are, well, correct. During his Senate tenure, Bob Corker's notable stances on economic policy include voting for Wall Street bailouts, support for a flat tax, and attacks on Social Security and Medicare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fixing a problem requires first understanding it. Trump's personal behavior is contemptible and alarming, but the reason why someone like Trump could get into the White House in the first place, and the way to prevent a new Trump once this one is out one way or another, is to understand how and why the establishment that enabled his rise and the rise of his movement failed. There has been no hint that Bob Corker or those of his establishment ilk understand any of this, or plan to do anything about it other than continue to behave like the stereotype of the kind of establishment Republican that drove a once-proud party (and thence, the world) into the hands of a fool. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's obvious psychological unfitness for his office, important though it is, is also a convenient way to distract from the fundamental failures of the Republican establishment that made him possible. But on this subject Bob Corker has been utterly silent. I would rather hand the nuclear button to Bob Corker than Donald Trump, but if the difference between a toddler and a man is that the latter is capable to self-reflect and then take responsibility for his own actions, then the difference between these two becomes blurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Corker isn't an opponent of Donald Trump. He is his enabler.\nPassage 3:\nRepublicans woke up Columbus Day morning to the sights and sounds of the wheels coming off their midterm-election bus and their legislative jalopy. First came a widely publicized war of words between President Trump and the prominent Republican senator, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker. Then came a Bloomberg News story by Jennifer Jacobs and Bill Allison laying out Steve Bannon’s intention to back challengers to most of the GOP senators seeking re-election next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump-Corker contretemps began last week when the Tennessee lawmaker, who had been a top contender to be Trump’s running mate as well as secretary of State, took an obvious shot at the president when he told reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.” Corker amplified his criticism on Fox News Sunday, charging that Trump was treating his office like “a reality show,” with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tweet wars then began in earnest. Trump fired back that Corker “didn’t have the guts” to run for re-election, and Corker reponded by saying, “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” After adding that the former reality television star was “like he’s doing ‘The Apprentice’ or something,” Corker concluded that “he concerns me,” and it should “concern anyone who cares about our nation.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a New York Times interview later Sunday, this in a phone call with Jonathan Martin and Mark Landler, Corker said that “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him.” Trump fired up his twitter gatling gun and wrote that “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Trump has been highly critical of the Republican-led Congress in general, and the Senate Republican leadership in particular, for their failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, his exchange with Corker went to a darker place. Corker did what a lot of Republican leaders have been tempted to do — question the president’s maturity and stability, and speculate how that might affect his performance as commander-in-chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last year Trump has singled out for criticism two endangered GOP incumbents up for re-election this year, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada. He also has engaged in an on-going feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If Trump is to get anything done legislatively without having to depend on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, he must have the support of Corker, McConnell, Flake, and Heller. The opportunities to align with Schumer and Pelosi are likely to be few and far between. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Citing three sources “familiar with his plans,” the Bloomberg News article reported that Bannon “plans to support as many as 15 Republican Senate candidates in 2018, including several challengers to incumbents. He’ll support only candidates who agree to two conditions: They will vote against McConnell as majority leader, and they will vote to end senators’ ability to block legislation by filibustering. Bloomberg went on to say that only Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is safe because he’s considered sufficiently conservative and seen to be moving toward the more populist approach Bannon favors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bannon has already scored a victory in Alabama by successfully backing former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore against a Luther Strange, a senator appointed by the GOP establishment. The Bloomberg piece reported that Bannon was targeting incumbents Flake, Heller, Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, Wyoming’s John Barrasso, and Utah’s Orrin Hatch, and the New York Times reported on Sunday that another Bannon favorite, Erik Prince, founder of the controversial security firm Blackwater, was considering a challenge to Barrasso. In the event that Sen. John McCain leaves office early — he is undergoing treatment for a virulent form of brain cancer — Bannon has indicated a preference for Paul Gosar, a state representative and tea party activist. In the race to replace Corker, Bannon intends to support Rep. Marsha Blackburn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost any conversation with congressional Republicans starts and ends with the need to cut taxes, now that tax reform no longer seems possible. Having failed to pass any legislation of real significance this year, and with a president who carries little weight on Capitol Hill, Republicans desperately need to put some points on the board. They are banking on passing a tax cut that’s meaningful, that voters can see, feel, and touch. If they pass something insufficiently large, the political payoff will be commensurately small. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With 25 Democratic Senate seats up next year, ten in states Trump carried, five in states the former real estate developer won by 19 points or more, this should be a year for the GOP to expand its current narrow 52-48 majority. Under different circumstances, the GOP could hope to boost their Senate numbers by four to seven seats, perhaps even reaching the magic 60-seat Senate super-majority level that could break filibusters on party line votes. But given their current disarray, Republicans will need to fight hard to gain any new seats, and losing one or two of their own seats would put their majority in jeopardy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stakes are even higher in the House where their majority status is in real danger. The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans. That’s a tall order. And it’s why last week’s news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Correction: An earlier version of this story erroneously characterized Erik Prince’s political plans. He is considering a run against John Barrasso of Wyoming.\nPassage 4:\nThe Failing @ nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!\nPassage 5:\nDonald Trump’s weekend Twitter spat with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker is a familiar story: The President is a Party of One for whom personal loyalty is the only test.

Bob Corker, the retiring Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, has engaged in a heated back-and-forth with Trump for days now, including in an interview with The New York Times where he said that he feared Trump was steering the nation \"on the path to World War III.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The President, a politician whose mantra has long been to hit back harder than someone hits him, is now treating Corker like he did his primary opponents: By giving him a nickname. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \"Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So have at it,\" Corker told the reporter. \"I understand we're on the record. I don't like normally talking to you on the record -- I'm kidding you -- but I will.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about Corker's comments, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, \"Sen. Corker is certainly entitled to his own opinion, but he's not entitled to his own facts.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The facts certainly don't lie, the President has certainly been very successful,\" she continued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if Corker should resign, Sanders said that decision is not for the White House to make. \"I think that's a decision for Sen. Corker and the people of Tennessee,\" Sanders said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump continued his feud with Corker during a Tuesday meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, pushing back on the senator's statement that Trump is putting the United States on a path toward World War III. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were on the wrong path before. All you have to do is take a look,\" he said when asked if Corker was right. \"Now we're on the right path.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump labeling Corker \"liddle\" is a throwback to the 2016 campaign, when he gave Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, then a presidential candidate himself, the same moniker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm the writer,\" Trump told New York magazine in 2016. \"Let me start with Little Marco. He just looked like Little Marco to me. And it's not Little. It's Liddle. L-I-D-D-L-E. And it's not L-Y-I-N-G Ted Cruz. It's L-Y-I-N apostrophe. Ted's a liar, so that was easy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The feud between Corker and Trump had escalated this weekend when the President tweeted that the outgoing senator \"begged\" for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal,\" Trump tweeted. \"Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Todd Womack, Corker's chief of staff, denied the claim later in the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\" Womack said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corker, in the New York Times interview, said that Trump is acting \"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,\" and added that he could set the nation \"on the path to World War III.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comment comes a week after Corker jabbed Trump, stating that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \"help separate our country from chaos.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The clash between Corker and Trump highlights fraying relations between the President and the men and women in Congress who the White House needs to deliver on the agenda Trump ran on. Trump has yet to score a signature legislative victory, a black mark on his record given his party controls both the Senate and House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said Tuesday that he didn't think his feud with Corker would imperil his tax cut plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't think so. I don't think so at all,\" he said. \"I think we are well on our way.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corker's comments have already infuriated Trump's base. Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist who was let go from the White House earlier this year, called on the senator to resign in response.\nPassage 7:\nShould I have outed the people who said these things—or should the countless other press people who have heard similar views? No: Reporters do have to keep confidences, and I conveyed the substance of this case as best I could during the Trump Time Capsule series through the election. Moreover, it’s not clear that “concerns�? like these would have changed anyone’s mind. During the campaign, most of Trump’s fallen rivals blasted him in exceptional terms—before truckling to support him against Hillary Clinton. One of the most remarkable illustrations was Senator Ted Cruz’s extended denunciation of Trump as a “pathological liar�? just before Trump clinched the nomination. Of course Cruz turned around to support him in the general election and has cast nearly all his Senate votes (94 percent) in alignment with Trump. Meanwhile, it’s not even the lead news of the week that Trump’s own secretary of state has half-heartedly non-denied Stephanie Ruhle’s report on NBC that he called Trump a “fucking moron.�? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now that Bob Corker, one-time supporter of Trump, has taken the commendable step of going public, what’s next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * * * NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For reporters, there is a logical extension from the opening Corker has given. Get Mitch McConnell, get Paul Ryan, get John Thune and John Barrasso and John Cornyn, get Kevin McCarthy, get every Republican in a position of responsibility to answer: Do you agree with your colleague that Donald Trump is a danger to the country and the world? Who’s right here: Your comrade who is the veteran chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee? Or a president who can’t stop tweet-threatening “Little Rocket Man�?? And what about Corker’s claim that the White House is a daily battleground to keep the incumbent under control? Are you going to call one of your own a liar? Or is he right about Trump? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They won’t answer. Knowing how not to answer comes as second nature. More smoothly than Rex Tillerson, they will decline to get into the “silly stuff.�? But they should be put on the spot and made to take a stand. Especially the ones who will either face the voters soon—or who are deciding, as Corker did recently, whether that’s even worth it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (To be clear: every reporter already knows these are the questions to ask, and overall the resilience of the press is one of the heartening aspects of this disheartening era. I’m just spelling out what to look for as day breaks and senators get within reporters’ range.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For congressional Republicans, this is your moment in history’s eye. One of your colleagues, who has chosen not to run for office again, and who also was the object of one of Trump’s intemperate attacks this morning, has decided that he might as well tell the truth. It turns out that this is often the right way to go! As the (slightly altered) line from Mark Twain put it, by telling the truth you will gratify some people and astonish the rest. Perhaps Corker’s motivations are not the purest or most glorious. He was nice to Trump last year, when Corker was in the mentioning-cloud as a possible secretary of state, and he was part of the “respectable�? Republicans who disastrous enabled Trump. Corker’s retorts today followed personal attacks from Trump. Still, he’s doing more than his colleagues have. And Corker has moved toward a better place for himself in the annals of Senate history than he would have had only 24 hours ago.\n", "answers": ["President Trump's feud with Republican Sen.

Illustration: Carl Court/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, expected to go public as early as Wednesday, March 1, investors are preparing for the hottest IPO in years. The company is aiming to price shares between $14 and $16, which would give the company a total market value of $20 billion. For comparison, Twitter is worth about $11 billion, and Facebook, nearly $400 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lead-up to the Snap IPO has been a bit rocky. Investors appeared initially skeptical of the company after its prospectus -- an SEC form that companies must file before going public -- revealed some concerning numbers about the business.

Plus, as expected, Snap revealed that it doesn’t make any money. It also said that it might never become profitable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But investors might be coming around right in time for the IPO. Snap, apparently, is a lot of things. To consumers, it’s a messaging company, but Snap calls itself a “camera company.” Now people are beginning to think of it as a serious media company that could draw ad dollars away from television spots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Snap can bring in considerable ad revenue, the company might come to resemble Facebook in the near future. Facebook is up more than 250% since its May 2012 IPO. The fear, though, is that Snap could become the next Twitter, which has fallen out of favor with users, advertisers, and investors. The stock now trades significantly below its IPO price.\nPassage 2:\nSnapchat is popular among teens and twenty-somethings, but their parents, or even grandparents, are more likely to consider buying into Snap Inc.’s $3.2 billion public offering. And that’s an issue as Snap’s initial public offering approaches.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question is long-term demand after shares begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Experts say that reluctance and confusion on the part of traditional investors could weigh on the stock, and those who do buy could be more likely to drop their shares if the company has a tough quarter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While saying that he expects Snap to be the “most high-profile” but “controversial” IPO of the year, Rob Sanderson, managing director of MKM partners, wrote in a note Monday that it may face pressure from a lack of understanding of the app from older investors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We think the use case is much less tangible to middle-aged money managers than an Uber or Airbnb,” Sanderson wrote, adding, “We expect this will be a hurdle for the stock, one that lasts a long time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Nolte, senior portfolio manager of Kingsview Asset Management, said he is struggling to comprehend Snap’s high valuation alongside large net losses and a low revenue-per-user ratio. Neither he nor his clients use Snapchat — “I’m old and they’re older,” he said — which makes it hard to see a user-growth case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Because of that lack of understanding, the first reaction is we’ll steer clear until we see the dust settle,” Nolte said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nolte, who invested in Facebook Inc. FB, -0.76% , but not Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.25% , said he prefers to wait until the IPO lockup is complete to buy stock so he can see whether there is a long-term case or at least a path to profitability, though he has clients who are interested in investing at the time of an IPO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See also: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Menlow, president of SecondaryRatings.com, which rates IPOs and secondary offerings, attributes investors’ reported enthusiasm to an overall lack of tech IPOs and the buzz around the offering more than Snap’s long-term prospects. Older investors may not be leading the charge to invest, but rather are deferring to the opinions of their younger counterparts, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The investors are just looking around to say ‘I guess it sounds good because everyone’s telling me it is,’” Menlow said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap’s roadshow presentation included a kind of tutorial, which explained how the app works. It also broke down each part of the app in its prospectus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap’s prospectus broke down each part of the Snapchat app for unfamiliar potential investors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greater understanding of the app may not lead to higher opinions, though. Eric Schiffer, chief executive of private-equity firm Patriarch Organization, said he believes that if investors were to understand and use Snapchat, they would see that the company faces a large competitive threat from Facebook’s Instagram and its recently launched “Stories” offering that mimics Snapchat’s popular feature with the same name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that if they sat down at the table and had a conversation with their kids, they’d realize how flawed the investment is,” said Schiffer, who admitted he “occasionally” uses the app. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don’t miss: Snap IPO boils down to a single question: Do you trust Evan Spiegel? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap reported slowing growth in daily active users and cited “increased competition” since Facebook released the Instagram Stories feature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap may see trouble later on from investors who don’t quite understand the app, Menlow said, especially if Snap’s user growth slows during a quarter. If they don’t buy in to the importance of Snapchat or understand social media cycles, they may back away from the stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If they had the understanding, they would know that this is a blip in a positive long-term profile,” Menlow said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposing views: Three reasons to skip Snap IPO and Snap could be the new Facebook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if investors don’t use the app, they are able to see the benefits and advertising opportunities of social media companies while still not being able to separate Snapchat out as a clear winner, said Kim Forrest, vice president at Fort Pitt Capital Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that shows how social media has really identified itself to investors regardless of age,” Forrest said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Forrest said she is steering clear of the offering because it does not sound like Snap will be returning shareholder capital for a long time and it is not giving investors voting rights.\nPassage 3:\nAs many as a quarter of new shares sold in Snap's IPO could go to long-term investors who will be required to hold the stock for a year, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap is looking to raise as much as $3.2 billion this week by selling 200 million shares for between $14 and $16 each. The filing says that 50 million shares are expected to be subjected to the so-called lockup period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap's IPO is the biggest tech offering since Alibaba Group's September 2014 share sale. Allocating big blocks of shares to large mutual funds or even corporate investors is one way to ensure a large stock sale's success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In exchange for a guaranteed block, the big investors may agree not to dump the stock — though Snap's filing says it may waive the lockup requirement. Snap's IPO was already oversubscribed by at least $6.8 billion heading into the weekend, Business Insider reported. Snap's Monday filing says that it doesn't have any binding agreements relating to the lockup yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is expected to set a price for its shares on March 1 and begin trading on March 2. The company could raise the price for its shares — or increase the number of shares it's planning to sell — before Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's the excerpt from Snap's filing (emphasis added): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We expect approximately 50 million shares of our Class A common stock purchased by investors in this offering will be subject to a separate lock up agreement with us providing for a restricted period of one year following the date of this prospectus. These agreements will reduce the number of our shares available for sale in the public market during their term. We may, in our sole discretion, waive any of these lock up agreements before the restricted period expires.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A representative for Snap declined to comment.\nPassage 4:\nMark Zuckerberg says he created Facebook Inc. FB 1.17% to make the world more open and connected. Twitter Inc. TWTR 1.28% says it wants to give everyone the power to share ideas instantly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap Inc., which this week could become the biggest technology public offering in years, is the unsocial social-media company. Not only does its app feature messages that disappear, the company defiantly operates unlike most Silicon Valley outfits, where collaboration and wide-open office spaces are prized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Snap Inc. goes public, Snapchat co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will retain control of more than 90% of the company's voting rights. WSJ's Shelby Holliday looks at how Snap's rare share structure stacks up against other tech companies. Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former employees say often the only way they knew co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel was at work was by seeing his chauffeured SUV. He avoids holding companywide meetings and prefers to dispense information to individuals or small groups, they say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In contrast to the big, open campuses of Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL 0.74% Google, designed for employee collaboration, Snap doesn’t have a headquarters. Its main offices are scattered around Venice, Calif., keeping employees siloed and making communication difficult, the former employees say. The company in its IPO filing listed the lack of a headquarters as a risk factor that could hurt morale, prevent adequate oversight and cost talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, Snapchat has won legions of teenage users, who like that what they share now won’t define them permanently—and that it keeps their parents out of their business. And it has attracted advertisers who want to reach a young audience, setting the stage for Snap’s initial public offering. The listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to take place this week and could value the company at as much as $22 billion, which would make it the biggest U.S. tech IPO in years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment or make Mr. Spiegel available for this article, citing the company’s quiet period ahead of the public offering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question is whether this management style and focus on privacy will help the company compete with television networks and challenge the Facebook juggernaut. Mr. Spiegel’s approach at times has left staff in the dark about important initiatives, the former employees say. And it has made the company resist giving advertisers the ability to narrowly target users based on their behavior and preferences, a strategy that has enabled Facebook, Google and others to mint enormous profits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Doesn’t talk much’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Evan doesn’t talk much,” says Hemant Taneja, managing director at venture-capital firm General Catalyst, an early Snap investor, saying confusion can stem from the fact that Mr. Spiegel doesn’t always feel compelled to explain his concepts to the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September, he surprised potential investors when he began publicly calling Snap “a camera company” instead of a social-media company. Some investors wondered if Snap was suddenly becoming a hardware company, but Mr. Taneja says the camera concept wasn’t new. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snapchat Evan Spiegel chief executive speaks onstage at the American Magazine Media Conference at Grand Hyatt New York in February last year. Photo: Larry Busacca/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rapid growth and increasingly intense competition are putting Mr. Spiegel’s management style to the test. Snap’s full-time workforce tripled during last year to 1,859 as it expanded internationally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is competing head-to-head with the global social-media giants, especially Facebook, whose Instagram unit already has emulated Snap’s features with some success, such as the Stories feature it rolled out over the summer. Snap in its public filing attributed part of its slowing user growth to increased competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Part of the competition is about the race to hook users first. Instagram is more popular than Snap internationally, and people could be inclined to stick with Instagram if they are already using Facebook, or with Snap if they landed there first. “You aren’t going to switch if you are satisfied with what you are using,” says Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap is also vying with traditional television networks to woo young viewers and advertising. Young people have been drifting away from television to their smartphone screen, where hours of videos from friends can be played. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Snap must continue to generate unusual and captivating content—much of which has been meticulously managed by Mr. Spiegel, former employees and business partners say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The listing is expected to take place this week and could value the company at as much as $22 billion. Photo: Brendan McDermid//Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like many tech executives, Mr. Spiegel attended Stanford University. But that is about where the comparisons end. He was more social than secretive when he arrived at college in 2008, friends recall, even though his high-profile lawyer-parents had had a rancorous and public divorce when he was in high school in Los Angeles. Far from geek, he was the life of the party, they say, and his style was more hipster than hoodie: skinny jeans, V-neck T-shirts, flip flops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These days, Mr. Spiegel, who is more of a product designer than a computer scientist, eschews many of the tech industry’s habits, preferring to be away from what he has described as the bubblelike culture of Silicon Valley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As he got to college, Facebook was taking off. In just four years since its launch in 2004, the social network had gained 58 million active users (it now has 1.9 billion monthly active users). In February 2009—during Mr. Spiegel’s freshman year—it added the Like button. From the start, Mr. Spiegel wasn’t a fan, friends recall. He would come to see it as a form of social pressure, where people create falsely perfect worlds in the quest to rack up likes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Spiegel said Snapchat was much more, a place for spontaneous interaction that evaporates in the same way a real conversation would. It was also about creativity and fun: Photos and video could be animated in whimsical and ridiculous ways using its functions to make selfies that vomit rainbows, sport puppy and bunny ears, and wear banana faces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina used Snapchat at the French Open in Paris last May. Photo: Christopher Levy /Zuma Press NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In most cases, photos and videos that users send in messages disappear after they are viewed, and other content disappears after 24 hours, although some items can be saved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the recent company video, created for its IPO, Mr. Spiegel says the ephemerality is “why people love creating Snaps. Because there isn’t pressure to feel pretty or perfect. Self-expression isn’t a contest, it’s not about how well you can express yourself, it’s about being able to communicate how you feel, and doing that in the moment.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conceived for mobile NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also key to Snap’s success, and unlike incumbents such as Facebook and Twitter: Its design and concept is mobile-only. Content is presented vertically, to fill a smartphone screen; location-based tags and filters are popular; and bite-size content is swipeable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Facebook was trying to transition to mobile in 2012, Snapchat sped out of the gate, catching the bigger company by surprise. Mr. Spiegel saw the smartphone as the new movie screen. When Mr. Zuckerberg offered $3 billion to buy Snapchat in 2013, Mr. Spiegel turned him down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Spiegel’s talent combining a Hollywood approach to content with a keen business sense is admired by many who know him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Video Snap's initial public offering will enable the social media platform's founders and two Silicon Valley venture-capital firms to rake in a huge fortune. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Zuma Press NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For someone of his age, he operates with much more wisdom than anyone else I have seen. I find him to be a very, very clear thinker,” Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, said in an email. When faced with critical decisions on issues like funding and partnering and selling, Mr. Schmidt says, “he gets it right every time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says Mr. Spiegel, a former student of his at Stanford, is now a friend and customer. Snap has a five-year, $2 billion contract for Google to provide cloud-data storage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other people note Mr. Spiegel’s timing on the dominance of mobile, getting ahead of Facebook and the recognition that social media was getting boring. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Revenue is generated by brands placing short video advertisements and simple location-linked overlays called “geofilters,” plus more elaborate “Lenses”—Taco Bell made a Lens that turned faces into tacos being doused with hot sauce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than two dozen media and entertainment outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, also provide news, sports, fashion and features. Advertisements are sold to place in the content the media companies produce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap’s revenue last year jumped more than 500% to $404.5 million. Its net loss widened to $514.6 million, and its user growth slowed somewhat, rising 48% to 158 million in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That revenue is a fraction of the $27.6 billion last year at Facebook, which also booked $10.2 billion in profit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Spiegel has been wary of advertising from the start, worrying that it would feel intrusive. As his business marketing team was crafting presentations for prospective advertisers and business partners, Mr. Spiegel didn’t want to explain the app to them, said one of the former employees. He preferred that CEOs learn it—not from a presentation but from their children. It was “difficult for a salesperson to run that one up the flagpole,” the former employee recalls. A product demonstration is now part of the meetings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Snapchat’s first ads made their debut in October 2014—Facebook was already generating $12.5 billion in annual revenue by that year—Mr. Spiegel’s ambivalence was evident in a company blog post. It told users if they didn’t want to watch the ads, which were in a different section, “No Biggie.” The company wouldn’t place ads in personal communiqués because that would be “totally rude.” It wanted Snapchat advertising to be “the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, he has resisted efforts to collect and share information that would enable advertisers to target the app’s individual users. Lately, he has made concessions. In January, for example, Snap signed a deal with Oracle Corp. to help marketers use data from offline purchases, such as supermarket loyalty cards, to target Snapchat users with more relevant ads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ad targeting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap is still far away from the more aggressive approaches of Facebook and Google, which have used precise ad targeting to make billions in profits. As a result, the giants can outspend Snap on talent and fresh content, and bankroll development of potentially expensive new products, such as hardware that taps into augmented reality, or tech that blends computer images onto a user’s real view of the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Spiegel with his fiancée, model Miranda Kerr, at a White House state dinner last May. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Associated Press NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of Snap’s vision of ads as less intrusive than most digital advertising—more like old-fashioned television spots made for a broader audience—Snap ads must have a wider appeal, with high production values, and be spliced into the rest of the app in an interesting way. During the Super Bowl, for example, users could choose to adorn their selfies with either Falcons’ or Patriots’ football helmets or cascade gushers of colorful Gatorade over their heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap’s requirements set a high bar for its partners. The small group of media and entertainment outlets that appear on Snapchat have tough targets to meet, according to a person familiar with the process. If Snap isn’t happy, it suggests changes to the content, and if the material doesn’t get enough traffic, the providers fear they could be booted off the app, according to a current and a former editor of content for Snapchat Discover, the section of the app where publishers post content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until lately, a lot of Snap’s advertising has come directly from brands like Coca-Cola Co. and Yum Brands Inc.’s Taco Bell. It has been slow to woo Madison Avenue’s big ad agencies, which have bigger budgets and can commit to longer contracts, and to form partnerships that would enable advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. Last summer, Snap hired Viacom ’s Jeff Lucas to help court big deals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the IPO has neared, Snap has signed deals with Oracle Data Cloud, Nielsen and others to ramp up its use of metrics that will dispel some of the mystery that has enshrouded the effectiveness of advertising on the app. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stock-exchange listing will force more transparency about the business, including regular updates on user and engagement data. Even so, Mr. Spiegel will continue to keep a tight grip on the company after it goes public. Snap is selling to the public only shares that have no voting power. Afterward, Mr. Spiegel and co-founder and chief technologist Bobby Murphy will retain more than 90% of the voting shares. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Write to Betsy Morris at betsy.morris@wsj.com and Georgia Wells at Georgia.Wells@wsj.com\nPassage 5:\nLast year, Snapchat's revenue growth increased by an astounding 589 percent, though the company is still not yet profitable. Its daily active user base rose to 158 million in the latest quarter, up from 107 million the year before, although the growth has decelerated a bit in the past couple of quarters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The slowing user growth could potentially be a real issue, Cramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last summer, Facebook's Instagram launched its own Instagram stories platform, which appeared to be a knock-off of Snapchat. Cramer attributed this as the reason why Snap's daily active user base increased by just 10 percent in the first half of 2016 to the second half, compared to 33 percent in the previous six months. The other reason for deceleration was due to performance issues on Android phones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another possible problem that Cramer uncovered is the immense amount of spending that Snap is doing on cloud-hosting costs. In the next five years, it expects to spend $400 million annually on Google Cloud and another $200 million annually on Amazon Web Services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Snap only expects to hit $1 billion in ad revenue this year. This means at least 60 percent of that will be eaten up by hosting costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nevertheless, I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here, at least for the near- and intermediate-term future,\" Cramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Snap's user growth is still impressive, it has plenty of opportunity to expand internationally. Any company with the immense amount of revenue growth must be doing something very right, Cramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, Goldman Sachs is one of the underwriters of the IPO and estimates that Snap could hit approximately $2 billion in revenue by 2018. Even better, Snap could be a great investment if it uses the billions they expect to raise in the IPO to expand new lines of business, and those businesses are successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless of the long term, Cramer expects Snap to be a \"phenomenal trade\" and its stock to soar when it comes public. Snap is also coming public about a year earlier into its cycle than Twitter did, which means investors can tap into the juicy early-stage growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If Snap spikes really hard right out of the gate, I suggest waiting for a pullback before you buy or accepting that you missed it if the stock is more than doubled at the opening,\" Cramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, Snap is expected to price on Wednesday within an expected range of $17 to $18, which would put its market cap at $20 billion. Based on that IPO price, Snap would trade at 20.3 times this year's sales, which sounded expensive initially to Cramer, but compared to Facebook's 19.4 times sales when it came public, it's not exactly uncharted territory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I could see it doubling pretty easily simply because big firms that got a huge slug of stock in the deal will go into the regular market to buy more, so their cost basis will be superb versus the actual closing price,\" Cramer said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At $17 a share, the parent of popular disappearing-messaging app Snapchat has a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter and the richest valuation in a U.S. tech IPO since Facebook in 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company had targeted a valuation of between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book was more than 10 times oversubscribed and Snap could have priced the IPO at as much as $19 a share, but the company wanted to focus on securing mutual funds as long-term investors rather than hedge funds looking to quickly sell, the source said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and 20-somethings who use it to apply bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies but faces a challenge in converting “cool” into cash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite a nearly 7-fold increase in revenue, the Los Angeles-based company’s net loss jumped 38 percent last year. It faces intense competition from larger rivals such as Facebook as well as decelerating user growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap priced 200 million shares on Wednesday night at $17, above its stated range of $14 to $16 dollars a share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sale had the advantage of favorable timing. The market for technology IPOs hit the brakes in 2016, marking the slowest year for such launches since 2008, and investors are keen for fresh opportunities. The launch could encourage debuts by other so-called unicorns, tech start-ups with private valuations of $1 billion or more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors bought the shares despite them having no voting power, an unprecedented feature for an IPO despite years of rising concerns about corporate governance from fund managers looking to gain influence over executives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap is set to begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNAP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Banner for Snap Inc. hangs on the facade of the the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the eve of the company's IPO in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OVERNIGHT MILLIONAIRES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Snap is going public at a much earlier stage in its development than Twitter or Facebook, the 5-year-old company is valuing itself at nearly 60 times revenue, more than double the 27 times revenue Facebook fetched when it went public in 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To justify its suggested valuation and fend off concerns about slowing user growth, Snap has emphasized how important Snapchat is to its users, how long they spend on the app and the revenue potential of the emerging trend for young people to communicate with video rather than text. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company has been vague on its plans to lead and monetize image-driven conversations, but has suggested investors put faith in the vision of its co-founder Evan Spiegel, whom it introduced in its investor roadshow as a “once-in-a-generation founder.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 26-year-old will walk away with a roughly 17 percent stake valued at $4.05 billion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy will each be selling 16 million shares in the IPO that earned them $272 million apiece.

The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights.\nPassage 7:\nThe drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company’s growth. How the company plans to grow is on the minds of investors as Snap goes public this week. Snap priced its initial public offering on Wednesday and the stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in what is set to be the biggest technology I.P.O. since the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba in 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap set its I.P.O. pricing at $17 a share — higher than the expected range of $14 to $16 — valuing the company at $24 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting more visual data such as photographs and video is important to Snap because it helps bolster people’s interactions with Snapchat. Communicating on Snapchat is a highly visual process, intended to create an intense engagement among people with the app. Snap said in its public offering prospectus that the average Snapchat user opened the app more than 18 times a day, and that more than 2.5 billion messages and images were sent each day with the app. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive, has been vocal about his company’s ambitions around cameras. In a video for investors about Snap’s public offering this month, Mr. Spiegel said cameras augmented the way a person communicates, rather than a person’s memory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re at the beginning of what cameras can do,” Mr. Spiegel told viewers of the video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Spectacles appeared, Snap faced questions from critics about why it would enter the realm of hardware products. The product is designed to make taking videos a fun and seamless part of everyday life, which dovetails with the company’s goal of getting users to feed Snapchat a steady stream of images and videos.\nPassage 8:\nSnap, the company behind Snapchat, is expected to price its initial public offering today and start trading on the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of Snap’s IPO, Recode Senior Editor Kurt Wagner answered some of what are no doubt the questions you’re dying to ask. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does an IPO actually mean? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, and it's the first time that a private company starts selling its stock on the public stock market. That means you (yes, you!) are now able to buy a piece of Snap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does this mean we’re all getting rich? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sorry, you're probably not gonna get rich, but you never know. People invested in Facebook at $20-$30 a share. It's now worth over $100, so you can make some money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Someone is getting rich off this IPO. Who? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snapchat's co-founders are going to get very rich. Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are both going to be worth billions of dollars by the time this whole thing is done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why does Snap want to go public? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies go public for a number of reasons: First, to pay back their investors that have given them money along the way to keep the business going. It's a good way for founders and executives to actually cash out some of the stock that they've earned during their time working there. It's also a way for the company to raise money from people like you who may invest. They can use that money to do things like acquisitions, international expansion and new product growth, things that Snap would love to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does Snap even make money? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Believe it or not, Snapchat is a real business. The company brought in over $400 million in revenue last year, the vast majority of which came from advertising. So, even though the app is free, the company is still making money by putting ads alongside all the content that you're creating inside the app. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doesn’t Snap make money in other ways? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap also makes hardware, called Spectacles. These are video-recording sunglasses that, until recently, you had to buy out of a vending machine. Snap says those sunglasses don't create meaningful revenue for the company. So while they may be cool, they're not actually benefitting the company's bottom line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What could possibly go wrong with Snap going public? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When you're a publicly traded company, you have to share a lot of information and you have to do it regularly. When you're private, you can keep things like revenue or user growth to yourself, but now, as a publicly traded entity, Snap's going to have to report that number publicly to investors. That means if things aren't going well, all of us are going to know about it.\n", "answers": ["Those who remember the hype when Alibaba priced its initial public offering of stock in 2014 will get to relive that excitement Wednesday when Snap does the same. Reuters reports the owner of the Snapchat messaging app will serve up a number at the end of the trading day, with expectations of anywhere between $14 and $16 a share and a possible valuation of more than $20 billion. What the buzz is on this \"eagerly awaited\" IPO: Recode offers a quick-hit Q&A, including such queries as: \"What could possibly go wrong with Snap going public?\" Kids, teens, and young adults are the ones who use Snapchat the most, but it's the older generations who are more likely to be investors. The elder set's confusion over the vanishing messages could be a problem, per MarketWatch. All eyes would be on Snap CEO Evan Spiegel right now—if anyone could find him. The Wall Street Journal takes a closer look at the company's \"elusive\" (and apparently reticent) founder. \"Evan doesn't talk much,\" shrugs an early investor. The company's plans for the future are an important piece of the IPO puzzle. Sources tell the New York Times those plans may involve a drone. Despite Snapchat's sluggish user growth and the company's hefty hosting costs, Mad Money's Jim Cramer believes the trade will be a \"phenomenal\" one. \"I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here,\" he says, per CNBC.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blast came a day after nine Iraqi soldiers and Shiite Muslim militiamen were killed in clashes with suspected ISIS militants in nearby Mahmoudiya, a Sunni Muslim community about 29 kilometers south of Baghdad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the height of Iraq's insurgency last decade following a U.S.-led invasion, Yousifiya and Mahmoudiya, along with the town of Latifiya, made up the Sunni area known as the \"Triangle of Death\" because it was an al Qaeda stronghold and a lair for criminals.

What insights or expertise about cybersecurity could possibly justify such a sky-high fee, some wondered, even for a man as well-connected in the military-industrial complex as the former head of the nation's largest intelligence agency? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The answer, Alexander said in an interview Monday, is a new technology, based on a patented and \"unique\" approach to detecting malicious hackers and cyber-intruders that the retired Army general said he has invented, along with his business partners at IronNet Cybersecurity Inc., the company he co-founded after leaving the government and retiring from military service in March. But the technology is also directly informed by the years of experience Alexander has had tracking hackers, and the insights he gained from classified operations as the director of the NSA, which give him a rare competitive advantage over the many firms competing for a share of the cybersecurity market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that Alexander is building what he believes is a new kind of technology for countering hackers hasn't been previously reported. And it helps to explain why he feels confident in charging banks, trade associations, and large corporations millions of dollars a year to keep their networks safe. Alexander said he'll file at least nine patents, and possibly more, for a system to detect so-called advanced persistent threats, or hackers who clandestinely burrow into a computer network in order to steal secrets or damage the network itself. It was those kinds of hackers who Alexander, when he was running the NSA, said were responsible for \"the greatest transfer of wealth in American history\" because they were routinely stealing trade secrets and competitive information from U.S. companies and giving it to their competitors, often in China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander is believed to be the first ex-director of the NSA to file patents on technology that's directly related to the job he had in government. He said that he had spoken to lawyers at the NSA, and privately, to ensure that his new patents were \"ironclad\" and didn't rely on any work that he'd done for the agency -- which still holds the intellectual property rights to other technology Alexander invented while he ran the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander is on firm legal ground so long as he can demonstrate that his invention is original and sufficiently distinct from any other patented technologies. Government employees are allowed to retain the patents for technology they invent while working in public service, but only under certain conditions, patent lawyers said. If an NSA employee's job, for instance, is to research and develop new cybersecurity technologies or techniques, then the government would likely retain any patent, because the invention was directly related to the employee's job. However, if the employee invented the technology on his own time and separate from his core duties, he might have a stronger argument to retain the exclusive rights to the patent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is no easy black-and-white answer to this,\" said Scott Felder, a partner with the law firm Wiley Rein LLP in Washington, adding that it's not uncommon for government employees to be granted patents to their inventions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source familiar with Alexander's situation, who asked not to be identified, said that the former director developed this new technology on his private time, and that he addressed any potential infractions before deciding to seek his patents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Alexander started his company almost immediately after stepping down from the NSA. As for how much the highly classified knowledge in his head influenced his latest creation, only Alexander knows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the interview, Alexander insisted that the cybersecurity technology he's inventing now is distinct enough from his work at the NSA that he can file for new patents -- and reap all the benefits that come with them. A patent prohibits any other individual, company, or government agency from using the underlying invention without a license from the patent holder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even if Alexander's new technology is legally unique, it is shaped by the nearly nine years he spent running an intelligence colossus. He was the longest-serving director in the history of the NSA and the first commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, responsible for all cybersecurity personnel -- defensive and offensive -- in the military and the Defense Department. From those two perches, Alexander had access to the government's most highly classified intelligence about hackers trying to steal U.S. secrets and disable critical infrastructure, such as the electrical power grid. Indeed, he helped to invent new techniques for finding those hackers and filed seven patents on cybersecurity technologies while working for the NSA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander used his influence to warn companies that they were blind to cyberthreats that only the NSA could see, and that unless they accepted his help, they risked devastating losses. Alexander wanted to install monitoring equipment on financial companies' websites, but he was rebuffed, according to financial executives who took part in the discussions. His attempts to make the NSA a cyber-watchdog on corporate networks were seen as a significant intrusion by government into private business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Few, if any, independent inventors have seen such detailed, classified information about the way hackers work and what classified means the government has developed to fight them, all of which gives Alexander a competitive advantage in his new life as a businessman. That insider knowledge has raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) has publicly questioned whether Alexander is effectively selling classified information in exchange for his huge consulting fee. (Bloomberg reported that the figure dropped to $600,000 after the $1 million figure raised hackles in Washington and among computer-security experts.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander said that his new approach is different than anything that's been done before because it uses \"behavioral models\" to help predict what a hacker is likely to do. Rather than relying on analysis of malicious software to try to catch a hacker in the act, Alexander aims to spot them early on in their plots. Only the market will tell whether his approach is as novel as he claims. (One former national security official with decades of experience in security technology, and who asked to remain anonymous, said the behavioral-model approach is highly speculative and has never been used successfully.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former NSA chief said that IronNet has already signed contracts with three companies -- which he declined to name -- and that he hopes to finish testing the system by the end of September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've got a great solution. We've got to prove that it works,\" Alexander said. \"It will be another way of looking at cybersecurity that gives us greater capabilities than we've had in the past.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked why he didn't share this new approach with the federal government when he was in charge of protecting its most important computer systems, Alexander said the key insight about using behavior models came from one of his business partners, whom he also declined to name, and that it takes an approach that the government hadn't considered. It's these methods that Alexander said he will seek to patent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander said that if he determines that he needs to use technology or methods that the NSA has patented, he will pay for a license, including for anything he helped to invent while he was in office and for which he doesn't own the rights. During his time at the NSA, Alexander said he filed seven patents, four of which are still pending, that relate to an \"end-to-end cybersecurity solution.\" Alexander said his co-inventor on the patents was Patrick Dowd, the chief technical officer and chief architect of the NSA. Alexander said the patented solution, which he wouldn't describe in detail given the sensitive nature of the work, involved \"a line of thought about how you'd systematically do cybersecurity in a network.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That sounds hard to distinguish from Alexander's new venture. But, he insisted, the behavior modeling and other key characteristics represent a fundamentally new approach that will \"jump\" ahead of the technology that's now being used in government and in the private sector. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander said he was persuaded to start a security business and apply for patents after hearing from potential customers, including company executives, who said they were worried about hackers who could steal or even erase the proprietary data on their companies' computers. Alexander said they were particularly worried about threats like the Wiper virus, a malicious computer program that targeted the Iranian Oil Ministry in April 2012, erasing files and data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That will come as a supreme irony to many computer security experts, who say that Wiper is a cousin of the notorious Stuxnet virus, which was built by the NSA -- while Alexander was in charge -- in cooperation with Israeli intelligence. The program disabled centrifuges in a nuclear plant in Iran in a classified operation known as Olympic Games. The United States has never acknowledged its involvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States isn't the only government capable of building data-erasing malware. Iran is building a formidable cyber-army, U.S. intelligence officials say, and is believed to be behind a 2012 attack on an oil company in Saudi Arabia that erased data from more than 30,000 computers. Iranian hackers also launched a series of cyberattacks on major U.S. bank websites the same year, intelligence officials say. The strike took Washington by surprise because it was so sophisticated and aggressive. The hackers hijacked data centers consisting of thousands of computers each and used them to flood the bank websites with digital traffic, causing them to crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brendan Smialowski / AFP\nPassage 3:\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The king of Saudi Arabia has warned that extremists could attack Europe and the U.S. if there is not a strong international response to terrorism after Islamist extremists seized a wide territory across Iraq and Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While not mentioning any terrorist groups by name, King Abdullah's statement appeared aimed at drawing Washington and NATO forces into a wider fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and its supporters in the region. Saudi Arabia openly backs rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, but is concerned that the breakaway al Qaeda group could also turn those very same weapons on the kingdom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am certain that after a month they will reach Europe and, after another month, America,\" he said at a reception for foreign ambassadors Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Official Saudi media carried the king's comments early Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These terrorists do not know the name of humanity and you have witnessed them severing heads and giving them to children to walk with in the street,\" the king said, urging the ambassadors to relay his message directly to their heads of state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman reports from Washington that President Obama didn't talk military planning Friday night when he met with Democratic donors, but he said that he understands that Americans are anxious about the growing threat of ISIS, and he acknowledged that it's a dangerous time in the Middle East. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A day after the president said that he doesn't have a strategy yet for confronting ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, in Syria, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama is waiting for his defense secretary to present a plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are some who probably would make the case that it's OK to not have a formulated, comprehensive strategy but, just as one pundit I know recently suggested, that we could just go drop some bombs and see what happens,\" Earnest told reporters Friday. \"That is not what the president believes is a smart approach.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Echoing that message, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said the Defense Department doesn't have binders full of plans at any given moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Planners down in Tampa and planners here in the Pentagon continually refine and change and update planning options for potential military activity,\" Kirby told reporters Friday. \"It is an ongoing effort.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. military campaign against ISIS is so far limited to targets in Iraq, but Mr. Obama is considering expanding the mission to also include Syria, where this week he ordered surveillance flights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ISIS has been fighting moderate rebels, other extremists and Assad's forces in Syria for nearly three years. Iraq has faced an onslaught by the Sunni extremists and their supporters since early this year, and the country continues to be roiled by instability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While providing arms and support to Sunni militants in Syria, Saudi Arabia has denied directly funding or backing ISIS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British officials raised the country's terror threat level Friday to \"severe,\" its second-highest level, because of developments in Iraq and Syria, but there was no information to suggest an attack was imminent. The White House has said it does not expect the U.S. to bump up its terrorism threat warning level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. ally in the region, has taken an increasingly active role in criticizing ISIS. Earlier this month, the country's top cleric described ISIS and al Qaeda as Islam's No. 1 enemy and said that Muslims have been their first victims. State-backed Saudi clerics who once openly called on citizens to fight in Syria can now face steep punishment and the kingdom has threatened to imprison its citizens who fight in Syria and Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A decade ago, al Qaeda militants launched a string of attacks in the kingdom aimed at toppling the monarchy. Saudi officials responded with a massive crackdown that saw many flee to neighboring Yemen. In the time since, the kingdom has not seen any massive attacks, though it has imprisoned suspected militants and sentenced others to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile Saturday, police in Iraq said a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden car into an army checkpoint in the town of Youssifiyah, killing 11 people, including four soldiers, and wounding at least 24 people. Youssifiyah is 12 miles south of Baghdad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hours later, a roadside bomb targeting an army patrol killed two soldiers and wounded five in Latifiyah, a town 20 miles south of Baghdad.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All roamed southern Utah over the eons, long before Native Americans struggled to hold their land against Mormon settlers, modern life and now, Donald Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the President arrives in Utah Monday afternoon, this rocky corner of the Wild West is a battlefield once again, but this time the warriors will carry briefcases and lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, by signing two presidential proclamations on Monday, shrunk the size of Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by roughly 45%, fundamentally reshaping the two large national monuments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The proclamations split the two national monuments into several smaller sections. Bears Ears will be shrunk from 1.35 million acres to 228,337 acres, according to the spokesperson for Interior, and split into two separate monument sections. Grand Staircase-Escalante, a monument designated by President Bill Clinton, will be split into three sections and shrunk from 1.9 million acres to just about 1 million acres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump slammed past administrations -- namely Clinton's and President Barack Obama's -- for what he called \"federal overreach.\" The two former Democratic president designated Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante for protection, hoping to preserve their culture, history and natural beauty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Past administrations, Trump said, thought \"the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington. And guess what? They are wrong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The families and communities of Utah know and love this land the best and you know the best how to take care of your land,\" Trump said. \"You know how to protect it. And you know best how to conserve this land for many, many generations to come.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore pose at the edge of the Grand Canyon, during the signing of a proclamation establishing Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Locals in the area saw the designations as nothing more than a 3-million-acre federal land grab. The drillers, miners and frackers who were shut out by Clinton's and Obama's use of the Antiquities Ac t would have new leases on life. Sen. Orrin Hatch and his fellow Utah Republicans would have a major victory to celebrate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hoodoos are among the natural wonders in Bears Ears National Monument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But those who believe the rocks can talk, through countless fossils, sacred ruins and desert solitude, are bracing for a fight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm going to sue him,\" says Yvon Chouinard, founder and CEO of outdoor gear maker Patagonia. \"It seems the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. I think it's a shame that only 4% of American lands are national parks. Costa Rica's got 10%. Chile will now have way more parks than we have. We need more, not less. This government is evil and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chouinard led the effort to move a major outdoor show from Salt Lake City to Denver in protest of Utah's land use politics and he's been a big supporter of the historic coalition of the five local tribes, which put aside ancient rivalries and lobbied for monument protection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outdoor retailer Patagonia also lent its voice in opposition to the move Monday, setting the home page of Patagonia.com to a blacked-out page that says, \"The President Stole Your Land,\" with the option to learn more about \"the largest elimination of protected land in American history.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site also gave visitors the option to support groups that are pushing back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he was unmoved by people like Chouinard who are threatening lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't yield to pressure, only higher principle,\" he said. \"And I don't think public policy should be based on the threat of lawsuit ... I feel very confident.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR San Juan County Commissioner Phil Lyman says the designation of Bears Ears as a national monument never felt right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Chouinard's arguments carry no sway at a pro-Trump, anti-monument rally in Monticello. Here, Chouinard represents all the liberal interests from outside, conspiring to pit neighbor against neighbor. \"What's his net worth? One billion dollars? Two billion?\" says San Juan County Commissioner Phil Lyman. \"You got Patagonia in here waving the flag of environmentalism while he's completely exploiting the outdoors for industrialized tourism. For a person in that position to try and lecture morality to one of the poorest counties in the entire nation is wrong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There has been opposition to Bears Ears as a monument since it was designated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The size of New Jersey, San Juan is the biggest and poorest county in Utah and with this moment of political victory, Lyman finds kinship with the coal miners of Appalachia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He points out that Bears Ears is the fifth national park or monument in his county and argues that oil and gas extraction would have less impact on the landscape than the brand of adventure tourism that has transformed nearby Moab. \"By designating a monument, you are using a tool that will bring hordes of people to a place that is very sensitive,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Maryboy walks in Bears Ears, home to generations of his ancestors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But according to former county commissioner and Navajo elder Mark Maryboy, cultural sensitivity is hard to find in San Juan County. \"They didn't want to work with us,\" he says. \"In fact, one of the county commissioners told me 'You guys lost the war so you have no business talking about the land planning process.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With efficient strides, he drops into a canyon near the San Juan River, past one of the 100,000 sacred ruins in Bears Ears, to a wall covered in 1,200-year old rock art. The spindly renderings of man and animal are the work of an artist they've dubbed \"Wolfman\" for the paw print signature that accompanies the pictoglyphs. And then he points out the modern bullet holes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ancient rock art is pockmarked by bullet holes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To his Navajo faith, this canyon holds the spirits of his loved ones and these carvings are just as sacred as any art in the Vatican or any wall in Jerusalem, yet someone has been using it for target practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The local white community members are determined to get rid of all the art rock,\" he says. \"It stands in the way of progress for them. It stands in the way of a job. New cars. New clothes. Rolex watch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He's heard the argument that his people need jobs and that the extraction industry could provide them while protecting the most important sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Native Americans built grain stores and other structures in what is now southern Utah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, he feels, history hasn't shown that to be true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The experience that Native Americans see in this county is discrimination,\" he says. \"They are the last ones to be hired for any position. Even if there's a huge mining operation opening up, they will not be hired for that position. And they will be exposed to the toxic materials that are left on the ground or in the air.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless of Trump's decision and unless Utah politicians can figure out a way to take them back and sell them off, the 3 million acres around Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante will remain public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you are an American, this is your land and these are your rocks. Pay them a visit sometime. You'll be amazed at the stories they tell.\nPassage 3:\nIDEAS Marcario is CEO of Patagonia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump’s Dec. 4 proclamation robs the American people of their public lands heritage. The President and a handful of politicians would like you to believe that they are doing what is best by rescinding 85% of Bears Ears National Monument and nearly half of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Nothing could be further from the truth. This action is unprecedented and widely unpopular. It is also illegal, and Patagonia will be challenging his decision in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By eliminating so much of Bears Ears National Monument, the President is putting over a million acres of land at risk for permanent destruction, and we aren’t going to just stand by. Protecting public lands is a core tenet of our mission and vitally important to our industry, and we feel we need to do everything in our power to protect this special place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People often look at this as a states’ rights issue. We acknowledge that people who live closest to these lands often want what is best for them, like the Native American tribes near Bears Ears who are filing suit alongside us. We must also acknowledge that history shows when states control public-trust land, 70% is sold off — and then often used for oil drilling, mining and other industrial activities. This also means that hunters, fishers, outdoorsmen and families like yours can no longer enjoy them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While our complaint contains the specific legal arguments we’re making in challenging the President’s illegal actions, some very basic principles explain why we’re joining this lawsuit: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To enforce the law. The Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution — Article IV, section 3, clause 2 — vests Congress with the power to manage federal lands. Through the Antiquities Act of 1906, Congress delegated a limited amount of power to the President — specifically, the authority to create national monuments protecting certain federal land. But it did not give the President the power to undo a prior president’s monument designations. It kept that power for itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To carry out our purpose as a benefit corporation. Patagonia became a California benefit corporation in 2012, in order to legally enshrine our longstanding environmental and social values into the foundation of our business. Our articles of incorporation require that we confront urgent environmental threats by investing our resources as a growing business into environmental nonprofits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To stand with our grassroots partners. Since 1985, Patagonia has supported hundreds of grassroots organizations in all 50 states fighting to protect public lands at the community level. As a company, we have donated more than $80 million to these groups. Beginning in 2013, we joined tribal leaders and grassroots allies to advocate for the designation of Bears Ears National Monument, and have worked together to defend it from the President’s threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To defend our business. Patagonia’s business relies directly on public lands, like Indian Creek in Bears Ears, which hosts world-class climbing. Powered by national monuments, national parks and other special public lands that draw millions of visitors a year, outdoor recreation is America’s fourth-largest industry — driving $887 billion in annual consumer spending and 7.6 million jobs, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For more than a century, presidents of both political parties have upheld their solemn responsibility as stewards of America’s public lands by protecting our most special wild places. In every corner of the country and across the political spectrum, the American people resoundingly support this tradition. This is not about politics; it’s about protecting the places we love and keeping the great promise of this country for our children and grandchildren. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We won’t let President Trump tear down our heritage and sell it to the highest bidder. We’re proud to keep fighting with everything we’ve got.\nPassage 4:\nThe Latest on President Donald Trump's plan to shrink two national parks in Utah (all times local): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6:30 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outdoor company Patagonia has sued to block President Donald Trump's cuts to Utah's Bears Ears National Monument.

Three lawsuits had been filed by Tuesday night, with more expected Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said he was reversing federal overreach by drastically cutting the sprawling monuments named by Democratic presidents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patagonia, which is expected to file a lawsuit by Wednesday, replaced its usual home page with a stark message, \"The President Stole Your Land.\"The California-based company called Trump's actions illegal and described Monday's action as the largest elimination of protected land in American history.

Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA file NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patagonia's statements follow more than a year of the company's activism on the issue, which is not the only time the retailer has stepped in a debate over Utah's public lands. The company joined with REI and other outdoor recreation companies in leading a push to move the industry's lucrative trade show from Salt Lake City to Denver after two decades in Utah. The move was a high-profile protest over Utah leaders' insistence on getting the Bears Ears designation rescinded and trying to take more control of federal lands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke argued that Bears Ears is still larger than Zion and Bryce Canyon national parks combined even after being downsized to about 202,000 acres while Grand Staircase-Escalante retains about 1 million acres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environmental and conservation groups and a coalition of tribes filed lawsuits Monday that ensure Trump's announcement is far from the final word in the yearslong battle over public lands in Utah and other Western states. The court cases are likely to drag on for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A coalition of the Hopi, Ute Indian, Ute Mountain Ute, Zuni tribes and Navajo Nation sued late Monday to challenge the Bears Ears reduction, which cuts monument status for the rugged land in southeastern Utah by about 85 percent. Bears Ears features thousands of Native American artifacts, including ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tribes argue that federal law only gives presidents the ability to create a national monument, not the ability to downsize one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two lawsuits also have been filed to try to block the Grand Staircase decision, which cuts the monument nearly in half. Grand Staircase contains scenic cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches — and one of the nation's largest known coal reserves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two monuments were created by Democrats Barack Obama and Bill Clinton under a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historically, geographically or culturally important. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump acted on a recommendation by Zinke, who also has urged that two other large national monuments in the West be reduced in size, potentially opening up thousands of acres of land revered for natural beauty and historical significance to mining, logging and other development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The interior secretary's plan would scale back Nevada's Gold Butte and Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou, in addition to the two Utah sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke said Tuesday he would focus changes in Gold Butte on the site's water districts. Gold Butte protects nearly 300,000 acres of desert landscapes featuring rock art, sandstone towers and wildlife habitat for the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and other species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke declined to specify how many acres he wants to remove from monument status, stressing that the administration is working with Nevada's governor and congressional delegation to find a solution.\nPassage 6:\nMonuments 1996: Clinton takes a 1.7 million-acre stand in Utah A Bold Stroke: Clinton takes a 1.7 million-acre stand in Utah NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diane Sylvain NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tom Brownold NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Hartmann/Salt Lake Tribune 1 2 3 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"God's handiwork is everywhere in the natural beauty of the Escalante Canyons and in the Kaiparowits Plateau, in the rock formations that show layer by layer the billions of years of geology, in the fossil record of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life, in the remains of ancient civilizations like the Anasazi Indians. \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In protecting it, we live up to our obligation to preserve our natural heritage.

Environmentalists, Native Americans, government bureaucrats, politicians, scholars and even a few movie stars mingle in the warm September light, excitedly awaiting a pronouncement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the ceremony begins, a few Hopi elders rise and deliver a blessing: \"This is a time of healing,\" they say. \"The healing must begin.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, with a stroke of his pen, President Clinton signs a document establishing 1.7 million acres in southern Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Thanks to the little-known Antiquities Act of 1906, which grants the president executive powers to designate new monuments, the declaration is final. No Congress, no mind-numbing or raucous public hearings, no mess: \"Here Utah, have a monument.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crowd roars its approval, but three men wearing black ribbons on their lapels stand quietly in the back. Perhaps the only time they smile during the ceremony is when the chopping of a helicopter interrupts Utah writer and wilderness advocate Terry Tempest Williams at the precise moment she asks the assembly to \"listen to the silence.\" These three men from Kane County, the home of the new monument, are virtually the only Utah officials present, and they are mad as hell. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After all, the battle over wilderness has raged for more than a decade here. County commissioners sent bulldozers into proposed wilderness areas one Fourth of July, wilderness supporters have been hung in effigy and environmentalists have decided that compromise and consensus are dirty words. It remains to be seen whether the designated monument will heal Utah's environmental war, or prolong it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the announcement at the Grand Canyon, solemn and angry locals in Kanab, Utah, 70 miles to the north, file into the high school gym for their own ceremony. To protest their loss of rights, they wear black arm bands and bear signs reading, \"Shame on you Clinton\" and \"Why Clinton, Why? You're our President.\" And while environmentalists in Washington, D.C., release festively colored balloons on tethers, schoolchildren in Kanab free 50 black balloons to symbolically warn other states that the president could unilaterally lock away their lands, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For six years, Kanab, pop. 3,000, has eagerly awaited coal development by Andalex, a Dutch-owned company that would tap into a mother lode of coal - 62 billion tons according to a recent federal analysis - under the remote, grassy Kaiparowits Plateau. The 50-year project was to provide locals with hundreds of decent-paying jobs and billions of dollars in state and local taxes. Now, with one simple proclamation, Clinton had derailed the plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Utah's mostly Republican congressional delegation, which fought hard to keep the Kaiparowits open to mining, blasted Clinton for steamrolling Westerners. \"This is the mother of all land grabs,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch. \"An outrageous, arrogant approach to public policy,\" echoed Sen. Bob Bennett. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, vowed to cripple the monument by stripping it of funds while state and county officials began crafting a legal challenge to the designation. The outrage wasn't confined to Utah. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, immediately introduced a bill to prevent the president from making a similar designation in his state without full public participation and congressional approval. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The monument will not be managed by the National Park Service, but by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which already administers the area and has long-standing relationships with local communities. Grazing, hunting and fishing will still be allowed (see accompanying story). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This helps some, but not a lot: \"I'd like to see local people involved,\" said Kane County Commissioner Joe Judd. \"I'd like to see taxes for school trust lands (in the monument), and I'd like to see 900 well-paying jobs. But I come across as un-American because the president says this land should be a national monument. Well, the reason this land is so beautiful is because we've been taking care of it for the last 150 years.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Clinton's announcement, but after rumors had been leaked to the national press, Judd flew back to Washington, D.C., to confront White House officials. \"They said they knew nothing about it,\" he said. \"Then the next day we find out it's a done deal and that it's been in the works for four months.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even some environmentalists felt miffed by the administration's secretiveness. \"All kinds of people I work with are angry about the process that didn't happen,\" said Bill Hedden, a Grand County council member who also works for Grand Canyon Trust, the environmental group that helped host the ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while newspapers on either coast ran glowing editorials about the plan, most Utah papers - even the generally pro-environment Salt Lake Tribune - took positions decrying the lack of public participation, if not the plan itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From defense to offense NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Behind the anger, some Utahns were searching their souls. How had control over public land management been so easily wrested from their hands? And would the new monument divide or unite the state in its future struggles over wilderness designation? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Less than a year ago, the state's political leaders seemed on the verge of resolving the struggle over Utah's unprotected wild lands once and for all. They passed legislation based on county recommendations that would have designated as wilderness approximately 1.8 million acres of land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (HCN, 12/25/95). The rest would have been thrown open to development, including large portions of the Kaiparowits Plateau. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environmentalists complained bitterly about the delegation's bill - they were pushing for 5.7 million acres of BLM wilderness - and the process, which they said gave too much influence to rural counties and ignored pro-environmental sentiments in Utah's densely-populated Wasatch Front. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Led by the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, environmentalists nationalized the debate, calling on people across the country to stand up for Utah's magnificent wild lands, to pressure their members of Congress to defeat the Utah delegation's wilderness bill. It worked. Last December, opposition within the House of Representatives forced Hansen to pull his bill before a vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The defeat created a political vacuum, and into it stepped the Clinton administration. One anonymous White House official says administration staffers had been on the lookout for environmental victories they could achieve without congressional support. They'd considered making Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a monument, but decided that the president could use his veto powers to stop destructive oil drilling in the refuge, so they targeted Utah instead. A team from the Department of the Interior, including Interior Solicitor John Leshy, and some outsiders, was asked to work out the details. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Administration officials involved realized the designation was a stroke of political genius. It would resonate well with a public irritated at Republican efforts to roll back environmental laws and regulations; it would shore up the president's green credentials; and it wouldn't affect Clinton's prospects in Utah, where he had finished third behind Ross Perot in 1992. Some say Clinton also got swept away by enthusiasm after announcing a month earlier that the administration would halt a gold mine near Yellowstone National Park. \"It's fun to be president; let's do some more of this,\" he reportedly told a nearby staffer at the park ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it seems that even the administration was caught a little off-guard. Officials were still crafting the monument proposal when reporter Frank Clifford of the Los Angeles Times broke news of it. Then it appeared in the Washington Post, and the White House decided it could wait no longer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already, officials were inundated with pleas from both sides. Utah's delegation begged the president's staff to back off and let Utahns decide the fate of the wildest country left in the lower 48 states. They told Clinton that Utah's schoolchildren would suffer if Andalex couldn't develop and pay fees on 200,000 acres of school trust lands scattered throughout the proposed monument. Finally, they resorted to name-calling in the media: They said the president was a midnight land-grabber seeking to burnish his image just weeks before the November election. Some even charged that environmentalists cozy with the administration had crafted the proposal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Utah environmentalists denied the allegation and said the Utah congressional delegation itself had set the stage for Clinton's decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The stars were aligned,\" said an exultant Ken Rait of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. \"The backdrop was created by the arrogance of the Utah delegation which snubbed much of its constituency. It pushed a wilderness bill that tried to bring down the spirit and intent of the wilderness act, (and that) put Utah public lands on the national map.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Added the Grand Canyon Trust's Hedden: \"The creation of the monument was a reaction to the fact that we are so polarized in this state that we can't communicate at all with each other. We have failed to come up with a solution on our own, so basically we took ourselves out of the debate.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happens now? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will Utahns hold a permanent grudge or will they sit down together to craft an agreeable management plan for the monument? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, cooperation seems unlikely. Kane County Commissioner Judd says his county will now back away from an expected agreement with state and federal agencies to reintroduce California condors to the area. \"We're not going to sign it now,\" said Judd. \"If one of those condors sits its butt in the monument, why, then, we've got an endangered species problem.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government,\" echoes Kane County's attorney Colin Winchester. \"I know it's playground stuff - you know, my daddy's bigger than yours - but that's the way we feel now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others believe that the president's move will ultimately be seen as a watershed leading to more peaceful resolutions of public land issues. Writer Terry Tempest Williams says she believes many Utahns support the monument. \"To hear what's going on in the papers, you'd think Utah is in a wake,\" she said. \"But my family is Republican and they're absolutely thrilled. This is one important step toward a growing conservation ethic that we are seeing in Utah. I think things will calm down and the hard work will begin.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollsters at the Salt Lake Tribune are waiting for the anger to subside before trying to find out what Utahns really think. The Deseret News, however, released an early poll showing 49 percent opposed to the monument and 29 percent for it; 61 percent said the process used to create it was unfair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond the immediate question of the monument lurks the larger question of how much additional public land in Utah should be designated wilderness. Some environmentalists fear the monument will be the extent of it for a long, long time. Others say it strengthens their hand. Says Tempest Williams, \"I view (the monument) as a down payment.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One precedent for such a view is Alaska. Following President Jimmy Carter's designation of some 56 million acres of national monuments there in 1978, Alaska's congressional delegation began holding serious talks with industry leaders and environmentalists about which lands warranted protection and which could be exploited for resources. The result: the 1980 Alaska Lands Act, the largest and perhaps most remarkable piece of public-lands legislation in the last century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Optimists might also take heart from a marquee outside a roadside business in Kanab.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nIn little over a year, at least six women have disappeared from Chillicothe, Ohio, a town of only 21,000 people. (The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years, Chillicothe, Ohio, was known as just another notch on the Rust Belt, afflicted by the same old problems of drugs, poverty and unemployment. If the town ever made national news, it was because a presidential candidate stopped by vowing to fix things, only for those promises to evaporate after Election Day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the past couple of months, Chillicothe has crept back into headlines for something other than a stump speech. Something much darker. Something evil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chillicothe is no longer just another Rust Belt town. Now it’s the place where women go missing and wash up dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In little over a year, at least six women have disappeared from the town of only 21,000. Four of their bodies have been found, almost all of them dumped in creeks or streams flowing away from the town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women have similar stories. Most of them were hooked on drugs, and many moonlighted as prostitutes to fund their addictions, police say. Some of them even knew one another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The similarities between the victims and the crime scenes have Chillicothe terrified that a serial killer is on the loose. Local police, several county sheriffs’ offices and state investigators have banded together to solve the spiraling murder mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even FBI analysts are assisting with the investigation, busy compiling a profile of a possible serial killer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t want to come out and say ‘yes, we have a serial killer,’ but it’s a small community that we live in … and the number of females who have come up missing, and then the bodies that we’ve found, that’s quite a bit for our community,” Staff Lt. Mike Preston of the Ross County Sheriff’s Department told The Washington Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The community is starting to get concerned,” he said. “Everyone just wants answers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the absence of answers — and arrests — residents are getting scared. The fear that a serial killer is stalking prostitutes swirls around Chillicothe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Obviously there has to be something going on,” said Jessica Sayre, whose older sister, Tiffany, was the latest victim. Her body was found in a drainage pipe Saturday after she had been missing for more than a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Apparently my sister was the next target,” Jessica Sayre said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women began disappearing a year ago from Chillicothe, a town about an hour south of Columbus. Ohio’s first capital more than 200 years ago — a title still boasted on city signs — Chillicothe has fallen far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are battling a problem with heroin in our community,” Preston said. Prostitution is on the rise as well, he acknowledged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charlotte Trego was the first to vanish. In her late 20s with wavy brown hair and glasses, the mother of two young kids had fallen on hard times. “She started taking pain pills and graduated to heroin,” according to the Columbus Dispatch. In the spring of 2014, Trego told her mother that she was ready to get clean. Her mom found a rehab center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then Trego was evicted by her roommate, according to the Chillicothe Gazette. She was last seen May 3, 2014. It was as if Chillicothe’s increasingly dangerous streets simply swallowed her whole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That same day, a friend of Trego’s, Tameka Lynch, also vanished. Like Trego, Lynch had drug problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She used and she kind of was struggling, especially after she was diagnosed with lupus,” Lynch’s cousin, Chasity Lett, told the Huffington Post. “Once that happened and she lost her place, it kind of triggered the whole drug thing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lynch, a 30-year-old mother of three, financed her deepening addiction by selling her body, the Huffington Post reported, citing Chillicothe police and a local prostitute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I knew her,” said the woman, whom the Huffington Post did not identify. “It was around midnight when she went to turn tricks and disappeared.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lynch was the first of “Chillicothe’s missing women” — as the six have been called — to be found. On May 24, three weeks after her disappearance, a kayaker spotted Lynch’s body on a sandbar in Paint Creek outside town. The Ross County coroner’s office determined that she had died of a multiple-drug overdose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Lynch was afraid of the water, her mother told the Dispatch. “Somebody needs to pay for this,” Angela Robinson said, speculating that her daughter had been murdered. “She was already dead when she was put in the water,” she told the Huffington Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the year since, four more women have vanished. Three of them have come home in coffins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Nov. 3, 2014, six months after Trego and Lynch disappeared, another local woman went missing. Wanda Lemons is a 37-year-old mother of five. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She just disappeared out of thin air,” her daughter, Megan Hodges, told the Huffington Post. “I just want them to find out what happened to her.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think her disappearance might be related to sex trafficking, but if it were drugs I don’t think it would be related,” Hodges added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two months later, Shasta Himelrick’s body was found floating in the Scioto River outside Chillicothe. In December, she had gleefully told friends that she was “eating for two,” according to the Chillicothe Gazette. On Christmas Day, the pregnant 20-year-old blonde had received a text message while visiting her grandmother. Himelrick left, promising to return, but never did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Chillicothe gas station surveillance camera recorded her ducking inside. Hours later, her abandoned car was found on a bridge south of town. The doors were open, the tank was empty and the battery was dead. Himelrick’s body was fished from the water eight days later. The coroner ruled the death a suicide, but Himelrick’s friends are convinced it was murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiffany Sayre, 26, went missing on May 11. On June 20, her body was found wrapped in a bed sheet. (The Sayre family) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiffany Sayre with her two children. (The Sayre family) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiffany Sayre went missing under similar circumstances. It was around midnight on May 11, and Sayre and her friend Jessie Sanford were working at a local motel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She was doing business at the Chillicothe Inn,” Sanford told the Huffington Post. “She left to run to her grandmother’s house and was going to go back to the hotel to meet the same people so she could make some more money. I don’t know what happened. I think somebody took her.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the other women, Sayre had gotten involved in drugs and prostitution, according to police and family members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenneth Buell, Sayre’s ex-boyfriend and the father of their two children, told The Washington Post that the couple had done heroin and crack cocaine together. “For a couple of years we were both on drugs,” he said. Buell said he got clean a year ago, but Sayre couldn’t, and the couple broke up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She couldn’t kick it,” he said. “It just had a hold of her.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jessica Sayre said her sister had met another man and tried to go straight. But when her new boyfriend died in April from a blood clot, Tiffany went back to drugs and the vices that funded her addiction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It hit my sister really hard. She really loved him,” Jessica Sayre said. “They had planned on moving, going to this other place, actually getting married and having a life together. I think she did the drugs a little more to help with the pain. She didn’t want to be in her right mind because she didn’t feel like it was the right thing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The night she apparently went missing, she talked about how she wanted to get her life straight and go clean,” Sayre added. “My sister did these things that we did not approve of to get money for drugs, because we didn’t want to be the source of money for those types of things. She did what she had to do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Did she have a problem? Yes, everybody’s got problems,” Buell said. “Hers got a hold of her and didn’t let go.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR // NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know everyone is probably getting sick and tired of me sharing the pictures of my cousin and all the other ladies that… Posted by Courtney Willett on Tuesday, June 9, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sayre’s family put out missing-person fliers and held candlelight vigils but heard nothing. While they were waiting, another woman, Timberly Clayton, was found dead: shot in the head three times and left in a ditch near another creek. (Authorities named Jason A. McCrary, a 36-year-old convicted sex offender, as the prime suspect in the killing but have not yet charged him with the crime.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, last Saturday, Sayre became the latest victim in the string of deadly disappearances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A couple out for a Saturday evening walk through a nature preserve south of Chillicothe spotted something white at the edge of a drainage pipe running underneath the road. Sayre’s naked body had been wrapped in a bed sheet and hidden inside the culvert with a crown of duct tape around her strawberry blond hair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She’s wrapped up in a blanket and you can see her breasts, her stomach, duct tape, a white blanket,” the female passerby told a 911 dispatcher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We were hoping that she was still alive,” Jessica Sayre said. “You’re wishing and hoping and then all of a sudden you get a phone call saying that your loved one has been found, but not the way you wanted to find her.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She got murdered,” Buell said more bluntly. “Somebody took her away and it was intentional.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have ruled Sayre’s death a homicide. The grisly discovery helped launch the task force, which now includes more than a dozen members, including the FBI analysts, according to Preston. The task force is investigating the cases of all six women, even those formerly considered suicides. According to media reports, the investigation could also expand to at least three other women who went missing from nearby Portsmouth and Columbus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A serial killer is a possibility, Preston admitted. He said officials were studying the apparent pattern of the dumping of the bodies along waterways outside the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This wasn’t just a simple overdose,” Jessica Sayre said of her sister’s death. “They could have called the police. We didn’t have to find her like this.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These motherf—— are gonna get done,” Buell said, promising vengeance. “What would you do if somebody took your life away?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiffany Sayre, 26, went missing May 11. On June 20, her body was found wrapped in a bed sheet. (The Sayre family) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is analyzing the forensics found at the scene for traces of a suspect, Preston said. He added that the task force had received more than 100 tips in just a few days but is still searching for a witness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A lot of those people may be afraid to come forward,” he said. “If they are afraid, they can let us know anonymously. We just want the information. Somebody saw something.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as authorities delve into the growing number of deaths and disappearances, some locals say the police are part of the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The day I reported her missing was very upsetting to me,” Trego’s mother, Yvonne Boggs, told the Huffington Post. “The cop said, ‘Women like your daughter take off because they don’t want to be bothered.’ It was like they looked into it up to a certain point and then quit looking.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The police didn’t take it serious and just blew me off,” Lynch’s mother, Angela Robinson, told the same Web site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sayre’s family said they had also been kept in the dark. Buell even blamed the authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These police down here are pieces of s—,” he said. “They even go around and pick up the prostitutes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both he and Jessica Sayre said police and authorities had long ago abandoned Chillicothe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s not safe,” he said. “The last five, six, seven years it’s gone to hell. You can’t walk around by yourself, especially females.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I feel like Chillicothe has turned for the worst,” Jessica Sayre said. “Now they are going to start picking up the pieces, but this town has really gone down with drugs. It’s got pretty bad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said that despite the discovery of her sister’s body, her family would continue to hold vigils for Trego and Lemons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s been a nightmare for us,” she said of Tiffany’s death. “Nothing is going to bring her back, but we are going to get justice. And we are going to pray for these two other women who are missing in Chillicothe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This town has beauty,” she said. “This town can come together.”\nPassage 2:\nCHILLICOTHE, Ohio -- One-by-one, at least four women have disappeared or turned up dead in this small city, where family and friends fear a serial killer or sex traffickers are on the loose, and authorities are ruling nothing out.

The evacuation of rebel-held eastern Aleppo has however yet to begin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The confusion over the deal, which imposed a ceasefire at 6pm local time on Tuesday, highlighted the splits and competing interests of Assad’s supporters, which include Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias on the ground, who were on Tuesday implicated by the United Nations in execution-style shootings of civilians in opposition areas.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia said the renewed shelling was a response to rebel attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said confusion surrounding the evacuation showed it was imperative to have UN observers to manage the process. “France wants the presence of UN observers on the ground and humanitarian organisations like the Red Cross must intervene,” he told France 2 television. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There had been conflicting accounts of the expected start times for the evacuation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An initial deal that would have seen thousands of civilians and opposition fighters granted safe passage out of the city stalled on Wednesday and the planned exodus failed to materialize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran, one of Assad’s main backers, had imposed new conditions, saying it wanted the simultaneous evacuation of wounded from two villages besieged by rebels, according to rebel and U.N. sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Abdul Salam Abdul Razak, a military spokesman for the Nour al-Din al Zinki rebel group, said late on Wednesday that a new agreement had been reached which included those villages in Idlib province. “Within the coming hours its implementation will begin,” he told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official in the Jabha Shamiya rebel group said implementation would begin around 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official in the pro-Damascus military alliance confirmed the truce deal was on, and said about 15,000 people would be evacuated from the majority Shi’ite villages, Foua and Kefraya, in return for the evacuation from Aleppo of “militants and their families and whoever wants to leave among civilians”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said those leaving Aleppo would head for Idlib province to the west of the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Jabha Shamiya official however denied that 15,000 people would leave the two villages and said only the wounded would be evacuated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not immediately clear how the deal had been reached. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original ceasefire was brokered by Russia, Assad’s most powerful ally, and opposition backer Turkey on Tuesday. But the planned evacuation of rebel-held areas did not happen and instead shelling and gunfire erupted in the city on Wednesday, with Turkey accusing government forces of breaking the truce. Syrian state television said rebel shelling killed six people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, said the bombardment by Syrian government forces and their allies “most likely constitutes war crimes”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call earlier in the day to make a joint effort to start the process, Turkish presidential sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before the new deal was announced, clashes raged in Aleppo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Government forces made a new advance in Sukkari - one of just a handful of districts still held by rebels - and brought half of the neighborhood under their control, the Observatory said. Rebels saying they launched an attack against government forces using suicide car bombs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia’s decision to deploy its air force to Syria 18 months ago turned the war in Assad’s favor after rebel advances across western Syria. In addition to Aleppo, he has won back insurgent strongholds near Damascus this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government and its allies have focused the bulk of their firepower on fighting rebels in western Syria rather than Islamic State, which this week managed to take back the ancient city of Palmyra, once again illustrating the challenge Assad faces reestablishing control over all Syria.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nTrouble at the Top NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More deaths on Everest underscore its problems with overcrowding and unstable weather and geography, writes Nick Heil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By now, everyone has seen the startling photos and video of the conga line of climbers ascending Everest earlier this month. If you’ve ever wondered what a human traffic jam looks like at the roof of the world, there it is, in all its goose-down glory. The images, from just a few days ago, show as many as 300 mountaineers moving between Camp 3, on the Lhotse Face, to Camp 4, on the South Col. This isn’t summit day, when those climbers converged again even higher up, but it’s nearly as bad. Many of them successfully reached the top, but at least four didn’t make it back to the bottom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A couple of weeks earlier, an equally surprising, if less sensational, story emerged from the mountain, this time from Base Camp. I’m referring to the unprecedented May 7 decision by Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience (Himex), one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, to cancel his climb, pull up stakes, and go home. Himex has run commercial trips on Everest since 1994, and this year had more than 60 team members on the hill, not to mention a village worth of tents, food, fuel, ropes, radios, and other gear and supplies. Clients had coughed up a nonrefundable $60,000 for the climb, and they’d barely ventured above base camp. After the fateful meeting that morning, Greg Paul, one of the Himex team members who was blogging about his Everest climb, wrote, “Jaws dropped and shock spread throughout the room. Long held dreams, years of training, big time and financial commitments all down the drain in one pronouncement.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few days later, Himex elaborated on the specific reasons the team decided to abort. These included dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures; dire warnings from experienced sherpas passing through the Khumbu Icefall about its instability; a massive serac (a hanging ice-cliff) directly threatening climbers from above the trail; abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face (a steep section of the route); and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season. If overcrowding was also part of their calculus, there was no mention of it on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The growing number of climbers on Everest—most of them amateurs—and the increasing instability of the high-alpine environment, sum up the mountain’s enduring dilemma: How to manage its burgeoning popularity as the terrain becomes ever more dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Himex gone, a mere 700 or so climbers remain on the south side this season (additional teams are also climbing on the north side of the mountain, in Tibet). By May 23, the total body count was up to 11 on the season (the 11th person was reported dead, but has since been found and rescued), barely shy of Everest’s deadlist year, 1996, when 15 people perished, including eight in one day. Currently, a second wave of 200 or so climbers are poised to make a summit bid on May 24-25. Not surprisingly, many observers and media outlets are already fluttering with morbid prognostications of additional carnage. The public isn’t infatuated with this place because it expects everything to turn out OK. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For those who are unfamiliar with how the Everest dance works, here’s a primer: Climbing teams spend weeks on the mountain acclimatizing before making their summit push, typically between early May and the first week of June, a brief weather window that provides favorable chances of reaching the summit—and returning alive. Everyone ascends via the same route, clipping into ropes stitched up the mountainside—six miles of it—all the way to the top. On summit day, you race the clock, trying to get up and down before your oxygen runs out and your body gives in to the hypoxic environment. There is no cap on the total number of climbing permits issued each year (Nepal is happy to collect the permit fees). Nor are there any regulations determining who goes, or when. If the forecast looks good, it’s up to the loose confederacy of international expeditions to determine whether they jump or stay put. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Commercial climbing on Everest is in trouble. Despite the best efforts of the established players to improve communication and cooperation; despite a full-time independent medical clinic now operating at base camp; despite, even, the arrival of powerful, high-altitude rescue helicopters servicing some of Everest’s high terrain, the mountain’s two biggest problems—the sheer number of climbers and the deteriorating conditions—have expanded beyond anyone’s control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latter, a growing body of research suggests, may well be linked to climate change. The conditions on Everest this year could be a seasonal aberration, but some hard evidence indicates the unstable trend is here to stay. Nepal’s glaciers have shrunk more than 20 percent in the last 30 years, and the rate has accelerated during the last decade, according to research from the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development. Temperatures throughout the Himalayas are, on average, rising, and the mountains are falling apart in the warming atmosphere. As the Himex climber Greg Paul noted in his post, “Russell [Brice] expects an accident of catastrophic proportions to possible [sic] hit the icefall.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corbis (4) Mountaineers descend from the summit of Everest May 19, 2009 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For every outfit like Himex that makes a prudent, conservative decision to leave, however, a dozen other expeditions stand ready to fill in the vacated boot track. That’s because, since so much is already in motion, it’s nearly impossible to reverse course, a pressure that only intensifies the closer teams get to the top. It’s one of the reasons Himex’s decision is so astonishing. For all the ballyhoo directed at successful Everesters, bailing out midclimb requires an act of will beyond the capacity of most commercial mountaineers. It’s far easier to ignore the risks than to heed them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Something else may be happening, too. The proliferation of communication technology now commonplace on remote expeditions has taken Everest voyeurism to new heights. Photos, video, podcasts, lengthy written dispatches, 3D graphics, and GPS tracking tools flood websites each spring, beaming reports from the mountain, practically in real time. Far from serving as cautionary tales, warning wannabes from the dangerous slopes, these extreme reality shows only bolster the peak’s mystique, prestige, and appeal. Climbing Everest has long been a spectacle; now it’s a spectator sport, with no shortage of willing participants.\nPassage 2:\nIn \"Disposable Man\" (August 2013), Grayson Schaffer's story about the risks Sherpas face helping paying clients up Everest, we wanted to know the fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest. And we also wanted to answer another question: How did this rate compare to traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation (a.k.a. bush pilots), and even military combat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Annual Fatality Rates by Profession NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number of Sherpas Killed on Everest by Year NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To do that, we used the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' formula for fatality rates per 100,000 full-time equivalents. Determining fatalities was easy: the Himalayan Database keeps excellent records. But figuring out how many hours Sherpas work each season took some legwork—Sherpas don't punch in and out like miners do, and employers aren't paying them by the hour. But we consulted with guides, outfitters, and climbers to arrive at numbers we felt gave a fair picture of just how dangerous the job was (the results: far more dangerous than being a soldier in Iraq from 2003 to 2007). There was only one hitch: to be consistent with the Bureau of Labor Statistic's numbers, we only calculated the number for fatalities from 2000 to 2010. And fatalities have been rising since then. If we calculate the fatality rate for the past decade, the numbers become much more distressing.

It caps the worst three-year period in Everest history.\nPassage 3:\nFor many years, the most lucrative commercial guiding operation on Mt. Everest has been a company called Himalayan Experience, or Himex, which is owned by a New Zealand mountaineer named Russell Brice. In the spring of 2012, more than a month into the climbing season, he became increasingly worried about a bulge of glacial ice three hundred yards wide that was frozen tenuously to Everest’s West Shoulder, hanging like a massive sword of Damocles directly over the main route up the Nepal side of the mountain. Brice’s clients (“members,” in the parlance of Himalayan mountaineering), Western guides, and Sherpas repeatedly had to climb beneath the threatening ice bulge as they moved up and down the mountain to acclimatize and establish a series of higher camps necessary for their summit assault. One day, Brice timed how long it took his head guide, Adrian Ballinger (“who is incredibly fast,” he wrote in the blog post excerpted below), to climb through the most hazardous terrain: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding to Brice’s concern, some of his most experienced Sherpas, ordinarily exceedingly stoical men, approached him to say that the conditions on the mountain made them fear for their lives. One of them actually broke down in tears as he confessed this. So on May 7, 2012, Brice made an announcement that shocked most of the thousand people camped at the base of Everest: he was pulling all his guides, members, and Sherpas off the mountain, packing up their tents and equipment, and heading home. He was widely criticized for this decision in 2012, and not just by clients who were forced to abandon their dreams of climbing the world’s highest mountain without receiving a refund for the forty-three thousand euros they had paid him in advance. Many of the other expedition leaders also thought Brice was wildly overreacting. The reputation of Himex took a major hit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After what happened last Friday, though, it’s hard to argue with Brice’s call. On April 18th, shortly before 7 A.M. local time, an overhanging wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion broke loose from the same ice bulge that had frightened Brice into leaving Everest in 2012. As it crashed onto the slope below, the ice shattered into truck-size chunks and hurtled toward some fifty climbers laboring slowly upward through the Khumbu Icefall, a jumbled maze of unstable ice towers that looms above the 17,600-foot base camp. The climbers in the line of fire were at approximately nineteen thousand feet when the avalanche struck. Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams. Three of the bodies were buried beneath the frozen debris and may never be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although many news reports indicated that all the victims were Sherpas, the legendary mountain people who comprise just half of one per cent of the Nepali population, three of the sixteen were members of other, much larger ethnic groups: one was Gurung, one was Tamang, and one was a member of the Hindu Chhetri caste. All, however, were employed as high-altitude climbing Sherpas—an élite profession that deservedly commands respect and admiration from mountaineers around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest, twice as deadly as the infamous storm in May, 1996, that killed eight people, the subject of my book “Into Thin Air” (four of my teammates accounted for half of that grim tally). But dying on Everest has been an occupational hazard for Sherpas ever since a team led by George Leigh Mallory to attempt the Tibetan side of the peak, in 1922, became the first mountaineers to ascend higher than the lower flanks of the mountain. In the final days of that expedition, seven Sherpas from Darjeeling, India, were swept to their deaths in an avalanche. Sad to say, the job hasn’t gotten any safer for Sherpas with the passage of time. According to a piece by Jonah Ogles posted on outsideonline.com, the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 until now was twelve times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no denying that climbing Everest is a preposterously dangerous undertaking for the members who provide the Sherpas’ income. But running counter to the disturbing trend among Sherpas, climbing Everest has actually grown significantly safer for Western guides and members in recent years, according to the available data. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Western climbers now use bottled oxygen much more liberally than they did in the past; many Western climbers now prophylactically dose themselves with dexamethasone, a powerful steroid, when they ascend above twenty-two thousand feet, which has proven to be an effective strategy for minimizing the risk of contracting high-altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) and high-altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ), potentially fatal ailments that are common on Everest; and weather forecasts are much more accurate than they were eighteen or twenty years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the seventy-six years from the first attempt on Everest, in 1921, through 1996, when I was guided up Everest, a hundred and forty-four people died and the summit was reached six hundred and thirty times, a ratio of one death for every four successful ascents. Notably, over the eighteen years that have passed since 1996, a hundred and four people have died and the summit has been reached six thousand two hundred and forty-one times—one death for every sixty ascents. Furthermore, non-Sherpas accounted for only seventy-one of these deaths, which equates to just one death for every eighty-eight ascents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason the risk remains so much greater for Sherpas can be traced to several things. Sherpas aren’t provided with nearly as much bottled oxygen, because it is so expensive to buy and to stock on the upper mountain, and they tend to be much better acclimatized than Westerners. Sherpas are almost never given dexamethasone prophylactically, because they don’t have personal physicians in their villages who will prescribe the drug on request. And perhaps most significant, Sherpas do all the heavy lifting on Everest, literally and figuratively. The mostly foreign-owned guiding companies assign the most dangerous and physically demanding jobs to their Sherpa staff, thereby mitigating the risk to their Western guides and members, whose backpacks seldom hold much more than a water bottle, a camera, an extra jacket, and lunch. The work Sherpas are paid to do—carrying loads, installing the aluminum ladders, stringing and anchoring thousands of feet of rope—requires them to spend vastly more time on the most dangerous parts of the mountain, particularly in the Khumbu Icefall—the shattered, creaking, ever-shifting expanse of glacier that extends from just above base camp, at seventeen thousand six hundred feet, to the nineteen-thousand-five-hundred-foot elevation. The fact that members and Western guides now suck down a lot more bottled oxygen is wonderful for them, but it means the Sherpas have to carry those additional oxygen bottles through the Icefall for the Westerners to use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historically, more Everest climbers have perished from severe weather, HACE , HAPE , exhaustion, falling from steep terrain, or some combination of these hazards than from being crushed or buried in the Khumbu Icefall. This seems to be changing, however. Accurate weather forecasting has reduced the risk of being surprised by a killer storm like the one that struck in 1996. But the pronounced warming of the Himalayan climate in recent years has made the Icefall more unstable than ever, and there is still no way to predict when a serac is going to topple over. And Sherpas spend much, much more time in the Icefall than their Western employers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1996, for example, I made four round trips through the Khumbu Icefall: three circuits as I progressively acclimatized to twenty-four thousand feet during the month of April, and a final round trip on my journey to the 29,035-foot summit and back. I was terrified each of the eight times I moved through the frozen chaos, which usually took more than three hours to ascend, even with my nearly empty backpack, and slightly less than an hour to descend. In contrast, each of the Sherpas supporting my team’s ascent was required to make something like thirty trips through the Icefall, often while carrying eighty-pound loads of food, propane, and bottled oxygen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These days, moreover, members are apt to spend even less time in the Icefall than I did when I was on Everest, eighteen years ago. It’s becoming increasingly common for Western guides and members to acclimatize in hypobaric chambers before they arrive in Nepal, or on other, less hazardous Himalayan peaks in advance of their summit assaults, greatly reducing the number of times they must expose themselves to the perils of the Icefall. Some members now make only a single round trip through it, while each of the Sherpas supporting them must still pass through that hazardous terrain between two and three dozen times. Most Western climbers feel more than a little guilty about this, but I know of none who have ever offered to take an extra lap through the Icefall with a heavy load in order to reduce a Sherpa’s exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statistics suggesting that Everest has become safe for members may, in fact, be giving Westerners a false sense of security, however. The astounding number of climbers who now attempt to reach the summit on the limited number of days when the weather is favorable presents a new kind of hazard. A notorious photo shot by Ralf Dujmovits in May, 2012, showed more than a hundred and fifty people attached to a series of fixed ropes as they ascended the Lhotse Face toward the South Col of Everest, jammed together so tightly that they had to move in lockstep. The static weight of all these people and their gear was well over thirty thousand pounds. If some mishap had occurred that caused more than a handful of the climbers to put their full weight on one of the ropes simultaneously, the shock to the anchors securing the ropes to the ice could easily have caused them to fail, resulting in the climbers falling two thousand or more feet to the base of the Lhotse Face. If such an accident should come to pass in the future (which isn’t far-fetched), the death count for both members and Sherpas would be horrific. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any event, no Western members or guides were killed or injured in last week’s avalanche. At the moment, in the immediate aftermath, almost everyone climbing on the Nepal side of Everest has retreated to base camp to try to come to grips with the catastrophe. Most of them, Sherpas and foreign climbers alike, are reeling from the unprecedented loss of life. At least one expedition has already announced that it will abandon the mountain. For the foreign climbers, to go home now will mean forfeiting most or all of the fifty to ninety thousand dollars they have spent to be guided up Everest. For the Sherpas who make the guided ascents possible, however, to quit now, after only a few weeks’ wages, will be an even greater economic sacrifice, relatively speaking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Depending on their talent, experience, foreign-language skills, how many loads they carry up and down the mountain, and how generously they’re tipped by their clients, climbing Sherpas generally take home between two and eight thousand dollars at the conclusion of an Everest expedition, which commences for them in late March and typically ends around the first of June. If a climbing Sherpa dies on the job, his family receives a million rupees (approximately ten thousand five hundred dollars) from the insurance his employer is required to provide. By any reasonable measure, neither these wages nor insurance payouts are fair compensation for the risk involved. But in Nepal, where the median annual income is less than six hundred dollars, most of the Sherpas’ countrymen would eagerly take similar risks for the opportunity to receive that kind of pay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, on April 20th, after holding several emotional, contentious meetings at Everest base camp, the climbing Sherpas announced that they would go on strike unless the Nepali government agreed to meet thirteen demands within a week. The threat of a work stoppage was provoked by the Sherpas’ outrage over the Nepali government’s offer to provide just forty thousand rupees—slightly more than four hundred dollars—to the families of the Sherpas killed in the avalanche, to defray their funeral expenses. Among the Sherpas’ demands are that the government increase this compensation to approximately a thousand dollars per family; provide ten thousand dollars to climbing Sherpas who have been seriously disabled; establish a permanent relief fund for injured Sherpas with a portion of the ten-thousand-dollar permit fee every Western Everest climber is charged by the Nepali government; double the current insurance benefit provided by the guiding companies to twenty-one thousand dollars; require the guiding companies to pay Sherpas their salaries, even if they call off the remainder of the 2014 Everest climbing season; and establish a monument in Kathmandu to memorialize the deceased Sherpas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The collective anger and resentment expressed by the Sherpas over the past few days is unprecedented. On April 20th, Tim and Becky Rippel, the owners of a guiding company called Peak Freaks, which lost a Sherpa named Mingma Tenzing to a fatal case of HAPE earlier in the month, stated, in a blog post: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we suggested in a previous post the Sherpa guides are heating up, emotions are running wild and demands are being made to share the wealth with the Sherpa people on the table. Now that there are more Sherpa operators today on Everest, they’ve come to learn how much the government of Nepal makes in revenues from Everest expeditions and they are asking for a share. This is their time and under very unfortunate circumstances. In any case things are getting very complicated and there is a lot of tension here and it’s growing. Peak Freaks is in support of the Sherpa people any which way it goes. They are our family, our brothers and sisters and the muscle on Everest. We follow their lead, we are guests here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Should the government and the Sherpas manage to reach an agreement concerning the terms of the new demands, it will come as no great surprise if most of the Sherpas now grieving intensely for their absent companions resume their dangerous work within the next week or two. Many people believe that this is the most likely outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jon Krakauer’s most recent books are “Three Cups of Deceit,” “Where Men Win Glory,” and “Under the Banner of Heaven.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by Niranjan Shrestha/AP.\n", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "length": 4329, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f4a2ca446392424def82aedb5cd9c48b73dead7e3ac5e14d"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: I am Hillary Rodham Clinton. I’m the 67th Secretary of State for the United States of America, serving in the Administration of President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Okay. We’re in Dubai because we had a little problem with your plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Now, what does that say – (laughter) – about American power, because it’s not the first time your plane breaks down? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think it says that we prioritize. So the President’s plane, Air Force One, is absolutely impeccable. Our fighter jets are the best in the world. Others of our Air Force are first-rate. But I think there’s a long line ahead of the plane that I’m in, which I share with the Vice President and other high officials. So we’ve had our ups and downs, as you might say, with this airplane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: On the other hand, you actually have an airplane that you can commandeer to go wherever you want when needed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: That’s exactly right. So I have no complaints. And if we were to just chart the hundreds of thousands of miles that I have traveled, the mechanical problems, or in the case of volcanic ash clouds or rocks on runways, have been relatively few. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Does the plane feel like a home away from home, an office with wings? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: It feels like an office, not a home, because it is an office. It has secure communications, it has a very able civilian and military team, we get a lot of work done on the plane, but it’s a little challenging jet lag-wise, mileage, dehydration, all of the problems that come with spending a lot of time in the air. So I am always happy to be home once we finally land. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: How do you handle jet lag? I mean, I travel with – I’ve traveled with you quite a bit, and at the end of the trips, I’m exhausted and I take a few days off. You go back to the office the next day. How do you do it? Do you do yoga, a special diet, what’s the secret? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I sleep a lot on the plane. I know that some people think you should stay up for a certain period of time and not sleep on certain legs, but since I am perpetually tired, I figure make up for the lost hours of sleep while flying. Also, I know very simple things – drink a lot of water, deep breathing, try to get a little bit of sunshine if you can every day. But I don’t know that there’s any magic formula. Because I, too, often am tired; there’s no doubt about it. But I’m exhilarated at the same time. I love what we’re doing, I’m honored to represent our country everywhere we go, and I feel like we are making a difference. So that is enough to keep me going. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: I want to take you back to our stop in Shannon when we were on our way here. You took me outside to talk to those two Irish guys. Tell me about them. You seemed to have a very nice conversation with them. Are they always there to welcome you when you land? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: They work at the airport, so they and a few others are usually always there. They’re combination security and welcoming, and I have gotten to talk with them over the years, stopping, going from Shannon. And I love Ireland, so it was great because we were there while it was still light out, and actually, I had slept till about five minutes before we were going to take off again. So I wanted to get a little air and a little bit of sun, and they kindly accommodated me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: When we travel with you, we are in what is known apparently as the bubble. How would you describe the bubble? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I don’t think of it so much as a bubble. I think of it as more of a caravan going from place to place, and sometimes the dogs bark, but we still move on. And it is for me a moveable adventure. No day is the same, in part because the places, the issues, the leaders, the people, the food are enough different still in our increasingly interconnected world that there’s always something new to see or hear about or discover. But it is true that when we’re traveling, we are focused on where we have been, are, and intend to go. So a lot of what happens back in the United States has to take second priority to what we are actually focused on. But there is no escaping the constant stream of paper, which is never ending. And I keep up with that on the road. So I don’t feel like I’m cut off in any way. I assume it would have been quite challenging, but such different times you would not maybe have noticed, 50 or 100 years ago when travel was much slower, communication was either so slow or nonexistent. So we live in this 24/7 media environment. So I’m always kept up to date, but I try to keep my attention on what we’re doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: But do you ever wish you could break free of the caravan and go explore on your own? Where would you go? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I do wish that, and I’ve been fortunate because I’ve traveled before this current job where I had the opportunity to explore, wander, walk anonymously, and even in – NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Anonymously? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Anonymously in those days. (Laughter.) That was a long time ago. So I would have felt very sad if I hadn’t had that experience before I – before my husband was president, certainly before I was a first lady, a senator, or a secretary. I went to a lot of places, and that gave me a familiarity. But even on these trips in the last two and a half years or so, every once in a while I will go for a walk and just get away. I remember when we were in Wellington, New Zealand and we were on the water, and there was a great walkway. I walked for probably an hour, and it’s just so rejuvenating to me. It’s my favorite thing to do. So I don’t get enough time to do that, but I try to fit it in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: If I’m not mistaken, your Secret Service code when you were first lady was Evergreen, and it’s stayed. And in hindsight, it’s quite a fitting name – (laughter) – because you’ve renewed yourself, reinvented yourself so often and so well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Apparently – well, apparently so. I had no choice. I was just given the name. My husband was Eagle. My daughter was Energy. And I think those are all fitting code names. But I have been lucky. I’ve been so fortunate to have been given these opportunities in my life over the course of a long time now. And I never take it for granted. I’m never complacent about it. I’m always energized by it because I think it’s important. I think the work that we’re trying to do, especially in this time of such tumultuous change, is going to set the template for the rest of this century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: It is a very tumultuous time in the Arab world and in many other places, and you have to meet a lot of leaders around the world. Some of them you like; some of them perhaps you like a little bit less. What is it like to have to shake hands with an autocrat, with somebody whose values you don’t really share? It can’t be easy to smile for the cameras all the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: It isn’t, and I have had to do it quite a bit over the course of the last 20 years. But I try to remember why I’m there and why I’m doing it. The United States has relationships with every country just about. There are a few exceptions that we don’t, obviously, but we are everywhere in the world, and we have a great mission to protect our security and advance our interests and promote our values. We see that very clearly. So with some you can work on all three, and some you can work on two or one of the three, and we’re always looking for those moments. I also try to be sensitive to the historical, experiential, cultural, religious, social differences that exist that make life so intriguing on this planet we share. But there have been times when I have left a meeting or an encounter, and it’s been very difficult to smile for the cameras, as you say. But some of what you do you do because of the goal that you are trying to achieve. And you cannot get from point A to point B without working with leaders and regimes that you don’t have much in common with or, frankly, who you disagree rather significantly with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: When a foreign minister travels to a foreign country, they’re usually – they usually only get to meet their direct counterparts, the foreign minister of that country. When an American secretary of state travels, when you travel, you get to meet with presidents and kings. Why is that? What does it say about America? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think it says a lot about America and about our great reach and the relationships that we have. I also know many of these people from my prior incarnations, so I have personal relationships with them, which I have certainly called upon in this role. So I find it very helpful to meet with, as you say, kings, presidents, and prime ministers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: But they also open the doors to you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, they do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: They wouldn’t do that for the foreign minister of another country, for example. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I can’t speak to that, but I know that because of my prior relationships, which are often on a long-standing personal basis, they would see me under any circumstances. They saw me when I was a senator, they saw me when I was a First Lady, so they continue to see me in my current role, and then I do think that as Secretary of State of the United States, there is a lot of business to be done, and some of that business is not only in the foreign ministry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: What’s your favorite story from your time – (laughter) – as a secretary of state? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh, Kim. I have too many. I’ll probably save them for my next book if I ever get around to writing it, but there have been wonderful moments, and then there have been moments of high comedy and even some quite difficult times. But the few times when I really feel like we’re making a difference are the best times because for me it’s mostly about the work when I travel. I mean, I don’t try to think too much about what else is happening, and I haven’t had too many difficult experiences. So I’m not looking back on it and rolling my eyes or anything, but I think I’ll probably wait until I can really think that through. Certainly, the last time I was in South Africa, getting to see Nelson Mandela, which for me has always been important personally, was very gratifying because he’s an international treasure. But there’s too many stories to tell. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: And what was your biggest challenge or your worst moment? I mean, we’ve been on some very interesting trips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, you have. I think that first trip to Asia was maybe one of the most consequential because there was a feeling in Asia that the United States had abandoned its role as a Pacific power, and that’s why I decided to go, but we did not know what would await us. And I heard a lot from the leaders there about our economic crisis, the global recession, whether the United States was going to remain a player in the region. So that very first trip for me was a real baptism by fire, so to speak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: You were practically mobbed by adoring fans, and you were greeted like a rock star everywhere. Two and a half years into your job, do you think people still look at you as a rock star, a celebrity, or do they see you more as part of the Obama Administration? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: That’s a great question. I actually think it’s both. I mean, I was just walking through the mall here and had some young women come up and shout at me and tell me how much they appreciated me. And I think for young women and not so young women, there is a connection. They know that I’ve spent a lot of time working on women’s issues and they care about what I’m doing and what it might mean for them. So I still encounter that a lot. And so that’s kind of my independent role. But also as someone who ran against Barack Obama, and you’ve heard me say, ran very hard and didn’t make it, but then supported him and much to my amazement was asked to be Secretary of State. That is a very powerful story around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I started telling that story on that first trip to Asia, and I could see people just nodding, little light bulbs of thinking and recognition going off about, oh yeah, that did happen there, and we have politics where basically we try to kill each other. And so people do see me connected with the Obama Administration. I often encounter very positive personal responses in the town halls, the townterviews kind of programs that we do, and then an interviewer or an audience member will mention President Obama’s name and people will break into applause. So I think there’s still a very good feeling about what the President and what this Administration are trying to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Do you ever wake up in the morning think, oh, I’m too tired to go to work today? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don’t. I wake up and say I’m tired so I better get up and get going. But no, every day is fascinating to me because I really don’t know what’s going to happen during the day. I am very aware of how much energy this takes because, clearly, it’s a nonstop marathon. But let me knock on wood here, I have been lucky with health, stamina, and all that goes with it. So no, I won’t lie to you. I’m tired. My friends call and email saying, “Oh, my gosh, I saw you on television. You looked so tired.” (Laughter.) Which I send back saying, “Gee, thanks a lot.” But I know, because if you work around the clock like we do, that’s just inevitable. So I do try to take some time, long weekends, take some deep breathing. I do exercise, yoga, those kinds of things. But no, I’m never tired about the work. It’s just the physical challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: You have an incredible amount of people you know around the world. You must have the biggest Rolodex in town. (Laughter.) How many contacts do you have in your Blackberry that you can just call up like that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, thousands. Really, thousands. And it’s the right kind of contacts, because they are people who have some connection with me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Somebody’s calling you right now. (Laughter.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Somebody’s calling me right now, so if somebody else will, I hope, answer it and see what they want. But that – you timed that question. Is that one of your colleagues calling and saying, “Oh, my goodness”? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m lucky. I know a lot of people. Now, they’re not close friends, but I have become friends with a number of the leaders with whom I do work. And I have found over this 20 years of high-wire American and international activity, people do not end up in the positions they hold by accident. There is a reason. Even in authoritarian, dictatorial systems, there is something that has set them apart. And it’s always fascinating for me to figure it out. Because from afar, you can say how did that person end up as prime minister, president, whatever? But then you work with them and you – and there’s an intelligence there, there’s a savvyness, there’s a sense of survival. It’s really, for me, not just diplomatic. It’s political, psychological. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I remember very well when – on my first trip to Africa and I went to Kenya, and it was shortly after they’d had this terrible violence after their prior election, and I delivered a really tough message. And they were taken aback by it, but I felt strongly that here was a country that had so much going for it. And we slowly saw some changes. I had very open, honest conversations with some of the leaders there. The President followed up because, of course, his deep interest in Kenya, with his father. And then two years later, we were at a democracy conference in Poland, and Kenya had been invited. They had taken some rather significant steps, including reforming their constitution. And the spokesman who came from the government started off by saying to me – I was in the audience – that you came and you really spoke very truthfully to us, and we have tried very hard to change. And that’s worth it to me. That’s worth all the travel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have no illusions about how hard this is to create strong democracies, to build free market economies, to stand against a culture of corruption, and all of the things that I talk about endlessly. But when I see progress being made against the odds, I say okay, this is really worth it, because we’ve been at independence for 235 years this year. We’ve had our own ups and downs and our own difficulties, including a civil war and so much else. But it’s the intention and it’s the direction. And when I see positive intentions matched with a commitment to a path that could lead in a positive direction, I just am going to stand up and say hooray, and the United States will be with you, we’ll support you, we’ll do everything we can to help you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: You are still very popular, both in the United States and abroad. In fact, I think you’re skyrocketing in polls. But some of your critics say that they can’t quite put their finger on what it is that you are trying to achieve as a Secretary of State. What is the issue that you are trying to get your hands on and bring to fruition? Is it Middle East peace? Is it Afghanistan? Is it Pakistan? What is – what do you want to be remembered for as Secretary of State? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: I don’t see it that way, especially at this time. I think there are so many converging challenges that are interconnected in ways that we could not have imagined 25, 50 years ago, that what we’re trying to do is restore America’s leadership in the world, because I fervently believe American leadership is essential for the promotion of human rights and dignity, freedom, economic opportunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I am well aware that for the years prior to this Administration, there were a lot of questions about what we were doing. And of course, there are those who say, well, history will look back and see Iraq as a great success, and I hope that’s the case. But I think much of what we did was because we were attacked on 9/11, and I think we made fiscal and budgetary decisions that undermined America’s strength at home and abroad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what we’re trying to do, and what I am personally am committed to doing, is moving on a very steady path toward restoring America’s influence and leadership. That’s why going to Asia was important. That’s why continuing to pay attention to Latin America and Africa, working with regional institutions that can espouse the same values that we think are the best way to live and for societies to flourish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, when I took this job, people said, well, you can either try to do that or you can pick one or two or three things. I don’t think this is a time to pick one or two or three things. And I’m well aware of – others might well choose a different perspective, but that’s how I see what I’m doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: Do you think you are on the right track in terms of restoring American leadership? Some people argue that, in the Middle East, America is becoming irrelevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: I just don’t believe that for a minute. I think that it’s nothing we can take for granted. We can’t be complacent and we certainly can’t walk away. I have fought hard within the Administration for a significant economic program for both Egypt and Tunisia, because I think that the revolution of expectations in both countries was as much economic as political, because it wasn’t only the freedom to vote or the freedom to speak, but the freedom to work and to increase your standard of living and to see your life improve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I think that we are still looked to, sometimes begrudgingly and critically, but there is no doubt in my mind that people still care very much what the United States says and does. And what I worry about is the contrary, that it’s not what people around the world think about our role, but at home people who rightly are concerned about our own domestic economic situation, our own federal budget deficit, who are saying enough with the foreign involvements; let’s just do nothing but stay right here and tend to our own garden. That would be, in my view, a great mistake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So part of what I’m trying to do is speak and work on behalf of America’s influence and leadership in a way that my own country understands, so that people who are unemployed auto workers in Michigan or struggling small businesspeople in California can say, “Yeah, I really want the President, the government, to pay attention to me, but I get it. I know why we’re working to make sure Egypt and Tunisia turn out well. I know why we still put money into developing agriculture and fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa, and all the other things that we are working on.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: And a final question, to wrap up on a lighter note. Tell us something about yourself that BBC listeners don’t know. (Laughter.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I sometimes think I’m the best-known unknown person. I’m always amazed when people – and sometimes interviewers but sometimes just citizens around the world – will say something to me about me that I think, well, no, I didn’t do that or I didn’t say that or I don’t like that. So I’m always amused by that. But there’s – look, I don’t think anybody in the public eye can ever be totally known. That’s a misnomer, even though people are constantly in the press and therefore, you think you know them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But I think that I am a pretty normal, average person, despite all of the hype. And I am very interested in spending time with my friends and my family and not being on the merry-go-round all the time, which is one of the reasons why I have decided that I will move on and return to private life at the end of what will be a very intense period of activity and work in the next 18 months. But I just – I believe what I say and I work to try to see life improve, particularly for women and girls, and I love what I’m doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR QUESTION: I think one thing that people don’t know about you is that you have a great sense of humor. (Laughter.) You (inaudible) I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, you’ve got to have a little bit of fun doing these kinds of jobs, Kim, as you know. And thank you for all of your good work.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMore than 50 women have made allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the number continues to grow each day. Among the Hollywood mogul’s accusers are household names who were still looking to establish themselves when the alleged offences took place. Below are some of the allegations made public so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Harvey Weinstein tells us about the liberal world | Thomas Frank Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Italian actor Asia Argento alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was 21. She told the New Yorker she had been invited to what she thought was a party in his Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc room near Cannes, but found herself alone with him. He changed into a bathrobe and asked her to give him a massage. She said she had reluctantly agreed, but that he pulled her skirt up and forcibly performed oral sex on her. She said she felt guilty about what she described as a “horrible trauma” and for not fighting him off. She later went on to have consensual sexual relations with him, which she described to the magazine as one-sided and onanistic, because she believed he would ruin her career if she didn’t comply. “After the rape, he won,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British actor Lysette Anthony says she was raped by Weinstein in her London home in the late 1980s. Anthony, who currently appears in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks, has given an interview to the Sunday Times describing an attack that left her feeling “disgusted and embarrassed”. She first met the producer in 1982 after being cast in the film Krull. It was a number of years later, Anthony alleges, that Weinstein rang her doorbell. “He pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack in my tiny hall and started fumbling at my gown. He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. It was disgusting.” Unable to push him away, she continues. “Finally I gave up. At least I was able to stop him kissing me.” Anthony has reported the rape allegation to the police who are investigating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lucia Evans, then Stoller, was an aspiring actor when Weinstein approached her at the Cipriani Upstairs club in New York in 2004, she told the New Yorker. He arranged a meeting at the Miramax office, where she found herself alone with him. “He forced me to perform oral sex on him,” she said. “He’s a big guy, he overpowered me.” She told the magazine she blamed herself for not fighting harder and that she was still haunted by it.

Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gwyneth Paltrow was 22 and had been hired for the lead in the Jane Austen adaptation Emma. She told the New York Times she had been summoned to Weinstein’s hotel suite, where he suggested she give him a massage. She said she refused and felt petrified. She confided in her then boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein. Soon after, the producer warned her not to tell anyone else. “I was expected to keep the secret,” she told the newspaper. “I thought he was going to fire me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the release of Playing by Heart in the late 1990s, Angelina Jolie found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein, she told the NYT. He made unwanted advances which she rejected. “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again, and warn others when they did,” she told the paper.

He changed into a bathrobe and “forced himself on me sexually”, the New Yorker reported. She felt “horror, disbelief and shame” and considered going to the police, but then thought about how much she could lose and decided “just to move forward”. She continued to have a professional relationship with him after the alleged rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein’s films, found herself in his hotel room at the Toronto international film festival in 1995. “He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,” the Mighty Aphrodite star told the New Yorker. She said she had managed to leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clockwise from top left: Rosanna Arquette, Mira Sorvino, Zoe Brock and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Composite: Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosanna Arquette, who starred in Pulp Fiction, told the New Yorker she had been supposed to meet Weinstein for dinner at a Beverly Hills hotel to pick up a script, but on arrival was told to go to his suite. He answered the door wearing a white bathrobe and saying he needed a massage. She said he grabbed her hand and pulled it towards his penis which was “visible and erect … My heart was really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight mode”. She said she told him: “I will never do that”, and that he responded by telling her she was making a huge mistake. She claims her career later suffered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, a Filipina-Italian model, was 22 when she was invited to Weinstein’s office in the Tribeca neighbourhood of New York. He lunged at her, groping her breasts and attempting to put a hand up her skirt while she protested. She went straight to the police. The New Yorker published an audio tape recorded when she was equipped with a NYPD wire tap. In the recording, Weinstein begs her to join him in his hotel room. She refuses and asks him why he had groped her breast the day before. “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please,” he says. “You are used to that?” Gutierrez asks. “Yes,” Weinstein replies, later adding: “I won’t do it again”. He also says: “Don’t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moguls and starlets: 100 years of Hollywood’s corrosive, systemic sexism Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zoe Brock, a model and writer from New Zealand, then 23, accepted an invitation to Weinstein’s hotel suite at Cannes believing others would be present. When others left she found herself “alone in a remote hotel suite with Harvey fucking Weinstein,” she blogged. She alleges he took his clothes off and asked for a massage, forcing her to run to the bathroom to escape. “Harvey chased me, dick, balls and all, and banged on the door with his fists, pleading with me to come out”. She agreed to come out once he was fully dressed and then left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film Swingers, told the NYT she was 23 when Weinstein invited her to a screening which turned out to be a solo trip with him to a cinema. Afterwards, he asked if they go to his apartment to pick something up, where he went to the bathroom, came back in a robe and asked her to massage him. She said he told her “everybody does it”, but she refused. He left the room and returned nude. “He literally chased me. He wouldn’t let me pass him to get to the door,” she told the paper. Then he implored her to at least show him her breasts, but she refused.

When she arrived, he was nude in the bath, she alleged in the NYT. He told her she would have a much better audition if she was comfortable “getting naked in front of him” as she might have to play a topless scene. She left, apologising, telling him she was too prudish to go along with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Secret Actress: I've lost count of the unwanted hands that have touched me Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ashley Judd, a US actor who has starred in a string of box-office hits, was 20 when Weinstein invited her to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what she thought was a breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower, she told the NYT. She said her thoughts were: “How do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emma de Caunes, a French actor, met Weinstein at a Cannes party in 2010. She told The New Yorker he had invited her to a lunch meeting at the Ritz in Paris. In the hotel room he disappeared into the bathroom, leaving the door open. “I was like, what the fuck, is he taking a shower?” she said. He came out naked with an erection and demanded she lie on the bed, she said. He told her that many other women had done so before her, but she left and slammed the door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romola Garai, a British actor who starred in Atonement and the BBC series The Hour, was 18 when Weinstein auditioned her wearing only a bathrobe at the Savoy hotel, leaving her feeling “violated”. She told the Guardian she “just tried to make out it was normal because as far as I was concerned it was a job interview. I knew something had happened to me that I didn’t like and that I felt belittled by it. But I didn’t feel like I had the right to complain”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clockwise from top left: Ashley Judd, Lauren Sivan, Dawn Dunning and Liza Campbell Composite: Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dawn Dunning was 24, attending design school and waitressing in New York when she met Weinstein. The aspiring actor was invited to a meal with him at a Manhattan hotel, but on arrival was told to go to his suite because he was running late at a meeting. She told the NYT she found him alone in a bathrobe behind a coffee table covered in papers he said were contracts for his next three films. She alleged he told her she could only sign them on the condition she had three-way sex with him. She laughed and he grew angry, she said, telling her: “You’ll never make it in this business. This is how the business works.” She fled, left acting and became a costume designer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actor Rose McGowan reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein following a hotel room encounter during the Sundance film festival. She had recently had a memorable role in the slasher movie Scream which came out in 1996. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lauren Sivan, a former Fox News host, has alleged Weinstein trapped her in a closed restaurant and masturbated in front of her in 2007 after attempting to kiss her.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The French actor Léa Seydoux, who was awarded the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival for Blue is the Warmest Colour, told the Guardian that Weinstein lunged at her and tried to kiss her on the lips in 2012 after a Paris fashion show they were both attending. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British actor Claire Forlani posted an account of her experience on Twitter, recalling two meetings at a hotel where “I ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes, massage was suggested.” Weinstein also spoke about all the actresses he had slept with and what he had done for them, Forlani said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Canadian actor Erika Rosenbaum alleged that Weinstein masturbated behind her while holding her neck. In an interview with CBC she said the producer made aggressive sexual advances during three separate meetings around 15 years ago. The masturbation incident took place in a hotel room during the Toronto film festival, she said. “He grabs me by – he holds me by the back of the neck and faces me to the mirror and very quietly tells me that he just wants to look at me and he starts to masturbate standing behind me.” She continued: “He really took something from me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The screenwriter and actor Louisette Geiss told a press conference that Weinstein masturbated in front of her while she was making a pitch. She was in his office, adjacent to his hotel room, during the Sundance film festival in 2008. Weinstein excused himself to go the bathroom. He returned in an open robe before getting in the bath. “When I finished my pitch I was obviously nervous, and he just kept asking me to watch him masturbate. I told him I was leaving. He quickly got out of the tub and grabbed my forearm as I was trying to grab my purse and led me to his bathroom, pleading that I just watch him masturbate. My heart was racing and I was very scared.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clockwise from top left: Léa Seydoux, Claire Forlani, Louisette Geiss and Cara Delevingne Composite: Getty/Rex Shutterstock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British actor Cara Delevingne alleged she was sexually harassed by Weinstein early in her career, detailing how he encouraged her to kiss another woman in his hotel room. After she refused and tried to leave, Delevingne said: “He stood in front of [the door] and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sophie Dix, an English actor who was on the brink of a career in the British film industry in the 1990s, told the Guardian her trajectory was “massively cut down” after an alleged attack by Weinstein in a London hotel. Dix, who was 22 at the time, described the alleged assault as “the single most damaging thing that’s happened in my life”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eva Green, who starred in the James Bond film Casino Royale, has said she felt “shocked and disgusted” by a meeting with Weinstein, where she “had to push him off”. The French actor responded to comments made by her mother about the Hollywood mogul. She told the Telegraph: “I met him for a business meeting in Paris at which he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off. I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clockwise from top left: Sophie Dix, Eva Green, Myleene Klass and Heather Graham Composite: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian/Rex/Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British singer and model Myleene Klass told the Sun that when she was 32 the Hollywood producer offered her a “sex contract” at a film festival lunch at Cannes in 2010 while working for CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The American actor Heather Graham wrote in Variety that Weinstein implied she had to have sex with him in order to get a movie role. She said he had offered her the chance of choosing a script. “Later in the conversation, he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy.” She was never hired for one of Weinstein’s films. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lupita Nyong’o, the Oscar-winning star of 12 Years A Slave, published a personal essay about her alleged harassment in the New York Times. She detailed several encounters with Weinstein in which the producer allegedly offered to help her career in exchange for sex. Nyong’o said she first encountered Weinstein while she was a student attending the Berlin film festival. Shortly afterwards, she was invited to a screening at his home in Westport, Connecticut, where Weinstein asked if he could give her a massage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she tried to sidestep the request by offering to give him one instead, Nyong’o said Weinstein told her “he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that.” At a later dinner in New York, Nyong’o said Weinstein propositioned her again and continued to pursue her afterwards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Game of Thrones star Lena Headey said Weinstein spoke to her inappropriately at the Venice film festival and reacted angrily when she resisted his advances in a Los Angeles hotel.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra has accused Weinstein of rape and sexual harassment in 1992. She told the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow the assault happened after she had filmed The Night We Never Met, which Weinstein produced.

He did not use a condom.” She was “completely grossed out” and lay still “like a dead person”, she claimed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant for a TV show made by the Weinstein Company, accused the producer of rape by forcibly performing oral sex on her without her consent in 2006. She told a New York press conference she had met him several times to try to maintain a good business relationship, but when she visited him at his house, he forced himself on her. “I told him no, no, no, but he insisted,” she claimed, saying Weinstein pinned her to a bed and removed a tampon. “I was mortified. I was in disbelief and disgusted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actor and model Dominique Huett filed a £3.8m civil suit with Los Angeles superior court alleging the Weinstein Company “aided and abetted” Weinstein in “repeated acts of sexual misconduct”. According to documents uploaded by Variety, the lawsuit alleges Weinstein asked Huett to his Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 under the pretence of discussing her career. Once there he asked if she would give him a massage, before suggesting he perform oral sex on her. Huett said she refused, but claims Weinstein “would not take no for an answer”. After performing oral sex on Huett, Weinstein masturbated in front of her, the suit claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brit Marling, the actor and co-creator of the Netflix drama OA, has accused Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room and suggesting they take a shower together.

When she told him she had a partner whom she loved, she claims Weinstein told her he only wanted her to be his mistress for a few days a year. “Basically he said that if I wanted to make it in America, it would be through him,” she alleged. “I told him I had to go, and left.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Canadian actor Lauren Holly claimed in an interview with Canadian TV that the producer had showered and used the toilet in front of her after inviting her to his hotel room in the late 1990s.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zelda Perkins, the British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein, claimed she was paid £125,000 to keep quiet after accusing him of sexual harassment. She told the Financial Times she signed a non-disclosure agreement in 1998 after making the accusation. She claimed he asked her to give him massages and that he tried to pull her into bed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weinstein has denied many of these allegations. His spokeswoman has said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein.

While I am sickened and angered over the disturbing accusations of Weinstein's sexual predation and abuse of power, I'm happy - ecstatic even - that it has opened up a dialogue around the continued sexual harassment, objectification and degradation of women. To the women who have suffered any form of abuse of power, I stand beside you. To the women who have come forward against a system that is designed to keep you silent, I stand in awe of you and appreciate you and your fortitude. It is not easy to disclose such experiences, especially in the public eye. Your strength will inspire others. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for fighting this battle so hopefully my daughter won't have to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I've been an actor for a long time. So long, that when I started, we were called 'actresses' - a feminized, watered down name for the same profession our male colleagues have dominated. Somewhere in the early 2000's it became politically incorrect to call us actresses, and with good reason. After all, there's no feminized moniker for a director or producer or a writer or doctor or a lawyer. So 'actresses' became 'actors'. But sexual harassment and sexism in the industry did not change with the title change. We were still clearly 'actresses' to anyone that saw gender before talent and intelligence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I can tell you what it meant to be an 'actress' then and what it means to be an 'actor' (with breasts) now. BUT more importantly, I can tell you what it means to be a woman in our society. In any - and every - profession, women are continuously mistreated. This is not an uncommon occurrence. This is a sick culture. Men like Harvey Weinstein are around every corner. Men who undermine women and their strength, ability and intelligence exist everywhere. Statistics say that 1 in 3 women are sexually harassed in the workplace. Really think about that. Really allow that statistic to become a part of you. Also, while you process it, think about the gender inequality women - particularly women of color - face in salary and opportunity. Actually, fuck the statistics, just do better, world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even with these strong feelings - not just about Weinstein but about workplace sexism in general - this statement is complicated for me for personal reasons. Harvey has a wife, who I have had the privilege of working with for the last 5 years on Project Runway All Stars. Georgina Chapman is my friend. She is one of the most special humans I have ever met. Harvey and Georgina also have two very young children who my children have known their entire lives. It is because of my love for Georgina, India and Dashiell that I haven't publicly commented on this until now. Please don't confuse my silence for anything other than respect for a dear friend and her beautiful children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And please know that I fight for women's rights every day. I am constantly part of this conversation even if I don't publicly comment on specific scandals. Sexual harassment and assault in the workplace are not just about Harvey Weinstein. We must change things in general. We must do better for women everywhere.\n", "answers": ["As new accusations continue to emerge in the Harvey Weinstein scandal, a celebrity-driven hashtag has started a wave of people who are sharing their personal experiences with sexual abuse and harassment, Mashable reports. On Sunday afternoon, Alyssa Milano tweeted: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" This quickly led to the #MeToo hashtag and a tsunami of posts that simply read \"Me too\" on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as detailed stories from those who felt comfortable sharing more—all messages the Washington Post notes \"were striking in their simplicity, and in the sheer number of them.\" Included among the \"tens of thousands\" the New York Times says reacted to Milano's message were other names from show biz, including Debra Messing, Anna Paquin, and Javier Munoz, from Broadway's Hamilton. \"I don't know if [it] means anything coming from a gay man but it's happened.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSurface was the single biggest genuine tech surprise of the year so far. Microsoft tantalized us with a tablet that made the iPad look stale. Its snap-on keyboard made all laptops look immediately old fashioned. And it promised The Future of Computers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We hadn't looked forward to something this much in a long, long time. Now it's here. And it's been just as long a time since a gadget has been so disappointing. Surface is good, but Surface RT sure isn't the future. Not yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why it matters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The laptop is about as far advanced as one can imagine. The MacBook Air and a horde of ultrabook clones are hitting a brick wall in terms of form and physics. The tablet, likewise, isn't exactly pushing civilization forward; it's still fundamentally a luxury device, a delightful toy for reading email on the couch or watching Netflix on an airplane. Nobody needs a tablet. It's a lovely, superfluous thing. But everyone needs a computer, unless you're planning on living by a lake and trading furs for a living. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft's pearly promise for Surface was to pioneer a strange new kind of gadget: all the grace and leisure of a tablet, combined with the ability to actually make stuff that a computer brings. Convenience with input. Type, edit, change. Work. Power! Microsoft claims outright that Surface will bring together the best of everything that exists—the elusive union of laptop and tablet. Or at the very least, with Surface RT, a tablet that you could actually use as your primary computer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men who built the Surface from a pile of cardboard prototypes into the thing I've been using for the past week stood in front of me at their headquarters and said exactly that. Microsoft is trumpeting a historical change here. And it has a recent track record of building exceptional things. Sure, there's a Surface Pro version coming up that'll have full, powerful laptop guts, and run the same software any PC can—Microsoft's best shot at being your only computer, forever. But even this RT variant is supposed to give us some overdue synthesis. Plop it down on your desk and get things done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether Microsoft can keep this promise matters more than anything else in technology this year. Surface could be the blueprint for the machine you'll be typing on well into the next decade. No pressure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using it NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface is Microsoft's attempt to out-Apple Apple. The thing is designed to hell and back, and most of the time it shows. This means a lot of attention to detail—attention that sounds silly until you actually hear it—like the kickstand with an extra, custom-designed hinge to guarantee a satisfying chkkk every time it's snapped shut. Is that superficial? Only if you consider something you're going to potentially hear and touch multiple times every single day superficial. Otherwise, it's just damn thoughtful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And most of the time, Surface is a thoughtful computer. It's a beautiful computer, in your hand or on a tabletop, its shifting angles clean and secure like a Danish prison. It's a little too heavy—slightly heftier than the iPad 3—but otherwise comfortable to hold, with an angled bezel that melts into your hand. There's a convenient USB port that, unlike other tablets, doesn't look like a gaping open sore on the delicately chamfered side. The screen doesn't hold up against the crispness of the iPad's retina resolution, but still manages a lovely colorful pop to suit the colorful, poppy Windows 8. All over the Surface, these little details reflect the meeting of large brains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But more importantly, Surface is handsome. That ineffable Hey, this thing feels good quality is lacquered all over Surface. You'll appreciate it every time you pick it up and turn it on. It's a simple, joyful experience. Open the Touch Cover keyboard/trackpad hybrid, snap out the kickstand, and lay the thing on your desk like a laptop. Start writing an essay. Flip the cover all the way around, hide the keyboard, and give yourself something substantial to grip like a tablet. Start swiping the web. Or prop the kickstand against the folded-back cover to create a stable base while you watch Netflix on a coffee table. Switching configurations is a cinch, and it's entirely intuitive. The Touch Cover feels as integral to the Surface as the binding of a book to the sandwiched pages. There's every reason to believe most computers will look and feel something like this, someday soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Surface is instantly more charming than any Windows device that's come before it. It's nearly the perfect size, and the form is almost beyond reproach. If you want a tablet, use it like a tablet. If you want a laptop, use it like a laptop. Both modes seem right, like a genuine seachange step forward. The Next Kind of Computer can be slipped in a bag, power up a bright display nearly instantly, run an operating system that loves being touched, and equally importantly, have a keyboard you can use to actually get work done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tablets aren't for work. That's the old refrain. But if they're going to be more than great toys someday, tablets have to become every bit as viable as a desktop tower as a way to write (and edit) long emails, presentations, and poems. Surface RT is the first evidence we have that this is possible, because you'll use it like you've never used any computer before. Your brain starts to rewire itself, and it's delightful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flip out the keyboard. Hit power. Swipe up to unlock. Type in your password. A dozen super-colorful tiles give you a snappy report of what's new: Who's tweeted at you, what's arrived in your inbox, news headlines, photos of your beautiful face, and incoming Facebook IMs, as they drop. You'll touch one thing, scroll to the next, swipe another, then begin typing, merging habits you've picked up since your parents first let you set hands on something that ran off batteries. Surface presents you the Internet all at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Browsing in Internet Explorer is just as easy a flopping into a couch-cushion Netflix marathon, or working in the full Microsoft Office suite. It all feels seamless, natural, a culmination of useful things. This ease, the effortless transfer between watching stuff and making stuff, reading and writing, listening and talking, it permeates Surface with the mark of The New Computer. This is what netbooks were supposed to be, before we realized they were all completely horrible: small, powerful, flexible, skinny computers that can do a ton of things easily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can thank Windows 8's radicalism for that. Traditional Windows would be absolute hell to use on this—or hey, so would OS X. But Metro is the best foundation for The Next Computer I can imagine, and if you can get over UI squeamishness, you'll love it. It'll make you more powerful the more you rub your hands on it. It is that good. Or at least it could be, at some point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No Like NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We're not there yet. Surface is a fantastic promise, and holds fantastic potential. But while potential is worth your attention, it's not worth your paycheck. Surface RT gets so many things right, and pulls so many good things together into one package. But it is undercooked. For all Microsoft's claims to hardware perfection and software revolution, Surface RT is undone by too many little annoyances, cracks, and flaws. After the initial delight of an evolved tablet wears off, you'll groan—because Surface brings the appearance of unity, but it's really just the worst of both worlds. Instead of trading in your laptop and tablet for Surface, a cocktail of compromises that fracture the whole endeavor, you'll miss them both urgently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Want to use Surface RT as a laptop? Sorry, the Touch Cover is a letdown. It's a phenomenal engineering effort, and the most terrifically-integrated mobile keyboard ever. It doesn't compare to the junky Bluetooth options you can slap against your iPad. Microsoft's keyboard cover is perfectly integrated with the device, and touch typing on it is actually possible. You can't say the same for the iPad's glass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it only approximates a real keyboard—the buttons are pressure activated, barely buttons at all, and spaced in such a way that typos are inevitable and constant. Unlike the first time you pinched an iPhone or gazed at E-ink, there's zero that's instantly intuitive about the Touch Cover. And in order for this to be a brave new computer, Touch Cover had to be instantly intuitive, an immediately responsive thing to touch and work with. But rather than feeling like you've instantly grown an extra brain lobe just by using it, Surface's mega-hyped keyboard cover feels like it requires one. You'll feel clumsy. You'll write slowly. I tried writing this review on the Surface, but I would've missed my deadline by a week. You'll get better—it will probably take weeks to hit a stride—but this thing was supposed to be a breakthrough. A perfect interface. Instead, it's just a half-broken death march up the learning curve. The trackpad, sludge-like and jerky, is even worse—particularly galling compared to the super-smooth touchscreen—and unlike the keyboard, will never get better with practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Touch Cover also approximates, dismally, the sturdiness of a laptop: thanks to the cloth-like floppiness of the thing that's necessary for making it easy to open and close, it can't support itself on anything but a flat, rigid (apologies) surface. You can't type on your lap, like laptop. It's hard to imagine what a design solution out of this would have been, but that's Microsoft's job, not ours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps most galling is the Touch Cover's $100 addition to the Surface's already pricy $400 base MSRP—akin to selling your windshield wipers separate from the car. Microsoft also offers a Type Cover, that promises actual physical keys instead of the flattened solution, but that will add critical bulk to your Surface experience—along with an extra $130. Another letdown—and a pretty outrageous one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it's Windows on Surface RT that's the greatest letdown of all, the lethal letdown, because it's not Windows 8, but Windows RT. You can't tell the difference by looking at them, but you certainly will once you use it. Windows RT is underpowered (everything opens and syncs slightly too slowly), under-functional (you cannot install a single app that's not available through the Windows RT app store, which offers a paltry selection), and under-planned (the built-in apps can't feel like Lite versions of something better). You'd be right to note that many of those limitations apply to the iPad as well, but no one could mistake iOS for OS X the way RT apes Windows 8. And even if it's a plight common to tablets, Microsoft—for better or worse—has hyped Surface RT as being so much more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the end though, this is nothing more than Microsoft's tablet. And a buggy, at times broken one, at that, whose \"ecosystem\" feels more like a tundra. There's no Twitter or Facebook app, and the most popular 3rd party client breaks often. The Kindle app is completely unusable. There's no image editing software. A People app is supposed to give you all the social media access you'd ever need, but It's impossible to write on someone's Facebook wall through the People app, Surface's social hub; the only workaround is to load Internet Explorer. Blech. Something as simple as loading a video requires a jumbled process of USB importing, dipping in and out of the stripped-down desktop mode, opening a Video app, importing, going back into the Video app, and then playing. What. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The app selection, overall, is worse than the already pathetic Windows Phone app fare, looking like the software equivalent to a barren Soviet grocery store. The difference is that Windows Phone, used in quick, informative bursts, skates by on the strength of its excellent with integrated features. At the moment, there's just not that much to do with Microsoft's über-tablet. Surface is weak because Windows RT is weak; a tepid tablet OS pretending to be a computer's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can do work, yes. But productivity is limited to a \"preview\" (beta) version of Microsoft Office. It also hurts that Office requires plunging into Windows RT's Desktop mode, where users of actual Windows 8 are able to install a decade's worth of legacy software. Normally, this would compensate. But RT users can't install any of this older software. None of it. Desktop mode is entirely worthless in RT, a cruel tease of non-functionality. It'll only remind you of how much you can't do with your Surface, and is going to confuse the living hell out of most people who buy one—especially when Surface Pro, built on x86 architecture and perfectly compatible with all of those legacy programs, steps in a few months from now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I pity Microsoft's retail staff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Should you buy it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. The Surface, with an obligatory Touch Cover, is $600. That's a lot of money. Especially given that it's no laptop replacement, no matter how it looks or what Microsoft says. It's a tablet-plus, priced right alongside the iPad and in most ways inferior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That could change. Maybe there will be a new Touch Cover that retains the original's terrific physical qualities while actually allowing good typing. Maybe the quasi-vaporware Surface Pro, which eschews Windows RT in favor of the real-deal Win 8, will make all the difference, opening itself up to the open seas of PC software (for several hundred dollars more). Maybe the app store will look different in a month, or a year, and have anything to offer. Maybe. But remember that Windows Phone—which has swelled from mere hundreds, to tens of thousands, to over a hundred thousand app offerings over the past two years—is still a wasteland compared to iOS and Android. Poor precedent. Maybe Windows RT will be different. Maybe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But those maybes aren't worth putting money on.

Instead, with its radically new, touch-centric interface, it was an attempt to reimagine the PC for the post-PC era. A wildly ambitious attempt — maybe even a visionary one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for all Microsoft's power and influence over the PC industry, it was in no place to reinvent the PC single-handedly. Sure, it could write a new operating system. It could also make suggestions to its hardware-manufacturing partners, But it couldn't, you know, try to build the PC of the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except that it did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June of this year, the company unveiled Surface , a pair of tablets it designed from scratch. (One, Surface with Windows RT, runs Windows RT, the version for devices based on ARM technology; the other, Surface with Windows 8 Pro, uses full-blown Windows 8 and isn't due until early next year.) They're iPad competitors, and that's important. But they're also PCs — the first ones that Microsoft has created on its own in its 37-year history. As such, they're the clearest possible expression of where the company thinks the PC should go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface for Windows RT goes on sale at Microsoft Stores and some temporary pop-up retail outlets, and at Microsoft.com , this Friday. It starts at $499 for a 32GB model: the same opening price as the current full-sized iPad, but with double the storage. Microsoft provided me with a unit for this review, and I've been using it for a little over a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you were excited by Surface based on its unveiling in June of this year , I think there's a good chance you'll be excited by the shipping product. And if the idea left you skeptical — well, you probably won't be won over by this initial incarnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that June Surface event — and then at a smaller press briefing at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters last week — company executives spent so much time lavishing praise on their own design choices and technical innovations that I wondered if they'd somehow convinced Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive to tutor them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out that much of the self-laudatory hoopla wasn't wildly off base. The Surface hardware is indeed a beautiful piece of work, one that's worthy of comparison to Apple's designs even though many of Microsoft's specific choices are distinctly un-Applelike. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its slate-colored magnesium case, manufactured using a process Microsoft calls VaporMg, is really, really nice. It's good-looking, it's sturdy and it helps keep the weight down — Surface is only slightly heavier than the iPad at 1.5 pounds, even though it has got a substantially roomier 10.6″ screen. Microsoft also says that the case is pretty much scratchproof, though you might want to be careful about tossing the tablet in a backpack: I noticed that the Windows logo on the backside of my review unit began scraping off almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface has a kickstand — a fold-out flap on the back, which, when used in conjunction with a keyboard cover I'll talk about in a bit, lets you use the tablet like an undersized laptop. The care that Microsoft poured into it shows: When it's closed it's flush with the rest of the case and when it's open it keeps the tablet perfectly stable. And the hinge has a luxe feel, reminiscent of the high-end car door Microsoft says was its inspiration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (I just said that you can use Surface like a laptop, but when I first saw it, I wondered if the kickstand would prevent you from using it in your lap at all. Not in my experience: I was able to balance it and the keyboard cover on my thigh without worrying too much about the whole contraption tipping over.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That 10.6″ screen has 1366 by 768 pixels; Microsoft used its ClearType technology to improve text display, and glued the touchscreen directly on the LCD, which makes for a thinner, less reflective display. At the Redmond press event, a Microsoft engineer argued that despite the lower resolution, the screen beats the iPad's 2048 by 1536 Retina display in some circumstances; he also said that people who are 45 and above generally can't tell a Retina screen from a lower-resolution one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My 48-year-old eyeballs have no trouble telling the difference between iPad Retina text and the Surface's ClearType — but overall, the Surface's screen is one of the best I've seen on a tablet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The screen, incidentally, is 16:9, an aspect ratio designed with Windows 8′s panoramic interface in mind. It lets you see more apps without panning, and is well suited to the feature that allows you to snap a widget-like version of one app on the side of the primary program you're using. Microsoft thinks Surface buyers will use the tablet mostly in landscape mode; it works in portrait orientation too, although the aspect ratio leaves it looking like a small-but-tall magazine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface has basic cameras on the front and back, as you'd expect from any $499 tablet. It also has a USB port and a MicroSDXC slot that lets you add extra storage, two features that add to its PC-like personality. Microsoft doesn't seem to be making a claim about battery life except to say that the tablet is designed for \"all day\" use, and in my time with it, it lived up to that vague claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One minor nit about the hardware: I found that I needed to wriggle the magnetic power connector into place in a way I don't with Apple's MagSafe connectors or even run-of-the-mill, nonmagnetic ones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So that's Surface's basic hardware — not flawless, but darn nifty overall. If it ran Android, people might well conclude that it was the best Android tablet on the market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But this tablet is defined by its operating system: Windows RT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the lack of an \"8″ in its moniker, RT has precisely the same user interface as Windows 8. It has the colorful Start screen with auto-updating Live Tiles, each leading to an app or service. It runs the same bundled Windows 8-interface apps: Internet Explorer, Bing, e-mail, a calendar, a news app and more. Everything's touch-friendly and fluid. It's not the Windows we've known, but it's a good start on an interface that might carry Microsoft through the next couple of decades of computing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Windows 8, RT has the Desktop, an area that's essentially Windows 7, except without the Start button. As with Windows 8, switching back and forth between new Windows 8-style apps and the Desktop can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you're teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Windows 8, the Desktop has a huge saving grace: It lets you use any old-school Windows program. Windows RT, however, can't run them. They were all written for computers based on x86 (Intel) technology, and are incompatible with Surface's ARM processor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So why is Desktop there at all? Mostly to run four Microsoft Office 2013 programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. All come bundled with Surface, and all are largely identical to their Windows 8 counterparts, despite being \"preview\" editions. (Surface buyers will get the final versions free.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyone who's ever struggled to get work done on a tablet with a stripped-down office suite in a Microsoft Office world will appreciate certain things about Surface's Office apps. They support the official Office file formats perfectly and have industrial-strength features such as Word's revision tracking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, I found them the least satisfying thing about Surface. They're the one part of this product Microsoft hasn't reimagined. Instead, it has just tweaked the apps slightly, giving them a Windows 8-type look in certain areas and rejiggering everything else to make it slightly easier to use with a fingertip rather than with a mouse. They work, but the whole experience feels like an exercise in compromise. (I have my fingers crossed that Microsoft has a real Windows 8-style version of Office in the works.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you plan to use Office much, you'll certainly want one of Microsoft's keyboard covers; the Touch Cover isn't included with the base $499 Surface, but a black model comes with the $599 version, and additional colors are available for $119.99 apiece. Snap one on, using the magnetic connector, and the Start screen automatically changes color to match — pretty stylish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Touch Cover is super-thin and clicks on and off in a jiffy. (I did find that I occasionally had to remove it and reclick to make it work.) The keyboard's on the inside and draws power from the connector; there's no need to futz with Bluetooth or worry about charging it. The nonkeyboard side has a fleecy surface that feels great in your hand, and the whole thing folds back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I first saw this cover in June, I kept an open mind about it. In fact, my mind was so open that I wondered if Microsoft had managed to produce a flat, one-piece keyboard that wouldn't leave many people pining for clacky mechanical keys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Actually, even at the June event, the company had tipped its hand: It also showed off the Type Cover, which is much like the Touch Cover except that it has discrete keys with real travel. If the Touch Cover had been a miracle, there wouldn't have been a need for the Type Cover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if your benchmark is on-screen keyboards rather than conventional physical ones, you might be tickled with the Touch Cover. The keys are surprisingly spacious and there's no need to fumble through multiple modes to get to digits and punctuation. More important, moving the keyboard off the screen frees up the full screen resolution for whatever app you're using — a plus in all scenarios, and close to a necessity with the Desktop Office apps, all of which work better when they don't have an on-screen keyboard in the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As with any unfamiliar input device, I got more comfortable with the Touch Cover as I used it. But if I were buying a Surface to use for anything other than extremely light productivity, I'd spring for the $129.99 Type Cover instead. It's also impressively thin, but comes infinitely closer to a notebook-like feel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the Touch Cover and the Type Cover sport a tiny touchpad. It's approximately the size of an unfolded matchbook, and I found it adequate in a pinch, but nowhere near as nice as a full-sized touchpad on a full-sized notebook. (With the Windows 8 experience, the bigger the touchpad, the better the experience.) With a cover on, I tended to do as much as possible from the keyboard, and simply touch the screen otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Office and a Desktop version of Internet Explorer as Surface for Windows RT's only major traditional-Windows apps, anyone who plunks down $499 or more for a Surface today will be largely dependent on Microsoft's Windows Store for software. That's the biggest gamble such buyers are making. Windows 8 is launching with 5,000 apps in the U.S. version of the Windows Store, most of which should be available for Windows RT; they include name-brand wares such as Evernote, Hulu, Netflix, Microsoft's own Skype, TuneIn, a bunch of games and more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the Windows RT apps I tried make smart use of the Windows 8-style interface. Compared to the 275,000 iPad-optimized apps in Apple's store, though, there simply isn't much there. If Surface's earliest adopters are pleased with their purchase a year from now, it'll be because the Windows Store's offerings got beefier fast; if they're nonplussed, it'll be because the selection remained too meager. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of which leads to one question: Who should consider buying a Surface with Windows RT? Not anyone who wants the most fully fleshed-out tablet experience right now — for that, the iPad still has no rival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface offers slick industrial design, an inventive interface, full-blown Office apps that haven't been truly optimized for tablets and two very clever keyboard options. If part or all of that proposition appeals to you — and you're optimistic about the Windows Store — this tablet is worth a look. For an audacious version 1.0 product, it's impressive. Now it's up to Microsoft to prove that it's serious enough about this PC business to forge ahead with Surface until it's impressive, period.\nPassage 3:\nIt has ports and jacks that iPad owners can only dream about: a memory-card slot to expand the storage, a video output jack and a USB 2.0 jack. You can connect almost any USB device: keyboard, mouse, flash drive, speakers, hard drive and so on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each Surface model has double the storage of the same-price iPad. For example, the $500 Surface offers 32 gigabytes; the 64-gig Surface is $600. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are some disappointments on the spec sheet. The battery life is advertised as eight to 10 hours, less than the iPad. There’s no cellular version; it’s Wi-Fi only. The screen is very sharp (1,366 by 768 pixels), but it doesn’t approach the iPad’s Retina screen clarity (2,048 by 1,536 pixels). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And you can charge the Surface only from its wall adapter — not from a computer’s USB jack. Microsoft’s reasoning is that you won’t have a computer to charge from, since your days of carrying both a tablet and a laptop are over. Besides, a wall outlet recharges far faster than USB can. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The front is all touch screen. The edges of the black magnesium body are angled and crisp, like a prop from a Batman movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then there’s the kickstand. The lower half of the back is a hinged panel, held shut magnetically until you pop it out with a fingernail. It snaps to a 22-degree angle, ready to prop the tablet sturdily upright. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A lesser kickstand would add weight, bulk or ugliness. But this one is razor-thin and disappears completely when you’re not using it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You do use it, though — especially when you flip open the optional keyboard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, keyboard. You know Apple’s magnetically hinged iPad cover? Microsoft’s Touch Cover is the same idea — same magnet hinge — except that on the inside, there are key shapes, and even a trackpad, formed from slightly raised, fuzzy material. Flip the cover open, flip out the kickstand and boom: you have what amounts to a 1.5-pound PC that sets up anywhere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is nothing like those Bluetooth keyboard cases for the iPad. First, the Touch Cover is much, much thinner, 0.13 inches, cardboard thin. Second, it’s not Bluetooth; there’s no setup and no battery hit. The magnet clicks, and keyboard is ready for typing. Third, when you want just a tablet, the keyboard flips around against the back. The Surface automatically disables its keys and displays the on-screen keyboard when it’s time to type. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can buy this cover, in a choice of colors, with the Surface for $100, or later for $120. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s an incredibly slick idea, but the keys don’t move. You’re pounding a flat surface. If you type too fast, the keyboard skips letters. (“If you type 80 words a minute on a keyboard and 20-30 on glass, you should be in the 50s on the Touch Cover,” says a Microsoft representative.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fortunately, Microsoft also offers the Type Cover ($130), with real keys that really travel. At 0.24 inches thick, it’s not as unnoticeable as the Touch Cover, but Microsoft says it’s the thinnest moving-keys keyboard on earth, and it types nicely.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This computer runs Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8, which Microsoft hopes will run on all PCs from now on. RT is wildly different from the old Windows. You’ll be thrilled or appalled, depending on your fondness for change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this Windows, the Start screen is a patchwork of colorful, interactive tiles. You tap one to open an app, swipe down on one to “right click” it, swipe across to reveal more pages of them. Each tile is also a tiny dashboard, showing your next appointment, latest Facebook post, today’s weather and so on. It’s fast, fluid and fun to use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swiping in from the edges of the screen summons useful hidden panels. Swipe in from the top or bottom to reveal your app’s menus; from the left to switch apps; from the right for important controls like Share and Settings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfortunately, Windows RT is not the full Windows. The Surface comes with preview 2013 versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint — workable, but sometimes sluggish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Otherwise, though, Windows RT can’t run any of the four million regular Windows programs. Or the 275,000 iPad apps. Or the 17 Android tablet apps. (That’s a joke! There are actually 19 Android tablet apps.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, it requires all new apps. They’re available exclusively from the online Windows App Store, and there aren’t many to choose from; for example, there’s no Facebook, Spotify, Angry Birds, Instagram, Draw Something or New York Times app. The total in the United States is about 3,500 apps so far; many are bare-bones or junky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some ways, the far more intriguing prospect is the Surface Pro tablet, which Microsoft says will be available in 90 days. It has a real Intel chip inside, and can run real Windows programs. That’s right: Photoshop, iTunes, Quicken and classic PC games on your tablet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pro will be heavier (two pounds), thicker (half an inch) and much more expensive (around $1,000). For those sacrifices, of course, you could buy an ultrathin laptop — but the Surface’s keyboard cover and touch screen make it far more flexible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But both Surface tablets, and indeed Windows 8 itself, suffer from an insanely confusing split personality. Beneath the colorful, edge-to-edge world of RT apps, the menus, icons, taskbar and overlapping windows of the traditional Windows desktop are still there. On the Surface, that old desktop pops bafflingly and unnecessarily into view whenever you use the Office programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (My complete review of Windows 8 will appear in The New York Times on Thursday.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s not all that’s wrong with Windows RT, either. There’s no speech recognition, let alone Siri; no app folders; no automated guidance in Maps. The Control Panel offers features like typing suggestions and autocorrect, but I couldn’t get them to work anywhere. Sometimes the on-screen keyboard doesn’t pop up when it’s supposed to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Little inconsistencies and bafflements are everywhere. Such as the way Word constantly informs me that “there is insufficient memory or disk space.” (Well, gee, Microsoft — whose fault is that?) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Look, here’s the thing. You’d have to be fairly coldblooded to keep your pulse down the first time you see the Surface: its beauty, its potential, its instant transformation from tablet to PC. How incredible that this bold, envelope-pushing design came from Microsoft, a company that for years produced only feeble imitations of other companies’ fresh ideas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And how ironic that what lets the Surface down is supposedly Microsoft’s specialty: software. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In time, maybe the Windows RT apps will come. Maybe the snags will get fixed. Maybe people will solve the superimposed puzzle of Windows RT and Windows 8. Until then, the Surface is a brilliantly conceived machine whose hardware will take your breath away — but whose software will take away your patience.\nPassage 4:\nNobody asked me about my Surface. I tried flashing it all over the place. But despite my best efforts, no one seemed curious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Victrola Coffee Roasters in Seattle, I sat in the front window, with a hot pink Touch Cover attached, intentionally conspicuous. Nobody mentioned it. At the airport, I broke it out at the large open-air counter of a crowded bar. I sat in a seat at the gate, facing the walkway, pounding away at its keys on my lap. On a Virgin America flight, crowded with techies, I sat up front and kept it on my tray table the entire time, swiping from app to app. On San Francisco’s Muni transit system, I tentatively typed in my seat, afraid it may be snatched on the crowded train. But no one said a word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only person to comment on it was a TSA agent at the Seattle airport, who told me I didn’t need to take my iPad out of my bag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s too bad. Although nobody asked, Microsoft’s new tablet is an altogether curious device. It’s something completely new and different. It is, in some ways, better than an iPad. In some ways, worse. It’s brilliant, and yet it can be puzzling as well. Confoundingly so at times. It’s a tablet of both compromises and confusion. It is a true hybrid — neither fully a desktop nor mobile device. That’s reflected in all sorts of ways. It is Wi-Fi only, but won’t run traditional Windows applications. It has a full-featured keyboard and runs Microsoft Office — but it’s certainly meant to be touched and swiped and tapped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s different. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let’s at least get this out of the way: This is one of the most exciting pieces of hardware I’ve ever used. It is extremely well-designed; meticulous even. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The backside kickstand can serve as a metaphor for the entire device. Close it, and it sits flush with the back of the tablet. It’s so tightly integrated, if you didn’t know it was there, you’d think it was just a seam for the battery compartment. It has three hinges — one of which is just to give it a satisfying sound when opening or closing. (Snap!) It’s designed to be like a car door. It’s designed to make you use it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And it’s quite sturdy, to boot. In Microsoft’s lab, we saw Surfaces that had been opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times. They still snapped open and shut like they were new. We wanted to see how easy it was to break one. It’s very possible, but you have to really try. We did manage to break off the kickstand by gradually leaning onto it, but I had to put nearly my full weight onto the tablet before the kickstand snapped off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People will break the hinge, but I don’t think as often or predictably as, say, the glass rear panel of an iPhone 4 or 4S. One other nitpick? The kickstand has a small fingerhold to make it easy to open. But this is on the left-hand side of the device. Most people are right-handed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then there is the 3-millimeter-thin Touch Cover keyboard. Ever since Microsoft first unveiled the Surface, this has been a big question mark. Does it really snap on and off so easily? Is it usable? Does it even work? Yes. To everything. It’s actually quite fantastic. On this miniature keyboard, that has no actual physical keys, keystrokes fire as fast as you can type them. There is no lag. There is, however, a learning curve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I struggled mightily with typos and finger placement for the first 24 hours. My left wrist hurt like hell. The pinkie and ring finger on my left hand were cramped. But by day three, my hands began to relax and I was typing quickly and, for the most part, accurately. After a week, I powered along at 90 words per minute. It’s not the same speed I hit on a full size keyboard, and I still have typos galore (though far fewer) but given how much I’ve improved in a week, it’s impressive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oddly, it is perhaps less effective as a cover than a keyboard. It folds over nicely, but doesn’t stay closed as well as I’d like. Several times, I opened my bag to a glow, like something out of Pulp Fiction, to find the Surface had lit up as the Touch Cover came open inside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Type Cover ($130, sold separately), which has actual keys, performs even more poorly as a cover, but it’s a spectacular keyboard. I could hammer away on it at approximately normal speed from the get-go, and made fewer typos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One issue I did have with the Type Cover was the accidental pressing of a key. Apparently, at some point I pressed the Shift key for eight seconds, which launched a Filter Keys setting — an accessibility feature meant for users with palsy and other disabilities that may cause them to inadvertently press keys. From that moment on, the keyboard basically did not work. And because Windows 8 and Windows RT are so cloud-connected, this setting propagated itself across all my other Windows devices. It was an easy fix, and Microsoft says a software update that prevents this from happening is on the way. But I thought it spoke to how easy it can be to inadvertently do bad things with the Type Cover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 720p HD cameras — front and rear — are junk. There’s no other way to put it. The camera has a significant lag time when you’re taking shots, and the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your Razr V3. It should be, however, fine for Skype. Just don’t expect Nana and Papa to be able to see their little grunions clearly.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nYou really CAN tell how intelligent a man is just by looking at him, scientists say (and the key is a long face and bigger distance between the eyes) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Team baffled by results - and found they do not work on women NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Say prediction was not based on face shape - but a combination of facial features NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers have found we have an inbuilt ability to tell how intelligent a man is just by looking at them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team from the Czech Republic found people we unable to perform the same deduction on women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team admit they are baffled as to how we do it - and say it does not appear to be based on symmetry of the alignment of features. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Czech team said faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wide distance between the eyes. The perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WHAT MAKES MEN LOOK SMART? Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences,' the team wrote in the journal PLoS One.

Surprisingly, the same can’t be said for women’s facial traits. And the particular male facial characteristics linked with intelligence are a mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For their study, the researchers recruited 80 students, who completed an IQ test and had their face photographed with a neutral expression. Another 160 students rated the 80 photographs in random order for either perceived intelligence or attractiveness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as more intelligent by both male and female participants. This link between perceived attractiveness and perceived intelligence was stronger for women’s faces than men’s faces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also found that the participants rated men with a high IQ as more intelligent based solely on their facial photograph. For women, however, the researchers found no statistically significant link between perceived intelligence and their actual IQ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Naturally, the findings raised the question of why people could predict men’s intelligence based on their face, but not predict women’s intelligence based on their face. The researchers proposed a number of explanations to be tested by future research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men’s faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty,” Kleisner and her colleagues wrote.

The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women,” the researchers added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By examining the geometric features of the faces, the researchers were able to determine there was a link between certain facial characteristics and perceived intelligence for both men and women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters,” the researchers explained. “In both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these facial characteristics were only associated with perceived intelligence. The researchers found no link between these facial traits and actual IQ scores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men’s faces,” the researchers wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the correlation between these geometric traits and perceived attractiveness suggests there is an intelligence stereotype. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects,” the researchers said.\nPassage 3:\nAbstract Background The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings We used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs. In addition to general intelligence, figural and fluid intelligence showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence, but again, only in men. No relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ was found for women. We used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, as well as with intelligence as measured by IQ testing. Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. Conclusions These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape. Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introduction The human face is a complex structure with a crucial social signalling function. Though numerous and varied mammalian species exhibit well developed facial structures, the communicative and expressive roles of the face reach a unique level of ability in human beings [1]. It is well established in previous research that faces inform us about personality, sex, age, health, ethnicity, social rank, attractiveness and political affiliation, as well as, to some extent, the intelligence of the bearer [2]–[9]. Some researchers have suggested that people tend to attribute higher intelligence to attractive persons [10], [11]. If women tend to prefer intelligent men because of their generally higher social status and these men in turn tend to prefer attractive women, the alleged covariance of attractiveness and intelligence should be of no surprise [12]. However, such findings are controversial and should be approached cautiously since Kanazawa's research methods and conclusions have attracted strong criticism [13]–[15]. As with physical attractiveness, intelligence is suggested to indicate good genes [16], [17]. This notion is supported by the fact that during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle, women display a higher preference for men who score highly in creative intelligence [18]. Intelligence is also correlated with humour, which is suggested to have evolved in sexual selection as an intelligence-indicator [19]. By modifying the good genes approach we find a bad genes hypothesis, which argues that even though unattractive faces signal poor genetic fitness, there is no difference in genetic fitness between faces of average and high attractiveness [20]. It has been also suggested that sexual selection has played a role in the evolution of particular facial features, which have evolved to signal high intelligence [10], [21]. Visual cues responsible for a higher attribution of intelligence may honestly reflect the real intelligence of a person and can therefore be used to indicate a preferential sexual or social partner. Past research shows that people are able to judge intelligence from the facial qualities of unknown persons, r = 0.28 [10]. Measured intelligence has been shown to correlate with perceived intelligence and other personality traits, whether self-reported (0.29) or rated either by intimate acquaintances (0.31) or strangers (0.38) [22]. In addition to visual cues, there is evidence of the accurate assessment of intelligence based on behavioural and acoustic cues [23]–[26]. For example, measured intelligence significantly correlates with ratings by stranger in sound-film conditions (0.38) but not in silent-film conditions [22] and the correlation between measured intelligence and ratings of fluent speech is as high as r = 0.53 [23]. In general, inferences of intelligence taken from thin slices of behaviour have been shown to be highly accurate [27]. Gender influences the accuracy of intelligence assessment. Men were more accurately assessed for intelligence than women, while women were more accurate at assessing the intelligence of both men and women [26], [28]. Although a number of studies have examined the perception of intelligence from different visual cues, none of these studies describe the specific facial traits that play a role in intelligence assessment. The specific aim of the present study is to determine which facial shape cues are responsible for the attribution of intelligence, as well as those which correlate with actual intelligence. We also sought to identify which particular factors of general intelligence can accurately be assessed from facial photographs. Finally, using thin-plate spline extrapolation, we provide a statistically supported description of the intelligence-stereotype in order to depict the facial traits responsible for an attribution of intelligence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methods The present study integrates data from two different studies in which two independent groups of students participated: the first group consisted of 80 biology students at the Faculty of Science who were tested for IQ and photographed; the second group involved 160 raters, students at the Faculty of Humanities who rated the photos of the biology students either for intelligence or for attractiveness (each student rated 80 randomized photos). Dataset is available at http://web.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/IQKleisne​retal2013.xls Ethics statement The Institutional Review Board of Charles University, Faculty of Science approved this research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in our study. The data on measured intelligence, perceived intelligence and attractiveness were analyzed anonymously. IQ measurement To measure the intelligence of subjects, we used a Czech version of Intelligence Structure Test 2000 R [29], [30]. The test consists of a basic module, which is comprised of three verbal, three numerical, and three abstract figural reasoning tasks. The test also includes two memory tasks and a knowledge test. The knowledge test is focused on questions from geography/history, business, science, mathematics, arts, and daily life. As a whole, the test obtains a broad spectrum of results: the basic module measures verbal, numerical and figural IQ, as well as memory and reasoning; the knowledge test measures verbally, numerically and figurally coded knowledge; and both parts of the test measures fluid, crystallized, and general IQ. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, independent of acquired knowledge. This sort of reasoning does not reflect cultural differences but arises from biologically given cognitive abilities. Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience. This sort of reasoning improves with age and reflects the lifetime achievement of an individual [31]. Verbal intelligence is the ability to use language to analyze and solve problems associated with language-based reasoning. Numerical intelligence is the ability to manipulate numerical symbols and to comprehend quantitative relationships. Figural intelligence is the ability to combine shapes and forms and to analyze spatial patterns. The university students involved in this study showed a broad range of distribution of IQ (see Fig. 1.)

Histogram showing the range of distribution of IQ among university students involved in the present study. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g001 We administered the exam on computers to 10–12 individuals in the same room and at the same time (at 9:15 am). The total length of time was about 145 minutes, including a15 minute break between the basic module and the second module with the memory tasks and knowledge test. The photographs Facial photographs of 80 students (40 men: Mean± SD = 21.8±2.8, range: 19–34, and 40 women: Mean± SD = 20.9±1.6, range: 19–24) from the Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, were used as stimuli. The subjects were seated in front of a white background and photographed with a digital camera, Canon 450D, using studio electronic flash and reflection screen. The subjects were instructed to adopt a neutral, non-smiling expression and avoid facial cosmetics, jewellery, and other decorations. The photos were cropped to place the eyes horizontally at the same height and leave a standard length of neck visible. Rating the photographs One hundred sixty raters (75 men and 85 women) took part in judging the photographs; they had no connection either to the Faculty of Science or the rated subjects and were aged 26.7 years on average (women: Mean± SD = 26.7±7.7, range: 15–58; men: Mean± SD = 26.7±7.5, range: 16–55). Of these, 43 women (Mean± SD = 27.1±8.8, range: 15–58) and 42 men (Mean± SD = 28.5±8.2, range: 20–55) judged the subjects for intelligence. Another 42 women (Mean± SD = 26.2±6.4, range: 21–51) and 33 men (Mean± SD = 24.5±5.7, range: 16–38) judged the photos for attractiveness. Every person rated the whole set of 80 photos, either for perceived intelligence or attractiveness, using a seven-point scale wherein 1 stands for the highest ranking (for intelligence or attractiveness) and 7 the lowest (intelligence or attractiveness). The presentation and judgment of all photographs were performed using the software ImageRater 1.1. The raters were individually invited to judge the photographs. Each rater saw the photographs on a computer screen and indicated their valuation by mouse clicks on a discrete seven-point scale. No time limit was imposed. The order of the photographs was randomized for each rater. In the situation where a rater knew or was acquainted with a person pictured, she/he was instructed not to rate that picture. To eliminate the influence of individual differences between raters, the ratings of all photographs evaluated by each rater were converted to z-scores and the perceived intelligence/attractiveness of each photographed subject was calculated as its average z-score. The z-scores of perceived intelligence and attractiveness ratings were normally distributed. Statistics The relationship between measured IQ and perceived intelligence was tested by linear regression models using a mean z-score of perceived intelligence as the dependent variable and IQ values as the independent variable. The age of photographed individuals and raters was added as a covariate. We measured a Pearson correlation between perceived intelligence and perceived attractiveness to estimate the intensity of the halo effect in our population. Perceived attractiveness was added to the model as a covariate, because perceived intelligence strongly correlates with attractiveness. Each of the intelligence components was tested separately for men and women. Both quadratic and linear models were fitted, their statistical plausibility evaluated by F-test and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The effect size of an explanatory variable was expressed by partial η2. Because the averaging of individual ratings can inflate the effect size of correlations [32], we have also calculated partial Pearson correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence for each rater with perceived attractiveness as a covariate and calculated average partial Pearson correlation for all raters. Significance level was estimated by permutation test with 10,000 randomizations. For each randomization, the order of values, represented by raters' assessment of perceived intelligence for 40 photos, was randomly changed. The partial Pearson correlation coefficient between permuted judgments of each rater and IQ values of photos was then computed and these correlation coefficients were averaged for all raters. A comparison of average correlation coefficient computed with original data with average coefficients computed from randomized sets of data (namely the fraction of higher or equal coefficients computed from randomized data sets) provided the statistical significance of the permutation test. For statistical analyses we used PASW/SPSS 18 and R statistical software version 2.13.2. For the permutation test we used Matlab v. 7.10.0.499. Geometric morphometrics Photographs of 40 men and 40 women were analyzed by geometric morphometric methods (GMM) in order to detect the facial features that are associated with either or both the perception of intelligence and intelligence measured with the Intelligence Structure Test in both men and women. The 72 landmarks (including 36 semilandmarks) were digitized by tpsDig2 software, ver. 2.14 [33]. Landmarks are represented as points that are anatomically (or at least geometrically) homologous in different individuals, while semilandmarks serve to denote curves and outlines. The definitions of landmark and semilandmark locations on human faces were derived from previous work [34]–[37]. Semilandmarks were slid by tpsRelw (ver. 1.49) software. All configurations of landmarks and semilandmarks were superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), implemented in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46 [33]. This procedure standardized the size of the objects and optimized their rotation and translation so that the distances between corresponding landmarks were minimized. To observe the variation among the landmark data configurations of all specimens, the principal component analysis (PCA) – i.e., the relative warp analysis for parameter α = 0 – was carried out in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46. [33]. To observe the shape variation associated with perceived intelligence/IQ, we regressed GPA shape coordinates onto scores of intelligence rating/IQ by using a multivariate regression in which the dependent variable was the shape coordinates and the independent variable was perceived intelligence ratings or IQ scores; this was conducted in tpsRegr, ver. 1.36 [38]. Shape regressions were displayed by thin-plate splines as a deformation from the overall mean configuration (the consensus) of landmarks. The composite images were constructed by tpsSuper 1.14 [39] using the original photographs of men and women that were unwarped to fixed configuration represented by the estimates of shape regressions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussion Our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher then chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women. At the same time, we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos: the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated, r = 0.88. Perceived intelligence positively correlated with attractiveness in both men and women. Even though this contrasts some previous findings [10], [11], [40], [41], we did not observe any significant correlation between measured IQ and attractiveness. However, it should be noted that evidence for a relationship between actual intelligence and physical attractiveness in adults seems rather weak. Zebrowitz et al [10] did not find any significant correlation between perceived intelligence and attractiveness in individuals older than 18 years, i.e. middle adulthood (30 to 40) and later adulthood (52 to 60); however Zebrowitz et al did not examine individuals of a similar age bracket to our study (21.4 years in average). The existence of a correlation between attractiveness and intelligence in the age cohort from 19 to 29 years would appear questionable at the very least. Moreover, meta-analytic study has shown that physical attractiveness is not correlated to actual intellectual competence in adults, but is modestly correlated in children [15]. Similarly, other studies have reported close to zero correlation between attractiveness and actual intelligence in adults [40], [41]. We also showed that IQ has no statistically significant association in facial morphology in both men and women (at least as it was delimited by the landmark configuration used within this study). This means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men's faces. It is important to recall that our subjects were prompted to assume a neutral expression while their photo was taken and only photos of subjects with a neutral expression were included in the study. We can speculate about attributions of intelligence based on particular configurations of eyes or gaze, colour of eyes, hair and skin, or skin texture. These hypotheses should be tested in future studies. Intelligence stereotype Though we were not able to objectively detect an association between IQ and facial morphology, we can provide a statistically supported description of the stereotype of an intelligent-looking face. Our data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters. The intelligence-stereotype shows the same transformations in facial shape space for both men and women. In both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence (see Figs. 2 and 3). There also seems to be a correlation between semblances of emotions of joy or anger in perceptions of high or low intelligence in faces, respectively. The ‘high intelligence’ faces appear to be smiling more than the ‘low intelligence’ faces. A similar pattern was described for the perception of trustworthiness [37]. Perceived intelligence correlates with perceived trustworthiness and happiness. Conversely, low-intelligence faces are perceived as untrustworthy and considered angrier [42]. Moreover, perceived intelligence was also shown to be positively associated with perceived friendliness and sense of humour in both male and female faces but negatively related with perceived dominance in faces of women [43]. The face shape associated with a higher perception of intelligence also shows the characteristics of higher perception of attractiveness, while the face shape associated with a lower perception of intelligence shows traits of higher perceived dominance. The positive correlation with attractiveness and trustworthiness and negative correlation with dominance may explain the attribution of higher intelligence to longer, narrower faces. Correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence Two factors of general intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men's faces: fluid intelligence and figural intelligence. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge [31]. It depends on a subject's genetic qualities and, largely, cannot be influenced by continuous exercise or life experience. Figural intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns, and shapes. One cannot explicitly say that figural intelligence is independent of experience acquired during life, though the nature of this ability would also be affected by heritable genetic cues (as well as nurturing or other environmental effects). By contrast, verbal and crystallized intelligence largely depend on the social environment. The quadratic shape of the negative relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ points at the constraints that limit the preference of men with a very high IQ. Men with an IQ higher than 140 are perceived as relatively less intelligent (see Fig. 4.), which can reflect an adaptation to an upper intelligence limit as men with an extremely high IQ could find such practical tasks, such as the care and protection of women and offspring, less rewarding. Though intelligence does not positively correlate with mental disorders or anomalies, there are some indications that extremely high intelligence combined with other factors such as creativity might carry a potential risk for various mental disorders [44]–[46]. In a future survey, it would be interesting to search for correlations between perceived intelligence and deviations from facial symmetry.

Graph demonstrating linear positive and quadratic negative relationship between IQ and perceived intelligence in men (a) and women (b). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g004 If intelligence is judged with an accuracy higher than chance, and if intelligence is suggested to be at least partly heritable, we can then expect that intelligence could be an indicator of underlying genetic fitness with interesting consequences for human evolution [16], [17], [47], [48]. Our results necessarily imply the following question: Why does perceived intelligence reflect measured intelligence in men but not women. If facial indicators of intelligence are heritable, and if particular genes are not located on the Y sex chromosome, then both sons and daughters of an intelligent-looking father will obtain the alleles for an intelligent-looking face. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty [49]–[51]. If this is true, then the attribution of intelligence in infant faces should not differ between male and female children. When estimating the intelligence of women's faces, observers mechanically use criteria that “work” in men's faces, i.e. the criteria that objectively reflect intelligence in men. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women. This seems to be supported by a significantly higher correlation of perceived intelligence with attractiveness in women's faces (r = 0.901) in comparison to that in men's faces (r = 0.502). The third possible explanation is that facial indicators of intelligence are signals rather than cues and that the honest signalling of intelligence is adaptive for men but not for women. It can be speculated, for example, that because of their mixed mating strategy, women prefer dominant men as extra-pair sexual partners while at the same time they seek men who are more willing to invest in their offspring as long-term or social partners [52]. It is known that while in the fertile phase of cycle and probably in search of good genes, women prefer creative intelligence to wealth especially in short-term mating [18]. On the other hand, a woman seeking a long term relationship could prefer a less intelligent but honest man, who compensates by long term provisioning, protection and a greater investment in childrearing. At the same time, the prevalence of the mixed mating strategy would influence so as to lead to frequency-dependent selection, and result in the stable coexistence of highly and lowly intelligent men within a population. To test this hypothesis, it will be necessary to search for correlations between women's preferences during their menstrual cycle and the IQ of their preferred partners. To conclude, humans were able to estimate actual intelligence from facial photographs of men but not women. The attractiveness ratings were not statistically related to measured intelligence in both men and women. No difference between men and women existed in the raters' ability to assess intelligence, and no specific traits that correlated with real intelligence were detected with standard geometric morphometric methods. Men and women with specific facial traits were perceived as highly intelligent. However, these faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already, hints of a distancing strategy have started to creep into Trump’s public comments, even as he continues to crow at rallies that the midterms are a “referendum” on his first two years in office. Trump told The Associated Press recently that some of his supporters have said to him, “I will never ever go and vote in the midterms because you’re not running.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside the White House, aides are resigned to the fact that Trump — as he has often done — will follow his gut on how to message any Democratic takeover of the House on Nov. 6. Those around Trump are anticipating lots of unfiltered, early-morning tweets casting blame on everyone but the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It would be a lot of shooting from the hip in early morning Twitter,” said a well-placed Republican source, who added that the White House seems to lack clear plans for post-election messaging. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The themes are already predictable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The arc is gonna be he wasn’t on the ballot, and people didn’t fully appreciate his policies and [candidates] didn’t tie themselves enough to him,” said a person close to the president, who was among several sources to say Trump will likely blame the media as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While lashing out would be a Trumpian response, it would also be a break from recent presidential precedent. After losing the Congress to Democrats midway through his second term in 2006, a humbled George W. Bush conceded that he’d taken a “thumpin’,” pushed out an unpopular Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and vowed to find “common ground” with Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four years later, after a tea party wave swamped congressional Democrats two years into his first term, with Republicans picking up 63 House seats for the biggest midterm gain by either party since 1938, Barack Obama took “direct responsibility” in remarks afterward. Calling the moment “humbling,” Obama vowed to “do a better job.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although White House officials are aware of those precedents, Trump may not care about them. And he alone will decide how to spin the midterm results, with his aides following his lead. The White House declined to comment on the record for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Despite whatever [way] they may want to spin it … he’s going to drive the train on this and the White House is gonna fall and say the president did everything he could, but unfortunately he’s not on the ballot and so people weren’t as excited,” said the person close to Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before he was president, Trump had a philosophy on whether leaders should accept blame: “Whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen you’re responsible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But once in office, Trump, backed up by his communications team, has shifted blame for setbacks to others — especially Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After efforts to repeal Obama’s health care law stalled in Congress last July, the president blamed “a few Republicans” for holding up the process, despite creating considerable confusion on Capitol Hill with his own mixed signals on health care reform. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders echoed Trump’s line, saying it would be “absolutely ridiculous for Congress to try to place the blame on the president for the inability to get their job done.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And when Trump’s endorsement of Roy Moore failed to carry the Alabama Senate candidate to victory last December, the president claimed he was pressured into backing the wrong candidate. Those around him reinforced his claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There does need to be a recognition of the lousy political advice @POTUS has been getting and it needs to change,” Tony Fabrizio, a top Republican pollster involved in Trump’s 2016 campaign, wrote on Twitter at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re in a completely different dynamic now where we know President Trump will be perfectly comfortable in a finger-pointing exercise,” said a former senior George W. Bush aide, who claimed his boss, by comparison, “was perfectly fine with owning and taking some of the heat off the Hill leadership” after the 2006 midterms two years before Bush left office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A former senior Obama administration official, who recalled cringing when the ex-president used the term “shellacking” to describe the results of the 2010 midterms, said the White House “took stock” of the situation afterward and determined Obama could continue chipping away at his agenda through “either executive authority or working at the state and local level.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I only cringed because it was so true … We were shellacked,” this person said, adding that Obama nevertheless displayed “a willingness to accept responsibility and not wallow in defeat.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Should Trump buck that trend by refusing to bear any blame, some Republicans said they would be disappointed — albeit not surprised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The president’s rhetoric is what’s actually energized the left, so it would be hard to put it on Congress if we lost the House,” a senior GOP aide told POLITICO. “But it’s just classic behavior on the part of this president to not shoulder the blame if things go bad, and to definitely take responsibility if things go right.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, some of Trump’s most steadfast allies say he would be justified to turn his ire toward congressional Republicans if November becomes a bloodbath for the party in power. They claim he has done “everything possible,” like holding back-to-back-to-back campaign rallies last week, to assist GOP candidates battling for their seats or seeking to upset Democratic incumbents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think [Trump] has done everything that has been asked of him from the Republican Party to … help campaign and raise money wherever they have needed it,” said ex-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence has answered that call every time.”\nPassage 2:\nDemocrats are tamping down expectations for a “blue wave” two weeks before the midterm elections as key races in the House tighten and winning back the Senate majority looks increasingly out of reach.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The remarks by Perez and Sanders could be seen as a way of motivating the Democratic base. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Democrats are convinced that the 2016 presidential race was lost in part because Democratic voters didn’t show up, perhaps because they thought there was little chance that Republican Donald Trump would win.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perez still said he has “a lot of confidence” that his party will win back the House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats have led Republicans on the generic congressional ballot in virtually every public poll conducted over the past year, and an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Monday gave the party a 9-point lead over the GOP in the race to control Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some Democrats insist that winning the bare minimum of 23 seats needed to flip the House still amounts to a wave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Winning 23 seats is a wave,” said a Democratic strategist familiar with House races. “The frustration among some Democrats is losing sight of how big of an accomplishment it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People built expectations for this giant tsunami without the evidence there. The people actually looking at that data, in this fight, know how hard it is and are not taking anything for granted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perez acknowledged, however, that the race for the Senate presents “a tougher map” for Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than two dozen of the party’s incumbents are defending their seats this year, including 10 in states won by Trump in 2016, and Republicans are eager to expand their slim 51-49 majority by flipping seats in deep-red states, such as North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats believe they have benefited from an enthusiasm gap with Republicans for most of the year, but there are some signs that GOP voters are getting more motivated ahead of Nov. 6. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has been campaigning across the country and is increasingly using the bully pulpit to steer the national conversation toward issues such as the immigrant caravan headed toward the U.S. border with Mexico — something seemingly designed to fire up his base. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early voting in some critical battlegrounds as of Monday found that GOP-affiliated voters are outnumbering the Democratic-affiliated voters in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee and Texas, according to TargetSmart data analyzed by NBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democratic-affiliated voters outpaced GOP ones only in Nevada, according to the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats are also worried about laws in crucial pockets of the country that could suppress Democratic voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These allegations have become a dominant issue in Georgia’s nationally watched governor’s race between former state House minority leader Stacey Abrams (D) and Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. If elected, Abrams would be the first black woman to serve as governor in U.S history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An APM Reports analysis found an estimated 107,000 voters in Georgia have been removed from the state’s voter rolls because of the “use it or lose it” law, which removes people who have not voted or made contact with an election official over three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kemp, who oversees the state’s elections, said his office is following the law and has worked to prevent voter fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are so many ways that Republicans have tried to make voting less accessible to voters over the last two years,” a former DNC aide told The Hill. “We’re really cautious of what the impact of those actions will be going to the polls and how many people are able to vote.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some Democratic strategists are also exercising caution about their midterm prospects because they’re “still a little scarred,\" in the words of one observer, after Trump’s shock victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWatergate’s John Dean: Nixon would tell Trump 'he's going too far' Senate Homeland Security chairman requests briefing on Ivanka Trump emails House GOP to hold hearing into DOJ’s probe of Clinton Foundation MORE in the 2016 presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has stepped up campaigning for Republicans in the final stretch of the campaign, attracting thousands of Republicans, while expressing confidence about the party’s prospects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent rallies, the president has also sought to cast Democrats as unfit to govern and has spoken intermittently about a coming “red wave” that would expand the Republican majorities in both chambers.\nPassage 3:\nHOUSTON (AP) — President Donald Trump escalated his immigration rhetoric at a midterm rally in Texas on Monday, falsely accusing Democrats of \"encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With weeks to go before Election Day, Trump is seeking to drive Republican turnout with his hard-line immigration policies. He cast the November choice in stark terms before the Houston rally for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, saying Democrats \"have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump spoke before a massive crowd on behalf of his former foe, who faces a strong challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke. When the two competed in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Trump would frequently deride his rival as \"Lyin' Ted\" but said in Texas that their relationship had come a long way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nobody has helped me more with your tax cut, with your regulation,\" Trump said, also attacking O'Rourke, as a \"stone-cold phony.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the midterms drawing near, Trump has emphasized immigration, targeting a migrant caravan heading to the U.S. southern border. The president's focus on immigration politics comes as he seeks to counter Democratic enthusiasm in November. Trump believes that his campaign pledges, including his much vaunted — and still-unfulfilled — promise to quickly build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, are still rallying cries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump is betting that his latest focus will further erode the enthusiasm gap that began to close during the debate over Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. But the approach offers both risks and rewards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hard-line rhetoric may be popular among the red-state rural Republicans who will play an outsized role in the top Senate contests. But it may further alienate the moderate Republicans and women in the overwhelmingly suburban races that will decide the House majority — including several in Texas, California and Florida that feature large Hispanic populations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday night, Trump called the caravan an \"assault on our country\" and suggested, without citing evidence, that \"Democrats had something to do with it.\" He added: \"We need a wall built fast.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Monday, Trump said the U.S. will begin \"cutting off, or substantially reducing\" aid to three Central American nations because of the caravan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Texas, an enthusiastic crowd packed into Houston's Toyota Center, wearing red Make America Great Again hats and waving signs, including some with the president's new catchphrase, \"Jobs vs. Mobs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking before Trump took the stage, Cruz made clear that their conflict was behind them and that the two were working together. His biggest applause came when he predicted that \"in 2020, Donald Trump will be overwhelmingly re-elected.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A series of elected state officials were among the warmup speakers, as well as Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump and son Eric Trump, who told the audience that \"we are driving the Democrats absolutely nuts.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump gleefully used his latest attack line against Democrats, saying, \"Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs.\" He declared Democrats would be a \"big risk to the American family,\" and went after some of his favorite targets, including Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Rep. Maxine Waters, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president stressed tax cuts, the strong economy and the hurricane response in the state. He repeated his pledge for a new middle-income tax cut of about 10 percent, though he offered few details on the plan. Trump said they would be \"putting it in\" next week, though Congress is not in session. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also criticized so-called globalists, declaring, \"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's Texas stop is part of a campaign blitz that is expected to last until Election Day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although political relationships tend to be fluid, Trump's appearance for Cruz is notable, given that the two were bitter enemies during the 2016 primaries. After Trump insulted Cruz's wife and father, and Cruz refused to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention, it was far from clear that the two would ever put it all behind them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they started rebuilding in the closing days of the campaign and have worked together since Trump took the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House views Cruz as a loyal vote for his agenda. Trump promised he would come to Texas after the Senate race grew closer than expected, with O'Rourke out-fundraising Cruz and drawing large and enthusiastic crowds around the state. Cruz, who is leading O'Rourke in the polls, said over the summer that he would welcome Trump's support, though he has brushed off any suggestion he'd need Trump to win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the 2016 Republican primary, Trump assailed Cruz as a liar and \"dishonest politician,\" insulted his wife's appearance and promoted unsubstantiated claims that Cruz's father had links to President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump on Monday did not voice any second thoughts about labeling Cruz the son of a presidential killer, telling reporters, \"I don't regret anything.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz gave back as good as he got in 2016. He savaged Trump as a \"pathological liar,\" an \"amoral bully\" and a \"sniveling coward.\" After Cruz lost the primary, he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he did not endorse Trump and instead called on Republicans to \"vote your conscience,\" drawing boos from the crowd. But he announced his support about a month before Election Day — and won points in Trump's camp for not withdrawing after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was released in which Trump bragged about groping women.

In Houston early Monday, thousands of people lined up at a voting location hours before early voting began, the Houston Chronicle reports. Authorities say early voting turnout has been much higher than in 2014 across the state's biggest counties. Renée Cross, senior director for the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, tells the Texas Tribune that the numbers are \"very impressive.\" \"We see so much anger or enthusiasm about candidates in much higher numbers than we’ve ever seen,\" she says. \"From a political standpoint, I think there’s just as much energy that we’ve seen in presidential years.\" In other election news: Trump praises \"Beautiful Ted.\" President Trump appeared at a Houston rally for Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday, where both men made it clear the bitterness of the 2016 campaign was behind them. Before he flew to Texas, Trump told reporters that he now called Cruz \"Beautiful Ted\" or \"Texas Ted\" instead of \"Lyin' Ted,\" reports the Washington Post. At the rally, the two men embraced and Cruz told the crowd that he is looking forward to hitting the campaign trail for Trump's re-election bid in 2020. Trump described Cruz's opponent, Beto O'Rourke, as \"overrated.\" \"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist.\" At the Cruz rally, Trump attacked Democrats as a \"big risk to the American family\" and accused them of \"encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation,\" the AP reports. He also attacked globalists, declaring himself to be a nationalist. GOP may have the edge in early voting. According to data analyzed by NBC News, talk of a \"blue wave\" may be overstated: In early voting, Republican-affiliated voters have outnumbered Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas, while Democrats are ahead in Nevada. Trump \"plans to distance himself from GOP losses.\" Insiders tell Politico that while Trump is currently describing the midterm vote as a vote on his presidency, he plans to break with recent precedent and distance himself from the results if there are serious GOP losses. The sources say Trump is likely to blame losses on House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—as well as the media.

This is going to be a dangerous winter storm,\" said Alan Dunham, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. \"Wherever you need to get to, get there by Friday afternoon and don't plan on leaving.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The snow began falling Friday morning in some areas, with the heaviest amounts falling at night and into Saturday. Wind gusts could reach 75 mph. Widespread power failures were feared, along with flooding in coastal areas still recovering from Superstorm Sandy in October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston could get up to 3 feet of snow, while New York City was expecting 10 to 12 inches. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said plows and 250,000 tons of salt were being put on standby. To the south, Philadelphia was looking at a possible 2 to 5 inches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hope forecasts are exaggerating the amount of snow, but you never can tell,\" Bloomberg said, adding that at least the bad weather is arriving on a weekend, when the traffic is lighter and snowplows can clean up the streets more easily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amtrak said its Northeast trains will stop running Friday afternoon. The organizers of New York's Fashion Week _ a closely watched series of fashion shows held under a big tent _ said they will have extra crews to help with snow removal and will turn up the heat and add an extra layer to the venue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blizzard warnings were posted for parts of New Jersey and New York's Long Island, as well as portions of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, including Hartford, New Haven, Conn., and Providence. The warnings extended into New Hampshire and Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In New England, it could prove to be among the top 10 snowstorms in history, and perhaps even break Boston's record of 27.6 inches, set in 2003, forecasters said. The last major snowfall in southern New England was well over a year ago _ the Halloween storm of 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dunham said southern New England has seen less than half its normal snowfall this season, but \"we're going to catch up in a heck of a hurry.\" He added: \"Everybody's going to get plastered with snow.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diane Lopes was among the shoppers who packed a supermarket Thursday in the coastal fishing city of Gloucester, Mass. She said she went to a different grocery earlier in the day but it was too crowded. Lopes said she has strep throat and normally wouldn't leave the house but had to stock up on basic foods _ \"and lots of wine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She chuckled at the excitement the storm was creating in a place where snow is routine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why are us New Englanders so crazy, right?\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a Shaw's supermarket in Belmont, Mass., Susan Lichtenstein stocked up, with memories of a 1978 blizzard on her mind. \"This is panic shopping, so bread, milk, a snow shovel in case our snow shovel breaks,\" she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're pretty excited about it because this has been an unusual winter for us,\" he said. \"We've been going back and forth between having really solid cold snaps and then the rain washing everything away.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said the snow might be too much of a good thing this weekend: \"For skiing, we like to have a nice hard surface, so it will be kind of tough to get the hill ready.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The governors of Connecticut and Massachusetts ordered nonessential state workers to stay home Friday and urged travelers to stay home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Terrance Rodriguez, a doorman at a luxury apartment complex in Boston, took the forecast in stride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's just another day in Boston.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Airlines began announcing the suspension of flights out of New York and Boston airports starting Friday night, as thousands of workers readied their plows, checked their stocks of salt and braced for what will most likely be a cold, wet weekend. Amtrak announced that it would suspend northbound service out of Penn Station in New York and southbound service out of Boston beginning early Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gas stations in parts of New York City and New Jersey had long lines Thursday night, according to local residents, a signal, perhaps, that many were taking storm warnings seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 2,200 flights for Friday had been canceled, according to the Web site FlightAware, the majority originating or departing from the areas affected by the storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By late Thursday night, schools across New York and Connecticut had announced they would close, or dismiss students early. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Long Island, where some forecasts said there could be more than 18 inches of snow, the power company, which has received heavy criticism for its response to Hurricane Sandy, promised customers that they were prepared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city of Boston, where forecasts called for more than two feet of snow to fall by Saturday, announced that it would close all schools on Friday, joining other localities in trying to get ahead of the storm and keep people off the roads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are taking this storm very seriously and you should take this storm very seriously,” said Jerome Hauer, the New York State Commissioner of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, at an afternoon news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you don’t have to go to work tomorrow, we suggest that you do not,” he said. “If you do, we suggest that you plan for an early departure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest forecasts, he said, called for between 12 and 20 inches of snow in the New York City region and wind gusts that could exceed 60 miles per hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, with the storm still some distance away, forecasters warned that predictions could change. The first sign of the storm will be a dusting of light snow that is expected to start falling across the region Friday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At some point Friday night, the arctic jet stream will drop down from Canada and intersect with the polar jet stream, which usually travels through the lower 48 states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They will cross somewhere between New Jersey and Nantucket,” said Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “That is where the center of the storm will deepen and explosively develop.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the current models hold, the storm could rival the blizzard of 1978 in New England, when more than 27 inches of snow fell in Boston and surrounding cities. That storm, which occurred on a weekday, resulted in dozens of deaths and crippled the region for days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said more than 20 agencies had gathered at the agency’s operations center in Framingham, Mass., where they were preparing for a historic storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From our perspective, this is a very severe, blizzard-type storm that we haven’t had for quite a long time,” Mr. Judge said. “Worst-case scenario, this will be the worst one that we’ve dealt with in many, many years. I can’t even come up with something comparable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials prepared for debris management, snow removal and supplies distribution, he said, as well as widespread power failures, which he said were the major concern. “People will lose their heat when they lose their power, and they’re certainly much more in harm’s way than at other times of the year,” he said.

But please stay safe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York (CNN) -- Stores across the Northeast were packed with shoppers as people prepared for what could be a historic blizzard set to arrive on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Reading, Massachusetts, residents were preparing for several feet of snow that could leave them stuck in their homes for days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a zoo in there. There's nothing left on the shelves. ... I think I got every bottle of water that they had in stock,\" Elizabeth Fraiser told CNN afilliate WHDH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Home Depot, another resident said she had essential supplies but wanted to be doubly sure she was ready. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have a lot of it, but just want to be prepared. You never know,\" Joanna Spinosa said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A picture posted on the website of CNN affiliate WCVB showed long lines at a gas station in Boston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Travelers looking up flight details on airline websites were seeing the word \"Canceled\" over and over. And it wasn't just affecting travelers in the Northeast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 3,300 flights were canceled in anticipation of the storm as emergency crews geared up for inclement weather, most of which was expected late Friday into Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the flight-tracking website Flight Aware, airports from Logan in Boston to O'Hare in Chicago to Reagan National in Washington were seeing significant number of flights -- inbound and outbound -- called off for Friday. More than 60 U.S. airports reported flight cancellations, Flight Aware said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amtrak canceled many trips in the Northeast corridor. The rail transit company said on its website that northbound service from New York's Penn Station would be suspended after 1 p.m Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two ferocious storm systems are expected to converge across the Northeast on Friday and spawn nightmares for a large swath of the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A wintry blast churning across the nation and a cold front barreling up the East Coast will unite and could dump as much as a foot of snow in New York and up to 3 feet in Boston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston could see snowfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour, as frigid gusts swirl across the region. The system has already drawn comparisons to the \"Great Blizzard\" of 1978, when thousands were stranded as fast-moving snow drifts blanketed highways and left several people dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most severe weather is expected to hit Massachusetts between 2 and 5 p.m. on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that all non-emergency workers should work from home. He canceled all school classes on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Be a good neighbor. Check on the elderly,\" he said, advising residents not to bring portable stoves, charcoal or gas grill indoors out of concern for potential fire hazards or carbon monoxide poisoning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All vehicles must be off the roads by noon on Friday, and Boston's public rail system will halt service at 3:30 p.m. A fleet of 600 snow removers will be manned by municipal workers and contractors as authorities gear up for what they say could be a 36-hour storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are hearty New Englanders and used to these kinds of storms, but I also want to remind people to use common sense and stay off the streets,\" said Mayor Thomas M. Menino. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forecasters warned of potential white-out conditions across New England and parts of New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you are on the highway and you are stuck, you are putting yourself in danger,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, residents stocked up after authorities announced that public schools across several New England states would not hold classes Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They're coming in buying shovels, ice melts and sleds,\" said Atton Shipman, who works at Back Bay Hardware in Boston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Social media was abuzz with chatter about the incoming weather. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Just a reminder of what the ground looks like in case anyone forgets in a couple of days,\" tweeted Ryan Pickering, after posting a close-up photo of a Rhode Island roadway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency officials said that they were busy salting roadways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Travel may become nearly impossible with blowing/drifting snow and near zero visibility during the height of the storm (Friday afternoon into Saturday morning),\" the agency said in a statement. \"Motorized vehicles are asked to stay off the roads if they can during the storm to allow snow plows to clear the roads.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crews began preparing snow plows at Logan International Airport, where officials said the storm is expected to cause more flight delays and cancellations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United Airlines said customers in storm-affected cities will be allowed to reschedule their itineraries \"with a one-time date or time change, and the airline will waive the change fees.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Delta, Jet Blue, Southwest and other airlines offered their customers similar assurances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy said utility companies were bringing additional crews from out of state to deal with potential power outages. Metro-North rail lines could also be closed at any time should winds exceed 40 mph. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Connecticut National Guard has moved equipment to staging places, including several Black Hawk helicopters at Bradley International Airport north of Hartford. In Rhode Island, 300 members of a military police brigade were scheduled to drill on Saturday and Sunday but the drill has been moved up because of the storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A snow emergency went into effect in the southern Connecticut city of Stamford, beginning at 5 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the timing of the storm could actually benefit municipal workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If it's going to happen, having it happen Friday overnight into Saturday is probably as good timing as we could have,\" Bloomberg said. \"The sanitation department then has the advantage of being able to clean the streets when there's normally less traffic.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York's Air National Guard unit on Long Island has some snowmobiles it can deploy to help with search and rescue or emergency transportation. If Gov. Andrew Cuomo were to order the National Guard to assist, each of New York's Guard's six operating areas will be ready to deploy 10 Humvees and 40 troops trained in disaster response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By late Thursday, the National Weather Service had issued a blizzard warning from 6 a.m. Friday until 1 p.m. Saturday, with wind gusts up to 50 mph, creating dangerous driving conditions with visibilities near zero in white-out conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consolidated Edison, a main utility company for the New York region, said it is preparing additional crews to deal with potential power outages and advised customers to stay clear of downed power lines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long island Power Authority, which received intense criticism over its handling of Superstorm Sandy, said it was preparing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Record-breaking snowfall could hit Hartford, Connecticut, as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We expect snow and then rain, and severe coastal flooding,\" said CNN meteorologist Sarah Dillingham. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wind will also be a major concern. Gusts could reach 75 mph along Cape Cod and 55 mph in the Long Island Sound and cause coastal flooding, with tides rising about three to five feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As more miserable weather slams the region, those affected by Superstorm Sandy will be further hampered by high winds, cold temperatures and more beach erosion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parts of the region are under a blizzard watch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In New Hampshire, there are people who actually want a lot of snow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Natural snow definitely gets people to remind them that there are winter activities,\" Lori Rowell, director of marketing for Pats Peak ski resort in Henniker, told CNN affiliate WBZ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steve Livingston said he usually sells 30 to 35 snowmobiles a week at his shop, but he hasn't sold any in the past week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sales have been super slow,\" said Livingston, owner of Livingston's Arctic Cat in Hillsborough. \"I hope we get as much snow as we can possibly deal with. That would be like a hot summer day for Hampton Beach for us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.\nPassage 6:\nA blizzard of potentially historic proportions threatened to strike the Northeast with a vengeance Friday, with 1 to 2 feet of snow feared along the densely populated Interstate 95 corridor from the New York City area to Boston and beyond.

Hopefully we’ll do it well.” Success for me would’ve been feeling like I figured it out. That I got to express the things I wanted to. It was never “I want this to be a cultural touchstone . . . but only for a very small portion of America.” And I was hoping to stay on TV longer than nine months this time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Daily Show premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, at 11:30 P.M. The format loosely tracked that of a conventional newscast: five or so opening minutes called “Headlines,” read by former ESPN anchor Craig Kilborn, followed by “Other News,” then usually a pre-taped “field piece” with a correspondent, and finishing up with Kilborn interviewing an actor or a musician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some segments played off the hard news of the day, like the presidential contest between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. “There was more of a pop-culture-and-lifestyle component only because what we were satirizing—particularly local news—was doing a lot of that stuff,” co-creator Lizz Winstead says. “We would make fun of the conventions of news. Like when TV reporters talk, how do you create drama in a story that doesn’t exist?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The day-to-day creative process of the first few years of The Daily Show centered on Winstead, fellow co-creator Madeleine Smithberg, and the writing staff. “My first day on the job,” Winstead says, “I have to pull the writers into my office and say, ‘Guys, you can’t have your mushroom dealer come up to the office.’ ” Kilborn came up with the signature “Five Questions” conceit for guest interviews, but otherwise largely read from the script. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November 1996, Comedy Central’s executives moved The Daily Show to 11 P.M., to replace Bill Maher’s Politically Incorrect, which had jumped to ABC, but also to counter-program the late local news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kilborn’s Daily Show would peak at a nightly average of 357,000, yet Kilborn’s audience was growing, and the show was generating critical buzz. Perhaps more important than the chatter was the fact that it was indeed reaching the younger male viewers Comedy Central president Doug Herzog had targeted in the first place. The combination caught the attention of CBS, and in 1998 it offered Kilborn the slot following Late Night with David Letterman, at 12:30 A.M. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He starts to get a little heat, we’re starting to get a little attention with The Daily Show,” Herzog says, “and then the next thing you know Kilborn goes and signs with CBS without even telling us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Panic, followed by auditions: David Alan Grier, Michael McKean, Greg Proops, Bill Weir, and Mike Rowe came to the studio and sat in the host’s chair. Daily Show correspondents Beth Littleford and Stephen Colbert got tryouts, too. But Herzog and other Comedy Central executives wondered about a black-leather-jacket-wearing stand-up comic, a guy who had hosted a short-lived MTV talk show produced by Smithberg. He had lost out to Conan O’Brien as Letterman’s NBC replacement; he had written a book of satirical essays; he had played Eve Harrington to Garry Shandling’s Margo Channing on The Larry Sanders Show; and lately he’d had some supporting roles in Hollywood rom-coms. Herzog didn’t think the highly regarded, slightly adrift comedian would be interested in the job. But, hey, what did he have to lose in buying lunch for Jon Stewart? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From The Neal Peters Collection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON (manager for Jon Stewart, 1987-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After The Jon Stewart Show was canceled, he was . . . not burnt on being on TV, but he wanted to kind of wet his feet with film. We had this nice deal with Harvey Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: At the time, I was obviously making my mark in such films as Wishful Thinking and Dancing with Architecture, or Dancing About . . . Oh, no. They ended up calling it something else. Playing by Heart, I think it was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting fired from the talk show was the real turning point for me. Because I thought that, after appearing on Letterman, now I’m a made man. I thought losing The Jon Stewart Show meant I was an unmade man. I realized you still have to make your act better. The goal is to produce, the goal is to make things. So I spent some time writing and performing on The Larry Sanders Show, and I learned a lot from Garry Shandling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUDD APATOW (stand-up comic, writer, director): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garry had the foresight to write about the talk-show wars and this very subtle aspect of it, which is you support a young comedian, and slowly the network likes him more than it likes you, and then that younger guy, in ways that he understands and might not understand, slowly pushes you out of your job. Similar to what really happened with Leno and Conan and Fallon. So there was a moment when Garry was considering continuing The Larry Sanders Show and changing the name of it to The John Stewart Show, with an h so it wouldn’t really be Jon. Everyone was excited about it for a while, but it went away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The Daily Show wasn’t necessarily on the radar. I think they called and said, “Hey, man, would you be interested in talking about this?”—something along those lines, something as romantic as that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON: I definitely advocated for him to do it. I just said to him, “You can put this through your prism. You can make it smarter and different than what it’s been.” Now, I definitely didn’t see the show becoming the political lightning rod that it evolved into. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DOUG HERZOG (executive, MTV, 1984-95; president, Comedy Central, 1995-98; executive, Viacom, 2004-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the summer of ‘98, when we announced that Jon was going to take over The Daily Show, we had a little press conference in the lobby of the old Comedy Central offices. And Stephen Colbert showed up, as a member of the press representing The Daily Show, wanting to know why he didn’t get the job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT (correspondent, 1997-2005): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You told me he wasn’t funny.” That’s what Jon said to Doug Herzog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MATT LABOV (publicist for Jon Stewart, 1994-2008): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stakes for Jon were fairly high at that point, because he’s not a super-young guy anymore, and he’s had shots, and people easily disappear and go into the woodwork. He didn’t get the Conan job on NBC; he didn’t get the 12:30 job after Letterman. If this doesn’t work on fucking cable, then where would Jon have ended up? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: A couple of months before I officially started as host there was a meeting with the writers and producers. Let’s call that “Jonny’s surprise party.” I knew that the people working on the Kilborn show were rightfully proud of it. It had done well. It was not the sensibility that I thought was right for me, and so when they approached me for the show, I was pretty clear about the direction I thought I wanted to take it. Seemed like everybody was on board with that, and so this was my first chance to meet with all the people who, I had been told, were so excited about that. So excited. They’re so happy you’re here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I walked in, and it was a room full of people who, as it turned out, were annoyed that I had an idea about where I wanted to go, who thought that I was going to MTV it up. I was told, “This isn’t about bands. We do a real show here.” I just sat there like “Oh, fuck.” It felt a little bit like “Wow, none of this was in the brochure. The brochure said that this was oceanfront property.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON: I had to talk Jon down. Not from a tree—from a skyscraper. Because they basically said to him, “Welcome aboard. This is how we do shit here. Grab a chair.” It was bullshit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PAUL RUDD (actor): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Technically I was Jon’s first Daily Show guest interview. I went to the University of Kansas, and my roommate, Stewart Bailey, became a segment producer who was with the show from the very beginning. I’d been on Kilborn’s Daily Show. When Jon replaced Craig, they wanted to do a test show so Jon could get used to the format. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stewart made his debut on Monday, January 11, 1999. His first joke was that Kilborn was “on assignment in Kuala Lumpur.” His first headline, “The Final Blow,” was about the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. His first guest was Michael J. Fox, then starring on ABC’s Spin City. But Stewart looked, for the first months, very much the guest himself. Other than a new couch and desktop—and blue script pages for Stewart to scribble on portentously, replacing Kilborn’s white paper—the set design was largely unchanged. The theme song, Bob Mould’s “Dog on Fire,” was the same. And Stewart’s suits were so ill-fitting that they looked like they were inherited from his much taller predecessor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Mike Blake/Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUSTIN MELKMANN (post-production supervisor; segment producer; later supervising producer, video department; 1997-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Kilborn era, it was about “How can we seem like we’ve gone too far?” With Jon, we went from creating the news—creating funny spoof headlines—to making fun of the news. That was a big change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA (correspondent, 1998-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after Jon arrived, we had done a bit about Dana Plato dying, and Jon felt bad about delivering a joke when the end of her life had been so pathetic. We had a meeting where he said he had resolved that the show needed to have a point of view and couldn’t just be the kid at the back of the classroom throwing spitballs in all directions. I remember people trading the kind of glances that said, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: To be fair to the writers who stayed from Kilborn’s show, they had a successful thing going. They thought of it as a continuation of their show. I thought it was a new show. To me it wasn’t edgy or provocative to just take napalm to a bush for no reason. You wanted it to be pointed, purposeful, intentional, surgical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I felt like I walked in there with a very open “O.K., so this will be great,” and it was “Hey, motherfucker, you came here to kill a baby.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KENT JONES (writer, 1996-2001): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, I would not agree with that. I don’t remember any of this being as hostile as it has been portrayed. I just don’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MADELEINE SMITHBERG (co-creator; executive producer, 1996-2002): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the point of view that had been created by Craig Kilborn sitting in the chair, the writers’ role had inflated. Yeah, they were spoiled rotten, because almost every show in late night is talent driven. They got too big for their britches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Six or eight weeks in, the writers called me into their office. They’re like, “You can’t change our jokes anymore.” I didn’t know what to say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So after a weekend of pacing and smoking and having tremendous Lincoln-Douglas debates on the couch by myself, I went back in, and it was horrible. I basically told them all to fuck off. “You work for me. And if you don’t like the direction, O.K. I get that. Don’t work here.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “THERE WERE POINTS WHERE I THOUGHT . . . I’VE GOT TO LEAVE,” SAYS STEWART OF THE EARLY TURMOIL. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were points where I thought, I made the wrong decision. I’ve got to leave. But I don’t give up very easily. It was open hostility, which is so enjoyable. It became that sense of “O.K., let’s arm-wrestle.” This will give you a hint of my personality of grudges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I didn’t really have a game plan. I knew what I didn’t want. But then turning it into what you did want was the next scenario, and that was going to take time, and effort, and accomplices. What I needed most were accomplices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN (head writer, later executive producer, 1999-2006): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was living in Los Angeles, working with a bunch of guys from The Onion, selling pilots and doing punch-up on movies. We did a pilot for Fox called Deadline Now, at about the same time The Daily Show was launching. We kind of did the exact opposite. We didn’t want to be winking at the audience. We wanted to play it straight and not really acknowledge we were a comedy show. We hired actors and went about trying to produce a news show that was very much in the spirit of the Onion newspaper. And, frankly, we were quite scornful of the Kilborn Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our template host, when we’d come up with show ideas, was always Jon Stewart. We loved Jon Stewart. So when it was announced that Jon was taking over The Daily Show, our little comedy-snob nerd group thought it was a bad move. For him. Comedy Central was still pretty second-tier, and that might even be nice. And Jon was the Letterman heir apparent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I got a call from my agent saying, “Listen, Jon is looking for a new head writer, loves The Onion, has heard that you’re kind of the de facto leader of the Onion guys’ group out in L.A. Would you be willing to come out to New York and meet with them?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: I really liked his sensibility. Ben seemed to be concerned with hypocrisy and the silly façades of politics. He seemed to know where the absurdity was, and that was an important change in focus for what we wanted to do. There’s also a certain steeped-in-neurosis bathos that probably was a rhythm that we both clicked on. That similar Jewie Jewerman from Jewville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The big thing was to find somebody who had thoughts, who cared, who had an opinion. Part of what The Onion is, and part of what Ben was steeped in, was the idea of deconstruction as your first step of re-creation. So Ben was a natural fit, although he had not had the TV experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Comedy Central. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I was friendly with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross. They were kind of like the grand Pooh-Bahs of the alternative-comedy scene in L.A.—Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt. It was that whole wave of comics. Bob and David said The Daily Show sounded like a great opportunity. So I sublet my apartment, sold my Harley, found someone to take my dog for a while, and came to New York with three duffel bags. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Ben walked into a buzz saw. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I’m not going to talk shit about anybody. But the staff had its allegiances, and the things that they liked to do, and the way they liked to do it. Now you’ve got this guy, Jon, who is a writer, who has a strong point of view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIZZ WINSTEAD (co-creator; head writer, correspondent, 1996-1998): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As much as I loved the original writers, I created some little monsters. Once Jon realized he needed to take charge, you can’t afford to have people who are not in the Jon Stewart business. And so there’s a bit of Kool-Aid drinking that has to take place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Karlin arrived as head writer in April 1999 and quickly formed a complementary duo with Stewart. Karlin pushed for a higher quotient of righteous anger in The Daily Show’s jokes; Stewart had an innate sense of what would get big laughs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: We were very kindred spirits, with very similar points of view, and my critique of the show was very much in line with his problems with the show: Why are we going after these helpless targets? Maybe we should focus the power of this kind of big news show on things that are actually newsworthy, rather than just look through the paper for what seems funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clashes, pitting Stewart and Karlin against some of the holdover Kilborn writers, would flare for the next year, with one confrontation—which became known inside the show as “the fuck-you meeting”—being leaked to the New York Post’s “Page Six.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: I think that was the meeting where I said, “You’re not a group. You’re not a unit. You’re not ‘the writers.’ You’re individual writers that have been hired, and you will be judged within that.” It was just an attempt to reclaim some semblance of order. It was an absolute flat-out power struggle, but one that I felt blindsided by. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: At one point during the battle for the heart and soul of the show, one of the writers snuck into Madeleine’s office and replaced some of the items on the board that tracks the stories we’re doing with personal insults. Some of them were about me; some were about other people. It was the most juvenile thing in the world. Jon and I used to have this thing: crazy out, sane in. We wanted to try to build a show of smart, funny, reasonable people with a similar vision who were hard workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An enormous step in that direction was Karlin’s first addition to the writing staff: a dizzyingly fast-thinking, cheerfully caustic 27-year-old who would become a major figure in the creative life of The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DAVID JAVERBAUM (writer, later executive producer, 1999-2010): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’d gone to Harvard and written for the Lampoon and Hasty Pudding, then I went to graduate school for musical-theater composition, at N.Y.U. It’s arguably the most useless master’s degree even by master’s-degree standards. I had a lot of creative things I was interested in, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was temping for three years at law firms and Merrill Lynch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I knew Ben Karlin from a teen tour that we were on together, the thing where Jewish middle-class kids go around the country and pretend to rough it for six weeks. Ben, after college at Wisconsin, wound up working at The Onion, and he said, “Do you want to contribute?” So I began writing a lot of Onion headlines and some articles, and I had the idea for the book Our Dumb Century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then I spent a year at Letterman as a writer, and I hated that. Not the people, per se, but it all comes from the top down, and Letterman, even at that point, which was ‘98 to ‘99, was just a detached, aloof figure who would stay there for, like, 13 hours a day for no reason. And I quit. I was making six figures. I’d never made the upper half of five before, but it just was not worth it. It was crushing my soul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ben was hired as the head writer for The Daily Show, and once again he called me and said, “Are you interested in writing?” So I owe Ben for both of those opportunities. I think I was Ben’s first writing hire, in July 1999. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: D.J. has genius-like qualities, almost to the point where—it’s not Asperger-y, because he’s a funny, normal guy. But the way he can hold information, the speed with which his mind works, it’s almost like he’s got a broken brain that works really well in this way. I’ve known him since he was 16 years old. He always was like this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Usually in a writers’ room you know that this guy is my joke guy, that one is my story guy, that’s my structure person. And D.J. has the ability to pitch individual jokes that are funny; he can come up with overarching structures that are funny; he can take over someone’s script and make it better. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Karlin, and now Javerbaum, Stewart had hired invaluable off-camera allies. But he quickly recognized that he had inherited an indispensable on-camera co-conspirator. Stephen Colbert had a subversive streak that was greatly abetted by the fact that he looked like a trustworthy middle-American insurance salesman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Al Levine/Comedy Central. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: It was a complete happy accident that I ended up at The Daily Show. I had been working for ABC at The Dana Carvey Show in 1996. That show got canceled, my wife wasn’t working, and we had a baby. I desperately needed a job. Someone from the entertainment division recommended to the news division that if they were looking for somebody who was funny but looked really straight, for a correspondent for Good Morning America, that they should consider me. They hired me. I did exactly two reports. Only one of which ever made it to air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After those two reports, I pitched 20 stories in a row that got shot down. At the same time, my agent, James Dixon, who also represented Madeleine Smithberg, said, “You should meet with Madeleine. She’s doing this other show, and I bet that they would do those stories.” They had me on for a trial basis, and for the next nine months I worked at The Daily Show occasionally, during Craig Kilborn’s second year. But it was totally a day job. I never expected to stay, because I did sketch comedy and I wrote, and I really didn’t think that The Daily Show was going to go anyplace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The first bit Stephen did on the show after I arrived, I think it was something about baby-back ribs. You could just feel: “This guy knows how to perform in a scene, is present, has an ease with language.” The key then was “What do we do with that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: I don’t really know why Jon and I worked together so well. It’s hard to quantify, but it happened very early. When Jon first got there, he had a rough ride with some of the people who had worked with Craig. But I immediately knew he was a guy I should listen to. I saw how thoughtful he wanted to be about political comedy and how he invited us to have our own thoughts, invest the jokes with our own beliefs. And maybe he thought he could trust me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Changing the lineup of correspondents and contributors, the on-air faces of the show, was crucial, if less contentious. A. Whitney Brown and Brian Unger left when Kilborn did; Colbert, Rocca, Beth Littleford, Frank DeCaro, and Stacey Grenrock Woods stayed on. Stewart’s first correspondent addition was Vance DeGeneres. Then Colbert helped recruit another major talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I got a call from Stephen Colbert. He and I were on The Dana Carvey Show together in the spring of 1996, and one of the sketches that we did was called “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.” And Madeleine Smithberg, who had hired Stephen onto The Daily Show, saw that and asked who I was—asked Stephen—and then Stephen called me and said, “Would you be interested maybe in doing a field piece?” And then Madeleine called and followed up and asked if I’d do a field piece out here in Los Angeles. Nancy [Walls Carell] and I were living out here at the time, and I had a holding deal with ABC. So we were just watching a lot of the Game Show Network. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I REALLY DIDN’T THINK The Daily Show WAS GOING TO GO ANYPLACE,” SAYS COLBERT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We decided to stage the field piece right underneath the HOLLYWOOD sign, up in the Hills, and that I was going to do the walk-and-talk as I was essentially walking up the side of a mountain, and obviously play up the fact that I was really out of shape, that it was a very bad correspondent to have chosen for a walk-and-talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently Madeleine really liked that moment within the piece and thought that that was a good choice. They asked if I’d move out to New York and be a regular on The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one was really familiar with this show. My agent didn’t see it as a positive step in my career. Let’s put it that way. They just saw it as a little nothing cable show. A job, but nothing that was going to amount to much. Jon had just become the host about six months before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Carell, I knew very little about him. These guys didn’t come from stand-up. I knew stand-ups. I knew Dave Attell, I knew Lewis Black. I did not know Vance, Mo, Steve, Stephen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: So much of the writing of The Daily Show actually comes down to brainstorming and coming up with the big-picture ideas. Once we started realizing what an incredible tool Carell and Colbert were, we said we’ve got to bring more of that into the studio. Let’s not just see them once a week or once every two weeks in a field piece. Let’s get both those guys on the show several times a week in one form or another. They’re too talented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Stewart and his colleagues could not have known was that they had arrived at the perfect moment, with the media and political worlds on the cusp of upheaval. When Stewart first sat behind the fake anchor desk, the anchors of the real news were still a trio of white male eminences: Tom Brokaw at NBC, Peter Jennings at ABC, and Dan Rather at CBS. But the network news hegemony had been rattled by the arrival of CNN, and especially by its coverage of the 1990 Gulf War. Now Fox News and MSNBC—both launched, coincidentally, within months of The Daily Show’s 1996 debut—were rapidly expanding their footprints on cable systems. Soon the Internet would flatten the traditional TV news industry. And a wised-up, postmodern generation of viewers was hungry for what The Daily Show would soon deliver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The turn of the century was also a boom time for network newsmagazines. NBC was airing Dateline five nights a week. ABC had 20/20 and Primetime; CBS had 48 Hours. Syndicated shows including Inside Edition added an even cheesier, tabloid flair to the genre. The TV-newsmagazine formula—leaning heavily on sensationalized crime stories, breathless celebrity profiles, and consumer-product scares—was ripe for parody. As were the self-serious anchor-reporter stars of TV newsmagazines: the style of The Daily Show’s correspondents drew special inspiration from the overinflated gravitas of Dateline’s Stone Phillips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MADELEINE SMITHBERG: I always say that Stone Phillips deserves a “created by” credit for The Daily Show, because I was obsessed with the guy, and we studied him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RORY ALBANESE (production assistant, later executive producer, 1999-2013): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colbert will tell you his character for years was just Stone Phillips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Kilborn era, field-department pieces frequently featured obscure eccentrics—say, a man who pulled his own teeth and replaced them with driveway gravel. Those kinds of bits didn’t go away immediately under Stewart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KAHANE CORN COOPERMAN (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2015): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I produced a field piece, with Stacey Grenrock Woods as the correspondent, about a guy, Alexander P., who had been a rock star in Ukraine and came here and was now a waiter in a hotel restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This piece may well have been in the works before Jon arrived. But it airs, and after the show you have a postmortem. And Jon was not happy. He said, “Your targets are just wrong. They shouldn’t be people on the fringe. Our targets need to be the people who have a voice, and that’s politicians, and that’s the media.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STACEY GRENROCK WOODS (correspondent, 1998-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I heard Jon was very unhappy with that piece, and I don’t blame him at all. I didn’t like it, either, but it was given to me. I think it ended up being a policy-changing piece. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: The correspondents had their own little thing going on with the field pieces. Jon left it up to us in terms of what sort of characters we were developing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I saw my character as a former local-news anchor who had been demoted to reporting on a nondescript cable news show and was a little bitter about it. Everyone to a certain degree had different variations on blowhard or idiot reporter. But I mean, let’s face it—we didn’t know what we were doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2002): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: None of us are correspondents. None of us have backgrounds in journalism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL: Mo was pretty knowledgeable, actually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: There was a very specific way we were supposed to present ourselves when we set up field pieces: “I’m from The Daily Show.” “What’s The Daily Show?” “Well, it’s an alternative news-and-entertainment program.” “What channel is it on?” “Well, I don’t know what channel it is where you live. Where we live it’s Channel 29.” Anything other than saying the words “Comedy Central.” We were never allowed to lie, but let’s not advertise we were on Comedy Central, because not being a famous show was really useful to us in the early days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was the first correspondent to be sued. After a piece ran, a guy claimed I claimed I was from CNN. I never said that. But if you make a man comedically look like Hitler and it turns out that he is a retired lawyer with a lot of time on his hands, you’re going to get sued. That’s the lesson for today, children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: The field pieces with eccentrics and oddballs, those were uncomfortable. For all of us. I almost didn’t . . . I won’t say I almost didn’t do the show, but I had some major reservations about doing it for exactly that reason, because I didn’t like the idea of making fun of people only because they were eccentric or different, and . . . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL: Duping them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Yeah. Shooting fish in a barrel is easy. When you go after someone who is intolerant or racist or has any sort of hateful nature, that’s a different story. I think that’s fair game. So part of what I tried to do with my character is put the impetus on myself, the comedic impetus, that I was the bigger idiot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his first year as host Stewart devoted far more energy to retooling the staff and the process inside the building. But it was the field department, in a series of excursions to New Hampshire to “cover” the presidential primaries, that really began pointing The Daily Show’s tone and point of view in a new direction. Initially intimidated by the straight political media pack, correspondents Rocca, Walls Carell, DeGeneres, and Carell played jester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: When we went up to the first Republican debate we had our jackets with “The Daily Show” embroidered on them, and we’re walking around with microphones. It was terrifying because people didn’t know that we were fake. So we could get away with a lot of stuff. Bush looked at us like we were insane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN (wife of Senator John McCain): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of a sudden there were these guys in these crazy jackets, popping up at campaign events, and nobody knew who they were. But they were funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2005): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was a Republican debate in New Hampshire, so we were going to do a piece from the spin room. And the spin room even then was acknowledged as the least newsworthy event of all time. Our premise was that it’s essentially a parlor game, and if that’s the case, let’s really turn it into a parlor game. I had each of the correspondents asking questions from Trivial Pursuit to the candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: All of us were nervous as hell, and so I just went for it: “Senator McCain, who became the hottest pop star to come out of Iceland in the mid-1990s?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Immediately our other correspondents start yelling, “Don’t skirt the question, Senator! You have to answer!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: And McCain showed why he almost upended George W. Bush in that race, because he played along, making this silly face. I remember the CNN people looking at us like, “O.K., that was funny. But who are you guys?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: When we went up to New Hampshire we were under the mistaken assumption that we had to integrate ourselves with the political media’s process and become them to parody them. Turns out we didn’t have to do that. We had thought, Oh, you’re a political reporter on television, which must mean something. Turns out it doesn’t mean anything. All it means is that somebody pointed a camera at you and lit it. So that was a revelation, and not a positive one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in December 1999, came a breakthrough—a five-minute segment that pushed past the silly and into the satirical. Carell climbed onto McCain’s bus and changed the entire trajectory of The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Remember, McCain that year was a huge deal. He won the New Hampshire primary. That was really his moment. And his big gimmick was his bus, the Straight Talk Express. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was supervising in the field department. Our idea was that we were trying to get on the Straight Talk Express, but we couldn’t. There was a secondary press bus. If you’re in the rollover bus you just don’t feel like you matter. So the premise was going to be: if Steve Carell finally does get on the Straight Talk Express, that means we were at the table with all the big important players. To get on McCain’s bus was a coup for us; it meant that somebody was going to allow us to bring our reindeer games into a legitimate political moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN: The actual press bus, which was completely different from ours, was really awful, in fact. Steve Carell was talking about, did we feed the press, or did we just lock them in the bus? They were pleading with me—is there any way I can get them on the main bus? They were a hoot to be around, so John invited them on the Straight Talk Express. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: We needed to then have Carell basically ask one question that is going to get us kicked off. The idea was going to be we had a brief moment of glory, we asked a question, and then we lost our privileges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL:) [On board the Straight Talk Express, reading from a legal pad as McCain grins.] Let’s do a lightning round: your favorite book? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SENATOR JOHN McCAIN: For Whom the Bell Tolls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Favorite movie? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: Viva Zapata! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Charlton Heston? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: Marlon Brando. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Close enough. If I were a tree, I would be a . . . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: If I were a tree, I would be a root. [Pause.] What does that mean? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Senator, how do you reconcile the fact that you were one of the most vocal critics of pork-barrel politics and yet while you were chairman of the Commerce Committee that committee set a record for unauthorized appropriations? [Four seconds of silence that feel like four hours.] I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means! [McCain looks at ceiling, shrugs in relief, awkwardly slaps hand to his own face. Carell shuffles sheepishly down the bus stairs and out the door, then stands on a highway median.] Oh, they all laughed at my little question. But two things were abundantly clear. It was the wrong question to ask, and I was going to be walking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Carell and Nick McKinney, the producer, had pulled the question out of Time on the way there, driving to the shoot. Just the fact that Steve Carell can get those words out of his mouth and that it sounded like something a smart person would say really threw McCain off. There was such a delay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: It was really funny because all of McCain’s handlers . . . you could feel the whole bus tense up. I thought McCain might just laugh it off, or probably give me some sort of joke response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh shit, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting. It meets the standard of being funny; it meets the standard of being relevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JOHN McCAIN (U.S. senator, Arizona, 1987-; Republican presidential nominee, 2008): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was great. I still remember Steve Carell on the bus. I was certainly aware of Jon and the show early on, and knew they would try to have some fun with us. I wanted to be funny. I wanted these young people to know that I’m a guy with a sense of humor. I’m not some dull, dry, old senator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: That moment, it was the beauty and the weakness of The Daily Show. You had this incredibly pregnant moment where you forced a politician to go off-book, and it was uncomfortable, and it was honest. Then, because of our role as a comedy show, you have to take the air out of it, and it let McCain off the hook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Yeah, to press it—we really hadn’t set ourselves up in that context to start going after him. It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: That was the first time we were in The New York Times—in a news-analysis piece, not the TV column. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The real revelation for the show, covering the 2000 campaign, was that before everything that happens publicly in politics there’s a meeting—so what’s that meeting? That’s what’s interesting. It always struck me as “We’re always covering the wrong thing. We’re always covering the appearance, but we’re never covering that meeting.” When you watch that pack of cameras follow a presidential candidate, you go, “That’s not interesting. What’s interesting is to stand behind them and watch that,” because then you learn a little bit about the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s when the idea of deconstructing the process came to the fore of how we were going to make the show. Before, it was just . . . we were making jokes. Some of them were insightful; some of them were not. The show came to exist in the space between what they’re telling you in public and the meeting that they had where they decided to do it that way. Seeing that was the aha of “That’s the show.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN: I still have those jackets, by the way. I talked them out of their big New Hampshire jackets. They were around John so much, and I finally said, “Look, these jackets are too good. I’ve got to get one from you, please.” They gave them to me. It’s a great souvenir.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nTOKYO Exhausted engineers attached a power cable to the outside of Japan's tsunami-crippled nuclear plant on Saturday in a race to prevent deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as America's Three Mile Island incident in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan's unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake, tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets, prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the Asian nation its sternest test since World War Two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has also stirred unhappy memories of Japan's past nuclear nightmare -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Working inside a 20 km (12 miles) evacuation zone at Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,\" the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 1,480 meters (5,000 feet) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If that works it will be a turning point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,\" said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If not, there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Underlining authorities' desperation, fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THOUSANDS DEAD, MISSING AND SUFFERING NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 390,000 people, including many among Japan's aging population, are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everything is gone, including money,\" said Tsukasa Sato, a 74-year-old barber with a heart condition, as he warmed his hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,\" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'll probably come back in about a month.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. government said \"minuscule\" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan's damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,\" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,\" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan's Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week's stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,\" Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday.

But they couldn't be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior official with the U.N.'s nuclear safety agency said there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week's earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant's owner denying Jazcko's report Wednesday that Unit 4's spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,\" Yuichi Sato said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3's reactor and cooling pool. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unit 3's reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant's own electric cooling systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a first step toward recovery,\" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels \"have somewhat stabilized at their lows\" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,\" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: \"Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of the plant's six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. \"I understand that they've controlled the cooling of the cores,\" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan's measures were also prudent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. \"It's frustrating, because we don't have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,\" said the 48-year-old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel.\nPassage 3:\nSmoke billowed from a building at Japan's crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel at the tsunami-ravaged facility.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant's six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex's Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see it as an extremely serious accident,\" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. \"This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week's 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan's northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I feel a sense of dread,\" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. \"I'm not an expert, so it's difficult to understand what's going on. That makes it scarier.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,\" Edano said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure.

Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report.\nPassage 4:\nWhile the findings were reassuring in the short term, the United States declined to back away from its warning to Americans there to stay at least 50 miles from the plant, setting up a far larger perimeter than the Japanese government had established. American officials did not release specific radiation readings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant’s six reactors — including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets — showed few signs of working. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,” said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What you are seeing are desperate efforts — just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,” said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. “Right now this is more prayer than plan.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aircraft normally used to monitor North Korea’s nuclear weapons activities — a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes — were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week’s 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, “My heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.” He added, “Because of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant’s spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases.

Made for quick assessments of radiation emergencies, the Aerial Measuring System is an instrument system that fits on a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft to sample air and survey the land below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights “are consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of “approximately 50 miles” around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 — another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Private analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires — helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,” he said in an interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor’s spent fuel pool are also high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day.\n", "answers": ["Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete.

Smoke has been rising from the No. 2 reactor at the plant, and authorities aren’t sure of the cause—though it may be linked to the explosion there Tuesday, notes the AP.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown stands for a portrait in front of an artist portrayal of Planet Nine. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown is an astronomer at Caltech who's been instrumental in the discovery of more than 30 dwarf planets and asteroids at the far reaches of our solar system. Most members of the general public probably don't know about all of the planetoids he has found — but many know about the one planet he has killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Brown and his team discovered Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, it was initially referred to as our solar system's 10th planet. But that ended in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union voted to define \"planet\" officially for the first time. Eris was out of the running, and Pluto was a casualty — cut from the official planetary roll call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they've compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. We called Brown up to chat about the latest blow he has dealt to Pluto fans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This interview has been edited for length and clarity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington Post: How did you get into the planet finding (and planet killing) business? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown: So, planetary science is something I got into when I was in grad school. I went into astronomy anticipating studying some of the most distant galaxies, but I fell in love with this field because planetary science is just so much more concrete to me. I could actually go outside at night and see this thing I was studying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I can’t do that anymore! But it’s still much more visceral to me than some of the more abstract parts of astronomy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the reason why I particularly like these objects I study in the outer solar system is that they have grand importance for how our solar system came together, and how our planetary system formed, but it's also just as much about this journey of discovery. It’s exploration. For me, this is what we do as humans. We see our neighborhood out there and explore it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown points to the gold ring showing the orbital path of Planet Nine. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Tell us more about that \"grand importance.\" What can objects like Eris, Pluto and Planet Nine teach us about the origins of the solar system? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: The objects in the outer solar system have the unique property of not having been messed with very much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the planets on the inside of the solar system have been heated, smashed, had their orbits pushed around, and so on. But on the very edge, there’s just not as much out there to mess with things. The sunlight isn’t very hot, and they can preserve these very delicate records of what happened at the beginning of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Planet Nine is actually an example, and not one I ever thought we’d get. The fact that we can find another planet out there based on the very subtle gravitational influence it has is because everything is so pristine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers say they have evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system. Here's what they say they know about it. (Joel Achenbach,Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: When you discovered the dwarf planet Eris, at what point did you realize Pluto was in trouble? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: Oh, within 15 seconds. I was sitting — I'm actually sitting in the same chair right now — I was looking at data, and the only reason it took 15 seconds was that for the first 14 I was thinking, no, this can't be right; there's nothing this bright in the sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then I did a quick calculation to see how big this object was and — we didn't know exactly how big it was at the time, but it was clearly the size of Pluto or much bigger. Either this was going to be a new planet, or Pluto was in trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: A lot of people got excited when New Horizons found that Pluto is probably larger than Eris, for exactly that reason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: Eris is significantly more massive — 25 percent more massive. If you take Pluto and you add every single object in the asteroid belt to it, you get to the mass of Eris. Pluto is bigger by volume, but it's just puffed up with extra ice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: So size isn't really the thing to get hung up on? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: It's good for bragging rights, but it doesn't actually mean anything. They're both so much smaller than anything else we'd call a planet. In the end, it doesn't matter that Eris exists. Eris isn't the problem with Pluto. Pluto is the problem with Pluto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: What made you take on the title of \"Pluto Killer\" willingly? Any regrets? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: It all happened kind of accidentally back in the early days of Twitter. I thought, oh, I should try it, and I needed a name and just thought being Pluto Killer would be funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Laughing] Be careful what you use, because that's going to follow you forever. I can say it was not really a calculated statement at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Do the Pluto fans ever make it personal? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: I think that there are people who would still love for Pluto to be a planet, and they wish people who kept reminding them why it’s not would be quiet and go home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Personally, I think it actually matters. I think that for people understanding the solar system as it really is, that's really important. So I have not been willing to back down and give up, and there are certainly people who don't like that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: And now you haven't just killed Pluto, you're trying to replace it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: My daughter — she's still kind of mad about Pluto being demoted, even though she was barely born at that time — she suggested a few years ago that she'd forgive me if I found a new planet. So I guess I've been working on this for her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An artist's impression of Planet Nine, which could sit at the edge of our solar system. (Caltech/R. Hurt) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Speaking of Planet Nine, at what point can we actually say the planet has been \"discovered\"? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: In the end, discovery means it’s been seen. Someone has seen it, has seen it move, has seen the orbit. We think we know the orbit, but we don't know where on that orbit the planet is, and we haven't seen it yet. This paper we published is like handing everyone a treasure map. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's going to depend on the luck of the person who points the telescope in the right place first. It's going to take a lot of hard work, sure, but also a lot of luck. It might not be us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: But if you do get naming rights, what name are you going to propose for Planet Nine? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: This would only be the third planetary discovery in modern history [note: not counting Pluto!]. Naming it just seems too big for any one person. It just really seems like too big of a thing for the person who happens to have the luck of pointing the telescope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be a huge cultural moment. It shouldn't just be some guy saying, hey, I found it, so we're going to name it George. Which, by the way, is what William Herschel tried to do when he discovered Uranus. Unfortunately for him, we didn't stick with George.

Here's what they say they know about it. (Joel Achenbach,Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology announced Wednesday that they have found new evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it \"Planet Nine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their paper, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet's mass as five to 10 times that of the Earth. But the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, they have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. Those smaller bodies have orbits that appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet – a \"massive perturber.\" The astronomers suggest it might have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. If \"Planet Nine\" exists, it's big – about two to four times the diameter of the Earth, which would make it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. But at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Q&A: The ‘Pluto Killer’ who thinks he’s found the true ninth planet] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirmation of its existence would reconfigure the models of the solar system. Pluto, discovered in 1930, spent three-quarters of a century as the iconic ninth planet. Then, a decade ago, Pluto received a controversial demotion, in large part because of Brown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His observations of the outer solar system identified many small worlds there – some close to the size of Pluto – and prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet. The IAU voted to change Pluto's classification to \"dwarf planet,\" a decision mocked repeatedly last summer when NASA's New Horizons probe flew past Pluto and revealed a world with an atmosphere, weather and a volatile and dynamically reworked surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown, who tweets under the handle @plutokiller and who wrote the book \"How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,\" said now may be the time to rewrite the textbooks yet again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My daughter, she's still kind of mad about Pluto being demoted, even though she was barely born at that time,\" Brown said. \"She suggested a few years ago that she'd forgive me if I found a new planet. So I guess I've been working on this for her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Is there a Planet X, a ‘massive perturber,’ hidden beyond Pluto?] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, cautioned Wednesday that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. He referenced the famous dictum from Carl Sagan that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Sagan Rule applies. If it's there, find it. I challenge you. Somebody out there oughta find it,\" Green said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said he was personally excited about the new research: \"What an era we're in, where we’re discovering new things about our solar system that we never thought possible even a handful of years ago.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown and Batygin initially set out to prove that Planet Nine didn't exist. Their paper builds on earlier research by two other astronomers that revealed a peculiar clustering of the small, icy objects discovered in the past decade or so in the remote regions of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Nah, this possible new ninth planet isn’t Pluto] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2014, Scott Sheppard of the Washington-based Carnegie Institution of Science and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii published a paper in the journal Nature that discussed the potential existence of a giant planet affecting the orbits of those dwarf worlds. Sheppard and Trujillo noted a similarity in the motion of those bodies when they are closest to the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown said, explaining that extra planets are always the \"go-to suggestion\" when astronomers find orbital behavior they can't explain. But he and Batygin struggled to debunk that hypothetical ninth planet. They used mathematical equations and then computer models, ultimately concluding that the best explanation for the smaller objects' clustering was the gravitational effects of something far bigger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such clustering is similar to what's seen in some asteroids that are about as close to the sun as the Earth. They wind up in stable orbits that keep them far from Earth and free from any significant disturbance by the Earth's gravity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin stand for a portrait in front of an artist portrayal of Planet Nine at Caltech (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Until then, we didn't really believe our results ourselves. It just didn't make sense to us,\" Brown said. But their modeling showed that a planet with 10 times the mass of Earth would exert an influence over the orbits of the smaller bodies and keep them from coming as close to the sun as they should. It would also slowly twist these orbits by 90 degrees, making them periodically perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the back of my head, I had this nagging memory that someone had found some of these modulating objects and not known what to make of them,\" Brown said. \"And sure enough, these objects do exist. And they were exactly where our theory predicts they should be.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's when the Caltech researchers started to take Planet Nine seriously. \"That was the real jaw-dropping moment, when it went from a cute little idea to something that might be for real,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [NASA estimates 1 billion ‘Earths’ in our galaxy alone] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheppard, who co-wrote the paper that Brown and Batygin set out to disprove, says the existence of a hidden planet is still a big unknown. \"Until we actually see it for real, it will always be questionable as to whether it exists,\" he said, cautioning that the latest calculations are based on a relatively small number of known objects and that further observations and detections of perturbed bodies would bolster the hypothesis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Sheppard significantly upped the odds of discovery – from 40 percent before to 60 percent now. “Some people took it seriously, but a lot of people didn’t,\" he said of his own study's findings. \"With this new work, it’s much more rigorous, and people will take it more seriously now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown said he puts the odds of Planet Nine being real as \"maybe 90 percent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the Côte d'Azur Observatory in Nice, France, planetary scientist Alessandro Morbidelli agreed that the evidence was stronger this time. \"I immediately felt that this paper, for the first time, was providing convincing evidence for a new planet in the solar system,\" said Morbidelli, an expert in these kinds of orbital movements who was not involved in either study. \"I don't see any alternative explanation to that offered by Batygin and Brown.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will find it one day,\" he added. \"The question is when.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The past two decades have seen a burst of discoveries as astronomers have scrutinized the light of distant stars and looked for signs of orbiting planets. More than a thousand such planets have been detected through analysis of starlight that has traveled across the vast interstellar distances. Brown and Batygin, however, have been searching closer to home, looking for objects that orbit the sun and remain unseen only because the outer regions of the solar system are exceedingly dark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Scientists caught a new planet forming for the first time ever] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The thought of a hidden planet larger than Earth is intriguing, but for now it's difficult to say too much about the hypothetical conditions there. Brown believes it's probably an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas – a planet that could have been the core of a gas giant had it not been ejected into a wonky, highly elliptical orbit. It might not make its closest approach of the sun more than once every 10,000 years, and even then it would remain far beyond the known planets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit. That work led eventually to the discovery of Neptune. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be difficult to see the ninth planet if it's not at or near its closest approach to the sun. Brown doesn't believe the object is at that point, saying it would have been spotted by now. But he does think that the most powerful telescopes on the planet, if pointed in precisely the right direction, might be able to detect it even when it is most distant from the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've been looking for it for a while now, but the sky is pretty big,\" Brown said. \"We know its path, but not where it is on that path.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He and Batygin hope their paper's publication will infuse the search with new energy. \"If other people – better astronomers – get excited about the idea of finding Planet Nine, we could hopefully see it within a couple of years,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two know they may not get credit for that discovery. Until the planet is spotted directly with a telescope, any work surrounding it is theoretical. Brown, Batygin and other scientists who have made the case for Planet Nine's existence are providing treasure maps and clues – but someone else could very well strike gold before they do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If and when it's spotted, Planet Nine would be evaluated by the same criteria that got Pluto demoted. Brown isn't concerned about that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's not even a question -- it's definitely a planet,\" he said. One of the trickiest criteria for planet status, based on the standards set by the International Astronomical Union, is that a planet must \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone. It needs to have the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Planet Nine is forcing any objects that cross its orbit to push into these misaligned positions. It fits that concept perfectly,\" Brown said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"Pluto killer\" added: \"Not to mention the fact that it's 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 of 22 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 22 stunning photos of our solar system and beyond in 2016 View Photos A look at the best photos of space.

(AP) — Scientists say they finally have \"solid evidence\" for Planet X, a true ninth planet on the fringes of our solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gas giant is thought to be almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles beyond Neptune's path — distant enough to take 10,000 to 20,000 years to circle the sun.

They base their findings on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate its discovery via telescope within five years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two reported on their research Wednesday in the Astronomical Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once it's detected, the researchers insist there will be no Pluto-style planetary debate.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Dr Mike Brown of Caltech in Pasadena, who rejoices in the sobriquet of \"the man who killed Pluto\" told BBC News that those arguing for its reinstatement should stop living in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people you hear most talking about reinstatement are those who are involved in the (New Horizons) mission. It is emotionally difficult for them,\" he said.

Some argued that Pluto was simply the first resident of this outer Solar System region to be discovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the coup de grace was delivered by Prof Brown with his discovery of the dwarf planet Eris in January 2005. It was like Pluto but more massive.

It was a choice of one or the other - the status quo was not an option. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof Brown argues that had the IAU had decided to keep Pluto as a planet and enrol Eris, it would eventually find itself having to consider the candidacies of hundreds, possibly thousands of wannabe planets.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So how did Prof Brown feel the day he heard that Pluto had been demoted? Was it a moment of joy, or was he wracked with guilt? He told me he felt it was more like a cold-blooded mercy killing necessary for the good of science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It had been clear to me for some years that Pluto had been wrongly classified.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nDAMASCUS, Syria — Rifa was growing frantic. Her husband had called to say that he and her brother were stuck on their way home from work outside the Syrian capital, normally a 25-minute drive. There was fighting in a northern suburb, he said, and traffic was frozen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tensions rose as the hours passed. It is never good to be out after dark in Damascus now, especially trapped in a traffic jam, unable to flee. Finally, Rifa’s husband called again. They had escaped and returned to their workplace to pass the night, another concession to their changing world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR War has come to Damascus. Not on the scale of Aleppo or Homs, at least not yet. But the difference from just a few months ago is unmistakable. With sandbagged checkpoints every half-mile and soldiers methodically searching vehicles for weapons, simple movement is becoming impossible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Where is Damascus headed? Are we the next Aleppo?” Rifa asked a few days later. “How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is the center of Bashar al-Assad’s power, the stronghold he tried for months to shield from a popular uprising that has inexorably been transformed into a bloody civil war. As his troops battled insurgents all around the country, Mr. Assad was determined that here, at least, he would preserve an air of normalcy, of routine, of certainty that life would go on, as it had before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such illusions are no longer possible. The reality of war has crept into daily life, and there is a sense of inevitability. Even supporters of the government talk about what comes next, and rebels speak of tightening the noose around this city, their ultimate goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damascus was once known for its all-night party scene. Now, few people venture out after dark, and kidnappings are rampant. Gasoline is increasingly scarce, and as winter approaches, people are worried about shortages of food and heating oil. Streets are closed at a moment’s notice, traffic diverted, bridges shut down. Even longtime residents and taxi drivers get lost and have to weave in and out of parking lots to avoid barriers and dead-end streets. Shelling and machine-gun fire are so commonplace, children no longer react. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As recently as summer, while war raged in various neighborhoods surrounding the city, Damascus existed in a bubble of denial. War, people seemed to feel, was happening elsewhere — and the residents of Mr. Assad’s stronghold were determined to live their lives as if nothing had changed. There were garden parties and fashion shoots, and the Opera House hosted Italian tenors. There were elegant dinners at embassies — before the ambassadors fled, that is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as summer faded, the strangulation of Damascus began. More checkpoints appeared. The shabiha — Arabic for ghosts — progovernment paramilitary forces who are often held responsible for the most violent crimes, were defiantly visible in foreign hotels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, suicide bombings are more frequent, and the rebels of the Free Syrian Army say they are slowly establishing control of the suburbs that ring the city, with the aim of slowly strangling the government. Some families say they are taking their children out of school and teaching them at home, because the drive to school is too dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussions among friends are no longer “of the real world,” as one writer put it. Talk turns more naturally to the fate of the homeless in the city’s parks, or the traumatization of the children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People,” one woman said, “talk of death.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To a reporter based in Paris who has been granted three visas in recent months to report freely in the country, Damascus seems now like a city under siege, where for most people danger is a wearying companion — so much so that the last names of those interviewed for this article are being withheld for their protection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kidnapping of wealthy Syrians is on the rise, sowing fear in the city’s finest precincts. In Mezze, a politically and ethnically mixed neighborhood once known as the Beverly Hills of Damascus, people talk of the daughter of a local businessman who was kidnapped three weeks ago and ransomed for about $395,000. She was returned to her family, according to local residents, sexually abused, tortured and traumatized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents say the kidnappers are from either the Free Syrian Army or renegade offshoots of radical groups or are, in the government’s catchall phrase, “foreign terrorists.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One man, an Armenian Christian — “a minority within a minority,” he joked — said he was wary of laying blame on any one group.\nPassage 2:\nDow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ongoing battles between rebel and government forces are taking their toll on cities in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rumblings of discontent within Syria’s Alawite minority are presenting a new challenge to President Bashar al-Assad’s efforts to retain power in the face of an expanding armed rebellion, calling into question the loyalties even of his own sect in the conflict ravaging the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assad has increasingly come to rely on the 2.5 million-strong Alawite community for support as Syria’s Sunni majority has flocked to join the rebellion, sharpening the sectarian dimensions of an uprising that began as a largely spontaneous quest for greater freedoms inspired by the revolts sweeping the Arab world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alawites, in turn, have rallied behind Assad’s leadership, spurred by fears for their future in a Syria they would no longer run and in which Sunni Islamists may play a major role should the rebels win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now, from the Alawite heartland of Syria’s northern coastal region, come whispers of intrigue and strains within the Assad clan itself. A shootout between members of the extended Assad family in the president’s ancestral home town of Qardaha late last month and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist by the regime offer hints of unease within the one segment of the population whose unwavering support for Assad has hitherto not been in question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no indication that Alawites are on the verge of switching sides to join the fragmented and leaderless opposition, which has made little effort to welcome them. Indeed, many Alawites who initially welcomed demands for political reform fell silent long ago or lined up behind the Assad regime once the revolutionaries took up arms and Sunni extremists began to play a more prominent role, according to Alawite activists and residents of the Latakia region, where the minority community is concentrated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As members of an obscure and little-understood offshoot of Shiite Islam, the Alawites endured centuries of persecution under Sunni rule before Assad’s father, Hafez, seized power in 1970 and propelled them into the ranks of the elite. Many fear being relegated again to second-class status or, worse, being killed by Sunnis exacting revenge for the months of bloodshed inflicted by the ­Alawite-dominated security forces, Alawites say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The signs of tension within the community suggest at a minimum, however, that the pressures of the 19-month-old revolt are taking a toll on the cohesion of the Alawites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Alawites are critical for Assad’s survival. He wouldn’t survive a day without their complete support, so the fact that we are seeing tensions is significant,” said Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. “Most Alawites are upset with the regime, and they feel Assad is dragging their sect into a conflict they can’t eventually win.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shootout in Qardaha NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exactly what happened in Qardaha over the last weekend of September is unclear, and accounts differ over whether the dispute was rooted in political or personal rivalries. But all agree that there was an exchange of fire between two members of the Assad family in a cafe in the mountainous town where Hafez al- NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assad was born and where his body is buried in a vast marble tomb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the men, local strongman Mohammed al-Assad, pulled his gun after being insulted by another Assad relative, Sakher Osman, the accounts say. Both men were injured in the ensuing shootout, along with as many as six others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syria scholar Joshua Landis, who maintains close contact with the community through his Alawite wife, says the gun battle occurred only because Osman insulted Mohammed al-Assad, known locally as the “Sheik of the Mountain” for his role as the Assad family’s premier enforcer in the town. An e-mail from a relative in the area described how Bashar al-Assad intervened in the dispute, calmed tempers and restored order, said Landis, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohammed al-Saleh, an Alawite activist in Syria, said the fight was over the lucrative smuggling trade in cigarettes, weapons and other contraband that has thrived among the coastal Alawite clans under the Assad family rule. Attempts to read more into the incident are “nonsense,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But suspicions that the quarrel reflected deeper political differences within the community were fueled by the fact that the shootout took place in a cafe owned by the prominent al-Khayer family, a longtime rival of the Assads; that one of those injured was a Khayer; and that the fight came days after the arrest of a prominent member of the family and a veteran dissident, Abdul Aziz al-Khayer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Khayer was detained in Damascus upon his return from a trip to Russia and then China as a representative of the opposition National Coordination Board, the Damascus-based grouping that is tolerated by the regime for its relatively moderate stance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arrest came amid widespread speculation in the capital that Khayer was being groomed by Moscow for a potential role in a future government, according to a Damascus analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his safety. Activists who believe the gunfight signaled the emergence of a political split within the ruling Alawite clans say Osman was meeting with representatives of the Khayer family to mull a response to the arrest when Mohammed al-Assad strode into the cafe to break them up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The specter of a full-blooded Alawite feud seems remote, if only because the challenges to their survival are so immense that most Alawite clans understand they have to stick together, Landis said. A split within the ruling family would “be totally new, a paradigm shift” in the narrative of Syria’s revolt, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t believe it’s happening,” he said. “But it’s clear there’s a dynamic in Qardaha that is not in favor of Assad. There’s just so many tensions.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exploiting fears NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, assumptions of Alawite loyalty to the regime mask a far more complex reality in which traditional clan rivalries are becoming tangled in deep frustrations among the many members of the community who have misgivings about the direction in which Assad is leading them, according to Alawite residents of the coastal region and exiled activists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A steady stream of coffins arrives daily in Alawite loyalist villages, containing the bodies of Alawite men killed in the fight against the rebels. Women wearing black are a common sight on streets festooned with Assad’s portraits. The government has not released casualty figures for its security forces, but if the widely touted number of at least 10,000 Alawite deaths is true, it would mean that Alawite loyalists are dying at a greater rate than Sunnis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A story, perhaps apocryphal but told often enough to lend it an air of authenticity, goes that a mother, upon being presented with the body of her third and last son to die fighting the rebels, asked the officer: “Are you going to kill every one of us just so that one man may survive?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Complaints that Alawite fears are being exploited by the regime to protect Assad and his family are growing steadily louder as the death toll mounts, according to an Alawite doctor from Latakia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while on a trip to Beirut because he fears for his safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Assad is not representing the Alawites; he is using them,” he said. “If Alawites are prepared to die for Assad, it is because they fear for themselves, not because they love him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most impoverished Alawite communities benefited little from the ascent of the Assads, and they have historically formed an important component of the opposition to Assad’s rule, said an Alawite activist in Latakia who spent a decade in jail in the 1990s and did not want to be identified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they were heavily recruited into the security services, and they have since been propelled onto the front lines as the accelerating defections of Sunni soldiers call into question the reliability of Sunni units, military experts say. The army is also increasingly relying on groups of armed irregulars known as the shabiha, drawn mostly from the Alawite community, and has been organizing them into local militias. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sunnis also serve in the shabiha in predominantly Sunni parts of the country such as Aleppo, Daraa and Deir al-Zour, confounding simple interpretations of the conflict as sectarian, Alawite and Sunni activists note. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the large-scale massacres of civilians known to have taken place, such as those in the villages of Houla and Qubair this summer, were blamed on Alawite shabiha, however. And though there have not been any recorded retaliatory massacres of Alawite civilians by the rebels, “the danger of widespread sectarian reprisals . . . is frighteningly real,” the International Crisis Group said in a recent report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those fears, above all, are likely to continue to bind Alawites to Assad in what they have come to see as a fight for their survival, said Khashan, the professor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He has left them with no option but to stay with him,” Khashan said. “He has succeeded in linking the fate of the Alawites to the fate of the regime.”\nPassage 4:\nIn this Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2012 photo, citizen journalism image provided by Edlib News Network, ENN, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, the dead body of Syrian...

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syria's wealthy, long cultivated by President Bashar Assad as a support for his regime, are seeing their businesses pummeled by the bloody civil war. Factories have been burned down or damaged in fighting. International sanctions restrict their finances. Some warn that their companies are in danger of going under, worsening the country's buckling economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assad may not have lost the backing of Syria's business elite, but some are losing faith. Many of those who can have fled abroad, hoping to ride out the turmoil, which is now in its 19th month and is only getting worse as rebels and regime forces tear apart the country in their fight for power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several businessmen interviewed by The Associated Press say resentment is growing against Assad over the crisis _ but they also aren't throwing their lot in with the rebellion. They are hunkering down, trying to salvage their companies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One young businessman said his family factory in the suburbs of Damascus was damaged Wednesday, with windows blown out and part of the ceiling was destroyed when warplanes hit rebels in a neighboring building. Its several hundred employees had to hide in the basement until fighting eased enough that they could be bused out to safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I feel that they are both just as bad as each other,\" he said of the rebels and the government. \"I could have died today because they (the rebels) were across the street from us and they (the planes) could have bombed us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syria's economy has been heavily hurt by the conflict, which activists say has left more than 30,000 dead. Inflation has risen to at least 36 percent. The currency has dropped around 50 percent, now trading at 75 pounds to the dollar on the black market, according to the factory owner. The government estimates economic losses at $34 billion _ almost half the gross domestic product _ though the opposition puts the losses at nearly three times that amount. Fuel shortages have become widespread as the regime burns through hard currency to import diesel and oil at the same time that it finances the war effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the economic blow has been hard, \"we are not at the stage that the rug has been pulled from under the regime,\" said Anthony Skinner, head of Middle East and North African division at Maplecroft political risk consultancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assad has so far been able to keep his head above water with financial support from top ally Iran, he noted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The question is whether this is sustainable in the longer term and I don't think it is,\" Skinner said. \"What Assad is counting on at present is a bare-bones economy that is able to fuel his armed forces.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The businessmen interviewed by AP spoke on condition they remain anonymous and that some identifying details of their industries not be specified for fear of repercussions for talking about the situation in Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They all come from the country's Sunni Muslim elite, which Assad ensured prospered as he carried out free market reforms over the past decade. The reforms transformed the long isolated nation, bringing in foreign businesses and chains and greater consumer goods, though it also sharply increased the gap between rich and poor. While the rebellion has largely been fueled by the Sunni majority, the elite have stuck by Assad for most of the conflict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The businessmen say they are caught in the middle _ both of the fighting and of Western sanctions they say hurt them more than the regime itself. The civil war has made it difficult to distribute goods since roads are cut off, warehouses have been shut down and 24-hour operations have been slashed to eight hours in places where it is too risky for employees to travel at night. Numerous factories have had to close or reduce production. A pharmaceutical company in Aleppo was also recently burned down in the city's fighting, said a businessman with close ties to the owners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The owner of a plastics factory said his wife and children fled to London three months ago when the worst fighting yet hit the capital Damascus. Initially, he stayed behind but eventually followed them to London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He knows others who have left and now have little access to their local accounts and are unable to operate their businesses. That has fueled resentment of Assad, he said. Still, there is also a fear of what may happen to Syria if his regime collapses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We feel this is a war by proxy,\" he said, referring to the influence of Shiite Iran, Russia and China backing Assad and Sunni Gulf states, France and the United States behind the opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If businesses fail, he warned, the new unemployed could further fuel the conflict. Already, 12 of his employees quit to work as \"security\" for the government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know what that means. They are Shabiha,\" he said, referring to the pro-Assad gunmen used in fighting against rebels and accused of killings of civilians. He said he paid the employees $200 a month, but the government pays Shabiha at least $300. \"If I stop paying salaries to 400 people they will make a choice,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A physician who is among 14 owners of a hospital in Syria said only seven of his partners remain in the country. He is now in London while his wife and child are in California. He says most of his friends have also gone abroad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nobody is happy. I am seeking opportunities around the world. I'm homeless now with no hospital, no income,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The civil war means patients do not have the money to pay for needed surgeries and those traveling from outside Damascus are unable to reach the capital because roads are unsafe. Locally-made drugs are difficult to find due to shortages or distribution problems. Importing high-end machines and spare parts is difficult because even if selling the technology is not necessarily banned by sanctions, banks are reluctant to finance the purchases. He also cannot wire his money in Syria to the U.S., he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He makes clear his unhappiness with Assad. \"By the first speech of his excellency I knew he was an idiot,\" he said, referring to an Assad speech to parliament after protests broke out last year in which he took a tough line against the dissent. \"If this is his way of thinking, I knew things would get worse.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States and its European partners have stepped up sanctions already in place before the uprising began in March 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the most damaging is the European Union's halt on importing Syrian crude oil, which has cost the country billions of dollars. The EU has also banned its member-states from exporting to Syria weapons, dual-use equipment, luxury goods such as vehicles and jewelry. It froze the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, as well as those of more than 50 other Syrian entities and more than 150 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also bars EU banks from establishing new joint ventures or correspondent banking relationships with Syrian banks, and while \"legitimate trade\" can continue, it is under \"strict conditions.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. has also frozen assets of the Syrian government and a list of people and entities linked to the regime. It has banned Syrian oil imports and bars U.S. citizens from investing in Syria and exporting any services or supplies to Syria. Arab nations, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia also have separate sets of restrictions for doing business with Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sanctions also have an indirect effect. European and other banks are reluctant to deal with Syrian businesses for fear of running afoul of sanctions. Transfers from Syrian banks _ particularly in dollars _ are difficult and sometimes impossible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Most of the banks we deal with say we do not want to do business in Syria,\" said the plastics factory owner. He said his company's cash flow is under strain. A customer in Italy, for example, could not send him a payment because the European bank banned the transfer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The businessman whose factory was damaged Wednesday said a European bank also refused to back his purchase of spare parts from China. So he had to pull cash from his accounts in Lebanon and Turkey. Many have had to rely on relatives with foreign passports to open overseas accounts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People are either changing dollars into euros or putting it in bags smuggled across the border,\" he added. \"It's just pushing people's buttons. No sanctions have ever hurt any government.\"\n", "answers": ["This could change things: Some Syrian rebels now have antiaircraft missiles, rebels and regional officials say. Video footage appears to show the rebels using such weapons, which have been smuggled into the country, the Wall Street Journal reports. Rebels say they downed a military helicopter yesterday, one of at least four aircraft reportedly shot down this week—if true, that's a quicker pace since the summer, although it's not clear how the copters and jets were brought down. Despite the fact that this could be good news for the rebels, it's bad news for the US, which worries such weapons could end up with anti-Western militias. More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA Nasa spacecraft that will hurtle past Pluto on Tuesday at more than 45,000 kilometres per hour has revealed the dwarf planet to be larger than scientists thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fresh measurements from New Horizons, the first spacecraft to reach Pluto on the outer edge of the solar system, show that it is 2,370 kilometres across, roughly two-thirds the size of Earth’s moon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alan Stern, the lead scientist on the $700m (£450m) mission, said the increased dimensions meant Pluto must hold more ice and less rock beneath its surface than researchers had expected. Pluto has been hard to measure with any accuracy from Earth because it is so far away, and its atmosphere creates mirages that can fool ground-based telescopes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other instruments onboard New Horizons confirmed that Pluto’s north pole bears an icy cap. The latest measurements beamed to Earth from the probe picked up chemical signatures of methane and nitrogen ice in the polar cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One early image received from New Horizons last week showed Pluto as an orangey globe bearing a large bright spot shaped like a heart. More recent images have revealed cliffs, craters and chasms larger than the Grand Canyon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The science we’ve already made is mouth-watering,” said Stern. “The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons will perform its historic flyby at 12.49pm BST on Tuesday. But scientists must wait until 2am BST on Wednesday for the probe to make contact with Earth and confirm it has survived the encounter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most dangerous hazards for New Horizons are dust particles trapped in orbit around Pluto after being dislodged from its moons by meteorite impacts. A strike from a dust particle the size of a grain of rice could destroy the spacecraft, but the risk of such a disaster is low, at around one in 10,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Horizons spacecraft has spent more than nine years on its 4.8bn kilometre journey to Pluto, the last world in the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft. On board are seven sophisticated instruments and the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the probe blasted off in January 2006, Pluto was the ninth planet in the solar system. Seven months later, astronomers at the International Astronomical Union voted to downgrade the icy body to a dwarf planet, because it does not dominate its region of space in the way the other major planets do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, Charon, Hydra, Nix, STyx and Kerberos. The images will give the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world, and its tenuous atmosphere seen as the sun rises and sets behind it. Instruments on New Horizons might even find evidence that it snows on the tiny world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nasa officials expect the first images from the flyby to be released on Wednesday night. The snapshots from onboard cameras will capture details up to 100 metres across, a vast improvement on those taken on approach, which pick out features about 15 kilometres across. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But scientists are in for a long wait to learn everything New Horizons sees. The probe will collect so much information as it passes Pluto that it will take 16 months to send it all back to Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mission marks the end of the US space agency’s bid to explore every planet in the solar system, starting with Venus in 1962. Tuesday’s flyby coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first ever fly-by of Mars by the Mariner 4 probe.\nPassage 2:\nAn illustration of the New Horizons spacecraft as it approaches Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nine and a half years after it launched into space, a NASA probe is set to become the first spacecraft to fly by the dwarf planet Pluto. The New Horizons spacecraft is expected to make its closest approach tomorrow (July 14) at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT), coming within 7,800 miles (12,500 kilometers) of Pluto's surface. But even 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion km) away, the historic mission could help scientists learn more about planet Earth. This is because studying other objects in the solar system can provide clues about Earth's history. Here are five things researchers can learn about Earth by studying the dwarf planet Pluto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How Earth formed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earth and the other planets in this solar system were likely born after a bunch of smaller objects smashed into each other. In fact, early in Earth's history, a Mars-sized object nearly annihilated the planet, according to NASA.The resulting pieces of debris eventually coalesced into the moon we see today. [Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Artist's impression of a planetary system being formed. Credit: NASA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roughly 4 billion years ago, the inner solar system was a billiard zone, partly because Jupiter's strong gravity served as a slingshot that sent asteroids and comets hurtling toward the sun. In the region of space where Pluto is found, called the Kuiper Belt, icy and rocky objects had a relatively tranquil environment. This means that observing Pluto (and similar objects in the Kuiper Belt) offers hints about what the solar system looked like early in its history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where Earth's water came from NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, scientists discovered that water from comets may not have seeded Earth with life-building molecules, as had previously been thought. Observations from the European Rosetta spacecraft showed a different type of water on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The molecules of water (specifically, the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio) were different from the molecules found on Earth, according to a study published in the journal Science in December 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are many objects in the solar system that are icy, including moons, dwarf planets and even parts of the planet Mars. It's possible that there is ice on Pluto as well, scientists have said. Examining the ice on the dwarf planet could help researchers refine theories about how water spread through the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How life began on Earth NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life on Earth is full of carbon. This is why the potential discovery of organics (carbon-based molecules) in other parts of the solar system is such an exciting prospect. While not every organic chemical originated from something living, they are considered the building blocks of life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are there organics even on icy, hostile Pluto? There are some reasons to think there may be, given that organics have been found in similarly life-unfriendly environments such as Mercury and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Finding organic material — or even not finding them — could give scientists a better idea of how life first arose on Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earth's atmospheric structure NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earth's atmosphere, as seen from high above the surface. Credit: NASA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pluto has something of a bizarre atmosphere. The dwarf planet's gravity is so low that its tenuous atmosphere extends much higher than Earth's atmosphere does. Some scientists think the dwarf planet's atmosphere collapses onto the surface when Pluto is colder. Because Pluto's orbit is taking it closer to the sun right now, gases in the atmosphere are heating up and expanding. [5 Strange Facts About Pluto] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By studying the atmospheres of other worlds, astronomers can learn more about how these same processes work on Earth. For example, Venus has a hothouse surface driven by a runaway greenhouse effect. Measurements of Venus' superhot, hellish atmosphere have helped scientists better understand global warming on Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How the sun affects Earth NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life on Earth wouldn't survive for long without the sun. Most of the heat on Earth comes from its closest stellar neighbor. The sun even has effects high in the atmosphere, such as when solar flares belch gas (called coronal mass ejections) toward Earth and \"excite\" molecules in its atmosphere, causing stunning auroras (also known as the northern and southern lights). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While auroras are benign, the sun's radiation can also zap power lines or satellites during so-called geomagnetic storms. Scientists are interested in seeing how the sun interacts with atmospheres throughout the solar system, including at Pluto. These observations will help researchers better predict the effects of intense solar activity, ranging from what happens after a solar flare to how the sun affects Earth's climate.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe is set to hurtle past the dwarf world on Tuesday, grabbing a mass of pictures and other science data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Controllers got a last health status report, before the robotic craft turned its antenna away from the Earth to concentrate on its target. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only when New Horizons has its trove of images safely in its onboard memory will it call home again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is not expected to happen until just after midnight (GMT) into Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It means there will be a long, anxious wait for everyone connected with the mission, as they hold out for a signal that will be coming from almost five billion km away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons' flyby of 2,370km-wide Pluto is a key moment in the history of space exploration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its successful execution will complete the initial reconnaissance of the \"classical\" nine planets in our Solar System. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will mark the fact that every body in that system - from Mercury through to Pluto - will have been visited at least once by a space probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright NASA Image caption The robotic probe turns its antenna away from Earth during the flyby NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons has been returning a steady stream of information on approach to the dwarf world in recent days, but this will be as nothing compared to the huge number of observations it plans to acquire when passing just 12,500km from the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is timed to occur at 11:50 GMT (12:50 BST). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe will investigate not only Pluto but also its five moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To achieve that, it must perform a furious set of manoeuvres as it points every which way in the sky to get the images and other types of data it needs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" New Horizons' principal investigator, Alan Stern, told BBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just getting the probe in position to make the flyby has been a monumental feat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the observations are all run on an automated command sequence, New Horizons must fly a perfect path past Pluto, and with perfect timing - otherwise its cameras will shoot empty sky where the dwarf or its moons are expected to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This has necessitated aiming New Horizons at a \"keyhole\" in space just 100km by 150km (60miles by 90 miles), and arriving at that location within a set margin of 100 seconds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All this has been achieved after a multi-billion-km flight across the Solar System lasting nine and a half years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mission team will not celebrate until New Horizons contacts Earth again, which should happen at 00:53 GMT Wednesday (01:53 BST). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This communication will contain only engineering information on the status of the probe, but controllers should be able to tell very quickly whether the flyby sequence worked properly or not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first high-resolution pictures from the pass should be downlinked later on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a very small possibility that New Horizons could be lost as it flies through the Pluto system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any stray icy debris would be lethal if it collides with the spacecraft at its 14km/s velocity (31,000mph). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As an insurance policy, the mission team therefore downlinked one last set of data from all seven of the probe's instruments on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This included a final full-frame picture of Pluto before the approaching dwarf filled the entire field of view. This image is expected to be released by Nasa on its website at the moment of closest approach on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Media caption Prof Alan Stern says Pluto is \"a little larger than anticipated\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the New Horizons team announced a new, more precise measurement of Pluto's diameter at 2,370km. The probe sees the girth of Charon to be very similar to earlier estimates, at 1,208km. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nix is estimated to be about 35km across, and Hydra about 45km in diameter. Kerberos and Hydra are a lot smaller, but New Horizons has not yet been able to make a good determination of their size. This will come from the flyby data.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This July 11, 2015, image provided by NASA shows Pluto from the New Horizons spacecraft. On Tuesday, July 14, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will come closest to Pluto. New Horizons has traveled 3 billion... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's the final destination on NASA's planetary tour of the solar system, which began more than a half-century ago. Pluto was still a full-fledged planet when New Horizons rocketed away in 2006, only to become demoted to dwarf status later that year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 3 billion-mile journey from Cape Canaveral, Florida, culminates Tuesday at 7:49 a.m. EDT. That's when the spacecraft is due to fly past Pluto at 31,000 mph. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Horizons team gathered at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, won't know for many hours if everything went well. The spacecraft will be too busy taking photographs and collecting information to \"phone home.\" A confirmation signal is expected at around 9 p.m. EDT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons has already beamed back the best-ever images of Pluto and big moon Charon. Pluto also has four little moons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness, its alien beauty,\" principal scientist Alan Stern told reporters Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discovered in 1930, Pluto is the largest object in the so-called Kuiper Belt, considered the third zone of the solar system after the inner rocky planets and outer gaseous ones. This unknown territory is a shooting gallery of comets and other small bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An extension of the $720 million mission, not yet approved, could have New Horizons flying past another much smaller Kuiper Belt object, before departing the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Online: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/\nPassage 5:\nAhead of Tuesday's historic flyby, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that 'is a gift for the ages.' Among the discoveries: Pluto is bigger than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will Macy's become the next store to drop the Ivanka Trump brand? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the eve of NASA's historic flyby of Pluto, scientists and tourists at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona are excited about the images and discoveries the New Horizons' spacecraft will beam back to Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's New Horizons mission to the Pluto-Charon system has yet to mark its finest hours – a historic flyby that makes its closest approach to the binary planet and its moons Tuesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even as the spacecraft puts the wraps on its final approach, data New Horizons has delivered within the past 48 hours \"is a gift for the ages,\" says Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and the mission's principal investigator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The craft's approach is revealing \"tremendous diversity between the two planets in the system and their moons,\" he said. \"We're already seeing complex and nuanced surfaces that tell us of history for these two bodies that is probably beyond our wildest dreams.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, \"the Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and alien beauty,\" Dr. Stern said during a briefing Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How alien? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's as though \"we're on the bridge of the Enterprise approaching some alien planet around Alpha Centauri 3 or whatever it is,\" said Paul Schenk, a planetary geologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston and a member of the New Horizons science team. \"It's like someone painted it for a 'Star Trek' episode.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even seemingly mundane measurements, such as a new, more-accurate determination of Pluto's size – now pegged at 1,473 miles across, at the high end of estimates that have ranged from 1,429 miles to around 1,491 miles – carry import. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new size, combined with long-established, precise measurements of Pluto's mass, yields a dwarf planet a bit less dense than previously estimated. That means its interior contains more ice, versus rock, than previously estimated. This change has implications – yet to be worked out – for the process that formed the binary-planet system as well as for the chemistry of the disk of dust, gas, and ice that encircled the sun and provided the building blocks for the planets ad their moons, Stern explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bragging rights also come into play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The new measurement unambiguously settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper Belt,\" Stern said, referring to a region of the solar system extending more than 2 billion miles beyond Neptune. By some estimates, the region hosts trillions of comets as well as several hundred thousand objects larger than 60 miles across. It's also the region that gave birth to Pluto and the object that would collide with it to form Charon. Another Kuiper Belt inhabitant, Eris, had previously laid claim to the \"largest\" label at 1,445 miles across. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A larger Pluto also means that the lower layer of the atmosphere is shallower than previously thought, which will affect models that try to shed light on the atmosphere's structure and behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another early result involves nitrogen escaping from Pluto's tenuous atmosphere. New Horizons' instruments began to pick up the great escape five days ago, when the craft supposedly was too far away to see it, Stern said. It could mean that the nitrogen is fleeing the planet at a higher rate than models have suggested or that the mechanism responsible for triggering the loss is different than researchers have anticipated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, incoming data show that a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto is in fact an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons also is revealing features on Pluto that are generating speculation, pending more detail from measurements taken at the closest approach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For instance, images of Pluto released over the weekend show a surface that in many places hosted vast expanses of small, tightly packed dimple-like formations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The features appear to be similar to those on Neptune's moon Triton, Dr. Schenk said. Triton – itself thought to be a Kuiper Belt object that Neptune captured – hosts a surface \"that looks like a boiling pot of porridge, with cells of material popping up. They create a cellular pattern that looks like the skin of a cantaloupe.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There, researchers suspect that relatively buoyant rock or ice has risen from deeper in the crust to build the array of hills and depressions – similar in principle to salt domes that rise through surrounding rock to form low hills in southern Louisiana or southeastern Texas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The science team hopes to get a closer look at some of these dimpled regions in images New Horizons takes during its closest approach Tuesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, images so far show a relatively smooth surface over much of Pluto, suggesting that the surface could be relatively young, Schenk said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again, he cites Triton as a possible analog. The relative smoothness of much of Triton's surface suggests that it's less than 100 million years old. \"On Triton, everything is very young,\" Schenk said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It speaks to Triton as a captured Kuiper Belt object whose orbit around Neptune initially would have been elliptical, but over time became circular. The change in orbit would have heated Triton significantly, allowing fresh material to well up from depth and repave the surface, erasing any evidence of impact craters that would have accumulated over time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Pluto, \"we're not seeing any large craters that would pop out and say: There's a big basin here,\" he says. \"So we're beginning to think that maybe that it's a very young surface.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The source of internal heating required to provide material for repaving Pluto is unclear, Schenk acknowledges. Perhaps heat left over from the impact that formed Charon remained intense enough long enough to provide sources of fresh material for resurfacing Pluto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We still don't know,\" he says. \"But we'll find that out.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Correction: This article has been updated to correct the new measurements of Pluto's diameter.]\nPassage 6:\nPluto is pictured from a million miles away in this July 11, 2015 handout image from New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SYDNEY A space tracking station surrounded by cows in an Australian valley will on Tuesday become the first place in the world to get close-up images of Pluto, the most distant planetary body ever explored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After nine-and-half years of traveling 5.3 billion km (3.3 billion miles), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s spacecraft New Horizons will get within 12,500 km (7,800 miles) of Pluto on Tuesday evening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spacecraft has been sent specifically to take pictures of Pluto, a part of the solar system that has been in deep freeze for billions of years. The data will be relayed back to the tracking station at Canberra's Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's very exciting because we have never ever visited Pluto, either by robots or man missions because it is so far away,\" CDSCC Director Ed Kruzins told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Up to now, little has been known about Pluto, the most distant planetary body in the solar system and the last to be explored by NASA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 and is thought to contain important clues about the origins of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" Kruzins said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, is due to send a message that will be received by the Australian tracking station on Wednesday - a key message that will determine if the mission has been a success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each piece of data will then take about four-and-half hours to transmit, with the full dataset taking about 15 months to complete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons will travel at 58,000 km (36,039 miles) per hour past Pluto, Kruzins said, which could pose a problem if there is any space debris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even a grain of sand would cause significant damage to the vehicle, it would be like being hit by a brick at 70 kilometers per hour,\" Kruzins said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tracking station, 35 km (20 miles) from the capital of Canberra, is part of NASA's Deep Space network and is one of only three tracking stations in the world.

Until now, Pluto’s face has remained hidden because it's so far away. To really see it as more than a blurry blob, we needed to go there. (Learn more about the historic mission to Pluto on the National Geographic Channel.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But getting to the icy world is no easy feat. By the time New Horizons reaches Pluto at 7:50 a.m. EDT Tuesday, it will have traveled roughly 3 billion miles for a single, fleeting chance to fly past the dwarf planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Launched in 2006, New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft to ever leave Earth. It crossed the orbit of Jupiter the next year and has been traveling nearly a million miles a day —but it still took 9.5 years for the spacecraft to reach Pluto and its moons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View Images On Saturday, New Horizons got one of its last looks at this side of Pluto, which faces its moon Charon. Captured from a distance of 2.5 million miles from Pluto, the photo shows mysterious geometric features above the equator, along with sinewy dark splotches. Photograph by NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, New Horizons is going so fast—more than 30,000 miles per hour—that the spacecraft will pass by Pluto in just three minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The entire close encounter lasts for hours, though, with New Horizons making hundreds of observations of Pluto and its five bizarre moons . The first of the highest-resolution images will be released Wednesday afternoon, and the rest of the data will trickle in over the next 16 months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While waiting for the flyby at New Horizons mission headquarters, space writer Nadia Drake answers some of the biggest questions about Tuesday's event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Why a flyby? Why not slow down or orbit Pluto? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simply put, slowing down and orbiting Pluto is nearly impossible if you want to get there in a reasonable amount of time. The planet’s gravity is so weak that a spacecraft pulling into orbit would need to be going really slowly. For New Horizons to slow down enough, it would have to carry enough fuel to fire its brakes and reverse all its forward momentum—that’s about as much fuel as was used to launch the spacecraft and get it zooming along in the first place. Launching all that propellent, plus the spacecraft, is pretty much impossible . (Read about chasing Pluto's shadow ).

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though they’re far away, those distant, glittering galaxies are really big and bright, which is why telescopes like Hubble can see them. But Pluto is too small and dim for even our sharpest Earth-based eyes to get a good look at: It's only about two-thirds as wide as Earth’s moon. Even dwarf planet Ceres, which lives much closer to Earth, is too small to be anything but a blurry blob in Hubble pictures. (Learn more about Pluto's first close-up ). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. What's the biggest thing that could go wrong? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It could be disastrous for the spacecraft to run into a dust particle as it flies through the Pluto system. Because the spacecraft is going so fast, colliding with something the size of a rice pellet could be catastrophic. So, the team has spent the last few weeks intensively surveying the system for anything that might be shedding dust and debris in the spacecraft’s path, and so far have found nothing to be concerned about. (Learn what happened when the spacecraft went silent ). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. What will the pictures of Pluto look like? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The images coming back from New Horizons are already by far the best ever taken of the dwarf planet, even though the latest image, on July 12, was taken from about a million miles away. Tuesday’s encounter will produce close-up, detailed images of Pluto and Charon, plus some images of the smaller moons. (Also see \" Three Possible Plutos \"). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the side of Pluto that the spacecraft will be able to see, features as small as the lakes in New York City’s Central Park will be visible. But that’s not all: After New Horizons zooms by Pluto, it will swivel around and take a look at the planet’s south pole, which we haven’t seen yet. (Check out the weirdest feature I'd like to see on Pluto ). Facing away from the sun, that pole is in the dark, except for the soft glow of sunlight reflected off Charon. In other words, New Horizons will give us a glimpse of Pluto’s wintry pole, in Charon's moonlight. (Also see: \" Proposed Names for Pluto System's Features Include Kirk and Spock \"). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. How long does it take to send a photo of Pluto to Earth? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radio signals traveling at the speed of light take 4.5 hours to travel between Pluto and Earth. So, data received from New Horizons will have been on the road for about as long as it takes to drive between San Francisco and Santa Barbara. Because of that, it will take about 16 months for all of New Horizons’ flyby data to make it to Earth—meaning that new discoveries will be trickling in through the end of 2016.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Horizons will take a good, detailed look at Pluto and its large moon Charon (in fact, Charon is so large it forms a binary system with Pluto). Scientists are curious about Pluto’s terrains and composition, whether there’s evidence for geologic activity, and what the planet’s thin, nitrogen atmosphere is doing. They’ll also be looking for clues to how the Pluto system formed and evolved—and many of those clues might lie in the features of the four small moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx . (Check out Pluto's possible polar cap ). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7. What will New Horizons do after it passes Pluto? How long can it keep going? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After New Horizons passes Pluto, it will continue sailing on into the Kuiper Belt, which is a vast, icy debris ring outside the orbit of Neptune. If NASA approves it, New Horizons will sail past and study another icy world within the next five years. The spacecraft carries enough fuel for that encounter (it’ll use the propellent to adjust its course), and will still be able to send data back to Earth, even though that body is nearly a billion miles farther out. Ultimately, it will continue heading out of the solar system, much as NASA’s Voyager I and II spacecraft are doing. (Learn more about New Horizon's Mission ). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8. Is this our only chance, or will any other spacecraft be going to Pluto? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no plans at this point to send another spacecraft to Pluto, but it sure would be nice to learn even more about that enigmatic little world and its cousins on the fringe of the observable solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9. Is it carrying a message for aliens? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not yet. There is a project, called the One Earth Message, that aims to upload a digital message to the spacecraft once it’s done collecting data and sending it all to Earth. That could be years from now, if New Horizons flies by another body in the Kuiper Belt. The message would be something like a new version of the Voyager Golden Record , which carried the sights and sounds of Planet Earth into the cosmos aboard the Voyager I and II spacecraft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10. What did New Horizons do during the nine years it took to get to Pluto? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It spent a lot of that time hibernating, but did occasionally wake up for system tests. And, of course, it woke up to take a look at Jupiter as it flew by the giant planet in 2007. No sense missing out on that view! Later, when it crossed Neptune’s orbit in 2014, New Horizons woke up again to snap a picture of the icy blue giant—but Neptune was so far away it looked like a faint dot.

According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n(CNN) The sounds recorded on one of the \"black boxes\" recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 firms up investigators' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For God's sake, open the door!\" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency is \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere \"voyeurism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz tells him he can go anytime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of Flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains, French authorities have said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flight took off 20 minutes late. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once that's finished, Lubitz again tells the captain he \"can go anytime.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next comes the banging. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says \"Terrain -- pull up!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Open the damn door!\" the pilot says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's 10:38, and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Screams can be heard one final time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Unbelievable' leak NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What authorities know NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues 00:10 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official also said that the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anxiety, burnout and depression NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic, according to the Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'This is a man whose life is totally broken' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as \"a man in deep distress.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,\" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,\" Bartolini said. \"He had so much emotion in him.\"\nPassage 2:\nMONTABAUR, Germany (AP) — The pastor of the Lutheran church in Andreas Lubitz's hometown said Sunday that the community stands by him and his family, despite the fact that prosecutors blame the 27-year-old co-pilot for causing the plane crash that killed 150 people in southern France.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The town of Montabaur has been rattled by the revelation that Lubitz, who first learned to fly at a nearby glider club, may have intentionally caused Tuesday's crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy, this crash — although this has not been finally confirmed, but a lot is indicating that — and we have to face this,\" pastor Michael Dietrich said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spoke to The Associated Press after holding a church service Sunday to commemorate the crash victims and support their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this, and want to support the family in particular,\" Dietrich said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR French prosecutors haven't questioned the family yet \"out of decency and respect for their pain,\" Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities are trying to understand what made Lubitz lock his fellow pilot out of the cockpit and ignore his pleas to open the door before slamming the plane into a mountain on what should have been a routine flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR French officials refused to confirm or deny a partial transcript that German newspaper Bild am Sontag said it had obtained of the cockpit recording. The paper reported Sunday that the pilot left for the toilet shortly before 10:30 a.m. and was heard trying unsuccessfully to get into the cockpit again a few minutes later, then shouting \"for God's sake open the door.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After several more minutes in which the pilot could be heard trying to break open the door, the plane crashed into the mountainside, according to Bild am Sonntag, which didn't say how it obtained the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brice, the Marseille prosecutor said that none of the bodies recovered so far have been identified, denying German media reports that Lubitz's body had been found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on the body of the co-pilot may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving. Germany prosecutors said Friday that Lubitz was hiding an illness and sick notes for the day of the crash from his employer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dietrich, the pastor, said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he attended religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, who worked as a part-time organist in the community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious. We had good conversations,\" Dietrich said. \"I know her and her family. This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"From what I've heard, there were no obvious signs that there is anything in the background that could lead to this,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Rome, Pope Francis on Sunday prayed for the victims of the plane crash, citing in particular the 16 German students returning from an exchange trip to Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Francis offered the prayer after Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square at the start of Holy Week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Le Vernet, a town near the crash site, families and friends of those killed were still coming to terms with what had happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Members of the family shed tears as they went to see the site,\" said Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of Japanese passenger Junichi Sato who died in the crash. \"It was particularly moving to see Mr. Sato's father asking the leader of the Kempeitai (a Japanese military rescue team), with many tears in his eyes, for them to continue the search operation and for it to finish earlier even by just one day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon,\" Yamanaka said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One black sheep does not constitute a herd,\" he said, adding that the overwhelming majority of pilots were \"very reliable\" and \"excellently\" trained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Meaningless explanations' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leading figures in the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) have also called for caution with regard to speculation on the causes of the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will perhaps never know exactly what happened, and we should simply not say anything,\" Margot Kässmann, the former council chair of the EKD, wrote in an article for the same newspaper.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The European Cockpit Association (ECA), which represents European pilots, said on Saturday that leaks of data from the crashed plane's voice recorder to the media - which led to the allegations that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane - were a \"serious breach of fundamental and globally accepted international accident investigation rules.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR tj/sms (dpa, Reuters, AFP, epd, dpa)\nPassage 4:\nRescuers still to find plane’s flight data recorder, leading to growing calls for caution in blaming co-pilot Andreas Lubitz for deliberately downing the aircraft NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forensic teams have identified 78 distinct DNA strands from body parts spread across the remote mountainside in the French Alps where Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed, killing all 150 people on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rescuers are still, however, to locate the plane’s second black box — its flight data recorder — six days after the Barcelona to Düsseldorf flight crashed into a rocky ravine at 435 miles (700km) per hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between 400 and 600 body parts have been located and are currently being examined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We haven’t found a single body intact,” said Patrick Touron, the deputy director of the police’s criminal research institute. Identification experts were using dental records, DNA samples from family members, fingerprints, jewellery and bits of ID card to help the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The black box, which is actually orange and weighs around 10kg, was originally in a protective casing, but only the empty casing has been found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Captain Yves Naffrechoux, a mountain ranger, told Agence France-Presse: “If it has not been completely destroyed or pulverised, the black box will be under the rubble and debris. We must work with caution and a lot of precision. We have to look under every last bit of plane and lift every rock.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An access road was being built to the site to allow all-terrain vehicles to remove some of the larger parts of the plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in France and Germany have suggested that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, deliberately crashed the plane. They have retrieved a torn-up sicknote from his flat in Düsseldorf, which was dated for the day of the disaster. Lubitz, who is from the small German town of Montabaur, had a history of depression which he hid from his employer and colleagues, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suicide-mass murder theory is based on the cockpit voice recorder retrieved from the crash site near the village of Le Vernet. According to Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper, the captain, Patrick Sondheimer, asked Lubitz to prepare the plane to land in Düsseldorf. Lubitz responded “laconically”. Sondheimer then left the cockpit to go to the toilet, telling his co-pilot: “You can take over.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was a sound of a seat being pushed back, and the door clicking shut. According to Bild, the plane then went into a steady descent. Minutes later there is a loud knocking and the voice of the captain saying: “For God’s sake open the door.” In the final moments the screams of passengers can be heard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German and European pilots’ associations urged caution last week in stating the cause of the crash until the second black box was discovered and the air accident investigation brought to a conclusion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jean-Pierre Michel, the head of the French investigation agency, said that some technical details of what precisely happened to the Airbus A320 aircraft were still missing. “At the moment we can’t rule out the hypothesis of a technical fault,” Michel told the French channel BFM TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The German chief executive of the Airbus Group, Tom Enders, expressed his irritation on Sunday and criticised TV talkshow coverage of the disaster. “There has been speculation without facts, fantasy and lies,” Enders said. Such “outrageous nonsense” mocked the victims, he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Montabaur, where Lubitz lived part of the time with his father, mother and younger brother, prayers were said on Sunday for the victims of the crash, and for the co-pilot and his grieving family. Hundreds of worshippers packed into St Peter’s Catholic church on the town’s cobbled main street, on a morning of pouring rain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many there believed that investigators had been too quick to blame Lubitz for the disaster. Candles and flowers have been left outside the church, and one note read: “We think of all victims of this tragic crash, and their families and friends, in these difficult hours.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The priest expressed sympathy for Lubitz’s parents whom, he said, had found themselves “at the centre of attention”, the families and friends of the victims, and the rescue workers in France.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She worked as a teacher at an unnamed comprehensive school in the state of North Rhine Westfalia and Bild said she had told her pupils that she was pregnant. Lubitz had also recently ordered two new cars for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman – given the pseudonym, Sabine L, by Bild to protect her identity – visited the crash site last week, discovering on the way there that Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane, killing himself and 149 others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sabine was said to have met Lubitz when the two were school students doing holiday jobs at a hamburger restaurant. “Eventually they no longer kept their relationship a secret,” the former manager was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane because he was deeply depressed and was being treated for vision problems that could have ended his flying career. Some sources suggested he was suffering from a detached retina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reports came as a transcript of the last voice recordings was revealed yesterday, which reveals that Lubitz urged the pilot to go to the toilet, leaving him alone in the cockpit. Passengers can be heard screaming uncontrollably for minutes before the crash, according to details published by Bild am Sonntag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the course of the transcript, Lubitz can be heard telling Captain Patrick Sondheimer that he is ready to take over “any time”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Capt Sondheimer orders Lubitz to prepare the plane for landing in Düsseldorf, Lubitz appears to give clues about what he is about to do, responding with “hopefully” and “let’s wait and see”. He then tells Capt Sondheimer: “You can go now”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two minutes later, the Captain says, “you can take over now” and the sound of a cockpit seat sliding backwards is followed by the clicking of the cockpit door.

Air traffic controllers can then be heard trying to contact the plane and the automatic “sink rate” alarm starts sounding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seconds later, there is thudding on the cockpit door. Capt Sondheimer can be heard shouting, “For God’s sake open the door!” Behind him, passengers can be heard screaming. Among the last sounds appear to be attempts by Capt Sondheimer to break down the door with the aircraft’s emergency axe, as he shouts: “Open the goddam door.” But to no avail. Shortly after, the plane’s wing is heard scraping the side of a mountain.

In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."], "length": 4511, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0cc803bf449c7c83013f18bfd0301e1cde02c809a0bbd0a8"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We will update as more details become available.\nPassage 2:\nMANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British police on Tuesday identified the suicide bomber who killed 22 people, including children, in an attack on a crowded concert hall in Manchester, and said they were trying to establish whether he had acted alone or with help from others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man suspected of carrying out Britain's deadliest bombing in nearly 12 years was named as Salman Abedi, aged 22, but police declined to give further details about him. (For a graphic showing where the blast hit: tmsnrt.rs/2rKy5Y1) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. security sources, citing British intelligence officials, said he was born in Manchester in 1994 to parents of Libyan origin. He is believed to have traveled by train from London before the attack, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our priority, along with the police counter-terrorism network and our security partners, is to continue to establish whether he was acting alone or working as part of a wider network,” Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attacker set off his improvised bomb as crowds streamed out of the Manchester Arena after a pop concert by Ariana Grande, a U.S. singer especially popular with teenage girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “All acts of terrorism are cowardly,” Prime Minister Theresa May said outside her Downing Street office after a meeting with security and intelligence chiefs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But this attack stands out for its appalling sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britain has increased its security threat level to “critical” from “severe” following the attack, May said in a later televised statement, adding that members of the armed forces would boost security at key sites and military personnel might be deployed at public events such as concerts and sports events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Islamic State, now being driven from territories in Syria and Iraq by Western-backed armed forces, claimed responsibility for what it called a revenge attack against “Crusaders”, but there appeared to be contradictions in its account of the operation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FRANTIC SEARCHES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses related the horror of the blast, which unleashed a stampede just as the concert ended at Europe’s largest indoor arena, full to its capacity of 21,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We ran and people were screaming around us and pushing on the stairs to go outside and people were falling down, girls were crying, and we saw these women being treated by paramedics having open wounds on their legs ... it was just chaos,” said Sebastian Diaz, 19. “It was literally just a minute after it ended, the lights came on and the bomb went off.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A video posted on Twitter showed fans, many of them young, screaming and running from the venue. Dozens of parents frantically searched for their children, posting photos and pleading for information on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Singer Grande, 23, said on Twitter she was devastated: “broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’t have words.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attack was the deadliest in the UK since four British Muslims killed 52 people in suicide bombings on London’s transport system in 2005. But it will have reverberations far beyond British shores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attacks in cities including Paris, Nice, Brussels, St Petersburg, Berlin and London have shocked Europeans already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration and pockets of domestic Islamist radicalism. Islamic State has repeatedly called for attacks as retaliation for Western involvement in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While claiming responsibility on its Telegram account, the group appeared to contradict the police description of a suicide bomber. It suggested explosive devices were placed “in the midst of the gatherings of the Crusaders”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What comes next will be more severe on the worshippers of the cross,” the Telegram posting said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It did not name the bomber, as it usually does in attacks it has ordered, and appeared also to contradict a posting on another Islamic State account, Amaq, which spoke of “a group of attackers”. That reference, however, was later removed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a series of impromptu statements about nuclear weapons, Donald Trump is threatening to upend longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy, even as his advisers contradict him and muddy his intentions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president-elect had alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” that he is fine with the country taking part in an “arms race” if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,” Trump said in an off-air conversation on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the remark was reported on MSNBC, though, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer pushed back and insisted that the remarks came from a “private conversation” with “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski. While he told the “Today” Show’s Matt Lauer that “there is not going to be” an arms race, he told CNN that Trump is not going to “take anything off the table,” either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains unclear where the president-elect stands, but given longstanding bipartisan support for preventing nuclear escalation, if followed through Trump’s statements would represent an extraordinary shift in how the U.S. approaches the role of weapons of mass destruction in its own defenses and throughout the world. President Barack Obama has advanced a vision of “America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, after his Thursday tweet, Trump’s own supporters had tried to downplay what it meant. It was unclear, for example, whether Trump was advocating the U.S. increasing the size of its nuclear arsenal, which would be a major change, or if he was speaking of modernizing it. Such a suggestion would be in line with ongoing efforts and not necessarily controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager who was recently named incoming counselor to the president, told an irate Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that Trump may have meant the latter. Regardless, Conway insisted during the heated exchange on MSNBC, the tweet did not necessarily represent a policy change, but Trump “talking about keeping us safe and secure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are a lot of people hiding under the bed right now because it doesn’t seem like he knows what he’s talking about on this issue,” Maddow said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s not fair,” Conway responded, later adding, “He’s not making policy on Twitter. … Again, perhaps he is also echoing what President Obama himself has tried to do here, which is get upgrades to our nuclear systems.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, had also said on Thursday that the president-elect was talking about expanding nonproliferation efforts, not stoking an arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it — particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,\" Miller said in a statement. \"He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s comments Friday, of course, seemed to directly contradict that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy started after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on his country to “strengthen” its nuclear forces. “We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,” he said earlier this week, according to multiple news reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Putin at an annual news conference on Friday said Russia has no interest in a nuclear arms race and seemed to normalize Trump’s statements, calling his tweet unsurprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Of course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,” Putin said, adding, “As for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his elections campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the election season, Trump made contradictory statements about nuclear proliferation. He suggested that some countries — including Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia — should be allowed to develop them, despite efforts to prevent more countries from doing so. But he also told The New York Times in March that “it’s a very scary nuclear world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation,” Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s more recent comments about expanding America’s nuclear capability go against decades of policy to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads and could potentially violate an arms control treaty with Russia. The U.S. has a stockpile of roughly 4,500 nuclear warheads and nearly 1,500 deployed warheads (Russia’s armaments are nearly identical, as both nations account for more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. and Russia are due to meet nuclear reduction targets by February 2018 under the New START Treaty, which can be extended for another five years in 2021. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts remain confused and in some cases unnerved by the nature of Trump’s foray into the nuclear weapons discussion. On Thursday, John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, presented Trump’s tweet as perilous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet,” he said in a statement, warning that an expansion threatens a nuclear arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The potential consequences of changing U.S. nuclear weapons policy so drastically are simply unimaginable,” he warned. “Current plans already call for spending $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the Pentagon has expressed concern about being able to afford. The President-elect will have to explain why any increase is necessary both financially and strategically.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Cirincione, the president of the global security foundation Ploughshares Fund and a nuclear weapons expert, called Trump's actions “bizarre, unprecedented and completely out of bounds behavior for a president-elect.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incoming presidents usually wait until they take office to make pronouncements on a topic like nuclear policy, Cirincione said. Beyond that, he said he is alarmed by the cavalier attitude Trump seems to have toward as enormously sensitive an issue as weapons of mass destruction. While Trump might see Twitter as a means to convey strength to his constituents at home, Cirincione said, “the rest of the world is watching,” and other countries could respond with actions of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can’t use Twitter to make nuclear policy,” Cirincione said. “Look, you should at least wait until you’re president. But this is why — this kind of view that he’s breaking with convention, he wants to shake things up, I understand that, but not on nuclear policy. There are reasons why people spend days crafting the language of nuclear policy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These things can be very complicated,” he continued, “and every word matters.”\nPassage 2:\nThis is probably not the first day on the job that Sean Spicer imagined it would be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already he has done a merry-go-round of morning show appearances since it was announced Thursday that he will serve as our nation’s next White House Press Secretary, set to take office with the Trump administration next month. However, his first day is off to an, uhh, let’s call it interesting start; during an off-air conversation this morning with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, “Let it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass. And outlast them all.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spicer a half hour later told TODAY’s Matt Lauer, “There is not going to be” an arms race, forced to clarify Trump’s comments that the MSNBC morning show reported on earlier in the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, remarkably, an hour later on CNN’s New Day, Spicer shrugged off the Brzezinski report altogether; during his interview with Alisyn Camerota, Spicer sheepishly admitted, “That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.” He promptly shifted the focus of his response, telling the CNN anchor, “He is somebody who gets things done,” discussing the recent conversations over Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What’s unclear is if Trump’s comments to Brzezinski, then, were ever intended to be reported on, or if they were — as Spicer alleged on New Day — just a private comment made over the phone. Although Spicer himself appeared on Morning Joe earlier in the day, during a commercial break he spoke on the phone with Mr. President-elect who was then handed over to Brzezinski. It was then that he reportedly made his comment, “Let it be an arms race,” which the MSNBC anchor promptly reported on as breaking news when the show came back on air. Morning Joe ran “BREAKING NEWS” chyrons about the ‘arms race’ admission throughout the rest of the program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have reached out to MSNBC for comment. Watch Spicer’s comment to CNN above. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE 9:22 a.m. EST: A MSNBC spokesperson has confirmed to Mediaite that Trump’s comments to Brzezinski were reportable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [image vis screengrab] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com\nPassage 3:\nTRUMP: Well you see, I don’t know that, you know, when I talk about unpredictability, I’m not sure that we should be talking about me – On the assumption that I’m doing well, which I am, and that I may be in that position, I’m not sure that I would want to be talking about that. You understand what I mean by that, David. We’re so open, we’re so, “Oh I wouldn’t do this, I wouldn’t do that, I would do this, I would do that.” And it’s not so much with Merkel, but it’s certainly with other countries. You know, that really, where there’s, where there’s a different kind of relationship, and a much worse relationship than with Germany. So, you know there’s so, there’s such predictability with our country. We go and we send 50 soldiers over to the Middle East and President Obama gets up and announces that we’re sending 50 soldiers to the Middle East. Fifty very special soldiers. And they now have a target on their back, and everything we do, we announce, instead of winning, and announcing when it’s all over. There’s such, total predictability of this country, and it’s one of the reasons we do so poorly. You know, I’d rather not say that. I would like to see what they’re doing. Because you know, many countries, I can’t say Germany, but many countries are spying on us. I think that was a great disservice done by Edward Snowden. That I can tell you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How to Defeat ISIS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HABERMAN: Mr. Trump, you have talked about your plans to defeat ISIS, and how you would approach it. Would you be willing to stop buying oil from the Saudis if they’re unwilling to go in and help? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: On the ground? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure. I would do that. The beautiful thing about oil is that, you know, we’re really getting close, because of fracking, and because of new technology, we’re really in a position that we weren’t in, you know, years ago, and the reason we’re in the Middle East is for oil. And all of a sudden we’re finding out that there’s less reason to be. Now, now, we’re in the Middle East for really defense, because we can’t allow them, I mean, look, I was against the war in Iraq. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it has destabilized it, it’s totally destabilized the Middle East. The way Obama got out of the war was, you know, disgraceful, and idiotic. When he announced the date certain, they pulled back, and they said, “Oh, well.” As much as they don’t mind dying, they do mind dying. And they pulled back, and then, you know, it’s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and then he didn’t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of Iraq, which in my opinion wasn’t very much, because I think that, you know, the government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge, and you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they weren’t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out of that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in those decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every bad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you look at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I’m not saying it was only Obama, It was Obama’s getting out, it was other people’s getting in, but you go back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would’ve been much better off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and you know, monetary loss, it’s just incredible. ’Cause we’re further, we’re far worse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East. Far worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to Maggie’s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power but not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab partners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from whom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie’s question, if I understood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground troops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama’s efforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, “We will stop buying oil from you, until you send ground troops?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: There’s two answers to that. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you’ll be talking about, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of time, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the amount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi Arabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have, there’s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily, everywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist for very long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I’m trying to figure out, why is it that we aren’t going in and saying, at a minimum, at a minimum it’s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie’s question. But why aren’t we going in and saying, “At a minimum, I’m sorry folks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.” You know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because – again, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never thought had oil, and they do have oil, and there’s a glut on the market, there’s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that are loaded up and they don’t even know where to go dump it. But we don’t have that same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn’t have that for a long period of time, because there’s so many places. I mean, they’re closing wells all over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to be reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that’s far greater than what we’re being paid right now. Because we’re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we’re performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabia’s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection of our country’s, of U.S. protection, think of Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was internal or external, it wouldn’t be around for very long. And they’re a money machine, they’re a monetary machine, and yet they don’t reimburse us the way we should be reimbursed. So that’s a real problem. And frankly, I think it’s a real, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country’s a poor country. Our country is a debtor nation, we’re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe trillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other countries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan, $1.5 trillion. We’re a debtor nation. We can’t be a debtor nation. I don’t want to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons we’re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military isn’t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to watch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these countries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but – in some cases they are powerful – but rich countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You’ve seen the current strategy, which is, you’ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They’re fighting each other and yet we’re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I’ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I’m not saying Assad is a good man, ’cause he’s not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it’s ISIS.\nPassage 4:\nA Russian Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) and capable of carrying a warhead of up to one megaton, the equivalent of one million tons of TNT explosive (AFP Photo/DMITRY KOSTYUKOV) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army's performance in its Syria campaign.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nIn an exclusive interview with Variety, Olivia Munn says that Fox initially didn’t return her call after reporting “The Predator” actor Steven Wilder Striegel to the studio. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When I called, (Fox) was silent for two days,” the actress told Variety’s Jenelle Riley at the Toronto Film Festival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I did have to reach out again and say I didn’t feel comfortable presenting at the MTV Awards with Keegan (Michael Key) unless this guy was out of it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fox later deleted the scene, which featured Striegel’s character hitting on Olivia Munn’s character. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Striegel, a friend of “The Predator” director Shane Black’s, pleaded guilty in 2010 to two felonies — risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer — after facing allegations that he attempted to lure a 14-year-old female into a sexual relationship through the internet. He served six months in jail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m not saying they weren’t working on it behind the scenes,” Munn says of Fox. “I just didn’t hear anything about it. But I’m happy that they did obviously because I’m proud of the work we did in this movie, we all worked really, really hard, and I wouldn’t be able to morally stand behind this movie with this guy in there.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Olivia Munn on Shane Black's 'Predator' Remorse: 'I Didn't Get That Apology' Ariel Winter on 'Modern Family' Death: 'We Tried to Make It as Light Hearted as Possible' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesperson for Fox said this week that the studio was unaware of Striegel’s history when casting the film. “We were not aware of his background due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors,” the company wrote in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The reason why it’s so important, especially in Hollywood, is because movies are so far reaching. And this kind of movie, it’s an international movie, it’s going to go global, or that’s our hope, and more people see that,” Munn said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: “When you have somebody on a big screen, no matter how small – we’ve all done little parts in movies – that little grain of fame is just enough to reach out and influence somebody who is impressionable and if you have somebody that has a history of using that to abuse children, that’s not OK in my book. And I do believe people deserve second chances, but I do have a hard line when it comes to people who hurt children or animals. You deserve to go make money, but not alongside me in a film. You can go work in a lot of other places or like make an Etsy store or something.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black has since apologized for the error in judgement in a public statement, but Munn said she was disappointed he never reached out personally to her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think an apology has to happen privately not just publicly, I believe in his apology that he said he apology to everyone past and present that he’s put in that situation, and that would be me, but I didn’t get that apology, I read about it online like everyone else.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a point when you’re in it, everybody from the top down, they just want you to keep quiet and do anything to help the movie,” she said. “They’re doing some Jedi mind trick like ‘These aren’t the people you’re looking for’ and I’m like ‘That’s not working on me!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black, whose previous credits include “Iron Man 3” and “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” was not available for press at the Toronto premiere of “The Predator” on Thursday.

Brown, Jacob Tremblay and a cast of misfits played by Trevante Rhodes, Thomas Jane and Keegan-Michael Key — scored a coveted slot in the Toronto International Film Festival lineup ahead of its Sept. 14 release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But just hours before the Midnight Madness screening on Sept. 6, the Los Angeles Times reported that the studio had deleted a scene from the film starring Munn alongside actor Steven Wilder Striegel (playing a jogger who has an encounter with Munn's biologist character) after it was revealed to Fox by Munn that he is a registered sex offender. Striegel, a longtime friend of Black, pleaded guilty in 2010 following allegations that he had acted inappropriately with a 14-year-old female to whom he was related. According to the Times report, Striegel had exchanged sexually charged emails with the underage girl, and as a result of the guilty plea, spent six months in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the news, the cast carried on and traveled to TIFF to promote the film ,while Black backed out and did not attend his film's worldwide debut. A studio spokesperson issued a statement, confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter, that Fox executives were not aware of Striegel's background when he was hired. \"Several weeks ago, when the studio learned the details, his one scene in the film was removed within 24 hours. We were not aware of his background during the casting process due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors,\" said a Twentieth Century Fox Film spokesperson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has been a complicated few days for the actors and publicists as they navigated a whirlwind schedule of press and on-camera interviews while being forced to walk the delicate line of promoting a big-budget action film and responding to journalists' questions about the controversial situation, which is even more charged in the #MeToo and Time's Up era. Answering a question about why she is still promoting the film, Munn tweeted Friday that she was \"contractually obligated,\" adding that, \"From what I’m experiencing, I think they’d prefer I not show up. It would make everyone breathe easier.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn did show up to THR's Video Lounge in Toronto on Saturday afternoon, but instead of doing an interview alongside available castmembers, Munn was joined only by Tremblay after a few of her fellow actors backed out of scheduled interviews, presumably because of the subject matter of the deleted scene. After doing a joint interview with Tremblay, Munn sat for a solo interview in which she discusses what she did after finding out about Striegel's background, what she thought of Black's apology and how she feels about doing promo on her own in the wake of this story. \"It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be sitting here with the rest of the cast,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those actors, Keegan-Michael Key, was due to catch a flight out of Toronto and was not among those scheduled to be a part of THR's interview. Key's rep issued the following statement to THR: \"His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing TIFF early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can you walk me through and tell me what the past few days have been like for you after this news came out? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s been most tough on the Jane Doe that was in the story because the victim is the victim. Whatever she’s gone through in the subsequent years is most important to me. The outpouring of support online and from the media and everyone just validating that it's the right thing to do has been really uplifting and helps me breathe a little easier. … We’re making movies. We’re not in the mafia. I haven’t spoken against the family. This guy isn’t in our movie anymore. I try to do the right thing and that’s all I can do, and when I see something, you do something. You don’t just sit back and hope it protects your movie. The movie is a great movie, the scene isn’t in there. It’s going to do well. At the end of the day, it's just a movie. We can’t tell stories about people and not care about people. … There are people who get very mad at you for not just helping them bury it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I saw you tweeted yesterday that you’re contractually obligated to be here but it might help everyone breathe a little easier if you weren't. How hard has it been walking through this with your cast and with Shane Black? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, I haven’t heard from Shane. I did see his apology that he put out. I appreciate the apology. I would have appreciated it more if it was directed toward me privately before it went public and I had to see it online with everyone else. It's honestly disheartening to have to fight for something so hard that is just so obvious to me. I don’t know why this has to be such a hard fight. I do feel like I’ve been treated by some people that I’m the one who went to jail or I’m the one that put this guy on set. I found out, and it was really important to me to have the scene deleted. When the press found out, they asked for a statement, I gave a statement. I found out those details like everybody else did. It was shocking and disturbing. Now when I’m being asked about it, I don’t know how to lie about it. I don’t know how to pretend, I don’t know how to skirt around the issue. I just know how to be honest about it. It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be sitting here with the rest of the cast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Who did you seek counsel from before you made the phone call to Fox? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one. I called my lawyer and my manager and I said, \"I need you to tell them right now about this.\" I found out and my very next call was to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let’s look forward a bit. I’m wondering how you hope this will change the industry. Do you think this will create a more structured vetting system so that these things don’t happen again? Have you had any of those conversations yet? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, I haven’t had any of those conversations. The truth is that the situation that we’re in over the last year or so, the #MeToo movement, it really exists because of the people online who are appalled and outraged and demanding that things be changed. The people who are at the top, the people colluding to keep abusers in power, the people who are colluding to turn a blind eye so that they can keep making money, they are the people who created this disparity in the first place, we can’t really depend on them to make a change. It's the people online and people who express their outrage. For some reason, there seem to be people out there who are only motivated by the bottom line. If the fans and public keep expressing that they won’t go support who are abusers or organizations or companies that support that, then that will make them change. Nothing really changes until people see that it will affect them personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know this can't be easy for anyone, especially you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I appreciate that people care that something like this happened, if someone wants to share their platform and their power with someone who went to prison for hurting a child. Once they’ve gotten out of prison, they’ve served their time, they are allowed to be back out in society and that's their choice if they want to help that person. I wasn't given that choice; that decision was made for me. My choice will always be to never give a second chance to anyone who hurts a child or an animal. That’s me. Everybody has their own prerogative. If you’re going to ask me, that’s going to be my choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sept. 9, 3:57 p.m.: Updated with statement from Keegan-Michael Key's rep.\nPassage 3:\nIt's striking to see Olivia Munn fielding an interview all alone when The Predator, the movie she's repping at Toronto International Film Festival this weekend, is an ensemble effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, we learned that Fox cut a scene out of The Predator because it featured a registered sex offender, also a friend of director Shane Black. It was Munn who first alerted the studio that she had shared a scene with this man and set in motion his removal from the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking on Saturday to The Hollywood Reporter, without any cast members at her side, Munn discussed the situation at length. She did what she did because she felt it was the right thing to do, but it's clear not everyone felt that way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are people who get very mad at you for not... just, you know... helping them bury it,\" she said carefully at one point. Munn doesn't single anyone out by name on that count, but the absence of — and relative silence from — her fellow actors is notable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be sitting here with the rest of the cast,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (It's easy to miss the nuance of Munn's comments in text form, so do yourself a favor and watch the full interview.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR .@OliviaMunn: \"It's not an easy thing to be the one to speak up. There are people who get mad at you for not helping them bury it ... I'm sitting here by myself when I should be with the rest of the cast\" https://t.co/vBnjnVz9cA pic.twitter.com/jP3qReJh64 — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) September 8, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be clear: Munn only comes off here as a strong woman who's not backing down from her position that she did the right thing. She may admit to feeling a sense of isolation from the cast and crew, but this isn't a pity party, self-inflicted or otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That said, it's hard for those of us on the outside looking in to overlook the signs that she's paying a price now for doing the right thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black hasn't communicated with her at all one-on-one since this story first surfaced. His public apology didn't even address her directly, despite the fact that she's the one who had to perform in a scene with the sex offender, without her knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her fellow cast members have been notably silent and/or absent as well. The intro to THR's coverage of the interview mentions that Munn sat for a paired interview with her fellow star, 11-year-old Jacob Tremblay, before her solo chat. But it goes on to provide additional context on the unusual situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Munn did show up to THR's Video Lounge in Toronto on Saturday afternoon, but instead of doing an interview alongside castmembers, Munn was joined only by Tremblay after her fellow actors backed out of scheduled interviews, presumably because of the subject matter of the deleted scene,\" the story reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A representative for The Predator star Keegan-Michael Key reached out to Mashable after this story published and asked us to share the following statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keegan was never booked to do an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing TIFF early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn herself has already explained that she's still repping the movie and at the annual film fest only because she's \"contractually obligated\" to do so, as she wrote in a Friday tweet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m contractually obligated. And from what I’m experiencing, I think they’d prefer I not show up. It would make everyone breathe easier. Also, I worked really hard on this film, as did the rest of the cast and crew. Now that the scene is deleted I think audiences will love it. https://t.co/6MZxb4NZfT — om (@oliviamunn) September 7, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This Is Us and The Predator star Sterling K. Brown isn't in Toronto this weekend, but he did weigh in on Twitter a few hours after Munn's interview with THR published. He defended his fellow actor and echoed some of her words, but the timing led many to wonder why Brown didn't speak up sooner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s gonna vary from individual to individual. You and @BonafideBlack may differ when it comes to that issue. I don’t have all the details regarding his friend’s crime, but I know it involves a minor, and he spent time in jail. With regards to forgiveness, I leave that to... — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our studio was not given that opportunity, and neither was our cast. Especially @oliviamunn who was the only member of the principal cast who had to work with him. I so appreciate that you “didn’t leave well enough alone,” & again, I’m sorry you feel isolated in taking action. — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thank you to @20thcenturyfox for taking quick action in deleting the scene. @oliviamunn I hope you don’t feel quite so alone. You did the right thing. 🕉 — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this post-#MeToo world, even the good changes tend to come with a fair amount of bad. Here we see it playing out in real time as Munn pays for her act of bravery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She spoke up, and in doing so she ensured that one less problematic figure gets to have a redemption arc enabled by his white male friend. But she's standing alone in the aftermath, and she's fielding the same old questions, and delivering the same common-sense answers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The truth is that the situation that we’re in over the last year or so, the #MeToo movement, it really exists because the people online who are appalled and outraged and demanding that things be changed. The people who are at the top, the people colluding to keep abusers in power, the people who are colluding to turn a blind eye so that they can keep making money, they are the people who created this disparity in the first place. We can’t really depend on them to make a change. It's the people online and people who express their outrage. For some reason, there seem to be people out there who are only motivated by the bottom line. If the fans and public keep expressing that they won’t go support who are abusers or organizations or companies that support that, then that will make them change. Nothing really changes until people see that it will affect them personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's Munn responding to a question about whether she thinks the situation with The Predator will lead to broader changes, in this case in the way film casts and crews are vetted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's nothing new, though. How many women have said over the past year (and, let's be clear, since well before that) that change is going to have to be a group effort? How many have pointed out that the system — whatever system they may be referring to in the moment — doesn't ever change because money is still being made? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's premature to say that the days of vindictive men blackballing the women that spurn them are over, but it's presumably (hopefully) a lot harder to get away with in the current environment. What Munn is experiencing now, just like others who have spoken up, is a different kind of fallout — but that doesn't make it any better. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She shouldn't be alone here. Men (and women) who claim to be allies need to actually step up and be allies in the moments that matter. And hey, guess what? This moment matters. It's wrong that Munn is facing the media alone while her other cast members bow out of their commitments. It's wrong that Black hasn't communicated with her directly, even if he's upset about what happened to his friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Too frequently, we hear men excuse their silence with comments like \"Well, she's a strong, independent woman who can speak for herself.\" Or \"It's not my place to wade in.\" Or \"I want to hear all the facts first.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of that is good enough. Women can be strong and speak for themselves while also reaping the benefits of a robust support network that's ready to act. It's shameful that Munn's co-stars didn't provide that for her here, and that she has to pay any kind of price for doing the right thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATED Sept. 9, 2018, 5:19 p.m. with a statement from Keegan-Michael Key.\nPassage 4:\nCLOSE Sterling K. Brown, Keegan-Michael Key and Olivia Munn star in this fight to save humanity from \"The Predator.\" It's the first film in the franchise since 2010. USA TODAY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Olivia Munn is pushing ahead with promoting \"The Predator\" at Toronto Film Festival, even after blowing the whistle on a registered sex offender in the cast. (Photo: Getty Images for IMDb) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Olivia Munn says she's getting the cold shoulder from \"The Predator\" cast after flagging 20th Century Fox that an actor in the reboot of the franchise is a registered sex offender. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news resulted in Fox cutting a scene from the film with actor Steven Wilder Striegel, who pleaded guilty in 2010 for trying to entice a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship on the Internet. (Striegel is a longtime friend of \"The Predator\" director Shane Black) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our studio was not aware of Mr. Striegel's background when he was hired,\" Fox told The Associated Press on Thursday just hours before the sci-fi movie premiered at Toronto International Film Festival. \"Several weeks ago, when the studio learned the details, his one scene in the film was removed within 24 hours.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn – who plays scientist Casey Bracket in the movie, which arrives in theaters on Sept. 14 – tweeted that audiences will love it \"now that the scene is deleted,\" in light of the #MeToo and Time's Up era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn, 38, has continued to promote \"The Predator\" since blowing the whistle on Striegel, but her fellow cast members haven't been supportive. During a scheduled interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Munn said her co-stars bailed on her, with the exception of 11-year-old actor Jacob Tremblay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be sitting here with the rest of the cast,\" Munn told THR. \"I do feel like I’ve been treated by some people that I’m the one who went to jail or I’m the one that put this guy on set.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Predator\" co-star Boyd Holbrook admitted on Instagram that indeed he \"did pull out of a small amount of press on Saturday, as this type of social commentary is new to me ...\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He wrote, \"I want to start by apologizing for this statement coming late in the current conversation ... I am proud of Olivia for the way that she handled a difficult and alarming situation, and I am grateful that Fox took the information seriously and took action swiftly.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fellow actor Niall Matter also addressed the controversy on Sunday, tweeting that he wasn't at TIFF doing \"Predator\" press because he was shooting a movie. \"I was not privy to any of this information until today,\" he said. \"I’m deeply sorry Olivia that you felt alone in this ... As a father to a daughter I can assure you that my stance is the same as yours.

And if it costs me my career they can take it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another one of Munn's co-stars, Emmy-winning actor Sterling K. Brown, took to Twitter to apologize to the actress for feeling alone. (He didn't attend Toronto Film Festival.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown said \"our studio was not given that opportunity\" to know who they were working with, especially Munn who appeared in the deleted scene opposite Striegel: \"I so appreciate that you 'didn’t leave well enough alone.' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thank you to @20thcenturyfox for taking quick action in deleting the scene. @oliviamunn I hope you don’t feel quite so alone.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn appeared to object to director Black, who was aware of Striegel's legal problems, on Twitter Thursday: \"The #MeToo movement called out abusers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I haven’t heard from Shane. I did see his apology ... I would have appreciated it more if it was directed toward me privately before it went public and I had to see it online with everyone else,\" she said. \"It's honestly disheartening to have to fight for something so hard that is just so obvious to me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black has frequently cast Striegel in his films, including 2013's \"Iron Man 3\" and 2016's \"The Nice Guys.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black said in a statement on Thursday: \"Having read this morning's news reports, it has sadly become clear to me that I was misled by a friend I really wanted to believe was telling me the truth when he described the circumstances of his conviction. I believe strongly in giving people second chances – but sometimes you discover that chance is not as warranted as you may have hoped.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn stars in the film alongside Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes and Thomas Jane, in addition to \"This Is Us\" star Brown, \"Room\" breakout Tremblay and Key. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contributing: The Associated Press NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: Fox deletes 'The Predator' scene after learning actor is a registered sex offender NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier: Olivia Munn, Boyd Holbrook battle a stronger alien in first 'Predator' trailer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2N3dEnD\nPassage 5:\nOn Thursday night, just hours after the news broke that she had successfully lobbied to cut a scene in which she appeared opposite a convicted sexual offender, Olivia Munn arrived at the midnight premiere of her new film, The Predator. She was joined by many of her male co-stars as well as director Shane Black, who after The Los Angeles Times broke the story said that he regretted casting his friend Steven Wilder Striegel and released a statement apologizing to “all of those, past and present, I’ve let down by having Steve around them without giving them a voice in the decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those people, presumably, was Munn. But as she told Vanity Fair’s executive West Coast editor, Krista Smith, on Saturday, she has not actually heard directly from Black, her co-stars, or the studio since speaking on the record to the Times about her efforts to have the scene cut and the “unsettling” realization that Black had cast Striegel without disclosing his history. (A source close to the production later clarified that at least one co-star had, in fact, reached out.) At the premiere, Munn said that her co-stars—including Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, and Keegan-Michael Key—all stood to give Black what appeared to be an ovation at the beginning of the film. “I looked back and I see the guys standing up, and I was just confused because I hadn’t heard from them during the day. Everybody else was sitting down—it wasn’t like this massive standing ovation for him. I felt it was still appropriate to clap and cheer, but to actually make that gesture to stand up, especially in this moment . . . and privately I knew that no one reached out to me to say, ‘Are you O.K.?’ It did feel bad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As their press duties have continued, Munn said, many of her co-stars have canceled scheduled interviews with her; another, she said, walked out of an interview when the issue of the cut scene came up. When Munn decided to give a comment to the Times, she told Smith, she reached out to all of her co-stars privately to encourage them to make statements of their own. “I wanted them to not be blindsided the way I was blindsided, and I encouraged them to put out a statement once the L.A. Times reached out to us,“ Munn said. “I was surprised that none of them did. Again that’s their prerogative. Right now the reality is that there will be people who wear Time’s Up pins and say they support Time’s Up, [but] there will be people in Time’s Up who aren’t really down with the cause.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview at TIFF with The Los Angeles Times, alongside Munn and Augusto Aguilera, Rhodes said, “I wasn’t disappointed in Shane. I was disappointed in the situation, and I’m happy that Liv spoke up.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A representative for Keegan-Michael Key said in a statement, “Keegan was never booked to do an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing TIFF early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday Boyd Holbrook sent the following statement via a representative: “I want to start by apologizing for this statement coming late in the current conversation. I do not take any of what has gone on lightly, and I want to speak from the most honest and genuine place possible. I have stated before, and I will state it again, I am proud of Olivia for the way that she handled a difficult and alarming situation, and I am grateful that Fox took the information seriously and took action swiftly. It is true that I pulled out of a small amount of press on Saturday, as this type of social commentary is new to me and given the nature of the originating crime, I felt further discussion could cause unwanted trauma and pain, neither of which I wanted to incite to the anonymous young woman. I now realize that my understanding of the situation was not the full picture and the last thing I want is for Olivia to ever feel abandoned or alone. We are in the midst of a very crucial and important time and it is imperative that we keep listening.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked for comment, a Twentieth Century Fox spokesperson said, “Our studio was not aware of Mr. Striegel’s background when he was hired. Several weeks ago, when the studio learned the details, his one scene in the film was removed within 24 hours. We were not aware of his background during the casting process due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors.” Representatives for Black, Holbrook, and Rhodes did not provide comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I kind of feel like I’m the one going to jail,” Munn said. “I didn’t go to jail, I didn’t put this guy on our set. I had this scene deleted. Thank God, honestly, that there is social media. It’s the fans and news outlets that’s confirming it to me that what I did was the right thing. If I didn’t have that feedback, I’d kind of go a little crazy thinking, Why am I being treated like this? That’s not O.K., to feel like the bad guy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the Los Angeles Times originally reported, Munn was tipped off that Striegel was a convicted sex offender, and notified Fox on August 15; though the Times report said that executives quickly worked to cut Striegel’s scene, Munn told Variety that the studio waited two days to tell her they‘d taken action, and in that time she told them she didn’t feel comfortable presenting at the V.M.A.s on August 20 unless the scene was cut. “Getting a convicted sex offender out of a movie that has global reach is extremely important, but the reality of what I’ve had to go through in this process of just finding out, it’s a crazy thing,“ Munn told Smith. “It’s like I stumbled upon something and now I’m being chased by everyone and isolated.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munn has been working in Hollywood for over a decade, with recent roles in blockbusters like X-Men: Apocalypse and Ocean’s 8, but said that her recent experience has made her consider leaving the industry behind altogether. “I love being an actor, but if it comes at this cost, who wants it? Who cares? I’m so much more than who I am as an actor, and so many other things going on in my life. I love it, but they can take it, if that’s what it comes down to.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CORRECTION: This article has been updated to include a clarification from a source that at least one co-star had reached out to Munn.

Olivia Munn discovered Steven Wilder Striegel, a friend of The Predator director Shane Black who'd acted in one of the film's scenes with her, had pleaded guilty in 2010 for trying to lure a 14-year-old girl online into a sexual relationship, and she alerted 20th Century Fox—which, she tells Variety, initially didn't return her call. She followed up, and the scene was eventually cut. Since then, Munn says she's \"getting the cold shoulder,\" as USA Today puts it, from fellow cast members and Black, who hasn't spoken to her. \"It's a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself,\" Munn told the Hollywood Reporter during a promo interview Saturday in which only 11-year-old co-star Jacob Tremblay showed up to sit next to her. \"I do feel like I've been treated by some people that I'm the one who went to jail or I'm the one that put this guy on set,\" she added. Though two of her co-stars, Keegan-Michael Key and Sterling K. Brown, note they weren't set to do the THR interview and that they support Munn, Munn tells Vanity Fair co-stars have dropped out of more than one interview and that no one else issued statements when she encouraged them to. \"Right now the reality is that there will be people who wear Time's Up pins and say they support Time's Up, [but] there will be people in Time's Up who aren't really down with the cause,\" she says.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Walt Disney Company is on a roll. The stock is trading close to its all-time high of $50.65, for the last nine months earnings per share are up 26% and expensive growth plans, like the $1 billion Cars Land at Disneyland, are proving to have been good bets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disney CEO Robert Iger tells the Wall Street Journal that the success is not just a seasonal blip. He expects investments in parks, cruise lines and Asia to continue to pay off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When you look carefully at Disney's growth, so much of it is driven by the film studio. Take California Adventure as an example. When the park opened in 2001, it was a monument to the wonderful attractions in the state of California, from Hollywood to Yosemite to Santa Monica Pier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But no one wanted to go. So over the years Disney has gradually transformed it into Pixar park. Before Cars Land opened the ride with the longest wait was Toy Story Mania, a 3-D ride where guests compete by shooting virtual plates, balls and hoops at screens. (It's incredibly fun.) Cars Land is rivaling Toy Story for wait times. California Adventure now attracts half of all visitors, up from one-quarter, according to the Journal article. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People want to go to the park to immerse themselves in the movies they love. Cars Land is not some vague homage to the movie, it's a replica of the town of Radiator Spring including things like the Cozy Cone Motel and Flo's V8 Cafe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To continue to grow at its current pace, Disney needs to keep producing films that are going to provide the company with opportunities for theme park attractions, TV spin-offs and lots and lots of merchandise. Disney is an $89 billion (market cap) beast with many mouths that need to be constantly fed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The studio's recent big hit, The Avengers, is the perfect Disney meal. The film grossed $1.5 billion at the global box office. It will generate billions more for the company from Iron Man, Thor and Hulk toy sales, a TV show is in the works for Disney's cable network and there are rumors that Avengers rides could eventually show up at Disney parks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course Disney is not alone. All of the major studios are now owned by huge media conglomerate that include merchandising, TV, publishing and, sometimes, theme parks. It makes business sense for the studios to focus as much energy and money as possible on the biggest films that will generate the most revenue down the line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That makes it harder to justify smaller films unless their budgets are really small, under $20 million, as opposed to a mid-budget film in the $50 to $80 million range. A film like The Help (which cost only $25 million to make, not including marketing costs) earned a nice profit for the studio grossing $211 million at the box office but don't expect any sequels, cartoons or Minny pies at Disneyland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'm of course exaggerating when I say the death of mid-budget films. Studios will still put out some mid-budget comedies and romances and there will always been smaller production companies like Alcon that will be willing to foot the bill for smaller films because they don't need all of those spin-off opportunities to be profitable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with the content from entertainment driving more and more of these big studios' growth, those smaller films become much harder to justify.

According to his hitchhiking chronicle Carsick, his very first driver was “Harris,” “an art school type” with a sideline in weed dealing who called himself a fan. They talked for a bit about movies before Harris asked the (five) million-dollar question: “How come you aren’t making a movie?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I explain that I had a development deal to make Fruitcake,” Waters writes, but on the eve of that dark holiday comedy’s production, “the recession happened, the independent film business as I knew it fell apart, and now all the distributors and film financiers want the budgets to be under $2 million, which I can’t do anymore.” His traveling companion told Waters, “I’ll back it,” pledging five million dollars cash. “You pay me back if it ever breaks even.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was only one problem with Harris’ offer: It was a total fantasy. There was no Harris, and there was no five million dollars. The scene was part of “The Best That Could Happen,” a novella of perfect, imaginary hitchhiking encounters, within Carsick. But it’s instructive, and sad, that when Waters — a well-dressed dandy of notorious sexual appetites — compiles his biggest fantasies, the very first one is of someone doing what people used to do all the time: giving him money to make a movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Waters isn’t the only beloved filmmaker harboring this fantasy. “It’s a strange time. There’s not a whole lot that any of us can do about it,” David Lynch, who hasn’t directed a feature since 2006’s Inland Empire, explained over the summer. “You’ve seen waves of things go up and down, but maybe the arthouse will be back in vogue, and they’ll reappear all over the place again. I don’t know. It would be beautiful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn’t always this way. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when Waters and Lynch were doing their most commercially successful work, it was possible to finance — either independently or via or the studio system — mid-budget films (anywhere from $5 million to $60 million) with an adult sensibility. But slowly, quietly, over roughly the decade and a half since the turn of the century, the paradigm shifted. Studios began to make fewer films, betting big on would-be blockbusters, operating under the assumption that large investments equal large returns. Movies that don’t fit into that box (thoughtful dramas, dark comedies, oddball thrillers, experimental efforts) were relegated to the indies, where freedom is greater, but resources are far more limited. As Mad Men’s Matthew Weiner put it, “Something happened that nobody can make a movie between $500,000 and $80 million. That can’t be possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While we weren’t looking, the mid-budget adult-oriented motion picture has all but disappeared. And the gifted directors behind them are in danger of disappearing as well. Movie wonks and box-office watchers have written and talked about the death of mid-budget filmmaking, but mostly in business terms — as opposed to personal ones, contemplating the phenomenon’s effect on the individual artists it cripples. There’s an entire constellation of cult and indie stars, filmmakers who came of age in the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, who have either vanished from the current scene or are struggling to maintain a place within it. How many of that generation’s auteurs have we lost? How many great movies — how many Blue Velvets and Hairsprays and Traffics and Do the Right Things and Godfathers — are they, thanks to the current myopic model, not making? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I look back on my life and it’s 95 percent running around trying to raise money to make movies and five percent actually making them. It’s no way to live.” –Orson Welles NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That quote appears in the recent documentary film Seduced and Abandoned, a combination love letter and wail of despair over the current state of filmmaking, written and directed by James Toback (who wrote Bugsy and directed Fingers, The Pick-Up Artist, Two Girls and a Guy, and others). In one of the film’s many candid conversations, an international financier tells Toback that the film he wants to make — a boundary-pushing political/sexual thriller starring Alec Baldwin and Neve Campbell — can’t get financed for the $25 million budget he has in mind. How much could he get? Toback asks. Four to five million, he’s told. Toback sighs. “I’m too old for that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sentiment is not uncommon. “The film business has changed. They want you to make it for no money,” Waters has said, by way of explaining his self-imposed hiatus from filmmaking. “Early in my career, it was fine to have no money. Everyone starts out without money. But I have four employees today. I have no desire to be a faux-underground filmmaker at 68 years old. I don’t have any needlepoint pillows with slogans on them, but if I did, it would be ‘Don’t Go Backward.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Francis Ford Coppola made four of the finest films in motion picture history, but he can’t get a movie produced anymore; after a ten-year exile, he made three films between 2007 and 2011 that were basically self-financed (via his lucrative wine-making business). “You try to go to a producer today and say you want to make a film that hasn’t been made before; they will throw you out because they want the same film that works, that makes money,” he said at the Marrakech International Film Festival. “That tells me that although the cinema in the next 100 years is going to change a lot, it will slow down because they don’t want you to risk anymore.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steven Soderbergh saw the writing on the wall, telling an audience at the San Francisco International Film Festival, “The meetings have gotten pretty weird. There are fewer and fewer executives who are in the business because they love movies. There are fewer and fewer executives that know movies… You’ve got people who don’t know movies and don’t watch movies for pleasure deciding what movie you’re going to be allowed to make.” He made a well-publicized exit from feature filmmaking last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m not Steven Soderbergh, I’m not banishing myself,” insisted his contemporary Spike Lee recently. “I’m adaptable! So do not think this is a film saying, ‘Fuck Hollywood, I never wanna do another studio film.’ That is not the case at all. But, there’s some films the studio doesn’t wanna make.” Lately, that’s included more and more Spike Lee films; he made these statements at the festival premiere of Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, a film he had to go to Kickstarter to finance. “Malcolm X was a studio film,” he noted. “Do the Right Thing was a studio film.” And he’s right — but it’s hard to imagine a studio financing either of those films now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, what happened? What caused this elemental shift between the way filmmakers like Lee, Soderbergh, Lynch, Coppola, Toback, and Waters worked a mere ten or 20 years ago, and the climate today? How has the industry left so many of our most important and influential filmmakers out in the cold? Well, to answer that question, I’m afraid we’re going to have to do some math. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s important to understand what we’re talking about when we talk about movie budgets. The numbers you hear about are the costs of making the film, and only those: pre-production, cast and crew salaries, sets and equipment and props and costumes, special effects and post-production. What it doesn’t include is the cost of marketing the movie. And hashtags on posters aside, studios are still remarkably old-fashioned when it comes to marketing, relying primarily on print and television ad buys. But in the modern, crowded multimedia landscape, the kind of saturation that makes them feel comfortable — even when it’s promoting a giant tentpole blockbuster that everyone is fully aware of — is very, very expensive. Sometimes it’s 50 percent of the production budget, and sometimes it’s even more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that high price tag — which, unlike a production budget, doesn’t have much wiggle room on a major release — is why, counter-intuitive though it might seem, a studio would rather make a $60 million movie than, say, a $10 million one. Studios are no longer interested in small investments with small return, which aren’t worth the time or the money. They want the big enchilada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ted Hope, author of Hope for Film, CEO of the VOD site Fandor, and producer of such films as The Ice Storm, Happiness, American Splendor, and Waters’ A Dirty Shame, tells me, “We had a deal at Universal, and finally our executive got fed up with us, and said ‘Ted, you need to give me movies that are theme park rides.’ We laugh, but I think now you see that more than ever, right? The business of Hollywood isn’t getting people to see movies. It’s [creating] these platforms that can exist as Broadway plays, as theme park rides, as a series of young adult novels, that can be across all different verticals. And we are ignoring so many other people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The groundbreaking director Susan Seidelman worked her way up the way you’re supposed to: she made a successful low-budget debut feature, 1982’s Smithereens, then graduated to Desperately Seeking Susan, a $4.5 million-budgeted sleeper hit that grossed $27 million in 1985. She made Susan, and her subsequent films of the decade, for Warner Brothers and the now-defunct Orion, which she calls “a looser sort of studio.” Seidelman says that the New York-based outfit “strongly supported directors, which is why Woody Allen made a lot of his movies for Orion, and Jonathan Demme too.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You could make movies in the ten-to-20-million-dollar budget range,” she tells me, almost wistfully. “They didn’t have to be huge blockbusters. They could be more adult-oriented, they didn’t have to appeal to absolutely everyone in the world, and if it’s good work then the studio was happy with making a good profit, but it was a different model… And I think over the years, what happened is that things have gotten really polarized. To studios now, to make a million dollars isn’t a big deal — you have to make a billion dollars, right?” She laughs. “They have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world, so to make a $20 million movie that makes $60 million, why put their money there?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This explosion of budgets occurred slowly but surely over the course of the last two decades. Back in 1997, the cost of an average studio film was $60 million — and the New York Times ran a now-hilarious report on that utterly preposterous figure, one studio heads at the time classified as “upsetting,” and “disturbing.” Sherry Lansing, then head of Paramount, told the Times, “I’m horrified at these numbers. They don’t make sense. We’re killing ourselves.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What’s striking about that figure now is that, for most studios, a major $60 million release would be a bargain. That number has gone up (and, up, and up) in the years since; in 2007, the last year the MPAA compiled an average studio budget, it was up to $106.6 million. As the average has ticked up, the middle ground has fallen out, and the output of the major studios has gotten both riskier and safer — more expensive, but with less variety. Sherry Lansing’s “They don’t make sense” quote in that Times piece stuck with me, so as an experiment, I looked up her studio’s slate for the year of its publication, 1997 — and then compared it with their output for this year. And the results of that comparison go a long way toward telling the story of the direction mainstream moviemaking has taken in those 17 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paramount’s 1997 slate included a robust 19 films, counting co-productions and pick-ups. These are what their budgets and grosses looked like: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Relic: $40 million budget, $34 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Beautician and the Beast: $16 million budget, $11 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Private Parts: $20 million budget, $41 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Saint: $68 million budget, $118 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breakdown: $36 million budget, $50 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Night Falls on Manhattan: $22 million budget*, $9 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Til There Was You: $10 million budget, $3.5 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Face/Off: $80 million budget, $245 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kiss Me, Guido: $740K budget, $1.9 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Good Burger: $9 million budget, $23.7 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Event Horizon: $60 million budget, $26 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Smile Like Yours: $18 million budget, $3.3 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In & Out: $35 million budget, $64 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kiss the Girls: $27 million budget, $61 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FairyTale: A True Story: n/a budget, $14 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Switchback: $38 million budget, $6 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rainmaker: $40 million budget, $46 million domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Titanic: $200 million budget, $2.187 billion worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Education of Little Tree: n/a budget, $323K gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Budget figures are unavailable for two of those films, but based on the final product, they seem to have been pretty low-budget efforts. And even leaving out that pair, the variety among these budgets is striking; the studio was releasing everything from micro-budget pick-ups like Kiss Me, Guido to low-budget, tween-centric comedies like the $9 million Good Burger to the $27 million thriller Kiss the Girls to the $35 million comedy In and Out to $60 million genre films like Event Horizon. The numbers are all over the map, and while Paramount took a few hits, they also did well enough on other titles to offset the difference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, the outlier in both the budget and gross columns is Titanic, and that entry is the one that shook the business to its foundation, and pointed the way towards its future. You can see the pre-Titanic path for the blockbuster elsewhere on the list, in the form of The Saint and Face/Off. The latter was fairly expensive, did solid business domestically ($112 million), and fared even better overseas ($133 million). The Saint barely earned back its budget here ($61 million), but got into the clear thanks to foreign box office ($56 million) that was respectable enough. (Interestingly, these were the only titles with worldwide box office numbers currently available.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The modest profits of those films, or Kiss the Girls or In & Out, more then cover the losses of the lesser titles. But Titanic was the game-changer, a wildly expensive (and, lest we forget, over-budget) production that became a worldwide megahit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With that in mind, let’s have a look at Paramount’s slate for this year. The first divergence of note is the decrease in output: only 11 films, three of them not yet released (so earnings figures are not yet available). They are: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones: $5 million budget, $90.9 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit: $60 million budget, $135.5 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noah: $125 million budget, $362 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Transformers: Age of Extinction: $210 million budget, $1.08 billion worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hercules: $100 million budget, $242 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: $125 million budget, $474 million worldwide gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Men, Women, and Children: $16 million budget, $705K domestic gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interstellar: $165 million budget, $593 million worldwide gross (and counting) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top Five: $6 million budget, n/a gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Selma: $20 million budget, n/a gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Gambler: n/a budget, n/a gross NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And thus you have a snapshot of how the studio system has evolved over this relatively short period of time. Taking The Gambler out of the mix (its budget has not yet been reported — aside from being comparatively low), you have a horror sequel and a comedy made for $6 million or less, five blockbusters made for over $100 million, and only three more in between. Jack Ryan checks in at that 1997 average of $60 million, and appears to have barely eked out its costs overseas, while Men, Women, and Children tanked (to be fair, it was also terrible). Selma’s fate remains to be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s no question that this model is profitable, more so than what we see in 1997. But it’s also resulting in multiplex monotony — and frankly, if studios are printing money with these tentpole movies, why not siphon off some of those mega-profits to a few filmmakers who actually have something to say? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More importantly, if the bottom has dropped out of the valley between big-budget and no-budget, where have those films — and the filmmakers behind them — gone? Two places. The first and most obvious is the increasingly crowded indie scene. (We’ll get to the second one a bit later.) Back to Professor Soderbergh: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2003, 455 films were released. 275 of those were independent, 180 were studio films. Last year 677 films were released. So you’re not imagining things, there are a lot of movies that open every weekend. 549 of those were independent, 128 were studio films. So, a 100% increase in independent films, and a 28% drop in studio films, and yet, ten years ago: Studio market share 69%, last year 76%. You’ve got fewer studio movies now taking up a bigger piece of the pie and you’ve got twice as many independent films scrambling for a smaller piece of the pie. That’s hard. That’s really hard. When I was coming up, making an independent film and trying to reach an audience I thought was like, trying to hit a thrown baseball. This is like trying to hit a thrown baseball – but with another thrown baseball. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The avalanche of product has been keenly felt across the indie scene. In earlier years, Hope tells me, “the financial model was relatively secure.” Thanks to the robust DVD market and other ancillary sources, “there was a predictive revenue stream, and that allowed us to take risks on directors — I think I produced 25 first features — and allowed us to break many stars’ careers, and introduce many actors early on.” Then, in the back half of the last decade, the bottom fell out of the DVD market, mostly due to the rise of cheap streaming and the general economic malaise of the recession. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Cut to now,” Hope explains, “five years or so post- the effects of the world financial crisis, and the films that maybe once were made for $15 million are now being made for under five. The percentage of fees have all been cut in half, so everybody ends up having to make more movies to survive, which means that they can’t make quality, they can only make quantity.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So even if a Lynch, a Waters, or a Soderbergh decided to suck it up and “go backward,” they’d face a variety of obstacles. First, the budgets might be even lower than they remember. Whit Stillman made three successful independent films in the early 1990s and then didn’t make a film for a decade and a half. Before shooting that film, he tells me, he had a conversation with another director, “one who had commercial hits in the ‘90s.” His colleague told Stillman “that to make films now, budgets had to be exceptionally, amazingly low. Then it turned out that he meant ‘under 200,000’ while I was thinking ‘under two million.’ These are the two ranges I think of when considering the viability of projects.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But let’s assume they’re willing to take the cut (and for comparison’s sake: $200K would be less than Stillman’s ever worked with, even on his first film, Metropolitan — and those were 1989 dollars). Say they manage to scrounge together foreign dollars or equity financing or investments from friends and family or Kickstarter funds. They’ll still find themselves competing in a much more crowded indie landscape — and that’s operating off the presumption of easy distribution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Those filmmakers are now in their mid- to late 60s, and older,” says Susan Seidelman (herself on the eve of her 62nd birthday), and as a result, they might want to tell stories about older characters like themselves. It’s not always that easy. Her 2006 film Boynton Beach Club was “a kind of a date movie for people 60 and above.” After it was finished, “it got accepted to a lot of festivals, it got nice reviews, and still a lot of the traditional distribution companies said, ‘We don’t believe there’s a big enough audience out there.’ My producers and I disagreed, so we decided to start out self-distributing.” It was only after the film started doing good business in target markets (“South Florida, for example”) that it was picked up by Roadside Attractions and Samuel Goldwyn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So even if, by some miracle, the film is produced, it still has to make its way in an increasingly competitive marketplace, often in the hands of independent distributors and art-house exhibitors who are nearly as risk-averse as their mainstream counterparts. Spend a bit of time considering the hoops they’d have to jump through, and it’s no wonder so many iconic filmmakers are bowing out; they’ve already got a legacy, so why bother with the extra aggravation? “John Waters doesn’t need much money for his films,” Hope told me, “but the fact is, he’s probably making more money, with his artwork and tours, than he would for his films. So why does he need to compromise in order to get a movie made? It’s only going to be suffering for him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the filmmakers who don’t have that kind of financial security? Increasingly, they’re saying to hell with it and going to television. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think there’s a lot of deep philosophical debate,” Soderbergh told The Daily Beast during the run of The Knick, the ten-episode Cinemax series that he directed in full. “There are more possibilities in TV, in terms of storytelling, than there are in the movies… Movies don’t have time to find audiences anymore. With TV, it’s nice to feel like you’re part of a conversation that’s going on — as opposed to the movie business, which is only judged by one prism these days: economic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And so the movie makers who aren’t interested in tentpoles and don’t want to go back to financing films on their credit cards are following Soderbergh in a mass migration from the big screen to the small one. Cary Fukunaga (Sin Nombre, Jane Eyre) helmed the entire first season of True Detective. Jill Soloway followed up her art-house hit Afternoon Delight by directing the full first season of Amazon’s Transparent (and will reportedly do the same for its second). David Fincher directed the initial episodes of Netflix’s House of Cards; Jodie Foster, Joel Schumacher, James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross), and Carl Franklin (Devil in a Blue Dress) have followed suit. Indie comedy and drama directors — including Lynn Shelton (New Girl, Mad Men, The Mindy Project), Nicole Holofcener (Parks and Recreation, Enlightened, Bored to Death), Rian Johnson (Breaking Bad, Terriers), and Todd Haynes (Enlightened) — are frequently squeezing in episodic gigs between films. And the freedom of pay cable was even enough to coax David Lynch back into the director’s chair, for Showtime’s upcoming Twin Peaks revival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seidelman was a bit of a groundbreaker here, helming the pilot episode of Sex and the City back in 1998. “What happened is, when the middle ground fell out in the movie industry, those projects or filmmakers that were more interested in character-oriented stuff, or in more complicated subject matter, suddenly started turning to television,” she says. “TV has really picked up the slack there, and I think it’s also gained a kind of respectability — there was a time before HBO and Showtime, where it was looked at as not as prestigious. And if you were a director, you didn’t really want to work in TV as much; you were selling your soul a little bit. But that isn’t the case at all these days.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stillman agrees. After his long-awaited comeback film Damsels in Distress, he went over to Amazon to make The Cosmopolitans. “What has affected my thinking a lot is that people, especially younger people, are going to the cinema much less,” he explains. “There are few ‘event’ indies anymore. And it’s great to work in a medium in which a lot of people can see the show right away. So just as financing mid-budget films has become especially tough, there is a boom in financing of new media — but one can never assume how long such boomlets are going to last.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Film’s loss is TV’s gain — for now. But is television an acceptable substitute for the scale and scope of a major motion picture? The budgets are often scarcely better than those low numbers on the indie model, and it’s a very different type of storytelling, open-ended, rarely working towards the kind of satisfying conclusions a great movie can offer. Plus, few get the kind of control over an entire series or season that Soderbergh, Lynch, Solloway, or Fukunaga do, making it much more difficult to establish an authorial voice and style. And filmmakers who don’t yet have Soderbergh and Lynch’s clout will most likely find network suits even less intellectually and experimentally accommodating than their film-exec counterparts. Even the warm embrace of HBO couldn’t keep Mike White’s Enlightened or Christopher Guest’s Family Tree on the air; ditto Frank Darabont’s Mob City on TNT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How long, then, will the current filmmaking model hold? No less an authority than Steven Spielberg predicted last year, “There’s going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even half a dozen of these mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm again.” Ted Hope agrees. “You look at the worst summer attendance [in 2014], box office dropped 15 percent, people like [DreamWorks Animation CEO and former Disney chief Jeffrey] Katzenberg saying that movies aren’t a growth industry, everything pointing toward the collapse of the foreign sales model.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, where does he think it’s going? “It feels incredibly vulnerable to me,” he says. “Look, I’m surprised the superhero stuff has the legs that it does, but you look at what Warner Brothers and Marvel have mapped out, you add into it all of the Universal monster movies and all these others platform plays, and you better hope that nobody’s taste changes for the next five years, you know? That’s not a diverse portfolio!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This may not be the new normal — studio filmmaking may be on the verge of the point it reached in the mid-to-late 1960s, when a bad run of bloated, runaway productions, reflecting market calculation rather than vibrant storytelling, just about put the studios out of business. The movies only managed to save themselves because the suits handed over the car keys to young filmmakers with original stories to tell and a new way of telling them. That’s how the New Hollywood movement was born — less out of the inspiration of the new than the desperation of the old. And since it’s a cyclical business, that might be what saves the movies again: the urge to burn it all down and start over fresh. The question is, how many great films and great filmmakers will we lose in the meantime? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [*UPDATE 12/12: We were initially unable to pinpoint the budget for the film Night Falls on Manhattan. After this piece was published, we were contacted by a source who worked on that film and provided that number.

Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nLetter of Resignation from the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sorry, we’re full! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That’s $146,127 per year — an entire professional’s income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits. We already see openings at our police department that we can’t fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can’t renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in Palo Alto but many miles in each direction. I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don’t want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Time and again, I’ve seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city’s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last 5 years I’ve seen dozens of my friends leave Palo Alto and often leave the Bay Area entirely. I’ve seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing. I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto’s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents’ accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today.

While we are leaving Palo Alto, the organization I co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community.

Reset Search Options\nPassage 3:\nFor the past two years, Kate Downing has been one of Palo Alto's most passionate advocates for building more affordable housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As one of the founding members of the citizens group Palo Alto Forward and a member of the city's Planning and Transportation Commission, she also has been a vehement critic of the city's recent tilt toward slow-growth policies, and its failure to address a housing shortage that many in the community and some on the City Council believe has reached a crisis level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Downing Kate Downing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Time and again, I've seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority,\" Downing wrote. \"The City Council received over 1,000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city's development, which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing, which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only available to Joe Millionaires.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her resignation letter, Downing pointed to the city's difficulties in filling job openings in the Palo Alto Police Department and renewing contracts with the local teachers because of the \"astronomical\" cost of housing, not just in Palo Alto but \"many miles in each direction.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is clear, she wrote, that \"if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing herself is facing similar challenges, despite the fact that she is a corporate attorney and her husband is a software engineer at Palantir. For several years, they have been renting a home in the Ventura neighborhood. Now, they are preparing to move to Santa Cruz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her resignation letter, Downing wrote that \"After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We rent our current home with another couple for $6,200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance,\" Downing wrote. \"That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing also noted that over the last five years, she'd seen dozens of her friends leave Palo Alto and, in some cases, the Bay Area. She also said that she has seen friends from other states get job offers in Palo Alto and then turn them down whey they started to look at the price of housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch,\" Downing wrote. \"If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto's streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents’ accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today,\" she wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing is hardly alone in urging the council to act with more urgency on promoting affordable housing. In March, more than 1,000 residents, including numerous former mayors and planning commissioners, signed a petition spearheaded by Palo Alto Forward that urged the council to do more to address this topic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cost of living in Palo Alto has skyrocketed. As a result, we are seeing long-time neighbors move because they can no longer afford the rent,\" the petition stated. \"It is not unusual for Palo Alto workers to commute in from areas as far as Stockton, Gilroy and Tracy, putting severe strain on our roads and our climate. We are on the path to being a city composed only of long-time landowners and wealthy newcomers. This situation is the result of city policies that have discouraged new housing while encouraging more office space.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recent surveys also suggest that residents are growing increasingly anxious about getting priced out of Palo Alto. In the city's annual survey, the number of people who gave Palo Alto good grades for \"variety of housing options” dropped from 27 percent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2015, while the percentage of people who ranked the city as a good or excellent place to retire dropped from 60 percent to 52 percent between 2014 and 2015 (in 2006, it was 68 percent). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local concerns about housing were also highlighted in a poll that the city commissioned last spring, when it was considering whether to proceed with a business tax to address traffic congestion. The poll showed 76 percent of the respondents listing \"cost of housing\" as an \"extremely serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, a higher percentage than any other issue (the drought and traffic congestion scored second and third, with 65 percent and 53 percent, respectively). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing's letter comes at a particularly sensitive time for local politics. The city is about to hold its first City Council election since the slow-growth \"residentialist\" camp won the council majority in 2014 and four of the council's nine seats will be up for grabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several candidates jumping into the race, including current planning commission Chair Adrian Fine, Human Relations Commission Chair Greer Stone and technology executive Michelle Kraus (all of whom are renters) have vowed to make creation of more housing options a priority if elected.

You work in tech. You've got it made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not if you want to buy a house in Silicon Valley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, a planning commissioner here became the very public voice of the region's frustrations over spiraling housing costs when she published her resignation letter to the city of Palo Alto. It said that she and her husband are moving to Santa Cruz because -- even with their combined incomes as a tech lawyer and software engineer -- they can't afford to live in this upscale city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After five years of \"trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here,\" Planning and Transportation Commissioner Kate Downing wrote in her public resignation letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter makes personal what the numbers show: That rising rents and home prices of recent years have put the region beyond the reach of many, even some at the top of the heap -- including in the lucrative tech industry that fuels the rush for housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average rent in Palo Alto was $3,463 in the second quarter of 2016, according to a report last month from Novato-based RealFacts. In June, the median price of a single-family home was $1.2 million in San Mateo County and $982,500 in Santa Clara County, according to the CoreLogic real estate information service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing, 31, has a full-time job as senior corporate counsel to a tech company in Santa Clara. In an interview, she explained that her letter \"is not supposed to be a sad story about me. I'm going to land on my feet. I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged. I'm going to be fine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather, she characterized the letter as a warning call about economic trends and failed policies that are hurting Palo Alto and the region. \"It's clear,\" she wrote, \"that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders and service workers are in dire straits.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing and her engineer husband, Steve Downing, 33, share a 2,300-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Palo Alto's Ventura neighborhood with another couple. The monthly rent is $6,200. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's actually pretty cheap for here,\" she said in the interview. \"We probably pay on the low end of what they could get for our home.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her letter calculated that if the couple \"wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7 million, and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance. That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Downings based those numbers on putting 20 percent down: \"If you put down less than that, you're not going to get picked,\" she said. \"Everyone knows how competitive it is in Palo Alto, with multiple offers on every house. Some of them are putting down all cash. They're coming in with just gigantic deposits.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing's letter, a colleague said, is a timely commentary on Palo Alto's changing demographics: \"All of us who are in our 20s and 30 and 40s -- we're used to seeing people leave,\" said Elaine Uang, a co-founder with Downing of the community group Palo Alto Forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You never know when your friends are going to go because there aren't the right housing options here for them to pursue the next stage of life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A commissioner since November 2014, Downing said in the letter that the city has failed to move the dial on housing. Stating that her own recommendations to the City Council have gone nowhere, she outlined some of the ways in which the housing supply might be expanded in order to \"make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She mentioned \"small steps like allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-used developments,\" as well as legalizing duplexes, streamlining restrictions on granny units and \"enforcing minimum-density requirements\" so that developers will \"build apartments instead of penthouses.\" Housing should be allowed, she wrote, above shops and offices in single-use areas like the Stanford Shopping Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Kate does a good job summarizing the challenges we're facing as a community,\" said Councilman Cory Wolbach. \"To say that Palo Alto has been slow to add housing is a very accurate statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's nothing shocking here,\" he added, in regard to Downing's letter. \"Palo Alto certainly does not encourage high-density, smaller, more reasonably priced units. It's unfortunate but true.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Palo Alto \"is not the family-oriented community it used to be,\" Downing said. In her estimation, it's becoming a place for \"jet-setting executives and investors\" who have neither the time or inclination to help out with block parties or join Neighborhood Watch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Young people are not moving here anymore. It used to be a place of innovation, where people created art and sculpture in their backyards or started companies in their garages. Now, it's more for people who are CEOs and executive vice presidents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contact Richard Scheinin at 408-920-5069, read his stories at www.mercurynews.com/richard-scheinin and follow him at Twitter.com/RealEstateRag.\nPassage 5:\nIn what’s becoming a regular story in the Bay Area, many Peninsula towns’ refusal to increase housing has led to a mass exit of long-time, working-class residents. First responders, police, teachers, grocery store clerks—the list goes on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These small cities, rich with tech money and close-proximity desirability, have left it to San Francisco, Oakland, and only a few other areas to house the influx of new-moneyed arrivals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And with that, another noteworthy exodus has taken place: Palo Alto Planning and Transportation commissioner Kate Vershov Downing and her family have decided to leave the pricey town for Santa Cruz because they, like many other residents, can no longer afford the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a letter of resignation, she starts off saying: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That’s $146,127 per year — an entire professional’s income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing goes on to note that the city council is, in part, to blame for this mess, noting that pleas from citizenry for more housing go ignored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don’t want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout. Time and again, I’ve seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city’s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Menlo Park, Palo Alto’s housing stock is extremely pricey. You can hardly find a home on the market right now for less than $1 million. And there’s no sign of things slowing down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read the entire piece here.\n", "answers": ["Palo Alto's planning and transportation commissioner sat down and did the math: For Kate Vershov Downing and husband Steve to purchase a home similar to the 4-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot dwelling they currently rent (with another couple, at $6,200 a month), their monthly payment would be $12,177. That's $146,127 a year on mortgage, insurance, and taxes, and that's assuming they had half-a-million dollars for a down payment. \"This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer,\" she writes; she's senior corporate counsel to a tech company and her husband works for Palantir. And so after five years of trying to make it work in Silicon Valley, the Downings, \"cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family,\" Kate writes in a public resignation letter posted Tuesday announcing her move to Santa Cruz.

Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner has acknowledged he communicated... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW YORK (AP) — Online communications between disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl are being investigated by law enforcement agencies in New York and North Carolina, officials said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The office of Jill Westmoreland Rose, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte, has \"begun investigative efforts,\" a spokeswoman said. An FBI task force in New York designed to combat the sexual exploitation of children also is investigating, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing case and spoke on the condition of anonymity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigations were launched after an online outlet, DailyMail.com, on Wednesday published an interview with the girl in which she describes online and text exchanges with Weiner that went on for several months this year. The girl said that during a Skype chat Weiner asked her to undress and touch herself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner, a Democrat who resigned from Congress in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, didn't return text or email messages seeking comment on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a statement he gave to The Associated Press on Wednesday he said he had \"likely been the subject of a hoax,\" and he provided an email written by the girl in which she recants her story. He also apologized, noting he had \"repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl, whose identity the Daily Mail didn't reveal, said she told her father and a teacher about the relationship.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for the FBI and a spokesman for federal prosecutors in Manhattan declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and has a young son with her.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and before Weiner's wife, Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ending their marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE TEEN ON TAPE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony Weiner carried on a months-long sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl online, and even sent her photos of himself, including one of him in a pool NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The high school girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one message, he tells the girl he was 'hard' after thinking of her that morning NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another message, both Weiner and the girl tell each other they feel like they can tell each other anything NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pair even joke about nicknames for each other, and Weiners old name of 'Carlos Danger.'

'The app is designed for confidentiality, and automatically deletes messages and images after the first time they are read or viewed. However, the girl took photos of a few of the messages and images from last February and March, which she shared with the Dailymail.com.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When confronted with the claims, Weiner did not deny exchanging 'flirtatious' messages with the teen. He declined to comment on the specifics of the allegations on the record, but provided copies of two emails the girl sent him that he contends raised questions about her claims. DailyMail.com publishes them below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He gave a statement to DailyMail.com in which he says, in part: ' I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WHAT ANTHONY WEINER TOLD DAILYMAIL.COM 'I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. 'I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt. 'While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. 'I am sorry.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation comes just weeks after Weiner's wife Huma Abedin announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner has faced a number of sexting scandals since 2011, when he was forced to resign from Congress after his online sexual messages with a female college student were revealed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another sexting scandal in 2013, involving 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, derailed his bid for New York City mayor. In the course of that scandal, his alias Carlos Danger was disclosed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former congressman has faced scrutiny over online chats with minors in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, he admitted to sending five private Twitter messages to a 17-year-old girl, but said the messages 'were neither explicit nor indecent'. The girl's family told the New York Times that the conversation appeared to be harmless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DailyMail.com reached out to the 15-year-old girl's family earlier this month after receiving information about her relationship with Weiner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the girl said she did not want to press charges because she believes her relationship with Weiner was consensual, she and her father agreed to sit down for an interview out of concern that Weiner may be sexting with other underage girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner and Abedin, still living in the same apartment despite their split, left separately Wednesday morning before the DailyMail.com story was posted online NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huma left to meet Hillary Clinton to fly to Orlando to campaign; Weiner went for a walk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl first reached out to Weiner on the evening of January 23, 2016, when she noticed his Twitter page allowed non-followers to contact him through private messages NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner sent the teen a bare-chested picture of himself with his hand on his crotch NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'If there's anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward, maybe use my daughter's example to have the courage to come forward,' said her father, whose name is also being withheld to shield the girl's identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He explains that he did not contact authorities to report Weiner because his daughter asked him not to. 'I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn't want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through interviews and a collection of online messages from applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Kik, and Confide, DailyMail.com has pieced together a timeline of Weiner's relationship with the underage girl. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl first reached out to Weiner on the evening of January 23, 2016, when she noticed his Twitter page allowed non-followers to contact him through direct private messages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told DailyMail.com she was interested in politics and had heard about his sexting scandals, and was curious to see what he was like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com she didn't consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a 'romantic' one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Why did I message you [in January]?' the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week.

I didn't want to appear suspicious.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also told Weiner: 'I was obsessed with you.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and the girl's home state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The messages started out as small talk, and during their conversation the girl noticed that Weiner had also found her profile on Facebook and sent her a friend request. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Where do you go to school?' Weiner asked her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR '[Redacted] High School,' she responded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still sexting? Weiner was out and about at the park with his son on Tuesday, but took time out to engage with his phone NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Closest aide: Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest aide and vice-chair of her campaign. The two's closeness goes back to when Abedin was a teenage White House intern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huma Abedin announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy. when the former congressmen sent a 40-year-old woman provocative shirtless photos of himself while his toddler son was curled up next to him in bed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early the next morning, Weiner found the girl on Facebook, sent her a friend request and they began messaging NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner sent the teen a picture of himself - with this undershirt rolled up to expose his stomach - and his son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one Facebook message, the girl tells Weiner that she's 'very good at keeping a secret' from her parents NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'You are kinda sorta gorgeous,' Weiner told her, before asking around midnight why she wasn't with a boyfriend that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'My dad is overprotective,' said the girl. '[Boyfriends] couldn't be at my house this late.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next morning, the girl woke up to find a private message from Weiner on Facebook asking how her night had gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'How did you sleep?' the girl asked him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Not great. Woke up very, uh, eager,' he replied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He continued to send her flirtatious messages throughout the day, saying he was 'imagining' her when she was in the shower and saying she must get a lot of male attention at the gym. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Weiner indicated that he knew the conversation could be a problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR '[I]f anyone would get the wrong impression we should say goodbye now,' said Weiner. However, he did not stop the conversation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead he told the girl they could talk over other chat applications that would not be monitored by her parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They began talking on Kik, an instant message app, where Weiner used the screen name 'T Dog.' He sent her photos of himself shirtless, including one photo of him in a hot tub that showed his face. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Maybe delete that. Hehe,' he wrote after sending it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In many of the messages, they discussed Weiner's trips to the gym and love of hockey, and the girl's school activities and her newly acquired learner's permit. But in a number of them, Weiner steered the conversation toward sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pair eventually move to another app, called TK, for conversing, in which they share several photos NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After sending a snap from a pool, Weiner tells the girl, 'Maybe delete that. Hehe.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She then tells Weiner that she doesn't think she would 'look good naked' at the time of messaging NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She says she is 'pale' and wants 'to work out more', but Weiner says the flaws 'would no doubt be overlooked' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I thought of you this am. Hard,' he wrote in one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl asked if she was the reason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Yes. And the solution,' responded Weiner, adding an emoji image of squirting water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Your body is pretty insane,' he told her at another point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the girl told Weiner she'd just gotten home from the gym, he wrote back, 'Hard. Again'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several of the messages involve finding times to talk over Skype, a video messaging application, when the girl's parents were asleep or out of the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Skype may have to be a tomorrow thing,' the girl wrote in one message. 'if I skyped you tonight id have to play music as we talked so that my parents couldn't hear me talking and I'd have to keep the lights off.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'No prob baby,' replied Weiner. 'Some other time. When it's easier.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR '[Weiner's] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,' she said. 'So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing 'I caught a glimpse of your body' and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,' said the girl. 'He would ask me to take my clothes off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,' she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Weiner did not get undressed on video, she alleges that he did send her nude photos of himself when they would sext over a messaging app. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The app, which is called Confide, is designed for confidentiality, and automatically deletes messages and images after the first time they are read or viewed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the girl took photos of a few of the messages and images from last February and March, which she shared with Dailymail.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shirtless: One of the messages from Kik, where Weiner used the alias T Dog NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, the girl asks Weiner if she was the reason he 'woke up so eager', and he said she was also 'the solution' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TEXT OF LETTER WEINER ASKED TEEN TO SEND TO TEACHER The teen wrote this letter but sent it to a fake email address and sent a copy to Weiner. Parts of the letter that might identify her are redacted. The teen told DailyMail.com what she had done. Weiner provided a copy of the letter in his belief it was sent to her teacher. Dr. XXXXX Thank you for being the perfect mentor. I remember the first time we met. I was a 'wise 92 year old stuck in a 13 year old's body' as you described me. I was a rising freshman. Above your door was a sign that said 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.' At that moment I knew that I'd love your class. I walked in and noticed a stack of all of my favorite literary works. Anything from Martin Amis to Albert Camus. We began chatting and I felt like I had known you my whole life. My freshman year [redacted]. I was the first freshman invited and I was thrilled. I started learning [redacted] at the age of 8 years old. I somehow managed [redacted]. You have brought me sooooo many projects. We started on the writing resources center. You and I would travel to the university to bring students to tutor kids at our school that were having a difficult time learning. I had the opportunity to work with some of the sweetest students at our school. I was able to earn 4 extra English course credits. We [redacted]. The student reporting labs have been an educational and a fun hands on experience. Aside from the plethora of knowledge you have graciously provided me with we have also had our deep, meaningful conversations. We share our writings with each other at least once a week. I have enjoyed reading your writings and I have been thankful for the feedback you have given me on mine. I recently shared with you a story about a former congressman. I contacted Anthony Weiner. Our online chats were never inappropriate, he was always very helpful and kind. I wanted to publish my story. He was the best candidate to pin the story to. The story needed a hoax to ride on. Speaking of candidates the election is coming up and his wife is Hillary Clinton's chief of staff. He doesn't have any credibility, I assumed no one would question the allegations. It was unfair to lie to you and my father. It was unfair to spread this false accusation against Anthony Weiner. He has done nothing to deserve this. I am sorry for lying to you, I hope this doesn't affect the bond we have formed over the years. Sincerely [Redcated] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'When we would Skype, he would tell me that he was very lonely and that it had been a year since he and his wife [Huma] had sex, and that she really didn't pay him any attention,' said the girl. 'We would talk, just chatting for about 30 minutes and it would lead to more sexual things…asking me to undress…he'd comment on my body. He asked me about masturbation, and that kind of thing.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sometimes, she claims, Weiner would ask the girl to dress up in plaid skirts and pretend he was her school teacher, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He would pretend like he was a teacher and I was a student. And he'd talk about me sitting in the front of his class, and him taking me after school,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also shared pornographic videos with her, she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl said she was not uncomfortable with the sexting, except for when Weiner would try to engage her in 'rape fantasies'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He had some rape fantasies. It would just be him showing up at my house when my dad was out of town,' she said. 'And just start undressing me, being forceful, asking me if I want to be dominated, strange questions.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said when she told him she was uncomfortable with this, he quickly agreed to change the subject. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl said she started feeling guilty about hiding the relationship, and told her father and a teacher about it in late April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Weiner asks if the girl's boyfriend is 'bigger than' him, she says he's a 'skinny nerdy boy' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner sent the girl a picture of his chest with welts he said he got from his heart check up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I was scared. I felt bad for talking to [Weiner],' she said. 'I felt a little guilty and I wrote [my dad] a letter telling him.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the girl also continued to talk to Weiner. The former congressman pressured her to write two more letters to her father and teacher saying that she lied about the natures of their relationship and the two of them were just friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told Weiner that she would do this, and she sent them to bogus email addresses and sent a copy to Weiner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'After I told my teacher about the relationship, [Weiner] wanted me to email my dad and my teacher and tell them that was I said was false,' she said. 'That the conversations were appropriate and were never inappropriate, and he was very helpful.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner sent DailyMail.com a copy of the letter he believed she sent to her teacher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl said she continued to talk to Weiner until July. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'After seeing what he did with his son having him in the picture that was released, I think that he's very disgusting and he needs help,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she never viewed him as her 'boyfriend', and that he made this clear by talking to her about his relationships with other women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He talked about women he would meet up with and have sex with, women he would meet at the gym, women he would chat with online,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He would also talk about going to different gyms, and getting different gym memberships, just to go watch 18-year-olds work out that would go to NYU and different schools in New York,' she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the girl tells Weiner that Skype will have to wait because her parents would hear, Weiner says 'No prob baby' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the girl says that she'll 'work out all of the time' if it 'turns you on', Weiner tells her that her 'body is pretty insane' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, she said he never mentioned relationships with other underage girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I actually asked him if he talked to other minors and he said not that he knew of, which is the risk that he kind of takes when he's talking to women on the internet,' she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girl's father said he was horrified when he learned 51-year-old Weiner had been speaking with his daughter over Skype. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I couldn't stomach that,' he said. 'That really was the worst part I think, was knowing that inappropriate behavior was available to my daughter by this man.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said if he ever met Weiner: 'There wouldn't be any words. There would be no words. I hope I never come in contact with him. I'll be in jail if I come into contact with him.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the girl said she does not regret the relationship, her father said the experience has changed her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'She's gone through some depression, we've sought counselling and been able to help her work through it,' he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'She's a bright girl, very smart, so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it's gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HOW I FELT: THE LETTER THE 15-YEAR-OLD SENT TO WEINER The teen wrote this letter to Anthony Weiner after her interview with DailyMail.com. Weiner gave it to DailyMail.com to publish, which he says indicates that he 'could have been the subject of a hoax.' The teen told us why she wrote it, saying: ' A few months ago Anthony asked me why I wanted to share my story, and I couldn't really give a good answer so I wanted to explain to him why I was doing it.' 'Don't be ashamed of your story. It will inspire others.' This quote lingered in my mind as my posture was consciously congruent to the hard back of my chair. The air was stale. All eyes were on me. My father's eyes wanted me to lie. At that moment, I had the moral backbone of an eclair. Why was I here? I didn't personally know Anthony Weiner. I felt myself hover over my own body. I was watching myself from above. I was not the same girl that I was when I walked into the hotel. Who was I becoming? Did I just sell my soul to the devil at fifteen? We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war's a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires and movie Gods. But we won't. And I'm learning that fact as my lips move. Fear blocked every rational thought. After leaving the hotel, I attempted to justify my every action. It wasn't a difficult task. Anthony continues to make the same mistake and expects a different result each time, he needs to learn his lesson. His wife is already leaving him, what I have done will not tear him apart. He fell in love with something and is letting it kill him. He needs to let go. The list continued to grow. Afterwards, I began to cry. I felt physically ill. I made the decision to not go to school the next day, I felt guilty, guilt is guilt. It doesn't go away. It can't be nullified. It can't even be fully understood, I'm certain- it's roots run too deep into private and long- standing karma. About the only thing that saves my neck when I get to feeling this way is that guilt is an imperfect form of knowledge. Just because it isn't perfect doesn't mean that it can't be used. The hard thing to do is to put it to practical use, before it gets around to paralyzing you. I messaged Anthony. He was trying to play victim... AGAIN! He treats me like I'm an invalid. I never call him out. I am used to his manipulative techniques, I know them very well. I used them long before he tried them on me. I see myself in him. I continue to talk to men online. My parents were not surprised that I contacted him. My dad started rattling off all the other occupations of these other guys.. First it was the teacher.. Yada, yada, yada.. They asked me when I would ever stop this kind of behavior. Why did Anthony and I do these ridiculous things? The only difference was that I didn't have to send out a press release every time that I did something like this. I was losing my soul. If you're losing your soul & you know it, then you still have a soul to lose. 'Apology': Why did I message you? I saw that your direct messages were open. I thought you had fallen off the face of the earth. I assumed you would have deleted your twitter for your wife's sake. I had watched a video of you that same night. I was studying you- for a book of course.You were my Hannibal Lecter. I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. I didn't want to appear suspicious. Why did you message me? I asked you the other day, you didn't return the question. You never do. You don't care enough about other people. 'It had been my job to get into Anthony's brain, but after nine months, I realized he didn't know a thing about me. I approached him at our post-campaign party and asked, 'Do you know I'm a single mom?' I wanted acknowledgment of what my family and I had sacrificed. He didn't know. 'You must feel good about yourself, accomplishing all of this,' he said, missing my point. Then the conversation turned back to him: 'I'm 50 years old, and I need to find a new career.' I smiled, same old Anthony. I said good night, and I haven't seen him since.' ( Provenz, Jessica. 'I Was Anthony Weiner's Longest-Serving Campaign Staffer. This Is What His Mayoral Run Was Really Like.' Daily Intelligencer. N.p., 2016. Web. 08 Sept. 2016. ) It doesn't just stop here, you did this with me on a numerous amount of occasions. You didn't inspect the emails to my teacher and my father. I made two fake emails. I used a ten minute mail, and created a Gmail. You believed me. I talked to you about committing suicide. You didn't try to stop me. I confided in you. I told you about older men taking advantage of me. You called me a liar. I offered proof. You rejected. It's like you don't want to know the answer to things. I believe that you don't go to therapy for that reason. Why do you continue to sext? Is it an addiction? Is it something psychological? Your brother was addicted to drugs. Does addiction run in your family? I can't fully grasp why I do it. I know that it's nice to feel worshipped. Sydney listed you as one of her heroes. You took advantage of her young, naive mind. She was infatuated with you.You should be glad that I am one of the most disensitized teenagers. I don't think I could ever been in love with someone I met over the internet. I did, however, enjoy listening to your podcasts, watching interviews, C-Span, etc. Talking to you helped me write my book about you. I was obsessed with you, the way one obsesses over a character in a book . One day you're going to mess with the wrong teenager, that has the wrong set of parents. Do yourself a favor and try to prevent that. It doesn't matter that you sext. It matters that you sext women you don't know. You tell me that you're in enormous pain (not sure if you're being honest, or playing victim), you read books such as 'So You've been publicly shamed'. It seems as if you have let these scandals consume you. Why do you let these women brand you with scandals. You WEAR your scandal. You were great at trying to change the world around you, why not try to change yourself?? You were a pleasant guy to talk to when you meditated. We fall in love with things, and we let it kill us. You don't have to do that. You're married to sexting and your wife is married to Clinton. If HRC jumped off of a bridge, your wife would be chasing after her, clutching Hillary's purse and jumping with her. Your image is going to affect your son, even Hugh Hefner has children. If you and your wife are truly being sincere about being dedicated to your son's best interest, pay attention to him. Don't photograph him as you sext. Don't give HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION! You're ruining his life before it has even begun. STOP MANIPULATING PEOPLE!!!! You asked me to lie to my teacher, my father, Sydney Leathers, and anyone that asked about this story. It's sick. You only care about yourself. You play victim ALL OF THE TIME. You attempted to make me feel bad about telling my teacher. You pretended that you were my friend. You said 'I trusted you.I skyped you. I told you that my dad was in the hospital. I sent you pictures of my son.' yada, yada, yada. How many women have seen pictures of your kid??? Every woman in your life? STOP MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD FOR YOUR SCANDALS. It's not their fault you make the same mistakes. I am worried about you. You are messaging anyone that flirts with you online. I am 15 years old. You got catfished by a dude! It will only get worse. It's time to retire. I want you to know that I'm not releasing the story for money. I am doing this to teach you a lesson. I want you to get help. I don't care if you hate me. I don't hate you, I care about you very much. I think this story will help you become a better person. I hope at least. I am also worried about myself. I talk with a lot of men online. I am fifteen years old! I catfish people, including you. I think it's time that I retire too. I think that by releasing this story I am teaching myself a lesson as well. I need to get help. I hate myself. I am trying to make this story into something positive. In order for a flashlight to work properly it requires a battery. The battery requires a negative and a positive, the negative is always larger.. It doesn't have to be that way. Sorry, I'm not sorry. I wish you the best!

Malaysian police have already... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While such incidents have happened before, the topic remains almost taboo, with investigators and officials reluctant to conclude that a pilot purposely crashed a plane in order to commit suicide even when the evidence appears compelling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A dozen years ago, U.S. investigators filed a final report into the 1999 crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which plunged into the Atlantic Ocean near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 aboard. They concluded that when co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty found himself alone on the flight deck, he switched off the auto-pilot, pointed the plane downward, and calmly repeated the phrase \"I rely on God\" over and over, 11 times in total. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet while the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the co-pilot's actions caused the crash, they didn't use the word \"suicide\" in the main findings of their 160-page report, instead saying the reason for his actions \"was not determined.\" Egyptian officials, meanwhile, rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting instead there was some mechanical reason for the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was also disagreement over the cause of the crash of SilkAir Flight 185, which plunged into a river in 1997 during a flight from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Singapore, killing all 104 passengers and crew. A U.S. investigation found that the Boeing 737 had been deliberately crashed, but an Indonesian investigation was inconclusive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mozambique officials have been investigating a crash that killed 33 people in November. They say preliminary investigations indicate that the pilot of the Mozambican Airline plane bound for Angola intentionally brought it down, and they're continuing to look into his possible motives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Administration indicates that in the U.S. at least, flying remains a remarkably safe mode of transport and pilot suicide is a rare occurrence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study found that during the 10 years ending in 2012, just eight of 2,758 fatal aviation accidents in the U.S. were caused by pilot suicide, a rate of 0.3 percent. The report found that all eight suicides were men, with four of them testing positive for alcohol and two for antidepressants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cases ranged from a pilot celebrating his 21st birthday who realized a woman didn't want a relationship with him, to a 69-year-old pilot with a history of drinking and threatening suicide by plane. Seven of the cases involved the death of only the pilot; in the eighth case, a passenger also died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Aircraft-assisted suicides are tragic, intentional events that are hard to predict and difficult to prevent,\" the FAA's report found, adding that such suicides \"are most likely under-reported and under-recognized.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In at least one case, a major international airline allowed a pilot who had expressed suicidal thoughts to continue flying. He flew nearly three more years, without incident, before he resigned in 1982 with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported that the Workers Compensation Commission heard that the Qantas pilot struggled several times to resist an overwhelming urge to switch off the plane's engines. Once during a flight to Singapore, the pilot's hand moved \"involuntarily\" toward the start levers and he was forced to \"immobilize his left arm in order not to act on the compulsion.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He left the flight deck and, once he felt calm enough, returned to his seat,\" the newspaper reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After telling his colleagues of his urges, the newspaper said, the pilot was examined by several doctors and ultimately declared fit to fly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malaysia's government said police on Saturday searched the homes of both the pilot and the co-pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet. It said police were examining an elaborate flight simulator taken from the home of 59-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also are investigating engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it took off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Glynn, a committee member of the Australian and International Pilots Association, said Friday that he considers pilot suicide to be the most likely explanation for the plane's disappearance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pilot rather than a hijacker is more likely to be able to switch off the communications equipment, he said, adding that he thinks suicide was to blame in the EgyptAir and SilkAir crashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The last thing that I, as a pilot, want is suspicion to fall on the crew, but it's happened twice before,\" Glynn said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perry reported from Wellington, New Zealand.\nPassage 2:\nWhoever commandeered Malaysia Air 370 took extraordinary evasive measures. That person switched off the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) and transponder soon after takeover and made a sharp westward turn during a 10-minute leg of the flight between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace, where there is little primary radar coverage. As the flight zigzagged off course, it also rose to 45,000 feet, well above the approved altitude for a Boeing 777, possibly to ensure that passengers could not use their cellphones or to incapacitate them by causing a shortage of oxygen, experts say.\nPassage 3:\nRep. Mike Rogers said on Sunday U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 for any national security or terrorism angles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We want to find out exactly if there was some terrorist nexus or some other nexus that would raise concerns to our national security,\" the chairman of House Intelligence Committee chairman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Appearing on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Rogers also said investigators are still not close to a likely theory on the matter, but suggested that the plane might be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This plane still may be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean — and I think a lot of folks that I’ve talked to believe that’s probably the most likely, the most probable circumstance,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a significant recalibration of the search,\" Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are still more questions than answers about the missing flight. Figuring out the motive of whoever apparently steered the plane off course is key, analysts told CNN Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think they had an end game in mind from the very beginning,\" CNN aviation analyst Jim Tilmon said, \"and they have executed a lot of things that have led us down a road. Are we going to the right place? I'm not sure.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane disappeared on March 8, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Airline CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Sunday the missing passenger jet took off with its normal amount of fuel needed for the roughly six-hour flight and did not have extra fuel on board that could have extended its range. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the nations involved in the search, Pakistan, said Sunday that the plane never showed up on its civilian radars and would have been treated as a threat if it had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Times of India reported that India's military also said there was no way the plane could have flown over India without being picked up on radar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A study of the flight's cargo manifest showed there were no dangerous materials on board that concerned investigators, he told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators are still looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see whether any of them were trained pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check,\" said Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general of the Royal Malaysian Police Force. \"But there are a few ... foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the(ir) passengers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that \"those in the cockpit\" -- the captain and co-pilot -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date.

MUST WATCH Who were the men who flew flight 370 02:30 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first clue that the captain or co-pilot may have been involved stems from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn just after it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is the perfect place to start to disappear,\" the official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding to the intrigue, ABC News reported that the dramatic left turn was preprogrammed into the plane's navigation computer. It's a task that would have required extensive piloting experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two senior law enforcement officials also told ABC that new information revealed the plane performed \"tactical evasion maneuvers\" after it disappeared from radar. CNN was unable to confirm these reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian Peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane,\" the Prime Minister said, officially confirming the plane's disappearance was not caused by an accident. \"Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused MH370 to deviate.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unconfirmed possibility that the plane could be on land means authorities need to answer that question -- and fast, analysts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Time is even more of the essence. If this airplane has been taken to be used as a weapon, then the time that has been taken to prepare the aircraft for whatever deed is the plan, obviously to thwart that, it's all about time,\" said Shawn Pruchnicki, who teaches aviation safety and accident investigation at The Ohio State University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tilmon said whoever deliberately steered the plane off course likely did it with help. But what's next is anyone's guess, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have been behind them all along, so now, if they had a plan, and if that plan included being able to set down someplace and refuel a little bit, we are looking at something that we may never see the end of,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pilots NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Malaysian police searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Zaharie lives in an upscale, gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ministry of Transport said Sunday that police were examining a flight simulator found at the pilot's house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's somewhat common among aviation enthusiasts to use online flight simulator programs to replicate various situations. Simulators allow users to virtually experience scenarios in various aircraft. Programs can simulate flight routes, landings and takeoffs from actual airports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andaman and Nicobar Islands NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Najib made clear in a news conference that in light of the latest developments, authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew, ground staff and passengers on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hishammuddin, the transportation minister, told reporters the pilots didn't request to work together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Chong, a friend of Zaharie's, said he had been in the pilot's house and tried the simulator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a reflection of his love for people -- because he wants to share the joy of flying with his friends,\" Chong said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was bothered by speculation about the captain's credibility and questions about possible ties to terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it is a little bit insensitive and unfair to the family,\" he said, adding he thought there was no evidence to suggest any ulterior motives on Shah's part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In any criminal investigation, the most important analysis is what's the motive,\" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \"I think right now, they have to look for it, and they have to rule it out, if they can, with their own pilots, so they can start looking for motives elsewhere.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Undoubtedly, authorities will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to The New York Times, one of the passengers was an aviation engineer on his way to Beijing to work for a private-jet company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kazakhstan to Indian Ocean NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the focus of the investigation has shifted, so, too, has the focus of the search. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Information from international and Malaysian officials indicates the jet may have flown for more than seven hours after the last contact with the pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. March 8. The last satellite communication from the plane occurred at 8:11 a.m., Najib said, well past the scheduled arrival time in Beijing. It is possible this contact could have been made from the ground, as long as the airplane still had electrical power, Malaysia's civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That last communication, Najib said, was in one of two possible traffic corridors shown on a map released to reporters. A northern arc stretches from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern arc spans from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Due to the type of satellite data, we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite,\" Najib said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the northern parts of the traffic corridor include some tightly guarded airspace over India, Pakistan and even some U.S. installations in Afghanistan, U.S. authorities believe it more likely the aircraft crashed into waters outside of the reach of radar south of India, a U.S. official told CNN. If it had flown farther north, it's likely it would have been detected by radar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said Sunday that both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance. Malaysian officials are working with 25 countries, many of them along the corridors. They include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Afghanistan's Ministry of Transport said it has joined the search, but said there is no evidence the plane flew over Afghan soil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separately, India has \"temporarily halted\" its search for the missing plane while Malaysian authorities reassess the situation, according to a top military official.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nine days after the plane went missing, patience is running thin with officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before a packed room, one man told them that the families have already lost faith.

Don't hide things from us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of mounting criticism over its handling of the situation, Malaysia Airlines has defended its actions, saying it took time to verify satellite signals and give authorities a chance to analyze their significance before releasing information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But at Sunday's Beijing briefing, a majority of the people in the room stood up when the man asked how many had lost trust in the airline and the Malaysian government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another man rushed the front of the room and tried to throw a punch but was stopped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The airline has been picking up the tab for families of the Chinese passengers to stay in Beijing during the ordeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is sending technical experts to join the investigation, and two Chinese search vessels headed for the Strait of Malacca, according to Xinhua. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People are across the world have shown their support for those involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his weekly Sunday message following prayers at the Vatican, Pope Francis asked the crowd to pray for the crew members and passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane and their families. \"We are close to them in this difficult moment,\" Pope Francis said.\nPassage 6:\nNEW DELHI (AP) — Massive Indian navy and air search operations for the missing Malaysian jetliner were suspended Sunday until fresh search areas are identified by Malaysia's government, an official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Col. Harmit Singh, spokesman for India's tri-services command, said coast guard ships have reverted to routine surveillance in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Air and sea operations for today have been put on hold,\" Singh said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was no indication as of Sunday evening when the search efforts would resume. A government official said earlier in the day that Indian and Malaysian officials were scheduled to meet in Kuala Lumpur later Sunday to refine search coordinates. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane, which was carrying 239 people, disappeared March 8 on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Indian navy and air force's coordinated search for the last three days has covered more than 250,000 square kilometers (100,579 square miles) in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal without any sighting of the Boeing 777. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So far no sighting or detection has been reported by the units deployed for searches in various designated areas,\" India's Defense Ministry said in a statement late Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Malaysian authorities have now indicated that based on investigation, the search operations have entered a new phase and a strategy for further searches is being formulated. Accordingly, search operations have been suspended and all Indian assets earmarked for search operations have been placed on standby,\" the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a dozen Indian ships, patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft and helicopters have scoured the region. India intensified the search on Saturday by deploying two recently acquired P8i long-range maritime patrol and one C-130J Hercules aircraft. A short-range maritime reconnaissance Dornier aircraft was also deployed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vinod Patney, a retired air force officer, said it was unlikely — but not impossible — for an aircraft to intrude a country's airspace undetected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials said there was effective radar coverage in the region, with a large number of flights between Europe and Southeast Asian using this route. Also, India has tightened security in the area, which is a strategic shipping lane for oil tankers.\nPassage 7:\nThe seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.\n", "answers": ["The echo chamber that is the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has yet to yield much in the way of definites, but the focus continues to remain on the pilots and the theory that the jet's disappearance was not an accident or mechanical failure.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nParticipants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For this prospective cohort study, first-time mothers participated in an MRI acquisition before and after their pregnancy, allowing us to use each woman's pre-pregnancy brain scan as her individual baseline. Data were collected over a total period of 5 years and 4 months. The participants were recruited via the fertility center Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad (IVI, Barcelona), by flyers and by word of mouth. We sought nulliparous individuals who were planning to try to become pregnant in the near future but were not pregnant yet and nulliparous individuals without such plans. Participants were therefore not randomly assigned to groups. Recruitment and data collection for all groups was initiated at the same time. Although individuals were recruited separately for the pregnancy (PRG) groups (women and men becoming parents between the sessions, hereafter referred to as F PRG and M PRG , respectively) and the control (CTR) groups (women who did not become pregnant within this time frame and men whose partners did not become pregnant, from here on referred to as F CTR and M CTR ) on the basis of their intention to become parents in the near future, the final group allocation depended on the transition from nulliparity into primiparity in between sessions. Women trying to become pregnant were scanned in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle or before the insemination or transfer in the fertility-treated group. Only participants who had never experienced a previous pregnancy beyond the first trimester were included in the study. Sixty-five nulliparous women and 56 men without children were scanned for the first time point, including 43 women and 37 of their male partners who wanted to become parents for the first time, aiming for a minimum of 16 participants51 in each group based on fertility statistics52. Pre-established exclusion criteria comprised neurological or psychiatric conditions or a history of substance use disorders as assessed by means of the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview53 applied by a clinical psychologist. The main criterion for continuing in the study for participants in the PRG group was achieving pregnancy in the period following the first MRI session. Of the final sample of 25 women who underwent pregnancy between the sessions, the majority (20 women) had an estimated pregnancy onset within 6 months after the session. Five participants became pregnant between 6 and 12 months after their participation in the first MRI session. To ensure that this longer period between the session and conception did not have a significant impact on the results, we also repeated our analysis excluding these 5 women, which rendered very similar results (Supplementary Table 15). Thirty-two participants, comprising 17 women and 15 men, did not achieve pregnancy within this period and did not participate in the follow-up session. Two women and 2 men who were initially recruited for the F PRG and M PRG groups participated as control subjects in the F CTR and M CTR groups when conception was not achieved. In addition, 2 women and 2 men who participated in the first session as control participants were scanned as participants of the F PRG and M PRG groups in the second MRI session following an unexpected pregnancy. In addition, 1 participant became claustrophobic inside the scanner, 4 did not return for the Post session and 3 participants had to be excluded due to poor image quality or neuropathological conditions encountered in the MRI scan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our final sample consisted of the following subject groups with complete Pre and Post data sets: 25 primiparous women, 20 nulliparous control women, 19 first-time fathers and 17 control men without children. Unless explicitly stated otherwise (in case of analyses including other measures only available for a subset of the participants), these represent the sample sizes used in the comparisons. There were no statistically significant differences in Pre-to-Post time interval, age or level of education between the PRG and CTR groups (mean ± s.d.: Pre–Post time interval: M PRG : 459.00 ± 117.46 d, M CTR : 419.17 ± 93.17 d; t = 1.12, P = 0.272. F PRG : 463.52 ± 108.33 d, F CTR : 413.05 ± 106.86 d. t = 1.56, P = 0.126. Age: M PRG : 35.21 ± 4.30 years, M CTR : 31.64 ± 6.41 years. t = 1.94, P = 0.063. F PRG : 33.36 ± 3.97 years, F CTR : 31.10 ± 5.63 years. t = 1.58, P = 0.123. Education: number of participants finishing secondary school/college/university or above: M PRG : 2/4/13, M CTR : 1/3/13, χ2 0.37, P = 0.833. F PRG : 2/4/19, F CTR : 2/3/15, χ2 = 0.06, P = 0.971), but as there was a trend for an age difference in the male groups, we also repeated our model including age as a covariate (Supplementary Tables 16 and 17), which had very little impact on the results. In addition, correlation analyses were performed to further examine potential associations of age and Pre-to-Post time interval with GM volume changes within the observed areas affected by pregnancy (using an explicit mask of the main contrast). These analyses rendered only a trend for stronger volume reductions in the right superior temporal sulcus cluster in the younger women (P = 0.095, FWE-corrected). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Post session took place on average at 73.56 ± 47.83 d (mean ± s.d.) after parturition. A model including the time interval between the birth and the Post scan as a covariate rendered results that were highly similar to the main results (Supplementary Table 14). In addition, to further examine the effects of the time between parturition and the Post scan on the GM changes within these regions, we performed correlation analyses with this time interval using the main contrast as an explicit mask. These analyses rendered no significant results (for either a linear, quadratic or cubic positive or negative correlation). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nine women achieved pregnancy by natural conception and 16 women by means of fertility treatment. The effect of a natural or assisted conception was further investigated by comparing these groups (Supplementary Table 4) and by separately examining the changes within these groups (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5), revealing no significant impact of the natural versus assisted route to conception on the brain changes of pregnancy. Of the fertility-assisted group, 12 women underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF, 3 involving an egg donation and 5 involving intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), 4 without egg donation or ICSI), 3 intrauterine insemination (IUI), and 1 a frozen embryo transfer. Albeit negligible in comparison to the hormone surges of pregnancy itself, each of these procedures involves hormone treatment which took place after the Pre session (for IUI: gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, human menopausal gonadotropin) and progesterone; IVF and ICSI: the same plus a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog; egg donation or embryo transfer: estrogens, progesterone, GnRH analog). To further examine the possible effects of treatment-related hormone therapy, we also repeated these analyses with a more homogeneous group of fertility-assisted women undergoing a procedure with the same approach in terms of hormone therapy (i.e., only women undergoing conventional IVF or IVF involving ICSI, 9 in total). Again, no significant differences were observed between this group and the women who were not exposed to fertility treatment-related hormones (the naturally conceiving group) and similar brain changes were observed in these subgroups (Supplementary Table 18). Future studies involving a larger sample of women undergoing fertility treatments are likely to uncover more subtle changes related to the hormone therapy associated with fertility treatments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ten of the women carried a boy, and 11 a girl. The remaining 4 had twins (2 mixed twins, 1 male twins, 1 female twins). Considering the previously observed effects of fetal sex on cognitive changes in pregnant women54, we additionally compared the women carrying a boy to the women carrying a girl (excluding the four women having twins). No differences in GM volume changes were observed between these groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One woman suffered from eclampsia during labor, 2 had premature deliveries and 2 women suffered from high-risk pregnancies with kidney complications or antiphospholipid syndrome. Leaving out the women with complications during pregnancy or delivery had very little effect on our results (Supplementary Table 19). Twenty of the experimental women gave birth to a singleton and four had twins. Eight of the women gave birth by cesarean section and 17 by vaginal birth. All women except 1 received epidural anesthesia during delivery. Sixteen women practiced exclusive breastfeeding (breast milk as their infant's sole source of nutrition), 2 practiced breastfeeding supplemented by formula feedings, 2 had started breastfeeding their infants but had stopped by the time of the Post scan, and 2 never started breastfeeding. Very similar results were obtained when including variables representing the type of conception, type of delivery, breastfeeding status and number of fetuses as covariates in the model (Supplementary Table 20), suggesting that these factors are not driving the observed neural changes. However, the current study was not designed to further investigate the possible impact of such factors, and future studies investigating these in more detail may reveal specific neural changes associated with these variables. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Post session, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale55 was administered to the primiparous women to detect symptoms of postpartum depression. One of the mothers showed symptoms of postpartum depression and was being helped by a specialist. Excluding this participant from our analyses did not significantly affect our results (Supplementary Table 21). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blood samples were acquired at the sessions before and after pregnancy from a large portion of our participants. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, we could only obtain blood samples from 2 of the women during pregnancy itself. Therefore, we cannot use hormonal data to pinpoint the observed neural changes to specific endocrine changes of pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the Post + 2 years session, we asked the 25 primiparous women to come back for another MRI acquisition. Of these 25 women, 11 had not yet experienced a (partial) second pregnancy since the last MRI session and were willing and able to participate in this follow-up session (mean time since birth: mean ± s.d.: 2.32 ± 0.50 years, age at Pre scan: 33.72 ± 3.32 years). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comitè Ètic d'Investigació Clinica de l'Institut Municipal d'Assistència Sanitària), and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Data acquisition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRI images were obtained in a Philips 3T scanner. High-resolution anatomical MRI brain scans were acquired using a T1-weighted gradient echo pulse sequence (TR = 8.2 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, NSA = 1, matrix = 256 × 256, FOV = 240 mm, 180 slices, thickness = 1 mm, no gap, FA 8°). Due to an unexpected technical problem, the radio frequency head coil was replaced for some time with another head coil, and 28 scans in total were acquired using the latter coil. There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of scan acquired with this head coil (χ2 = 4.21, P = 0.240). Nonetheless, to err on the side of caution, we also repeated the main analysis without these scans acquired with the temporary head coil, which rendered highly similar results (Supplementary Table 22). Furthermore, direct comparisons of the subjects acquired with the different head coils were performed, rendering no significant results. Finally, the head coil was introduced as a nuisance covariate in all neuroimaging analyses. In the Post + 2 years session, an MRI scan was acquired with both radio frequency head coils for those participants for whom a different coil was used in a previous acquisition, allowing us to match the comparisons on head coil type. Therefore, no covariate for the head coil was included for analyses involving the Post + 2 years session. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Post MRI session also included an fMRI paradigm (T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI sequence. TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 35 ms, matrix = 128 × 128, FOV = 230 mm, 30 slices, thickness = 4 mm, gap 0.5 mm, FA 90°) that examined the new mothers' neural responses to their babies. During this MRI session, pictures of the women's own and other unknown babies were shown to the participants using Presentation software (NeuroBehavioral Systems). The images were extracted using Adobe Photoshop CS5 from short movies that were shot by one of the experimenters, or in some cases by the father, at a home visit a few days before the Post session. For the women who had twins, movies were acquired from both babies. The pictures represented cut-out faces on a black background and were matched for size, resolution, brightness and facial expression. For each participant, 28 images of their own baby (14 of each infant in case of twins) and 28 images of other babies were presented in randomized order in an event-related fashion (trial duration 1,500 ms, randomized inter-trial interval 750–1,250 ms), with an average number of trials of (mean ± s.d.) 72.15 ± 6.64 and 72.40 ± 6.99 for the other baby and own baby conditions respectively. Pictures involving sad facial expressions (crying) and neutral facial expressions were acquired from each infant. Additional explorations of the data based on facial expression are provided in Supplementary Table 23. Five participants could not be included in the fMRI analyses due to head motion exceeding 3 mm (for translations) or 3° (for rotations) (1 woman), artifacts in the data (2 women), or incomplete data sets (2 women), rendering a sample of 20 primiparous women for this part of the study (age at Pre session: 32.85 ± 4.13). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Pre and Post session, our participants were also asked to complete several supplementary cognitive tests and questionnaires (the Test de Aprendizaje Verbal España Complutense56, based on the California Verbal Learning test57, the Digits subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III58, a two-back working memory test, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index59, and a simple reaction time task). Normality of these variables was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk tests, and nonparametric tests were applied as some did not follow a normal distribution. Homoscedasticity was confirmed using a nonparametric Levene's test. No significant changes across sessions were observed in any of these measures (Supplementary Table 10). For completeness, a correlation analysis was performed between the number of correct responses on the verbal word learning paradigm (Post-Pre scores) and the changes in GM volume in the women who underwent pregnancy between sessions. No suprathreshold voxels were observed, either with a whole-brain approach or with an explicit mask representing the areas of GM volume change across pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women were also asked to retrospectively fill in the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS)24 for the first 6 months of being a mother. One of the mothers did not complete this measure, and hence these data are available for 24 of the primiparous women (age (at Pre scan): 33.42 ± 4.05). From this scale, the three scores of the MPAS were extracted (mean ± s.d., quality of attachment: 37.11 ± 3.99; absence of hostility: 16.93 ± 4.10; pleasure in interaction: 20.88 ± 3.10). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longitudinal symmetric diffeomorphic modeling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The anatomical MRI images were processed in SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), implemented in Matlab 7.8 (MathWorks), using the longitudinal symmetric diffeomorphic modeling pipeline60. The images of each participant were first processed using the longitudinal registration tool provided within this framework, which incorporates rigid-body registration, intensity inhomogeneity correction and nonlinear diffeomorphic registration in an interleaved fashion. Considering the bias associated with asymmetry in pairwise registration, this approach registers both time points to a within-subject average image. These midpoint average images were segmented into tissue classes using the unified segmentation algorithm61. The jacobian determinants resulting from the longitudinal registration were subsequently multiplied by each subject's GM segment, creating maps of volumetric change in GM tissue. To bring these images into MNI space, the product images were normalized using DARTEL tools62 and smoothed with a 12-mm full-width half-maximum smoothing kernel63, 64, 65. The individual smoothed GM volume difference maps were entered into general linear models. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To quantify the overlap between our results and other functional maps such as the neural activity of the mothers in response to pictures of their infant (the 'own baby > baby' contrast in the fMRI task) and the theory-of-mind network as defined by the large-scale meta-analysis of Schurz et al.22, we computed the intersection between these maps and our map of GM volume changes across pregnancy. A further assessment of the localization of these GM changes of pregnancy with respect to functional networks was performed by quantifying the overlap between our map and the 12 functional networks of Yeo et al.23, who investigated the functional specialization of the cerebral cortex with a meta-analysis of 10,449 experimental contrasts and confirmed intrinsic network organization using a resting-state fMRI data set of 1,000 individuals. The overlap of our results with these functional maps was extracted by computing the intersections between each of these maps and the map of GM volume changes of pregnancy, and defining the fraction of the observed intersection relative to the expected volume of the intersection based on a random distribution across the gray matter of the brain (see Supplementary Table 6). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For completeness, although these MRI images are not optimal for investigating white matter, we also multiplied the individual jacobian difference maps with the white matter segments of the midpoint average images to obtain an indication of the changes in white matter signal across pregnancy. These maps were further processed and analyzed in the same manner as the images obtained by multiplying the jacobian maps with the gray matter segments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A cross-sectional voxel-based morphometric approach was also applied to the baseline images to confirm the absence of pre-existing baseline differences between the PRG and CTR groups. This approach included a segmentation of the baseline images using the unified segmentation algorithm61, a DARTEL normalization of the GM segments62 and the application of a 12-mm full-width half-maximum smoothing kernel. A two-sample t-test was performed to test for the presence of baseline group differences. Plots depicting the signal values extracted from this approach are provided in Supplementary Figure 10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Post + 2 years images were processed using the same longitudinal approach described above, rendering volume difference maps between the Post + 2 years images and the two other sessions. To examine whether GM volumes within the regions affected by pregnancy underwent further changes across the first 2 years postpartum relative to the Pre and early Post sessions, we performed one-sample t-tests on the Pre – Post + 2 years and the Post – Post + 2 years difference maps, using an explicit mask of the Pre – Post changes across pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regarding the main comparisons, each of the primiparous groups was first compared to their nulliparous control group in the framework of the general linear model. Maps of GM volume change were compared using two-sample t-tests. If a significant group difference was found, we then proceeded to separately examine the increases and decreases in GM volume across time within the relevant groups by means of one-sample t-tests to determine which changes were driving this group difference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statistical maps were constructed by applying a stringent voxel-level Gaussian random field theory–based threshold of P < 0.05, FWE-corrected across the whole brain. A minimum cluster size of 10 contiguous voxels was imposed to discard very small clusters and restrict table sizes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Multivariate analyses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the above-described mass-univariate analyses, we also performed multivariate pattern recognition analyses using the analysis pipeline provided by PRoNTo 2.0 (http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pronto/)66 implemented in Matlab. This pipeline can be used to automatically search for regularities in the data and train a classifier function that models the relation between spatial signal patterns and experimental factors on the basis of a training data set66. This classifier can then be used to predict the group a new image belongs to using the spatial distribution of the signal within the image and to compute the accuracy with which groups can be discriminated from one another on the basis of whole-brain spatial signal patterns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To examine the degree to which the experimental women could be discriminated from the control women on the basis of the distribution of GM volume changes across the brain, we applied a linear support vector machine classification to the Post – Pre difference maps. A sample-specific GM mask was created using the SPM Masking Toolbox (http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/masking/) to serve as the mask image. To evaluate model performance, we applied a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Using this cross-validation strategy, the classifier's accuracy is computed by leaving one subject out at a time and predicting this subject's group label on the basis of a training set including all remaining subjects. This procedure is then repeated for each subject, and the accuracy of the discriminant function is computed using all these runs. Permutation testing was used to estimate the null distribution and examine the statistical significance of the classification accuracy (N permutations = 10,000; P < 0.05)67. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, to further examine the regional contribution to the decision function and determine the areas with greatest relative prediction power, we built multiple kernels based on the regions of the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas (http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL-217), using an L1 Multiple Kernel Learning algorithm as implemented in PRoNTo68 with the same cross-validation scheme and significance testing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Furthermore, to investigate whether the GM volume changes across pregnancy could significantly predict measures of maternal attachment, we performed kernel ridge regression analyses using the three dimensions of the MPAS24. Kernel ridge regression represents a form of support vector regression using a squared-error loss function combined with l2 regularization (see ref. 69 for a description of this approach). Using kernel ridge regression, MPAS scores were predicted from the changes in GM volume, and the correlation between true and predicted MPAS values was subsequently examined. A leave-one-out cross-validation was applied; that is, in every fold a participant was left out for whom the MPAS score was predicted and examined in relation to the actual MPAS score. As in the classification models, we used a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and permutation testing (N permutations = 10,000; P < 0.05). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the current version of PRoNTo does not yet allow the inclusion of covariates and we could therefore not include the radio frequency coil covariate in the models, the residuals were written in SPM12 and the multivariate classification and regression analyses were repeated on these images, rendering very similar results (SVM classification on residuals: balanced accuracy = 100%, P < 0.0001; kernel ridge regression with MPAS scores on residuals: quality of attachment: R = 0.38, P = 0.043, normalized mean squared error (nMSE) = 0.90, p nMSE = 0.034; absence of hostility: R = 0.42, P = 0.031, nMSE = 0.87, p nMSE = 0.023). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additional measures based on previous related results: manual regions of interest of the pituitary gland and total tissue volumes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a supplementary analysis, we wanted to further explore our data on the basis of previous findings related to structural brain changes in human pregnancy. Therefore, we also examined total tissue volumes and pituitary gland volume in our sample. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Total brain volumes were extracted in SPM12. To obtain measures of pituitary gland volume, this structure was manually delineated by two raters who were blind to any identifying subject or group information on coronal slices of the Pre, Post and Post + 2 years sessions of the primiparous women using MRIcron (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/), according to the delineation criteria described in MacMaster et al.70. Inter-rater reliability was determined on the basis of ten repeated ROI delineations (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.935). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For 5 MRI scans, the pituitary gland could not reliably be delineated due to local inhomogeneity or contrast issues, and these scans were therefore excluded, rendering a total of 23 Pre, 23 Post and 10 Post + 2 years volumes. As the missing volumes did not correspond to the same individuals across sessions, that left 22 Pre-Post pairs, 9 Pre–Post + 2 years pairs and 10 Post–Post + 2 years pairs for the longitudinal comparisons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These measures were analyzed in SPSS 23 (IBM). A normal distribution of the data and equal variances were confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests, respectively. The results are described in Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surface-based analyses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To examine changes in surface area and cortical thickness, surface-based morphometry was conducted in FreeSurfer 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The images were reprocessed from raw data for this approach. To investigate changes in these surface-based measures across sessions, the images were processed with the longitudinal stream implemented in FreeSurfer71, 72. The longitudinal preprocessing pipeline involves an initial cross-sectional processing of the images of each of the time points, which includes motion correction, removal of nonbrain tissue, transformation into stereotaxic (MNI) space, intensity correction, volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction73, 74, and parcellation75. The extraction of the brain for surface-based processing was based on the segmentation algorithm implemented in SPM8. All further steps were performed in FreeSurfer 5.3. Individual surfaces were inspected for accuracy, and minor manual edits were performed where needed, usually involving the removal of sections of nonbrain tissue. The next step in the longitudinal stream was the creation of a probabilistic individual base template based on the cross-sectional images for each participant, which is unbiased with respect to any of the time points. Subsequent processing of each time point was then initialized using the processed results from the unbiased template71, 72. Surface maps were resampled, mapped to a common surface, and smoothed using a full-width at half-maximum kernel of 15 mm. A cross-sectional approach was also applied on the baseline images to confirm the absence of pre-existing baseline differences between the PRG and CTR groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longitudinal change in cortical surface area and thickness in each hemisphere was calculated as symmetrized percent change (i.e., the rate of change between the time points with respect to the average thickness or area across the time points), and examined using one-sample t-tests. Cluster statistics were obtained using Monte Carlo simulations with a vertex-wise −log 10 (P) of 4 (corresponding to P < 0.0001) and a cluster-wise threshold of P < 0.05. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discriminant analyses with leave-one-out cross-validation were performed in SPSS 23 (IBM) using the changes in average cortical thickness and surface area values across the regions of GM volume change to examine the predictive value of these surface-based measures for group classification. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Functional MRI analyses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analyses of the functional MRI data were performed in SPM12. The functional images were first corrected for differences in slice acquisition timing and realigned to the first volume. Subjects with head motion exceeding 3 mm (for translations) or 3° (for rotations) were excluded from the analyses (1 woman). Then, the anatomical images were co-registered to the mean functional image and normalized into MNI (ICBM) space using nonlinear registration61. Finally, the normalization parameters and a full-width at half-maximum smoothing kernel of 12 mm were applied to the functional images. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the first level of analysis, general linear models were used to model voxel-wise changes in BOLD response for the conditions of interest, also including the movement parameters extracted during the realignment and regressors based on temporal basis functions. The first-level parameter estimates for the linear contrast 'own baby pictures > other baby pictures' were entered into a second-level model and one-sample t-tests were performed to examine whether new mothers show a differential pattern of neural activity in response to pictures of their own or other babies. For completeness, the reverse contrast ('other baby pictures > own baby pictures') was also examined. Additional explorations of the data based on facial expression are provided in Supplementary Table 23. In addition to the whole-brain FWE-corrected threshold, the fMRI results were also investigated and are reported at an uncorrected threshold of P < 0.0001 and an extent threshold of 10 voxels to allow a further inspection of the similarity of the regions of strongest neural responsiveness to the women's babies to the pattern of GM volume changes across pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To create images, the statistical maps were projected onto the PALS surface provided in Caret software (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download). Slice overlays were created using MRIcron (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Data availability.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW YORK (AP) — Pregnancy affects not only a woman's body: It changes parts of her brain too, a new study says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When researchers compared brain scans of women before and after pregnancy, they spotted some differences in 11 locations. They also found hints that the alterations help women prepare for motherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, they might help a mother understand the needs of her infant, Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, explained via email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women were also given memory tests, and they showed no signs of decline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hoekzema, a neuroscientist, began working on the study while at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. She and colleagues present the results in a paper released Monday by the journal Nature Neuroscience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. That's based on follow-up with 11 study participants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further work showed they're a motherhood thing: No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy rather than after childbirth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What's going on? Hoekzema and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In the 11 places, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect loss of brain cells or a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some study results hint that such upgrades may prepare a woman for motherhood. One analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant. And when women viewed pictures of their babies, several brain regions that reacted the most were ones that showed pregnancy-related change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, the affected brain areas overlapped with circuitry that's involved in figuring out what another person is thinking and feeling. That's a handy ability for a mother tending to an infant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea of synapses being pruned in pregnancy makes a lot of sense, commented Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University in New York, who studies hormonal effects on the brain but didn't participate in what he called a terrific study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The brain is being shaped all the time,\" he said, and \"sex hormones are part of the whole orchestra of processes that change the brain structurally.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Malcolm Ritter at http://twitter.com/malcolmritter His recent work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/malcolm-ritter\n", "answers": ["Pregnancy affects not only a woman's body: It changes parts of her brain, too, a new study published in Nature Neuroscience says.

In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

MacDonald said last week that white people in America are becoming a victimized minority. He has been accused of anti-Semitism by critics, including the Southern Poverty Law Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MacDonald's tweet had to do with Clinton's State Department and perceived favoritism for UBS, a global financial services company that donated to the Clinton Foundation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's running mate told Fox News Wednesday that Trump immediately responded to an invitation by Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto to meet. He noted that Hillary Clinton received the same invitation but hasn't responded yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pence said that Trump and Pena Nieto are expected to discuss the logistics of Trump's proposed border wall — something Trump insists Mexico will pay for, despite Pena Nieto's condemnation of the plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:35 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least two demonstrations are planned in Mexico City as Mexicans express anger about the visit of Donald Trump.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pena Nieto's office hasn't said where or when the meeting would be held, possibly in a bid to avoid protests outside the meeting site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leading historian Enrique Krauze also addressed Trump in a tweek, saying \"We Mexicans expect nothing less than an apology for calling us \"criminals and rapists\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Krauze told the Televisa TV network that, \"Tyrants are to be confronted, not pacified.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mexico has awakened to the news that President Enrique Pena Nieto is going to meet with Republican candidate Donald Trump Wednesday, and many Mexicans don't like it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some analysts said the Republican nominee had left Pena Nieto flat-footed by accepting an invitation the Mexican president had made simply for appearances' sake. Trump is widely loathed in Mexico for calling migrants from the country \"rapists\" among other insults. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary (Clinton), but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added: \"What's in it for Mexico? \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard\" by accepting the invitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3:10 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump will be taking his first foreign trip as the Republican presidential nominee on Wednesday, making a quick visit to Mexico, a nation he derided as the home of rapists and criminals as he launched his campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto, who earlier this year compared the billionaire candidate to Hitler, comes hours before Trump is set to deliver a highly-anticipated immigration speech. It's a defining issue for Trump, but one on which he has appeared to waiver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After saying during his primary campaign he would expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally with a \"deportation force,\" Trump has suggested recently he might be open to \"softening\" his stance as he tries to win over more moderate general election voters.\nPassage 2:\nGOP nominee Donald Trump waxed diplomatic during a joint news conference with Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had a very substantive, direct, and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time,\" Trump said. The U.S. and Mexico \"are united by our support of democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions of millions of Mexican-Americans to the United States. And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether genuine or not, Trump on Wednesday diverged heavily from his hard-line primary rhetoric — about deporting 11 million illegal immigrants — and laid out a five-point plan for a hemispheric approach to U.S. relations with Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump called illegal immigration — from Central and South America to the U.S. — a \"humanitarian disaster\" for \"the extreme physical dangers\" that the \"trek\" poses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial,\" he argued before alluding to his proposed wall along the southern border of the United States: \"We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and weapons.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for his previous promises to supporters that the Mexican government would for whatever reason pay for said wall, Trump said, \"We didn't discuss that.\"\nPassage 3:\nTrump gets what he wanted in Mexico The Republican nominee gets his presidential moment south of the border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump could barely have scripted it better. After a year of tormenting Mexico as a hostile foe, he stepped to a podium on Mexican soil — alongside the country’s leader Enrique Peña Nieto — and got a president’s welcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump emerged from an hourlong huddle with Peña Nieto and the pair delivered side-by-side statements, embedding subtle criticisms of each other inside enthusiastic declarations of mutual respect. But it was the precise visual Trump had hoped for: a bilateral news conference that amounted to a preview of what similar international trips might look like in a Trump presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In written remarks — delivered in stilted bursts — Trump clung tightly to his arguments that the North America Free Trade Agreement had benefited Mexico disproportionately to the United States’ detriment. He described a mutual agreement with Peña Nieto about each country’s right to build a border wall. Peña Nieto even contended that Trump’s hot-blooded rhetoric about Mexicans has been, in some cases, “misinterpretations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet the most striking development may have been Trump’s decision to simply ignore the central policy proposal of his campaign: forcing Mexico to pay for the 2,000-mile wall. Trump, responding to a reporter’s question, said financing for the wall simply didn’t come up in the conversation with Peña Nieto, that the talks were “preliminary” and could be continued later. (Peña Nieto later disputed that on Twitter, writing, \"At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear Mexico will not pay for the wall.\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it was a striking departure from his campaign-trail posture; so synonymous with the Trump candidacy is the wall proposal that adoring fans chant “Mexico!” at rallies when he asks who will fund his plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a speech he plans to deliver later Wednesday in Phoenix, Trump is expected to detail his immigration policy, which has suddenly become a moving target despite forming the core of his candidacy for the past year. Along with a Mexico-financed wall, he’s long pledged mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A campaign spokesman reiterated as recently as Tuesday that Trump still intends to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman, added that he doesn’t expect Trump's speech to include much of a departure from his previously stated policies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don't want to get ahead of the speech, but he's made it very clear that everyone who is not in the country legally must leave the country so I don't expect to see any kind of departure from that,” he said on CNN Wednesday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peña Nieto, squeezed by political leaders in his own country, strained to deliver subtle rejections of Trump’s language while maintaining his pledge to be impartial in the American election. He delivered a methodical dismantling of Trump’s anti-NAFTA arguments, noting that trade with Mexico supports as many as 6 million American jobs. He also reminded Trump that for all the undocumented immigrants and drugs flowing north, illegal cash and weapons are flowing south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a point of view of border issues that’s clearly incomplete because it doesn’t consider the illegal flux of weapons and cash that come into the South,” he said. “Every year millions of weapons and millions of dollars cross illegally into Mexico from the North that strengthen cartels and other criminal organizations that generate violence in Mexico and receives earnings from drug sales in the United States. This flow has to be stopped.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illegal immigration to the United States had slowed since its peak a decade ago, he added. And he referred obliquely to Trump’s disparagement of undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists or criminals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People of Mexican heritage in the U.S. contribute every day with their work, talent, and creativity, to the prosperity and development of the U.S. and Mexico. Mexicans living in the U.S. are honest and hardworking people — they are people of goodwill, who respect family, who respect living in community, and who respect the law,” he said. “This is why Mexicans deserve everyone's respect.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, Peña Nieto lamented that there’s been “misinterpretations and statements that have unfortunately hurt and affected Mexicans in the way he's presented his candidacy,” but he added that “I was sure that his genuine interest was to build a relationship.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who delivered his statement second, embraced Peña Nieto’s language, referring to the “deep and sincere” bond between America and Mexico and referred frequently to “we,” “us” and even “our hemisphere” when describing his posture toward Mexico, a far cry from the “America First” language that typically threads his speeches at home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans largely greeted Trump’s visit as a success, primarily because he’d set a low bar and managed to exceed it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “[Hillary] Clinton's framework is that Trump would embarrass the country abroad. He didn't,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican operative and former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “This Mexico trip worked for Trump in the short term.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peña Nieto’s predecessors were less diplomatic about their president’s decision to host Trump. Vicente Fox said the visit simply legitimized Trump’s earlier harsh rhetoric. After the speech, Felipe Calderon called Trump a “hypocrite” for changing his tone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don't believe him. He is lying. He doesn't mean what he says,” Calderon said on CNN. “He says we're rapists and tomorrow he says we're wonderful, smart, hardworking people. He is lying. And for that reason, I think, I was very, very sorry, I'm very sorry he came to Mexico. I think it was a very important mistake.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats and even Trump’s detractors among Republicans argue that it’s too late for him to persuade large numbers of Hispanic voters to support his candidacy. Rather, they viewed his trip as a chance to frame his immigration speech and also to convince undecided white voters with concerns about his temperament that he can be trusted with international affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the speech turns out to be a watershed in the campaign or a too-little-too-late desperation play is unclear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with a firm handshake, and a declaration that Peña Nieto is a “friend,” Trump strode out of the presidential palace in Mexico City assured that, for a moment, he exceeded international expectations. And then he boarded his plane to Phoenix.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MEXICO CITY (AP) — Standing alongside the president of Mexico, a measured Donald Trump on Wednesday firmly defended the right of the United States to build a massive border wall along its southern flank but declined to repeat his frequent promise to force Mexico to pay for it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, the U.S. presidential candidate who is widely despised across Mexico, also sidestepped his repeated criticism of Mexican immigrants following a closed-door meeting at the official residence of the country's president, Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump and Pena Nieto, who has compared the New York billionaire to Adolf Hitler, addressed reporters from adjacent podiums flanked by a Mexican flag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall,\" Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his announcement of his presidential candidacy last year, Trump derided Mexico as a source of rapists and criminals coming to the U.S., and his presence on Wednesday sparked anger and protests across the capital city. A former Mexican president bluntly told the celebrity businessman that, despite Pena Nieto's hospitality, he was not welcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit,\" former President Vicente Fox told CNN, calling the trip a \"political stunt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pena Nieto was less combative as he addressed reporters alongside Trump. He acknowledged the two men had differences, but he described their conversation as \"open and constructive.\" They shook hands as the session ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trip, a politically risky move for Trump 10 weeks before America's presidential Election Day, came just hours before the Republican nominee was to deliver a highly anticipated speech in Arizona about illegal immigration. That has been a defining issue of Trump's presidential campaign, but also one on which he's appeared to waver in recent days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After saying during his Republican primary campaign he would use a \"deportation force\" to expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally, Trump suggested last week he could soften that stance. But he still says he plans to build a huge wall — paid for by Mexico — along the two nations' border. He is under pressure to clarify just where he stands in a speech that's been rescheduled several times as he and his staff has sent varied and conflicting messages on the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The American people are going to see more clearly that there's one candidate in this race who's prepared to take the steps necessary to end the flood of illegal immigration,\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said Wednesday on CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump will also make clear, Pence later told CBS, \"that there will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship. People will need to leave the country to be able to obtain legal status or obtain citizenship.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The buildup to the speech was abruptly interrupted Tuesday night by the news that Trump would visit Mexico, accepting on short notice an invitation offered last week by Pena Nieto. The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campaigning in Ohio earlier in the day, Democrat Hillary Clinton jabbed at Trump's Mexican appearance as she promoted her own experience working with foreign leaders as the nation's chief diplomat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People have to get to know that they can count on you, that you won't say one thing one day and something totally different the next,\" she told the American Legion in Cincinnati. \"And it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has promised, if elected, to deport millions of immigrants who are in the United States illegally, force Mexico to build a wall to secure the nearly 2,000-mile border and renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement to make it more favorable to the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pena Nieto made his invitation to both Trump and Clinton, who met with him in Mexico in 2014. The inclusion of Trump puzzled many in Mexico, who said it wasn't clear why their own unpopular president would agree to meet with someone so widely disliked in his country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary, but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pena Nieto has been sharply critical of Trump's immigration policies, particularly the Republican's plans to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. In a March interview, he said that \"there is no scenario\" under which Mexico would do so and compared Trump's language to that of dictators Hitler and Benito Mussolini. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump responded to Vicente Fox's criticism on Twitter earlier in the day, saying the former president had, like Pena Nieto, invited him to come. Fox shot back with a tweet of his own, saying he had invited Trump to \"come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peoples reported from Washington.

NBC executives quickly denied any Comcast involvement in the decision. But how did it all really go down? Details are trickling in, and early anonymous sources say Olbermann was not flat-out fired. However, most outlets are also reporting that Olbermann and network brass have long been butting heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to TMZ, the exit was partially about money: \"Olbermann's agent went to NBC complaining that Keith was underpaid,\" the site reports. \"NBC execs told Olbermann's agent they would not cough up more money. Network execs were well aware that Comcast wanted Keith gone because he was 'a loose cannon that could not be controlled.' It became clear to both sides that Olbermann's days were numbered and they began negotiating an exit, completed just before airtime Friday night.\" Under the deal, Olbermann is allegedly barred from appearing on television for a certain period of time, but he will reappear soon with \"a presence on the Internet,\" where all fugitives of the television end up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deadline reports a similar story: \"This was all Keith's choice. He has said several times over the years said that he wants out of his contract.\" The site says he began negotiating his out a few months ago, but, \"because of all the false threats in the past, it was impossible for the network to know if he was really going to sign the final document.\" Even his own staff learned he was quitting when they heard him say it on TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the New York Times concurs that NBC and Olbermann have been in negotiations to end Olbermann's run for weeks. The Times notes: \"Mr. Olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the Comcast deal, including Phil Griffin, the top MSNBC executive ... and NBC’s management had been close to firing Mr. Olbermann before.\" One executive said Comcast \"dreaded the prospect\" of being blamed if Olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only the New York Post reported that Olberamnn was \"unceremoniously dumped,\" but the paper also repeatedly refers to him as \"a garrulous gasbag.\" So.\nPassage 2:\nThe ball was chopped slowly and to get the out the first baseman would have to pick it up barehanded in the grass corner between the foul line and the infield dirt. The pitcher would have to hustle over but as the game’s most abused cliche reminds us every 43 minutes, that’s why they have PFP in spring training. With a speedy runner it would still be close but this was the majors and he who executes best laughs last. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fans at Yankee Stadium didn’t think twice about it when it happened in the top of the fourth yesterday. The play was difficult, but the pitcher was CC Sabathia and his hustle and athleticism have been one of the under-publicized aspects of the franchise’s success since 2009. And of course, the New York first baseman for exactly the same length of time has been Mark Teixeira and the goaltender-like whip-lash catches he makes at the bag and his other defensive wizardry obscures the fact that if that comparatively ordinary slow chopper is hit to him 500 times over a decade he’s going to pick it cleanly at least 499 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except the Yankee first baseman yesterday wasn’t Teixeira, it was Kevin Youkilis. And no offense to Kevin Youkilis, but when he reached down to scoop up the Jose Iglesias chop and toss it to Sabathia for the out he got nothing but grass and air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An inning later Jarrod Saltalamacchia shot one into the corner in left, where Brett Gardner should have made an adroit pick-up of the ball as it rattled around. Except Gardner was in center because like Teixeira, Curtis Granderson is hurt and it was Vernon Wells. And no offense to Vernon Wells, but when he waited for the straight bounce off the fence that never comes out there, it didn’t come, and he was left to play ‘go chase’ for awhile. All things considered Saltalamacchia probably would’ve gotten a double out of it anyway but there would have been a play and every tenth or twentieth time – an out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In neither case did the Red Sox score. But those two plays alone added ten pitches or more to Sabathia’s count and send him packing after five innings down 4-to-2, which opened things for the Yankee bullpen, which may be the least recognized problem among the cascade of them that started yesterday, and soon it would 5-to-2 and then 8-to-2 and then just as in “Young Frankenstein,” it got worse – it started raining. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effect on the offense of the subtraction of Teixeira, Granderson, Derek Jeter, and even Alex Rodriguez is obvious. What will kill the Yankees – and I mean last place kill the Yankees; this is not the collapse of 1965, that was last year in the ALCS, this is 1966 – will be its effect on the defense. Bad defense is not only its own punishment but it makes bums out of the best of the pitchers. And to re-use yet another old joke, kid, these aren’t the best of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And much of this mess will never show up in the box score. The Iglesias and Saltalamacchia plays were both clearly to be scored base hits. Unfortunately this Yankee team – the Muddlers’ Row of Brennan Boesch, Ben Francisco, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Wells, and Youkilis – has been assembled through (in the memorable phrase of the equally memorable San Francisco baseball writer Hank Schulman) dumpster-diving. And defensively they’re just bad enough to not make the plays, but just good enough to not get the errors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s hard to say how this impending disaster will be received in the Bronx. The Yankees haven’t had a losing season since 1992 and they’ve either won or been in contention every year since 1993. Hal Steinbrenner was still at the University of Florida Business School then, and the Yankees could and often did draw half of what they draw these days. A front office with no memory of the Bad Old Days never mind experience with alleviating them is likely to panic and throw some babies out with the bathwater (heck, the Yankees began panicking about mild media criticism more than a year ago). And the front-running fans who have filled the place during these later glory years will not know what that they were seeing, and never fully realize the implications of the fact that their new platoon third baseman was guy who had been released by the Red Sox exactly a week ago today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toronto: I’m not one of those stick-in-the-muds who looked at the Dodgers last year and tut-tutted “you can’t parachute in four new guys in mid-season and expect to form a team.” I mean, for one thing I’m an entirely different kind of stick-in-the-mud. But more importantly, that conclusion ignores the reality that the Giants have won two World Series while parachuting in four guys (last year) and five guys (2010). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So my refusal to jump on the Bandwagon going doing Blue Jay Way is nothing about team chemistry or parachuting or trying to meld a team while competing or Jose Reyes’s hamstrings on turf. I just think that the laudable effort to rebuild a once-great franchise has somewhat obscured some remaining problems – like a very average bullpen, very average production out of the DH spot, and trouble at third base until Brett Lawrie returns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plus there’s this little scandal from last year that sneaked in under everybody’s radar. The big trade for the noble Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey? It came less than a year after Dickey became one of a handful of major league pitchers to admit to taking painkiller injections during the season (Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester, and Clay Buchholz were among the others). In Dickey’s case this was 2011; I’ve seen no reporting about him and the drug – Toradol – in 2012: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is among the players who believe Toradol is more effective than taking over-the-counter pain pills. He said he believed the injections helped keep him on the field to pitch 2082/3 innings last season (2011), despite his injured foot. Some doctors, though, said athletes might believe Toradol to be more effective only because of the way it is commonly administered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emphasis there was mine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Giving your starting pitcher a series of anti-inflammatory pain-dulling injections all seasons long is ok because the drug, while requiring a prescription, supposedly only has a slightly greater impact than a couple of Advil (injected directly into the source of your pain). Except, oh by the way, that pesky drug insert sheet references limiting its use to five days in pill form and two days for injections, and oh by the way in England physicians are instructed to start patients on Toradol only in a hospital, and oh by the way when Clay Buchholz was in a hospital with internal bleeding last June he said he thought his use of the drug contributed to his crisis and the fact that doctors had to transfuse him with three or four pints of blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is hardly deserving of being the only one with a finger pointed at him. My understanding is there isn’t a rotation in the majors that doesn’t have at least one regular Toradol, and that some of them may be in new uniforms this year in part because of their teams’ fears that the painkiller could mask necessary pain, the kind that warns you of impending injury. For as with any drug that dulls pain, or covers up muscular damage or exhaustion, or which neutralizes tiredness, the possibility is increased of sudden serious injury. You don’t know you’re hurting and you push it to far – and something snaps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, if a Toradol scandal, or a Prescription Drug scandal, breaks in baseball this year the guys on the record as (past) users are few and far between. And only one of them is a defending Cy Young Winner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost as an aside I also have doubts about the efficacy of Toronto’s rotation. Dickey went from 8-13 in 2011 to 20-6 last year. His strikeouts soared from 134 to 230 in only 25 more innings. His offensive support went up 8/10ths of a run. I don’t know if any of that is sustainable or repeatable this year – especially without the joy of facing pitchers every ninth batter. Tell me how much you’re willing to rely on Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, to say nothing of Ricky Romero, currently of the Dunedin Blue Jays. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston: The gift of Jackie Bradley being ready as much as a year early – and it is a gift, his at bats are those of a 10-year veteran who draws 100 walks every year – may hide some dubious free agent signings. When your key acquisition does so poorly on his physical that you (and he) agree to cut the deal from three years to one, that’s a problem. When you are hoping that Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Ryan Dempster all had ‘blips’ last year, that’s a lot of high-odds wagering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Red Sox probably did themselves a favor by sacrificing the stability that was Adrian Gonzalez in order to offload the franchise-sinking contracts of Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford. But as has been noted elsewhere, they were left with a lot of contract room and not that many people to spend it on. Instead of a Josh Hamilton they went for “Clubhouse Guys” – which is great for long road trips, flights, bus rides in traffic, rain delays, etc. – but rarely seems to be the corrective folks assume insomuch as the last time I checked the game was still played out on the field and very rarely in the clubhouse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley, of course, is the real deal (though I’ve never seen a player whose Dad didn’t reach the majors use the “junior” on his uni – his reads “BRADLEY JR.”). Will Middlebrooks is legit too. If Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia stay healthy that’s four of nine positions that will excel offensively and defensively. But with David Ortiz hurt and presumably waning there is no longer a feared hitter in this line-up and given the depth of this division that’s a serious impediment to contention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baltimore: As mentioned in the AL Central preview the Orioles could’ve easily offed the Yankees in the ALDS last year even though they were relying on two outfielders – Lew Ford and Nate McLouth – who had been released earlier in the same season (Ford, by a team in an independent league). The O’s were reshaped by two guys who were largely viewed as having been bypassed by the proverbial parade, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette, and featured the contributions of only a couple of homegrown guys (Markakis, Machado, Wieters, Jim Johnson). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What becomes of the Orioles when the revivified farm system begins to contribute? Dylan Bundy was arguably the game’s top pitching prospect, until this spring when he was bypassed by his teammate Kevin Gausman. Will they step into the rotation or be used out of the bullpen a la David Price? Could WBC-tested infielder Jonathan Schoop help out? Or outfielder L.J. Hoes? Could any American League team add more key parts from its own farm system as 2013 rolls along? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tampa Bay: Well, yeah, actually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even while trading off Wade Davis and James Shields, the Rays still have a complete back-up rotation (Jeff Niemann in the bullpen, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Alex Colome in the minors) to say nothing of a Cy Young Winner (David Price) and two possible future candidates (Jeremy Hellickson and Matt Moore) at the front of Plan A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And if the primary bounty in the Shields trade, Wil Myers, is not summoned into the Tampa line-up it will only be because of injury, or because the traditional small-ball line-up is producing satisfactorily and there’s no need to squeeze out James Loney or the platooners at second or DH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The key Tampa weakness would seem to be behind the plate. They kept Jose Molina intact enough to appear in 102 games last year and one wonders if that can be done again, or if Jose Lobaton is a satisfactory alternative. There isn’t a catching prospect in the system and despite the sense that the Rays hit the bullseye with every one of their very few economic darts, the minors are thin generally in terms of position players (2009 was a bad draft, and every year that passes makes the 2008 selection of Tim Beckham as the overall number one pick instead of some kid named Posey look that much sillier). But the arms keep appearing, the down-market free agent signings keep producing (you realize that Loney could out-hit his predecessor Carlos Pena by a hundred points and still not hit .300?), and the veterans get transformed either into more draft choices (or guys like Wil Myers. Good grief, the team with the thinnest tightrope in the sport was somehow able to trade for Wil Myers). Marc Topkin has a superb and concise explanation of how the Rays keep the machine turning here and I offer the usual disclaimer here that I went to college with the future Mrs. Stuart Sternberg and their oldest son was an intern for me one summer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Division: I know this is viewed as a three, four, or even five team race. I just don’t see anybody seriously challenging the Rays, especially when Myers comes up. I’m not certain on whether the Orioles’ Tampa-like structuring and youth flood can overcome the value of Toronto’s mass additions in the race for second place; either way it’ll be close. The Red Sox are not likely to compete but also not likely to be challenged by the Yankees who – even in the disaster of last place – will still be the division’s lead story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tomorrow we’ll finish it up with the Tarot Card reading that those one-game wild cards make trying to predict the playoffs six months in advance.\nPassage 3:\nKeith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR scored an even sweeter exit package than previously reported. Sources connected with NBC tell us Keith is pocketing \"well in excess\" of $7 million.Sources tell us ... Olbermann was due for two salary hikes during the last two years of his contract, which would have netted him just over $17 million. The exit deal, we're told, gives Keith much more than $7 million, though our sources would not be more specific.And we're told ... Olbermann agreed as part of his exit deal not to do television, but our sources say he'll be benched for less than 4 1/2 months.had to sit out twice that amount of time.And speaking of Conan, we're told attorney Patty Glaser, who negotiated Conan's exit from the same network, did the heavy lifting for Keith, along with his agent and manager. We're told negotiations for the exit went on for seven weeks.\nPassage 4:\nImage Credit: Olbermann: Amy Sussman/Getty Images; Sorkin: Valer Now that Keith Olbermann is leaving MSNBC, could he be setting his sights on Hollywood and Aaron Sorkin’s next TV project? The Golden Globe-winning scribe behind The Social Network has long had a pilot script in the works about a cable news show, and Olbermann could be tapped to contribute rants, says a source familiar with the project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sorkin spent time on Olbermann’s set while penning the behind-the-scenes script (think Sports Night meets Countdown), something he did while juggling The Social Network and working on an early draft of the upcoming film Moneyball (starring Brad Pitt). Sorkin recently told BBC News that he also shadowed Chris Matthews and Fox News and that he’s working with HBO on the project. (Unfortunately, the pay cabler is not confirming anything.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any network giving serious consideration to Sorkin’s next series may want to wait until Tuesday’s Oscar nominations to make a bigger publicity splash since it seems all but guaranteed that Hollywood’s premier scribe will snag a screenplay nod for The Social Network. Sorkin already won a Golden Globe for writing the movie, which was also recognized as the year’s best drama flick by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. In addition, Sorkin scored a BATFTA nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Should the behind-the-scenes script become a series, it’s practically a given that Sorkin would call upon his trusted allies to help carry out his vision. Besides Olbermann’s potential contribution, Emmy-winning scribes like Kevin Falls (Franklin & Bash) and Eli Attie (House M.D.) — both of whom worked on The West Wing – could help Sorkin run the show, while Thomas Schlamme would be a natural to direct. And what do you say, Sorkin; how about Bradley Whitford as Olbermann’s doppelganger? Stay tuned.\nPassage 5:\nSince joining Twitter early last year, now-former Countdown host Keith Olbermann has become one of the platform’s most loquacious users, tweeting more frequently than a meth-tweaked canary. All of that came to an abrupt end in the hour before his Friday announcement that he, and his show, were leaving MSNBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday night, though, Olbermann-watchers saw the first sign of post-Countdown life from his Twitter feed: an update to his profile which read “WATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point, very little should be read into this, but that won’t stop people from trying. The New York Daily News speculates that maybe the update signifies a return to sports for the former Sportscenter co-anchor: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since his sudden split with MSNBC, Keith Olbermann could be going back to his roots – at least on Twitter. “W A T C H T H I S S P A C E MLB.Com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14,” he wrote on his biography line– the only update he’s written on his usually prolific account since Friday evening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They go on to note that a return to ESPN is unlikely, for a variety of reasons that Sportsgrid details here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem here is that promoting the Baseball Nerd blog is nothing new to Olbermann’s Twitter feed, and so “Watch this space” isn’t necessarily related to it. If Olbermann does remain silent until February 14, though, you can bet that will be the most widely-read edition to date. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any case, those watching Olbermann’s feed for dirty laundry, or laundry of any kind, regarding his departure from MSNBC are likely in for a big disappointment. As much as it’s probably killing the normally-outspoken Olbermann, news accounts from respected journalists generally concur that the terms of his exit include some kind of gag order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much more likely is the prospect that Olbermann will share, in fairly short order, some level of detail about his future plans. Ironically, his departure has elevated his Twitter feed to near-Sarah Palin status, anticipation-wise. The parallel has been noted by some conservatives on Twitter, who wondered if Olbermann could continue to slam Palin for resigning the Alaska Governorship, which caused Olbermann to dub Palin the “former Half-Governor.” (This says more about their attitudes about the gravity of elected office than anything else.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In that vein, it would be a satirical masterstroke if Olbermann emerged from Twitter exile to tweet about “Death Panels,” as they relate to cuts to transplant funding in Arizona. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Either way, Olbermann has to be aware that his status as a Palin-level Twitter celebrity has a short shelf-life, and if he wants to use the platform to promote his next move, sooner is better than later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: On Sunday, perhaps in response to the Daily News’ speculation, the message on Olbermann’s Twitter profile was tweaked to more clearly separate the messages. It now reads “W A T C H__________T H I S__________S P A C E (Also: MLB.Com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14)”\n", "answers": ["Details of Keith Olbermann’s abrupt exit from MSNBC—as well as what’s in store for him now—are trickling out. The latest: Olbermann’s exit package was “well in excess” of $7 million, sources tell TMZ. The deal includes a clause that benches Olbermann for a while—at least when it comes to television—but sources claim he’ll only have to sit out for four-and-a-half months or less. The New York Times has a different estimate, citing executives involved in the deal: Olbermann must stay off TV for six to nine months, and can’t talk about his departure, although he can work on the Internet or in radio. His exit comes after years of behind-the-scenes conflict at MSNBC, the Times reports, noting that Jeff Zucker was one step away from firing him during his campaign contributions brouhaha in November. The usually prolific Olbermann has tweeted only once since his departure, and the message—apparently since removed—read “WATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.” Of course, that sparked all sorts of speculation that Olbermann may return to his sports roots. But Olbermann has often promoted his Baseball Nerd blog, Mediaite notes, so the message could mean … nothing. Next up for Olbermann: Writing for TV with Aaron Sorkin?

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBALTIMORE, June 2 (UPI) -- A discrepancy between galactic distances in the infant universe and more modern measurements suggests the universe is expanding at a faster pace than previously predicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. The numbers suggest the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe, just after the Big Bang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers believe the discrepancy may offer insights into the nature of dark matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" Adam Riess, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University, said in a news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dark matter and the dark energy it carries may explain the acceleration of the universe's expansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most recent calculation of the universe's rate of expansion, called the Hubble constant, is believed to be the most accurate ever -- with a margin of error, or rate of uncertainty, of just 2.4 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers expected the new calculations to forge an agreeable link with those derived from observations of the Big Bang afterglow collected by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" Reiss said. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers are continuing to go over the data to try to reduce the margin for error even further, but it appears likely researchers will now be faced with the task of explaining the disagreement between the two Hubble constants.\nPassage 2:\nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. This is a generally accepted scientific understanding, the discovery of which yielded a Nobel prize in 2011. But what exactly is the speed of that expansion? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to new research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, the rate of expansion, or the Hubble constant, is about 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a unit equivalent to 3.26 million light-years): somewhere between five and nine percent faster than we thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A multitude of reasons has been put forth for this discrepancy, including the possibility that these new calculations are inaccurate. But if they continue to withstand scrutiny, they could challenge some of the basic precepts surrounding the functioning of our universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you really believe our number – and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties – then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" co-author Alex Filippenko, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Maybe the universe is tricking us, or our understanding of the universe isn't complete,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the science is correct, then one possible explanation has to do with the mere 95 percent of the universe constituted of mysterious elements that do not emit light, such as dark matter, dark energy, and dark radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dark energy, thought to be responsible for the acceleration of our expanding universe, could be pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed. Or dark matter, the \"backbone of the universe,\" in NASA's words, could have some as-yet undiscovered oddities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then there's dark radiation: subatomic particles that travel at velocities approaching the speed of light. Maybe one such particle exists, or existed, that is unknown to science, perhaps the much-hypothesized \"fourth flavor of neutrino.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aside from all that darkness, there is another possible explanation: Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" study leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, said in a NASA press release. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new numbers are based upon the team's efforts to acquire a more precise understanding of the universe's current expansion rate. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope, they refined that to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type la supernovae. Cepheid stars allow astronomers to determine how far they are from us, and thereby how distant their galaxy is, by analyzing two characteristics: their true brightness, gleaned from the rate at which they pulsate, versus their apparent brightness as seen from Earth. Type la supernovae, a kind of exploding star, can be detected even further away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Armed with this information, they could calculate the distance to some 300 Type la supernovae in distant galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've done the world's best job of decreasing the uncertainty in the measured rate of universal expansion and of accurately assessing the size of this uncertainty,\" Dr. Filippenko said in the Berkeley release, \"yet we find that our measured rate of expansion is probably incompatible with the rate expected from observations of the young universe, suggesting that there's something important missing in our physical understanding of the universe.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's far too early to jump up and down to say the universe is messing with us,\" Dr. Carroll told The Washington Post, but he conceded that the research was carried out by scientists both solid and careful.\nPassage 3:\nAstronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have discovered that the universe is expanding 5 percent to 9 percent faster than expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" said study leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and The Johns Hopkins University, both in Baltimore, Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results will appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riess' team made the discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent. The team made the refinements by developing innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. Cepheid stars pulsate at rates that correspond to their true brightness, which can be compared with their apparent brightness as seen from Earth to accurately determine their distance. Type Ia supernovae, another commonly used cosmic yardstick, are exploding stars that flare with the same brightness and are brilliant enough to be seen from relatively longer distances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By measuring about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and comparing the observed brightness of both types of stars, the accurately measured their true brightness and calculated distances to roughly 300 Type Ia supernovae in far-flung galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team compared those distances with the expansion of space as measured by the stretching of light from receding galaxies. They used these two values to calculate how fast the universe expands with time, or the Hubble constant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The improved Hubble constant value is 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec. (A megaparsec equals 3.26 million light-years.) The new value means the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This refined calibration presents a puzzle, however, because it does not quite match the expansion rate predicted for the universe from its trajectory seen shortly after the Big Bang. Measurements of the afterglow from the Big Bang by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite mission yield predictions which are 5 percent and 9 percent smaller for the Hubble constant, respectively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we know the initial amounts of stuff in the universe, such as dark energy and dark matter, and we have the physics correct, then you can go from a measurement at the time shortly after the big bang and use that understanding to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today,\" said Riess. \"However, if this discrepancy holds up, it appears we may not have the right understanding, and it changes how big the Hubble constant should be today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comparing the universe's expansion rate with WMAP, Planck, and Hubble is like building a bridge, Riess explained. On the distant shore are the cosmic microwave background observations of the early universe. On the nearby shore are the measurements made by Riess' team using Hubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" Riess said. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are a few possible explanations for the universe's excessive speed. One possibility is that dark energy, already known to be accelerating the universe, may be shoving galaxies away from each other with even greater -- or growing -- strength. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that the cosmos contained a new subatomic particle in its early history that traveled close to the speed of light. Such speedy particles are collectively referred to as \"dark radiation\" and include previously known particles like neutrinos. More energy from additional dark radiation could be throwing off the best efforts to predict today's expansion rate from its post-big bang trajectory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boost in acceleration could also mean that dark matter possesses some weird, unexpected characteristics. Dark matter is the backbone of the universe upon which galaxies built themselves up into the large-scale structures seen today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And finally, the speedier universe may be telling astronomers that Einstein's theory of gravity is incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it's important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history,\" said Lucas Macri of Texas A&M; University in College Station, a key collaborator on the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hubble observations were made with Hubble's sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), and were conducted by the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES) team, which works to refine the accuracy of the Hubble constant to a precision that allows for a better understanding of the universe's behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SH0ES Team is still using Hubble to reduce the uncertainty in the Hubble constant even more, with a goal to reach an accuracy of 1 percent. Current telescopes such as the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an infrared observatory, and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), also could help astronomers make better measurements of the expansion rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Hubble was launched in 1990, the estimates of the Hubble constant varied by a factor of two. In the late 1990s the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale refined the value of the Hubble constant to within an error of only 10 percent, accomplishing one of the telescope's key goals. The SH0ES team has reduced the uncertainty in the Hubble constant value by 76 percent since beginning its quest in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ### NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C.

This is a discovery that could test part of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, a pillar of cosmology that has withstood challenges for a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nasa and the European Space Agency jointly announced the universe is expanding 5% to 9% faster than predicted, a finding they reached after using the Hubble space telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond theMilky Way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rate of expansion did not match predictions based on measurements of radiation left over from the Big Bang that gave rise to the known universe 13.8bn years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Milky weigh: our galaxy has the mass of 700bn suns, say scientists Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Physicist and lead author Adam Riess said: “You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers arrived at a new expansion rate of 73.2 kilometres per second per megaparsec. A megaparsec is 3.26 million light years. The consequence of this adjustment in difficult-to-imagine speeds over unthinkable distances is that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years. The catch is that such speeds do not match predictions for an expansion rate from other observations made by Nasa’s Wilkinson microwave anisotropy Probe, or the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite. Both went into orbit to study the afterglow of the Big Bang, in which time, space and matter were created. And both delivered lower – and in each case slightly different – predictions for cosmic expansion, the first 5% and the second 9% lower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest discovery also stirs hypotheses about what fills the 95% of the cosmos that emits no light and no radiation, scientists said on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility for the discrepancy is that the universe has unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light, about 186,000 miles (300,000km) per second. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Hubble is used to measure the distances to stars called Cepheid variables. Their brightness means they can be used as cosmic yardsticks to measure distances to galaxies. Astronomers then look for galaxies that contain Cepheids (centre) and Type Ia supernovae, and determine their distance. They then look for supernovae in more remote galaxies. The brightness of distant supernovae are compared to measure out to the distance where the expansion of the universe can be seen (right). Those measurements are compared with how light from the supernovae is stretched by the expansion of space. Illustration: A. Riess (STScI/JHU) and A. Feild (STScI)/NASA/ESA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that so-called “dark energy”, a mysterious, anti-gravity force discovered in 1998, may be shoving galaxies away from one another more powerfully than originally estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This may be an important clue to understanding those parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and that don’t emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter and dark radiation,” said Riess, with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riess shared the 2011 Nobel prize in physics for the discovery that the expansion of the universe was speeding up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The speedier universe also raises the possibility that Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which serves as the mathematical scaffolding for calculating how the basic building blocks of matter interact, is slightly wrong, or at least incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it’s important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history”, said one of the team, Lucas Macri of Texas A&M University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such research has a long history of revision and updates. Einstein’s original calculations for general relativity seemed to predict that the universe was expanding and – in what he is supposed to have described later as his greatest blunder – he confected a cosmological constant to correct what he thought was an error. In 1923, the great American astronomer Edwin Hubble stared through what was then the world’s biggest telescope at what he thought was a nebula - cloud of dust – in the night sky and realised that he was observing another distant star system: the island universe of the Andromeda galaxy. And within two years he had observed the light signature of a receding galaxies, and proposed that everywhere in the universe, galaxies were rushing away each other, the farthest away at a greater rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But all astronomical observations depend on being able to calculate distances, and from that make ever more precise estimates of galactic recession. When the Hubble space telescope was first launched in 1990, estimates of the rate of cosmic expansion varied by a factor of two. Continuous observations seemed to narrow the range to ever more precise estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until 1998, astronomers thought they had got the big picture. The universe was expanding at a steady rate, but it might still be possible that expansion could halt, or even that the universe could contract. A team of astronomers staring at a class of stars called type 1a supernovae across enormous distances realised that the furthest were not just receding at the predicted rate: they were accelerating as if being driven by a mysterious force briefly dubbed “antigravity”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the first hint of what, for want of a better term, is called dark energy: a so-far inexplicable force that is likely to keep the universe expanding forever. And it was at that point that cosmologists began to realise that all the gas, dust, planets, stars, galaxies and black holes they could account for added up to only about 4% of the universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stunning Hubble Bubble Nebula image marks telescope's 26th birthday Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also raised the possibility that, an unimaginable number of years from now, all the other galaxies will have receded over some cosmic horizon, leaving the Milky Way alone in the visible universe, and with no distant objects to provide any evidence at all of accelerating cosmic expansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest advance on the speed of universal expansion builds on all these elements in a century of cosmological discovery. Riess and colleagues made their discovery by building a better cosmic yardstick to calculate distances. They used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure a particular type of star, known as Cepheid variables – the stars that gave Edwin Hubble and and his colleagues the first hint of an expanding universe - in 19 galaxies beyond our own Milky Way galaxy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How fast these stars pulse is directly related to how bright they are, which in turn can be used to calculate their distances, much like a 100-watt light bulb appears dimmer the farther away it is. They also used the type 1a supernovae as “standard candles” and it had been this class of objects that had illuminated not just another advance in speed but speculation about dark energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research will be published in an upcoming edition of the Astrophysical Journal.\nPassage 5:\nAdd this to the list of existential fears that keep you up at night: the universe appears to be expanding faster than we thought. A lot faster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s according to new, highly precise measurements of the distance between 19 faraway galaxies acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope. The new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe (the so-called “Hubble constant”) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In slightly less baffling terms, space is expanding fast enough to essentially double the distance between our galaxy and our nearest neighbors in about 10 billion years. The new Hubble constant is 5 to 9 percent higher than previous estimates. It might not seem like that much, but when it comes to the fate of the entire universe, it constitutes a major discrepancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery, which will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal, presents a problem for cosmologists, because it does not match estimated expansion rates from the energetic leftovers of the Big Bang. Two missions—NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite mission—have both yielded smaller Hubble constants by examining the so-called “afterglow” of the mega-explosion that birthed our universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discrepancy still needs to be independently verified. But if it holds up, it implies that there are underlying physical processes pushing space apart which we haven’t fully accounted for. That’s not too surprising when you consider that some 95 percent of our universe is made up of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, all of which emit no light and are barely understood at all. Alternatively, it could mean that Einstein’s theory of relativity is incomplete—which is also kind of understandable, given that the man single-handedly penned the laws of existence in his twenties without the aid of a computer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Either way, it’s an exciting reminder that the very fabric of reality is being shaped and stretched by forces we can barely comprehend. But one day, those forces will ensure that all of our atoms are dispersed across trillions of light years of vast nothingness.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWashington (CNN) Besieged by bad news at home, President Donald Trump is about to get religion, bigly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his first foreign trip as President, which begins Friday, Trump has planned a pilgrimage of sorts, visiting the homelands of all three Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- before heading to Europe for meetings with Pope Francis and NATO leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In all, it's an ambitious nine-day, five-country tour that will test the religious acumen and diplomatic skills of a President who, beyond courting conservative Christians and casting suspicion on Muslims, rarely talks about religion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's itinerary includes Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, where he aims to erase his Islamophobic image and urge Muslim leaders to address extremist ideologies. In the Holy Land, Trump wants to jumpstart the stalled peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, while visiting touchstones like the Western Wall. And in Europe, the President seeks to repair frayed relations with two of the continent's most venerable institutions, the Vatican and NATO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump's national security adviser, called the President's plans unprecedented. \"No President has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslims faiths all on one trip,\" he said at a press briefing last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Actually, other Presidents have visited Saudi Arabia and the Holy Land on the same trip. But no President has included the Vatican, Catholicism's holy headquarters, on the itinerary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House says Trump has three main goals: to project American power abroad, build relationships with world leaders and \"broadcast a message of unity\" to Jews, Christians and Muslims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What President Trump is seeking is to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress and prosperity,\" McMaster said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Religious accord is a smart way for the White House to frame Trump's trip, said Chris Seiple, former president of the Institute for Global Engagement and an expert on faith and foreign policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Most of the American people are utterly fed up with the Middle East, and this framework is a way to get their attention,\" Seiple said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some experts question whether Trump is the right messenger to preach about religious unity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was raised Christian, but as an adult he has rarely attended worship services, nor had he cultivated relationships with religious leaders before running for president. During the campaign, his remarks on religion were sometimes seen as uninformed and divisive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was accused of tweeting an anti-Semitic image and trafficking in anti-Jewish tropes; he said \"Islam hates us\" and pledged to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States; he even feuded with Pope Francis, who said that someone who talks only about building walls instead of bridges isn't Christian. Trump called the Pope's comments \"disgraceful.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Concerns about Trump's views on religion have carried over into his administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He pleased his conservative Christian base with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and an executive order promising greater legal latitude to pastors who want to preach about politics. But Jews complained for weeks about his reluctance to condemn dozens of bomb threats at Jewish community centers, and Muslims say his executive order halting immigration from several Muslim-majority nations discriminates against their religion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Up until now, Trump's message on Islam has been very confrontational, a clash-of-civilizations type narrative,\" said Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on political Islam. \"For him to talk about the great faiths unified in a common civilization would be quite different.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Posing for photos with the Pope and praying at the site of Jesus' tomb may alter aspects of Trump's image, but the his pilgrimage bears considerable risks, especially for someone with a tendency to improvise in delicate diplomatic situations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If he takes advantage of this trip to bring people together, that would be good,\" said Seiple. \"On the other hand, the whole thing could blow up in our face.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With those challenges in mind, here are the key religious events during Trump's trip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saudi Arabia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where: Riyadh NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When: May 20-21 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Key religious event: Speech to leaders of 50 Muslim countries NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McMaster said Trump plans to deliver an \"inspiring yet direct\" speech to leaders from Muslim countries on Sunday. The topic is the \"need to confront radical ideology\" and the \"President's hope for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The speech is intended to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate our commitment to our Muslim partners.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The President is fairly popular among Muslim heads of state, experts say, because of his hardline stance on Iran and reluctance to lecture Middle East dictators on human rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Trump's speech risks alienating or even insulting many Muslims who are weary of Western politicians conflating their faith with terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliott Abrams, who supervised President George W. Bush's Middle East policy, said Trump will have to navigate between \"very dangerous portals.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If he says nothing about Islamic extremism, then supporters at home will say he bit his tongue; if he says too much about it, he could conceivably offend some of those who are there.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early signs about the speech are not encouraging, experts said, especially after CNN reported that Stephen Miller, a White House aide known for peddling Islamophobic ideas , was drafting Trump's address. Miller also helped craft Trump's first executive order barring immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries. (A second order is being fought in the courts after the first version hit legal roadblocks.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR William McCants, director of the Brookings Institution's Project on US Relations with the Islamic World, offered Trump some advice for the speech. The first tip: cancel it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The President is not known for nuance, which is what a speech like this requires to escape the potential wrath of his multiple audiences,\" McCants said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCants and other experts on Islam also warned against projecting Saudi Arabia's strict theocracy as a model for \"moderate Muslims.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the country is the custodian of Islam's \"two holy mosques,\" it has also spread a toxic theology, Salafism, that has inspired extremists like al Qaeda and ISIS. What's more, the country has a horrible human rights record, according to international watchdogs, particularly on religious freedom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One safe proposal, according to foreign policy experts, is a regional roundtable on religious freedom, looking particularly at the plight of Christians in Muslim-majority countries. The Trump administration has been studying the idea , after meeting with members of the Institute for Global Engagement earlier this month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel/West Bank NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where: Jerusalem and Bethlehem NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When: May 22-23 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Key religious events: Speech at Israel Museum, prayer at Western Wall, visit to Church of the Holy Sepulchre NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some ways, Trump is sending a message just by setting foot in Israel, Jewish leaders say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama, during his first Middle East trip, skipped the Jewish state, a slight that some Israelis were reluctant to forgive, said Robert Danin, a former State Department official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Jerusalem, Trump will lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust victims, before delivering a speech \"reaffirming America's unshakable bond\" with Israel at the Israel Museum, the White House says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Danin said some Israeli leaders appear apprehensive about Trump's speech, mainly because they don't know what he's going to say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That uncertainty is very anxiety-provoking for the Israeli government because they fear that he is going to ask the Israelis to do things that this government may not want to do, may not be in a position to do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other Jewish leaders say they'll be looking for more than pacifying political rhetoric from Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We want to see if the President understands Israel's traumas, its security dilemmas and its unique importance in the region,\" said David Harris, CEO of the American Jewish Committee. \"It's about chemistry and tonality and feelings. We want to know if he feels Israel in the kishkes,\" the Yiddish word for gut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration has already caused a diplomatic stir over the Western Wall, the last remnant of Judaism's Second Temple and its holiest place of prayer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to reports, an American diplomat said Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu could not accompany Trump to the holy site because it's not in Israel. Previous administrations have considered east Jerusalem, where the wall sits, to be Israeli-occupied territory, but Trump's position is unclear. Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McMaster dodged questions about Trump's stance on the wall, saying the President aims to send a religious, not political, message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He's going to the Western Wall mainly in connection with the theme: to connect with three of the world's great religions -- and to pay homage at each of these religious sites that he's visiting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier that day, Trump will travel to Bethlehem, where he will encourage Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to come to the negotiating table with Israel, the White House says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has eased the way for talks to restart, Middle East experts say, by delaying a campaign promise to move the US embassy to disputed Jerusalem, a change that would irk Palestinians and other Arabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Trump will still have to address the embassy question, Abrams said. \"If the President says nothing about it, then he is, in essence, moving away from the campaign promise.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possible compromise: Trump could continue to call Jerusalem \" the eternal capital of the Jewish people,\" while dragging his feet on the embassy move. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rome NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where: Vatican City NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When: May 24 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Key religious moment: Meeting Pope Francis NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Trump visits the Vatican Wednesday, it will be the most highly anticipated meeting between Pope and President in recent memory. But those expecting a donnybrook will likely be disappointed, church experts say. Neither the President nor Pope Francis seem eager to replay their brief spat over Trump's border wall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the upcoming meeting, Francis said he's keeping an open mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will say what I think, he will say what he thinks, but I never, ever, wanted to make a judgment without hearing the person,\" the Pope said at a recent press conference aboard the papal plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Francis also said he will not seek to change Trump's mind on policy disagreements. Instead, he'll try to find avenues of agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look for the doors that are at least a little bit open, enter and talk about common things and go on. Step by step. Peace is handcrafted. It is made every day. Also friendship among people, mutual knowledge, esteem, is handcrafted.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Churchwatchers say the Vatican is eager to open lines of communication with the new American President, especially after their rocky start. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At this point, there doesn't seem to be much common ground between the new President and the Pope,\" said John Thavis, author of \"The Vatican Diaries\" and a longtime reporter on the Catholic Church, \"and that's probably pretty worrying for the Vatican.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McMaster said Trump looks forward to paying his respects to the Pope and discussing religious freedom, as well as cooperation in humanitarian missions and combating religious persecution and human trafficking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of the meeting consists of elaborate protocol: the Swiss Guard will welcome Trump as a head of state, and the Pope and President will exchange gifts. The private meeting between Francis and Trump is expected to last just half an hour, as the Pope is scheduled to speak in St. Peter's Square shortly after the encounter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Francis Rooney, US ambassador to the Vatican from 2005-2008, said the real diplomatic decisions often occur when the secretaries of state and other diplomats convene on the sidelines. One such meeting covered 16 countries, Rooney recalled, in which the Catholic Church and United States worked together on political and humanitarian missions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Holy See doesn't have business to promote or consular activities to direct,\" Rooney said. \"It's all about the big ideas and the power of persuasion.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a President who likes to think big and make splashy deals, this trip offers plenty of opportunities, as well as a few potential pitfalls.\nPassage 2:\nUS President Donald Trump will repeat his opposition to settlement growth in the West Bank during his first visit to the region next week – and expects the Israeli government to acknowledge that his position has been heard, a senior White House official said on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president will visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem during his visit on Monday and Tuesday, meeting with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, after attending an “Arab Islamic summit” in Riyadh over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He will not arrive in Jerusalem – or Riyadh – proposing diplomatic frameworks or road maps of any kind for Israeli-Arab peace, the official said.“This is not a trip in which the president comes and says, ‘Here’s my peace plan,’” the official said. “We’re not looking at something formal yet – perhaps down the road.”And while the president hopes to eventually bring Israelis and Palestinians around the same table, the White House believes it is “too early” for those talks to begin on this trip, the official said, confirming earlier reporting in The Jerusalem Post that a trilateral summit among US, Israeli and Palestinian leaders had been put on hold.Aides say the president has no plans ever to serve as an “arbiter of details” in future peace negotiations. But “he has expressed a general concern” with ongoing Israeli settlement activity, the official said.“He will reiterate that,” said the official. “He has not abandoned the two-state solution.”Trump first outlined his concerns about Israel’s settlement construction outside of existing settlement blocs in February when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited him in Washington. “Hold back a bit” on future building, Trump asked Netanyahu in front of the press.Now, Trump expects “assurances and signals from the Israeli government that they’ve heard his views,” the senior official said.Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had held that settlements were a stumbling block to peace. While Trump has not expressed that position, Israel had hoped he would have a more tolerant view of settlement construction, which it believes has no bearing on the peace process.Netanyahu on Thursday said he believed that Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jews was the stumbling block to the peace process.“The failure to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians and achieve peace lies with the Palestinian refusal to accept the existence of the Jewish State in any borders,” Netanyahu told Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel A. González Sanz.Heather Nauert, the Trump administration’s new spokesperson at the State Department, said that in Bethlehem Trump will “express his desire for dignity and self-determination of the Palestinian people” while meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after visiting with Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin and Netanyahu in Jerusalem.Trump will also offer remarks at the Israel Museum and visit Yad Vashem, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism. Administration officials have not stated whether the president believes the wall is in sovereign Israeli territory, and one official on Thursday confirmed that Trump will be accompanied only by the rabbi of the Western Wall – not by any Israeli government officials – “in keeping with the religious nature of the site.”The official could not confirm or deny reports that Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and an Orthodox Jew, will join the president on his trip to the wall.In Israel, the US Embassy spokeswoman told the Post that “the Western Wall is in Jerusalem.”She spoke in reference to comments attributed to US officials working in Jerusalem that the Western Wall was in the West Bank, meaning that it was not under Israeli sovereignty.“The reports in the press about the conversations are not accurate,” she said. “In any event, such alleged statements would not have been authorized by the White House, do not reflect the US position and certainly not the president’s position.“All indications are US officials’ actions were in accordance with longstanding US policy on coordination for such official visits to Jerusalem.”The sudden dispute that broke out between the US and Israel over the Western Wall was followed by reports that Trump planned to delay the execution of his pre-election pledge to relocate the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel had hoped that he would announce the move while in the capital.Trump’s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt is already in the area meeting with Israelis and Palestinians. On Thursday night, he met with King Abdullah in Jordan. Earlier he met with Netanyahu’s staff.As a sign of support for Trump’s drive to improve the Palestinian economy, Israel’s cabinet is expected to approve on Sunday a package of economic incentives for the Palestinians.\nPassage 3:\nWASHINGTON — President Trump leaves on Friday for a nine-day, five-city foreign excursion, his first trip outside the United States as the country’s leader and top diplomat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He doesn’t really want to go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Mr. Trump has groused to several friends that he is not looking forward to leaving his new White House cocoon for high-profile, high-pressure meetings with dozens of world leaders in unfamiliar settings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, he barked at an aide that he thought his first tour abroad should be only about half as long. He will have to abandon his well-known preference for sleeping in his own bed (or in one at the hotels or golf resorts he owns) as he hops between Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican — all places without a Trump-branded property. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the trip comes at a critical moment for Mr. Trump’s young presidency. It is his first opportunity to deliver specifics about his “America first” worldview to a global audience that has watched his initial, chaotic months in the White House with a mix of amusement, befuddlement and alarm.\nPassage 4:\nPresident Donald Trump accompanied by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, left, calls on a member of the media during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, May 18, 2017,...

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's maiden international trip, a five-stop marathon across the Middle East and Europe, has long loomed as a crucial first test abroad for the chaos-courting president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was before he fired his FBI director — and the chain reaction of scandal that followed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, with the eyes of the world upon him, the president will embark on his big trip carrying the baggage of dire troubles at home. As he tries to calm allies worried about his \"America First\" message, he'll be followed by fallout from his firing of FBI Director James Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to probe his campaign's ties with Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There has never been a president taking his first international trip being dogged by scandal like this,\" said Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's trip was always going to be dramatic. U.S. allies have been rattled by his warnings about pulling back from the world. He is tasked with urging a united front against terror by appealing to some of the same corners of the Muslim world he has tried to keep out of the United States with his travel ban. Last week, he added new layers of complication by disclosing classified intelligence to a longtime adversary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the White House once hoped the trip, wrapped in the pomp and circumstance of diplomatic protocol, could offer a chance at a reset after a tumultuous first four months in office. Trump's advisers saw it as an opportunity for the United States to boldly reassert itself on the world stage and resume a leadership role that the administration believes was abdicated by President Barack Obama. Trump's powerful senior adviser, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, led a West Wing team to craft the agenda, laden with religious symbolism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Trump hasn't been eager to seize the opportunity. It's been more than a half-century since any president waited as long to take his first foreign trip. The itinerary, which begins Saturday in Saudi Arabia, is a startlingly ambitious excursion for a president who dislikes travel and has displayed a shaky grasp of foreign affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each stop comes with high stakes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Saudi Arabia, the president — whose campaign was marked by heated anti-Muslim rhetoric and whose administration has tried to enact a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries — will deliver a speech to the Islamic world meant to be a clear contrast with the vision Obama laid out in his first trip to the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Israel, Trump will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, looking to smooth over fresh tensions. Israel was in an uproar earlier this week after U.S. officials confirmed Trump shared highly classified intelligence about the Islamic State group with senior Russian officials visiting the White House. The information, about an IS threat related to the use of laptops on aircraft, came from Israel and there were concerns a valuable Israeli asset could be in danger, a U.S. official said, requesting anonymity to discuss the sensitive material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster added to the alarm by refusing to declare the Western Wall a part of Israel. U.S. policy holds that ownership of the holiest site where Jews can pray, as with the rest of Jerusalem, is subject to Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Rome, the president will call upon Pope Francis, the popular, liberal-minded pontiff. Trump denounced Francis during the campaign, calling the holiest man in the Catholic faith \"disgraceful\" for questioning his faith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Brussels, Trump will attend a meeting of NATO, the World War II-era alliance which Trump has repeatedly mused about abandoning because member states weren't paying their fair share. He recently has shifted to reassure wary allies that he remains committed to the pact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in Sicily, the president will meet with the other leaders of the G7, a gathering of Western economic powers. Key parts of the group are unsettled by Trump's unpredictability and his willingness to cheer on nationalist sentiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's itinerary is heavy with religious symbolism. He'll visit the birthplace of Islam, the Jewish homeland and the Vatican. Officials say the message is \"unity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He strongly believes that it is the strength of the faith of people in these religions that will stand up and ultimately be victorious over these forces of terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Administration officials believe the unexpected move of going to Saudi Arabia first was meant to underscore the seriousness of the United States' commitment to fighting extremist groups like the Islamic State. Trump, whose denunciations of Iran have been welcomed by the Saudis, wants to frame the conflict not as one between the West and Islam, but simply between good and evil, according to his aides. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While some Middle East leaders will likely greet Trump warmly, he could receive a far cooler reception in Europe. Though Pope Francis has said he'd \"never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,\" others on the continent have sharply criticized Trump. That includes France's newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, who denounced Trump's musings on abandoning the Paris climate treaty, a likely point of contention in Sicily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's inauguration sparked thousands of protesters to fill the streets of several European capitals, chaotic scenes that could be repeated during his stops in Rome, Brussels and Sicily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Welcome to the White House abroad,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's former press secretary. \"This is a great opportunity for the president to change the subject, to make real news.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump for the eight-day, five-country itinerary, which includes stops in the symbolic homes of three Abrahamic religions. Trump may be attempting to rebuild relations with countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, which frayed under the Presidency of Barack Obama. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will also accompany Trump for most of the trip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump outlined his objectives for this trip, which comes as his Administration struggles with a series of controversies, as he addressed the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I will strengthen old friendships and seek new partners, but partners who also help us, not partners who take, and take, and take,” Trump said in his commencement address. “Partners who help pay for whatever we are doing and all of the good that we doing for them. Which is something that a lot of people have not gotten used to, and they just can’t get used to it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s his itinerary: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saudi Arabia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump arrives in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, on May 20. He will first meet King Salman in Riyadh for coffee, followed by a royal banquet, before holding bilateral talks with the King, the Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince. Trump will reportedly come bearing a $100 billion arms deal, and the leaders are likely to discuss issues such as Syria, Iran and the ongoing war in Yemen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before having dinner with the Saudi royal family, the President will take part in a signing ceremony on several agreements, which “will further solidify U.S.-Saudi security and economic cooperation” National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster told the press on May 16. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next day, Trump will hold bilateral meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of six energy rich Middle Eastern countries. The President will have lunch with leaders from more than 50 Muslim countries— including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted for alleged war crimes— during a summit. Syria and Iran were not invited to the event as they are not part of a Saudi Arabian military alliance, that is being established to fight terrorism. There, Trump will give a speech about radical ideology and Islam, which is being drafted by White House aide Stephen Miller, Politico reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to McMaster, Trump will finish-off his trip by inaugurating a new center to fight radicalism and will participate in a Twitter forum with young people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump arrives in Israel on May 22 amid a handful of diplomatic misunderstandings, which includes Trump allegedly revealing classified intelligence to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that is thought to have come from Israel, and McMaster declining to state that the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, is a part of Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump is set to meet with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem and lay a wreath at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Yad Vashem. He will then deliver remarks at the Israel Museum and reaffirm the U.S.’s “unshakable bond with our closest ally in the Middle East” McMaster said. Later that day, he will meet privately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and have dinner with Netanyahu and his wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next day, Trump will spend time with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, part of his effort to facilitate the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Jerusalem, Trump is set to say a prayer at the Western Wall, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to visit the contested territory. He will also visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vatican City NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump will meet Pope Francis at the Vatican on May 24. Both men hold opposing views on climate change and immigration. Speaking ahead of the visit on May 13, the Pontiff says he won’t try to persuade Trump to his views and he will try and find common ground with the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I will tell him what I think, he will tell me what he thinks, but I never wanted to judge someone before I listen to the person first,” the Pope said, ABC News reports. According to reports, Trump is due to nominate Callista Gingrich, the wife of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for the post of U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump will also get a tour of St. Peter’s by the Cardinal Secretary of State and will meet Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella before departing Rome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Belgium NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The President will meet Belgium’s King Philippe and Prime Minister Charles Michel, as well as heads of state and government of the country on May 25. He will then head to the E.U. headquarters in Brussels to meet the E.U. and European Council presidents. Trump has previously said that the U.K. was doing the right thing by leaving the E.U. and that other countries would follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump will then have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. During the French presidential elections, Trump told Associated Press that he thought far-right leader Marine Le Pen would do well in the vote as she was “strongest on borders, and she’s the strongest on what’s been going on in France” he told AP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump is then expected to reaffirm his commitment to NATO while unveiling the security bloc’s memorial, in front of a piece of the Berlin Wall and segment of the World Trade Center. Trump will also say that “for the good of the alliance, all members must share responsibility and share burdens” McMaster said. Secretary of Defense James Mattis will accompany Trump for a NATO meeting and dinner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Italy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump will head to Italy for the final leg of his trip for a May 26-27 G7 meeting on the island of Sicily. The event will be attended by German President Angela Merkel, Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the leaders of Italy and Japan— who are keen to gain a clear understanding of Trump’s views on a range of issues, which include trade, terrorism and the refugee crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House has however said that Trump will only make a decision as to whether he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement on his return from Sicily. According to McMaster, Trump will “press America’s economic agenda and call for greater security cooperation” he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, Trump will now deliver a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It comes after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the Masada site, according to Israel’s Channel 2 broadcaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more: What to know about Masada, the ancient Israeli site where Trump wasn't allowed to land his chopper NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike former presidents who have made the trip, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up, preferring to cancel the visit altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment, referring any matters involving Trump’s schedule to the U.S. government. The Israeli Foreign Ministry also declined to comment on Trump’s schedule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for the regulation is that helicopters on approach create dust, making landing at the desert site 1,300 feet above sea level precarious. On a previous 1997 landing by the IAF in the middle of Masada, the wind created by the helicopter caused damage to the ruins, according to the Jerusalem Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Masada, a UNESCO World Heritage site that the cultural agency calls a creation of “majestic beauty,” is built upon a mountain overlooking the shores of the Dead Sea in southern Israel’s Judean desert, some 60 miles southeast of Jerusalem. It is one of the country’s archaeological wonders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR King Herod is believed to have built the fortress, but its defining story is that its Jewish rebel defenders who—under threat from a Roman siege—killed themselves rather than be captured alive by the invading forces some time between 73 and 74 AD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR News of the president’s cancellation stirred reactions among observers of the American-Israeli relationship and officials inside the country. “Well Masada was too hot, so we found a great spot instead for POTUS,” Eitan Weiss, deputy spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry tweeted, appearing to mock the reason for the cancellation. “@IsraelMuseum. The Dead Sea Scrolls make an important setting.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Twitter user joked : “Trump is going to move the U.S. embassy to Masada,” referencing the consideration the president is giving to moving Washington’s diplomatic representation from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more: Trump ISIS leak to Russia threatens Israel-U.S. intelligence sharing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martin Indyk, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, tweeted that a raft of decisions on the Trump administration in regard to the visit has “soured” Israel’s mood. As well as the Masada cancellation, Trump will only spend 15 minutes at the national Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, a move likely to offend the Israelis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of the visit, a member of Trump’s diplomatic staff told the Israelis that the Western Wall was in the West Bank and they did not want Netanyahu to accompany Trump on his visit to the site. The declaration sparked Israel’s anger and a call from the government for an explanation from the White House, which subsequently said that this was not Trump’s position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will be the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to the Western Wall (Barack Obama only visited the site as a presidential candidate). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel considers the site to be the nearest to the holiest landmark in Judaism—the Temple Mount—where Israelis can pray, to be part of Jerusalem and, therefore, Israel. Jews cannot pray at the Temple Mount, which is controled by a Jordanian-Palestinian Islamic Waqf, or trust. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the wall sits in the old city of East Jerusalem, a territory Israel occupied in the 1967 Six-Day War, and therefore land that much of the international community, including the U.S., does not recognize as Israel’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jim Watson/AFP/Getty\n", "answers": ["\"No president has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths all on one trip,\" says National Security Adviser HR McMaster—and President Trump's critics say there are probably good reasons why. Trump departs Friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Belgium, and the G7 summit in Sicily. A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

(Matthew Fortner/Staff) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a night of fear and grief in downtown Charleston, authorities in North Carolina arrested a young white man on charges that he gunned down nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, ending a vast search but leaving the city and the nation reeling.

Clementa Pinckney’s opening prayer at the Charleston YWCA’s April 24 “Requiem on Racism 2015,” go to https://vimeo.com/126710749 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Holy City struggled to comprehend why the gunman police identified as 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof would sit down for an hour at a Bible study in the historic black church on Calhoun Street and then open fire, wiping out most of the clergy. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the killings as a hate crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victims The nine people fatally shot at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church: Clementa Pinckney, 41, the primary pastor who also served as a state senator. Cynthia Hurd, 54, St. Andrews regional branch manager for the Charleston County Public Library system. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, a church pastor, speech therapist and coach of the girls’ track and field team at Goose Creek High School. Tywanza Sanders, 26, who had a degree in business administration from Allen University, where Pinckney also attended. Ethel Lance, 70, a retired Gailliard Center employee who has worked recently as a church janitor. Susie Jackson, 87, Lance’s cousin who was a longtime church member. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49, a retired director of the local Community Development Block Grant Program who joined the church in March as a pastor. Myra Thompson, 59, a pastor at the church. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74, a pastor, who died in a hospital operating room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To President Barack Obama, the shooting stirred up “a dark part” of American history when racially motivated violence was more prevalent. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declared that such acts have “no place in a civilized society.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emotional weight of the ordeal also brought local activists, Charleston’s police chief and South Carolina’s governor to tears as they fought to find words to ease community members who fear further violence in a city with a long and complicated history involving race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,” Gov. Nikki Haley said, her voice trembling. “We have some grieving to do. ... Parents are having to explain to their kids how they can go to church and feel safe. That’s not something we ever thought we’d deal with.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a massive manhunt, Roof, who has shown interest in racial segregation and the Confederacy, was caught during a traffic stop Thursday morning in Shelby, N.C., 250 miles north of Charleston. A motorist there recognized Roof’s 15-year-old Hyundai from wanted posters distributed by police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A resident of Eastover, a rural town near Columbia, Roof smiled at television cameras Thursday afternoon as Shelby officers led him to a waiting cruiser, his mop of blond hair hanging in his eyes and a ballistic vest covering his torso. He waived extradition, and South Carolina flew him back to Charleston County to face charges in what has been called one of worst hate crimes the United States has seen in decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, the community mourned and searched for answers, with hundreds packing prayer vigils in a show of solidarity and support for the fallen and the families they left behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In all, six women and three men died after gunfire sprayed through Emanuel’s basement. Among the dead were a state senator who served as the church’s primary pastor, a beloved county librarian, a dedicated girl’s track and field coach and a young college graduate. The victims ranged in age from 26 to 87. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their deaths marked the second fatal shooting in the past three months that has drawn the nation’s eyes to the Charleston area, roiling racial tensions and prompting federal investigations. The FBI has been examining potential civil rights violations in the April 4 killing of Walter Scott, a black man shot in the back by a white North Charleston police officer. FBI agents also are looking into what motivated Wednesday’s bloody attack in Emanuel AME Church, Columbia-based spokeswoman Denise Taiste confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tragedy also renewed politicians’ focus on reform of the nation’s gun laws. Obama said Thursday during a press briefing in Washington that the Charleston shooting should spark national introspection about the availability of guns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve had to make statements like this too many times,” Obama said. “Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times. Once again, innocent people were killed because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tragedy unfolded on a hot, steamy night after about a dozen clergy and church members gathered for a regular Bible study and prayer service. They met in the basement, a ground-level floor beneath the sanctuary that housed the pastor’s office and other rooms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They studied Mark 4 16:20. “Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy ...” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A young white man, not part of the congregation, came in around 8:15 p.m. and sat down quietly. He stayed for 40 to 50 minutes as the session continued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away ...” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suddenly, the young man rose, uttered remarks that betrayed his contempt for blacks and opened fire with a gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A female trustee, who hid under a table, was among the survivors. The gunman told her he would let her live so that she could tell the story of what happened. Two other survivors, including a young girl, played dead, church members said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gunman slipped out of the church as dozens of police officers descended on the area armed with military-style rifles, teams of police dogs and helicopters that circled overhead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Area residents locked the doors and bolted their gates, fearful after news spread that a gunman was on the loose. Activists from local black communities expressed fear of being targeted next. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR James Johnson, South Carolina president of the National Action Network, stood in the middle of Calhoun Street, where city leaders had announced the death toll moments earlier Thursday morning, and cried. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson has spoken out for years about civil rights concerns in Charleston-area policing. He had recently joined Clementa Pinckney, the slain AME church pastor, for a summit about the Scott shooting in North Charleston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Johnson had never coped with anything like this, he said, and he worried that it would discourage people from talking about racially charged problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We feel that we’re not safe,” he said. “They could do the same thing when we speak out against this injustice. We must be mindful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Johnson and others grappled with such thoughts, the gunman, who had slipped out of Charleston, put distance between himself and the carnage he’d left behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators soon broadened their hunt, deploying local and statewide police agencies and top agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They also circulated surveillance camera images of a young man with a bowl haircut who appeared to be the gunman they were looking for. A bulletin included pictures of the gunman’s 2000 Hyundai Elantra and a telephone tip line for people to call if they saw the car or its driver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tips started rolling in soon after the bulletin went out. By mid-morning, investigators named Roof as the suspected gunman and a call went out for his arrest. Shortly after 11 a.m., authorities announced he had been nabbed in North Carolina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We had a number of tips that were coming in,” Mullen, the police chief, later said. “It was amazing. Whenever we got a lead ... we sent out teams. It was a tremendous effort. ... I am so pleased that we were able to resolve this case quickly ... so that nobody else is harmed by this individual.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A picture soon emerged of a troubled young high school dropout who had talked about blacks in racially inflammatory terms and had been arrested in recent months on drug and trespassing charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had been banned from a Columbia mall in February after employees of two stores alerted police that Roof, dressed in all black clothing, was asking odd questions about their operations and when workers left for the night, an incident report stated. He was arrested on a trespassing charge in April after returning to the mall, records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friends said something seemed to be bothering him, but he stayed out of trouble until he walked into Emanuel AME Church Wednesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aftermath NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama and Vice President Joe Biden called Charleston Mayor Joe Riley on Thursday to relay their condolences. They praised the efforts to track down the suspect, Riley said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a wonderful sign that we don’t let these people get away with these dastardly deeds,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But further rattling people as they mourned the losses, someone called in bomb threats to another downtown AME church where residents and leaders had gathered for a vigil and to the office building where Charleston County’s coroner announced the names of those who were slain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emotions already were raw this week from the anniversary of another tragedy that also claimed nine lives. The shooting occurred on the eve of the eighth remembrance of the June 18, 2007, Sofa Super Store blaze in West Ashley that killed Charleston firefighters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR County Coroner Rae Wooten said the anniversary made her team’s response to the shooting more difficult. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It all came back,” she said. “It was somewhat disbelief that we could ever face something that horrific again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But people from local leaders to the president expressed resolve to overcome the latest carnage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called it “absolutely despicable” for such violence to occur in a place where people come together to “laugh, love and rejoice in God’s name.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama said Emanuel AME and its congregation have risen before from flames, an earthquake and other dark times to give hope to Charleston, “and with our prayers and love and buoyancy, it will rise now as a place of peace.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Acts like this have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,” Lynch, the attorney general, added during a Thursday morning news conference in Washington. “I want everyone in Charleston and everyone who has been affected by this tragedy to know that we will do everything in our power to help heal this community and make it whole again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christina Elmore, Glenn Smith, Robert Behre, Melissa Boughton, Tony Bartelme, Schuyler Kropf and Jennifer Berry Hawes contributed to this report.\nPassage 2:\nThe Rev.

Staff/file NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond the squad cars blocking roads and news trucks jamming downtown sidewalks, Emanuel AME Church sits a white sentry of faith in the heart of historic Charleston, roped off by police tape to all who are watching her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State Rep. Bakari Sellers stands in a dapper suit under sweltering heat before national TV cameras aimed at the historic church. He tries not to glance at his cell phone clock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son of civil rights activist Cleveland Sellers, he wants to speak, to remind, to mourn with the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the news crew is running late, and he needs to dash to a prayer vigil a few blocks away at Morris Brown AME, daughter church of “Mother Emanuel,” as the devastated congregation affectionately is known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The historic Charleston congregation, founded in 1818, was the first African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. It remains the oldest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, its story really begins closer to 1816 when Morris Brown, a free shoemaker and devout Christian, walked out of a white, segregated Methodist Church in Charleston, an AME Church website states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He formed Emanuel AME which, like other black churches, became defenders of freedom to worship — and became deeply interwoven with freedom to do so much else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of its founding members was Denmark Vesey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost to this precise day 193 years ago, Vesey plotted a failed slave rebellion from the very church where so much blood spilled Wednesday as worshippers gathered to study God’s word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vesey’s rebellion might have charted a new course in the lives of enslaved black residents, had someone not tipped off authorities. But someone did. And the 1822 plot was discovered, bringing harsh reprisals to the area’s black residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vesey, a former slave but then a free carpenter, died with 34 others by the hangman’s noose. Emanuel AME was burned and its members driven underground to worship for decades. All-black churches were outlawed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ensuing investigation forced its pastor, the Rev. Morris Brown, to flee north to Philadelphia, the seat of the AME Church. The church was burned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mother Emanuel went underground. But rose again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1865, at the close of the Civil War, the congregation adopted the name Emanuel.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protective NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a similar incident in 1986 on the island of Jersey, a Crown dependency of the UK, a five-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He lost consciousness and a silverback gorilla called Jambo famously stood guard over him, protecting him from other gorillas and stroking his back. When the boy came round he started to cry and the gorillas retreated, allowing keepers and an ambulanceman to rescue the child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A life-sized statue of Jambo fetched £18,000 ($26,000) at auction and he even appeared on Jersey stamps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The western lowland subspecies inhabits west African rainforests and is the most numerous, although exact figures are not known. There are more than 500 in zoos worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting of the lions last week in Santiago, Chile, brought criticism from activists. Zoo officials said no fast-activating tranquillisers were available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man had jumped into the enclosure and stripped naked.\nPassage 3:\nThose are some of the words the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden used Sunday in a contrite explanation for the death of Harambe, a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla killed on Saturday to save a boy who slipped into the zoo's habitat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boy was in \"imminent danger,\" leaving the zoo's Dangerous Animal Response Team with no option but to shoot the 450-pound gorilla, zoo director Thane Maynard said in a statement on Facebook . Tranquilizers may not have taken effect in time to save the boy while the dart might have agitated the animal, worsening the situation, Maynard said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are heartbroken about losing Harambe, but a child's life was in danger and a quick decision had to be made,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The words did little to assuage an angry chorus of critics who believed the gorilla's death was unnecessary. Many blamed the boy's mother for failing to look after her son. Neither the boy nor his family have been identified.

An online petition seeking \"justice for Harambe\" through criminal charges earned more than 8,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others criticized the zoo for responding with what they felt was excessive force. Demonstrators gathered outside the zoo on Sunday calling for a boycott.

You all killed him for protecting a child [whose] parents couldn't contain their own children!!\" said one commenter on the zoo's Facebook page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Not a good scene' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boy, 4, was released unhurt from a Cincinnati hospital Saturday and the zoo opened on Sunday. Gorilla World, home to nine western lowland gorillas, was closed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident drew widespread attention as dramatic video spread across the Internet showing Harambe dragging the boy like a rag doll through the water across the habitat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boy climbed through a barrier and fell some 15 feet to a shallow moat in Harambe's enclosure, Maynard said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kimberley Ann Perkins O'Connor, who captured some of the incident on her phone, told CNN she overheard the boy joking to his mother about going into the water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suddenly, a splash drew the crowd's attention to the boy in the water. The crowd started screaming, drawing Harambe's attention to the boy, O'Connor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, it looked like Harambe was trying to help the boy, O'Connor said. He stood him up and pulled up his pants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the crowd's clamors grew, Harambe tossed the boy into a corner of the moat, O'Connor said, which is when she started filming. Harambe went over to the corner and shielded the boy with his body as the boy's mother yelled \"Mommy's right here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crowd's cries appeared to agitate Harambe anew, O'Connor said, and the video shows him grabbing the boy by the foot. He dragged him through the water and out of the moat atop the habitat, O'Connor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By that point, \"It was not a good scene,\" she said. When the boy tried to back away the gorilla \"aggressively\" pulled him back into his body \"and really wasn't going to let him get away,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Connor left before the shooting. When asked if the the barrier could be easily penetrated by a child, she said it would take some effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, it was a bad situation where a 4-year-old didn't have the attention of his mother for seconds,\" she said. \"I don't think it was as easy as standing up and falling in. He actually had to climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Captivity is never acceptable' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The zoo defended its safety barriers, saying this is the first time Gorilla World has experienced a breach since the exhibit opened in 1978. The exhibit is inspected regularly by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and the United States Department of Agriculture, and adheres to safety guidelines, according to the zoo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The safety of our visitors and our animals is our No. 1 priority,\" Maynard said. \"The barrier that we have in place has been effective for 38 years. Nevertheless, we will study this incident as we work toward continuous improvement for the safety of our visitors and animals.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zoo officials said the incident lasted about 10 minutes. According to a Cincinnati Fire Department incident report, the gorilla was violently dragging and throwing the child, leading the zoo's emergency responders to decide to put the gorilla down \"to save the child,\" the zoo said. The response team includes full-time keepers, veterinarians, maintenance workers, zoo leadership and security staff. All members are trained and certified annually by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said on Twitter the tragic episode was the latest proof that \"captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates.\" Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, numbering fewer than 175,000, according to the zoo. An additional 765 gorillas dwell in zoos worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1/4 Yet again, captivity has taken an animal's life.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know that was a tough decision for the zoo to make,\" one commenter said. \"Now if that child was killed because they (the zoo) didn't do anything then everyone would be up in arms.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As another person said, \"My heart goes out to all of the Zoo Family at this time. I am well aware of how difficult the decision was and it could not have been an easy one for the Zoo's Animal Response Team especially as the staff at the Zoo goes above and beyond providing compassionate care for all the animals entrusted to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is unfortunate that to save the life of a child, an animal had to be sacrificed. Thank you to all the Zoo Staff for all you do for the animals. Wishing you peace.\"\nPassage 4:\nThe creator of this petition wishes to extend her thanks and appreciation for the support in the quest to seek justice for Harambe. It is understood that the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office will make a statement on this matter on Monday, June 6. The creator of this petition will respect the decision made by the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office in this matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There has been a lot of talk in the press (especially cable news), vilifying the petition, vilifying its creator, Sheila, and making this seem like a race-baited witch-hunt for the mother and that the intent of the petition is to get kids removed from the home. Nothing can be further from the truth. Ms. Hurt condemns the racially-motivated statements made on news channels and in news stories on the internet, especially the statements that involve the legal record of a family member who was not present during the incident. Ms. Hurt feels these journalistic attacks on the family are unnecessary, hurtful, and they do not further the cause of seeking justice for Harambe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is understood that there is a petition is created in regards to closing down this one with claims that this is a racially-driven smear campaign that defames the mother involved in the incident. Once again, these allegations are false and upsetting toward Ms. Hurt whose only goal was to ensure that proper legal action was taken in this matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is important to note that Ms. Hurt’s petition has not, and will not mention the name of the family involved. There is a reason this petition has not and will not state the family members' names or any personal information about them: It is wrong and it is up to the proper authorities to have that information and any other information they need to investigate this matter. This information is only of use to Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office, not the public, and certainly not of use to anyone who signs this petition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The creator of this petition requests that no one harasses, threatens, or otherwise disturbs the family involved in this sad incident. Please understand that any disturbance toward the family may result in legal action being taken against you by the family and any involved parties. Only Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office, Hamilton County Job and Family Services, and Cincinnati Police Department should be in contact with the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three things matter in the case of Justice for Harambe: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *Ensuring that the children of the involved family are safe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *That the parents have necessary support they need to keep the children safe and that they have access to supportive services that will help them provide a safe environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *That proper LEGAL action is taken in this matter and responsible parties are held accountable if the investigation finds that there was negligence involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We understand no parent is perfect, kids are curious and can slip away, but we do get concerned when a child was at risk for serious injury and death in one of the safest settings around. It is upsetting that people vilify the Cincinnati Zoo, an institution that has done so much work in trying to turn the tide against extinction in several critically endangered species. If any of you have heard of the Sumatran rhino calf born recently- that was made possible BECAUSE of the research on Sumatran rhino reproduction at Cincinnati Zoo. The sire was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, and research conducted at the zoo ensured that the mother maintained a healthy pregnancy resulting in a healthy female calf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The zoo has made modifications to its Gorilla World viewing area and as announced in September, 2015, a new Gorilla World viewing area will be ready in Summer 2017. A sad incident at the Cincinnati Zoo has prompted this petition. On May 28, 2016 an unattended four year-old boy was able to crawl through a series of barriers at the Gorilla World enclosure. The child fell an estimated 10 to 12 feet into the moat surrounding the habitat. The 17 year-old male Western Lowland Gorilla named Harambe then got a hold of the boy. The gorilla was perceived as dragging and throwing the boy. The zoo made the last-resort decision to shoot Harambe because of the increased risk of aggression if a tranquilizer was used in such close proximity to a human. This heartbreaking decision was made in the best interests of keeping the child and the public safe.This beautiful gorilla lost his life because the boy's parents did not keep a closer watch on the child. We the undersigned believe that the child would not have been able to enter the enclosure under proper parental supervision. Witnesses claim that they heard the child state that he wished to go into the enclosure and was actively trying to breach the barriers. This should have prompted the parents to immediately remove the child from the vicinity. It is believed that the situation was caused by parental negligence and the zoo is not responsible for the child's injuries and possible trauma.We the undersigned want the parents to be held accountable for the lack of supervision and negligence that caused Harambe to lose his life. We the undersigned feel the child's safety is paramount in this situation. We believe that this negligence may be reflective of the child's home situation. We the undersigned actively encourage an investigation of the child's home environment in the interests of protecting the child and his siblings from further incidents of parental negligence that may result in serious bodily harm or even death.Please sign this petition to encourage the Cincinnati Zoo, Hamilton County Child Protection Services, and Cincinnati Police Department hold the parents responsible.\n", "answers": ["Did the gorilla have to die?

Protesters who accuse the zoo of using excessive force gathered outside the zoo Sunday and the #JusticeforHarambe movement has started a petition to have the boy's parents investigated for negligence. The zoo, however, says that while it is devastated by the death of the male western lowland gorilla, the boy was in imminent danger and tranquilizers would not have worked quickly enough. A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said.

There’s a baby in a frilly pink dress and nine other girls in matching pink and purple plaid dresses, while three boys have on black suits and magenta ties, their hair cut in mop-tops like David’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other pictures show the family in matching outfits on other group outings. And there are lots of pictures of the baby, including one in which she wears a “Mommy loves me” T-shirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the children appear thin in the photos but not obviously unhealthy. And like the sheriff’s deputies who found the victims Sunday, someone seeing the pictures may be surprised any of the children were in their 20s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attempts to reach relatives of the Turpins were unsuccessful Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A comment on one of the family photos indicates the couple moved to California around 2009. They purchased their current house in Perris — a four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,388-square-foot home that was built in 2013 — in August 2014 for $351,000, county property records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That house at 160 Muir Woods Road is also the address of Sandcastle Day School, a private school founded in the 2014-15 school year, according to state records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the 2016-17 school year, it had an enrollment of six: one student in each of the fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, 10th and 12th grades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school is within the boundaries of the Perris Union High School District, said Candace Reines, the district’s deputy superintendent for business services. However, as a private school, Reines said, Sandcastle has no association with the public district. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Private schools, they don’t have to get any approvals from the local school district,” she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than two dozen people gathered in groups on the sidewalk, and motorists drove by the house, some slowing down and pulling out their cellphones to capture the scene. A helicopter flew overhead and news reporters poured in to try to gain insight on the family, but few of the people who were outside had had much interaction with the Turpins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Santillan, who lives around the corner, heard about the case from a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I had no idea this was going on,” he said as he stood in a nearby driveway and watched the scene. “I didn’t know there were kids in the house.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neighbor Andria Valdez said she first saw four cop cars outside the Turpins’ house about 8:15 a.m. Sunday. She said officials stayed all day — one deputy was there until 10 p.m., and a truck with a camper shell that said “Riverside Services” stayed overnight, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Valdez said her family had previously joked the family at that house reminded them of the fictional Cullen family from the “Twilight” book and film series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They only came out at night,” she said. “They were really, really pale.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonte McLaurin also saw about four or five sheriff’s cars Sunday morning.

The teenager claimed her 12 brothers and sisters were being held captive inside the residence by her parents and further claimed some of her siblings were bound with chains and padlocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Police Officers from the Perris Police Department and Deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department met with the juvenile, she appeared to be only 10 years old and slightly emaciated. After a brief interview with the female, they contacted 57-year old David Allen Turpin and 49-year old Louise Anna Turpin at the residence where the teenager escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further investigation revealed several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings, but the parents were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. Deputies located what they believed to be 12 children inside the house, but were shocked to discover that 7 of them were actually adults, ranging in age from 18 to 29. The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty. Perris Station Detectives were dispatched to the residence for further investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All 13 victims, ranging from the age of 2 to 29, were transported to the Perris Station and interviewed.

The victims were provided with food and beverages after they claimed to be starving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The six children were eventually transported to the Riverside University Hospital System (RUHS) for medical examinations and admitted for treatment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An investigation began after a 17-year-old girl \"escaped\" from her home in the 100 block of Muir Woods Road and called 911 early Sunday morning to report that her 12 brothers and sisters were being held captive by their parents, according to a sheriff's news release. The call came from a cellphone that she had managed to find in the house before fleeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the disturbing phone call, she alleged some of her siblings were bound in padlocked chains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Responding officers initially believed the “slightly emaciated” girl was only 10 years old until she provided her age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After interviewing the teen, investigators went to the residence and contacted her parents, identified as 56-year-old David Allen Turpin and 49-year-old Louise Anna Turpin, according to the release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators discovered \"several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings,\" the release said. The parents could not provide a \"logical\" explanation for why the kids were restrained, investigators said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities located what they thought were 12 children, but were \"shocked\" to find out that seven of them were adults. In all, the victims are between the ages of 2 and 29, the release stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They looked to be malnourished and filthy, authorities said. The department did not say how long the children had been held under such conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victims were taken to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department's Perris Station for interviews; they were provided food and drink after telling investigators they were \"starving,\" according to the release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The six children and seven adults were then transported to different hospitals for treatment. Their conditions were not immediately known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One neighbor told KTLA that residents in the area didn't know what was going on in the home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s heartbreaking,\" she said. \"Now to know that there was that much kids in there and not even know about it then, it’s like, I wish there was something this community could have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Facebook page for a \"David-Louise Turpin\" shows photos of the couple that match the pair seen in the booking photos.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 10 female children are dressed identically in pink plaid dresses, white tights and white Mary Janes, while one of the girls holds a baby. Three male children wear suits and magenta ties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The girls all have long brown hair, and the boys have bowl haircuts, like the father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both parents were detained and interviewed while child and adult protectives services responded to assist in the investigation, the release stated. They were arrested on Muir Woods Road Sunday around 9 p.m. and booked early Monday morning at the Robert Presley Detention Center, according to inmate records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Turpins were booked on nine felony counts each of torture and 10 felony counts each of child endangerment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The release stated that David Turpin was 57, but inmate records that show his date of birth indicate he is 56. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David’s mother, Betty Turpin, told CNN the children usually dressed alike during family outings for safety purposes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They were very protective of the kids,\" she said. The parents would also line their children up according to age, and then lead the group at the front and back of the line, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a highly respectable family,\" Betty added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California records indicate a David Turpin is the principal of Sandcastle Day School, a private school that is located in the 100 block of Muir Woods Road in Perris. The address of the school matches that listed for the Turpins in public records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school -- which opened in March 2011 -- has a total of six students, one each in fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, 10th and 12th grades, according to the latest information from the state Department of Education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple filed for bankruptcy the same year Sandcastle Day School opened, after accruing about $240,000 in debt, mostly from credit cards and a foreclosed farm south of Fort Worth, Texas, federal court documents show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Turpin had been an engineer for defense contractor Northrop Grumman, where he earned about $140,000 a year, the court record indicated. His wife was a homemaker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When they declared bankruptcy, the Turpins had 12 children and \"spoke about them highly,\" their attorney, Ivan Trahan, told the New York Times in an interview. He described them as \"a very nice couple,\" noting that the family loved to visit Disneyland and visited the Anaheim theme park often. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is shocking,\" Trahan said of the accusations against the husband and wife.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the interview, Damon says there is a \"spectrum\" to behavior, and that we live in a \"culture of outrage.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"All of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum.

In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.

Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse.

Of course he’s a womanizer,” Damon continued in an interview for ABC News’ “Popcorn With Peter Travers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon, who stars in the upcoming film “Downsizing,” worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film “Good Will Hunting,” which was produced by Weinstein’s production company Miramax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” his spokesman previously said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read part of Damon’s conversation with Travers below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There’s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We’re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matt Damon: I think we’re in this watershed moment. I think it’s great. I think it’s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it’s totally necessary … I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? — I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It’s like at what point — you know, we’re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, “Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.” You know what I mean? … The Louis C.K. thing, I don’t know all the details. I don’t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, “I did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.” And I just remember thinking, “Well, that’s the sign of somebody who — well, we can work with that” … Like, when I’m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fear for me is that right now, we’re in this moment where at the moment — and I hope it doesn’t stay this way — the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life’s going to get ruined … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that’s prison. Right? And that’s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That’s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think … I don’t know Louis C.K.. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he — I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: It’s harder, isn’t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I’ve worked with him. But I didn’t see any of this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman’s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it’s not funny. It’s wrong, and he shouldn’t have done that … But when you talk about Harvey and what he’s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There’s no witnesses. There’s no pictures. There’s no braggadocio … So they don’t belong in the same category. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we’re not seeing it, is, what’s our responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: A lot of people said, ‘Well, Harvey — everybody knew.’ As you were saying, that’s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew … Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would’ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? … I knew I wouldn’t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn’t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that — I mean, look at the guy. Of course he’s a womanizer … I mean, I don’t hang out with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: But you can’t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody’s behavior that you have a professional relationship with … away from the profession bother enough that you don’t want to work with them? For me, I’ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody’s committing a crime — well, that’s your life, and you go live it. I don’t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: [We’ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in “The Martian,” having to erase Kevin Spacey from “All the Money in the World” and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven’t talked to him, but … it wasn’t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out … and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I think he’s right about that. He’s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don’t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Editor’s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, “I’m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter … But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.” In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: When it’s in that gray area and it’s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, “What’s going on? Can I help?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what’s going on. If it’s a friend of mine, I’m always talking to them. I know the real story if it’s my friend. If it’s a colleague … I don’t know … I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: We’re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it’s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, “Matt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.” We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I’d go, “I don’t want this out there. Peter’s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it’s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?” The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they’d go, “Oh, this is what it’s worth.” And I look at the number and go, “OK, I’ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You’re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now … with social media, these stories get — it’s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I’d go, “I don’t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I’ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can’t just blow me up like that.” So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That’s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I’ve seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Isn’t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they’ve been told they can’t express what happened to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: One hundred percent … I think that it’s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who’s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I’ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening — I can’t think of any of them who don’t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I don’t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can’t escape this in the headlines? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you’re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women — when you say, “Hey, let’s take a meeting in a hotel room.” I mean, we auditioned, you know, for “Good Will Hunting” in a hotel room. Like, it’s common to take meetings in a hotel room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the ’90s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, “Go meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,” you’re going to that meeting … You don’t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you … I don’t know who’s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you’re in a different city and you just don’t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there’s still those situations that that’s the nightmare kind of scenario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren’t secrets. It’s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there’s this avalanche of men … Well here’s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It’s not everybody. It just feels like it. There’s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It’s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that’s fine. That’s a good thing. That’s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we’re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, “Well, let’s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let’s all grow together and move on.” And then I’ll think we’ll be making progress.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSan Francisco (CNN) A jury on Thursday found an undocumented immigrant not guilty in the July 2015 death of Kate Steinle, a decision that reignited the debate over immigration policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, was acquitted of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges, as well as assault with a deadly weapon. Jurors convicted the Mexican citizen of being a felon in possession of a firearm, which could bring a three-year sentence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors had argued Garcia Zarate intentionally shot Steinle, 32, with a Sig Sauer .40-caliber handgun as she and her father walked on San Francisco's Pier 14. But Garcia Zarate's defense attorney said the shooting was accidental and the bullet ricocheted off the ground and traveled about 80 feet before hitting Steinle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal immigration officials said they will try to deport Garcia Zarate. He had been deported from the United States five times prior to Steinle's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reaction to the jury's decision, after more than 24 hours of deliberation over six days, was swift. President Donald Trump called the verdict \"disgraceful.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said San Franciso's status as a sanctuary city was largely to blame for what happened that summer day. Before the shooting, officials in San Francisco released Garcia Zarate from custody instead of turning him over to immigration authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Steinle, 32, was killed in July 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,\" the President tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sessions said: \"When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public's safety at risk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative pundit Ann Coulter said Steinle \"would still be alive if we had a wall,\" referring to the President's call for the construction of a border wall between the US and Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jury convinced that illegal alien killed Kate Steinle accidentally. She would still be alive if we had a wall. — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) December 1, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But one of the defendant's lawyers said the debate over immigration didn't belong in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"From day one, this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,\" public defender Francisco Ugarte said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nothing about Mr. Garcia Zarate's ethnicity, nothing about his immigration status, nothing about the fact that he is born in Mexico had any relevance as to what happened on July 1, 2015,\" the defense attorney said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle's family: Justice 'was not served' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assistant District Attorney Alex Bastian said prosecutors were disappointed in the verdict but respected the jury's decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I can't stress this enough, this really is about the Steinle family. They've shown incredible resolve in this whole process,\" he said. \"Our hearts go out to them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle's family did hear the jury's decision. Before the verdict, they told the San Francisco Chronicle that above all, they were looking forward to no longer being in the spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We just want to get this over with and move on with our lives, and think about Kate on our terms. Nothing's been on our terms. It's been on everyone else's terms,\" said Steinle's father, Jim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, Jim Steinle told the Chronicle he was \"saddened and shocked.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's no other way you can coin it. Justice was rendered, but it was not served,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deportation imminent? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tom Homan, deputy director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also criticized San Francisco's sanctuary city policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"San Francisco's policy of refusing to honor ICE detainers is a blatant threat to public safety and undermines the rule of law,\" he said in a statement. \"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE, as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets. ... Following the conclusion of this case, ICE will work to take custody of Mr. Garcia Zarate and ultimately remove him from the country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fatal shooting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle, her father and a friend were at the pier when a bullet struck Steinle's lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surveillance video showed Garcia Zarate running away. After his arrest, investigators found gunshot residue on his right hand, prosecutor Diana Garcia told jurors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia Zarate faced a charge of second-degree murder, but jurors also were allowed to consider first-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors said Garcia Zarate was playing his own \"secret version of Russian roulette\" and deliberately fired into an unsuspecting crowd on the pier, killing Steinle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier. He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juors began deliberating Tuesday in the murder trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors said Garcia Zarate immediately tried to cover his tracks by throwing the gun into the San Francisco Bay, then fleeing the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia Zarate was formerly known as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, one of several aliases he is known to have used. CNN and other media outlets previously identified him as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sanctuary cities and 'Kate's Law' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle's death stirred an already heated debate over immigration.

MUST WATCH Officials sued after Kate Steinle's death 02:00 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Freya Horne, chief legal counsel to the San Francisco County Sheriff, said in a 2015 interview that Garcia Zarate was let go because there was no legal cause to detain the suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle's family filed a lawsuit in 2016 alleging that San Francisco and its former sheriff were partly to blame for Steinle's death, because officials never notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Garcia Zarate was released from a local jail in April 2015. City officials have said they're not liable for a former inmate's actions. A federal judge dismissed the family's claims against San Francisco and former Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi earlier this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steinle's death became a rallying cry for Trump and others, who have invoked the case in decrying sanctuary cities and promoting the construction of the border wall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This senseless and totally preventable act of violence committed by an illegal immigrant is yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately,\" Trump said in July 2015. \"This is an absolutely disgraceful situation and I am the only one that can fix it. Nobody else has the guts to even talk about it. That won't happen if I become President.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also mentioned Steinle in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention after winning the Republican presidential nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3004, dubbed \"Kate's Law\" -- a measure named for Steinle. The legislation would increase maximum prison penalties for immigrants caught repeatedly entering the US illegally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The measure was introduced in the Senate but failed to get the 60 votes needed to pass.\nPassage 2:\nThe Latest: Trump: 'Disgraceful verdict' in pier shooting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Playing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Latest on the trial of a Mexican man in a killing on a San Francisco pier (all times local): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7:45 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump says there was a \"disgraceful verdict\" after a Mexican man was found not guilty of murder in a high-profile killing that touched off a fierce immigration debate.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR / Updated By Daniel Arkin and Corky Siemaszko NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The homeless Mexican immigrant who was pilloried by then-candidate Donald Trump after he was accused of fatally shooting a woman on a San Francisco pier was found not guilty of murder on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, was acquitted in a case that galvanized anti-immigration forces and forced San Francisco officials to defend their \"sanctuary city\" policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathryn Steinle, 32, died in her father's arms when she was shot on July 1, 2015, while they and a family friend were strolling along Pier 14 in the city's tourist-friendly Embarcadero district. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that's about it,\" Jim Steinle, Kate's father, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"There's no other way you can coin it. Justice was rendered, but it was not served.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump seized on the case during the campaign as proof that the United States needs his proposed border wall and weighed in on what he called the \"disgraceful verdict\" in a tweet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other tweets early Friday, Trump said the man who killed Steinle had come \"back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court.\" He added that the jury was not told that Garcia Zarate was a seven-time felon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in a statement Friday, the White House called on Congress to secure the border, \"provide the resources\" for deportations and \"finally stop sanctuary city policies that cause needless loss of innocent life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Had San Francisco enforced our nation's immigration laws, the Steinle family would be celebrating this holiday with all of their loved ones,\" the White House said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge in the trial did prohibit discussion of Garcia Zarate's immigration status and the mention that he was deported to Mexico, but returned to the U.S. five times. Instead, jurors were told to focus on the events surrounding Steinle's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defense attorneys maintained that Garcia Zarate’s history of deportations and drug offenses were nonviolent crimes. But in her closing argument, Deputy District Attorney Diana Garcia said the suspect found the gun somewhere and deliberately fired at Steinle in \"his own secret version of Russian roulette.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathryn Steinle was shot dead at San Francisco’s Pier 14 while out for an evening stroll with her father along the waterfront in 2015. Steinle Family NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bullet that felled Steinle ricocheted off the pier's concrete walkway before it struck her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia Zarate was found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He could face up to three years in state prison for that charge, although he has already served more than two years behind bars and could get credit for time served. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said late Thursday that it wants him deported instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Following the conclusion of this case, ICE will work to take custody of Mr. Garcia Zarate and ultimately remove him from the country,\" said Tom Homan, the agency's deputy director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Justice Department official said the federal government is considering bringing charges against Garcia Zarate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're looking at every option and we will prosecute this to the fullest extent of the law because these cases are tragic and entirely preventable,\" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said on \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez told jurors that the shooting was a tragic accident and that prosecutors were pushing a \"wild narrative of a desire to hurt someone he does not know.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gonzalez said that Garcia Zarate found the semi-automatic handgun wrapped in a shirt under a chair on the pier — and that it went off by accident when he picked it up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weapon, as it turned out, had been stolen from a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger a week before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The six-man, six-woman jury was asked to consider first-degree murder, second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges against Garcia Zarate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After he was elected president, Trump signed an executive order to cut funding from cities that limit cooperation with immigration authorities, a policy that a federal judge in San Francisco permanently blocked last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia Zarate, who also used the name Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, had been deported five times before the deadly encounter.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nIt’s been 31 years since May 31, 1986 — the last World Cup that didn’t feature the United States. That’s 11,456 days of progress for a sport that’s come so far in a country that still hasn’t fully embraced it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of that gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With U.S. soccer’s dreadful 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of CONCACAF’s qualifying hexagonal for the 2018 World Cup, next summer’s tournament will not feature the USMNT. No Christian Pulisic. No Tim Howard. No Michael Bradley. With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it’s not really close. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CONCACAF is a grind, but compared to the other qualifying regions, the 3.5 World Cup spots out of six teams mean that the United States should be a lock to qualify. When it beat Panama, 4-0, on Friday, the U.S. put itself in position to escape a lackluster qualifying round with a spot in the tournament. All it really needed to do was take care of business at lowly Trinidad and Tobago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They couldn’t even do that. With no sense of urgency, USMNT players and coaches had to watch as their CONCACAF counterparts did them no favors. Four years after the USMNT saved Mexico’s World Cup dreams, El Tri instead blew a lead to Honduras and helped seal the USMNT’s fate. Costa Rica also blew a lead to Panama on a goal that shouldn’t have counted and gave up a late winner as the U.S. decided to score-watch rather than take matters into its own hands. A mostly empty stadium in Couva, Trinidad and Tobago, felt even emptier on this night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s really difficult to quantify how bad this loss was for U.S. Soccer. Sunil Gulati and Bruce Arena should both be gone. Tim Howard, whose last World Cup appearance was a legendary performance, will likely leave U.S. Soccer with the lasting image of his worst performance with the national team. As bad as things got for the USMNT, the possibility of missing the World Cup didn’t actually seem real. It’s that arrogance that likely brought the team to where it is right now — out of the World Cup. When U.S. soccer legend Alexi Lalas called out the USMNT, its biggest star, Pulisic, laughed off the attempted gut-check rant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when it comes down to it, though, the sport of soccer in the U.S. is going to feel the lasting effects the most. Every World Cup is an opportunity to grow the sport on the biggest stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the growth from 2010, to 2014, to now has been tremendous. A nation went crazy when Landon Donovan sent the USMNT into the Round of 16 with his late winner in 2010 (a loss would have meant an early trip home). A nation went crazy when John Brooks put the U.S. ahead against Ghana in 2014, as he ran around not fully processing what he had done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those moments forge memories and make lifelong fans of the sport. It creates momentum that makes it possible for an MLS team to draw 71,000 fans for a regular season match. Those moments inspire a young fan to kick around a soccer ball rather than throw a football. Those moments make it possible for a 19-year-old wonderkid to break through into the next level of international stardom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s not happening anymore. It’s five years — at best — of the USMNT out of the forefront of American sports. All because U.S. soccer let 95 minutes of arrogance erase 31 years of progress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that is truly a shame.\nPassage 2:\nAshley Allen/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States Men's National Team lost to Trinidad & Tobago, 2-1, on Tuesday night and were eliminated from the 2018 World Cup as a result. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is plenty of blame to go around, including to a phantom goal that helped Panama jump the Americans in the standings, but the brunt of it should and will be placed on the players and coaches who underperformed for the better part of a year of CONCACAF qualifying play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The loss is devastating to the US men's soccer program, which had not missed a World Cup since 1986. But some executives at Fox Sports are surely just as upset with the result as coach Bruce Arena and his players. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To win a bidding war with ESPN, Fox agreed to pay $400 million for the English-broadcast rights to the World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With the Americans eliminated from 2018 contention, those broadcasts are most likely significantly less valuable than previously imagined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the US had made next year's finals, Fox would've gotten the chance to broadcast three group-stage games for the US side, with the possibility of more if the Americans were able to make a run into the knockout round. Instead, Fox will have to dig a bit deeper to find compelling storylines for American fans in the biggest tournament in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While there will still be plenty of interest in Russia 2018, it's no doubt disappointing to both American soccer fans and Fox that the US will not be a part of the competition. USMNT supporters had hoped that this World Cup would be a swan song for some of the stars who had brought so them much joy, including Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, and Tim Howard. It was also supposed to serve as a coming-out party and passing of the torch for the American wunderkind Christian Pulisic, the 19-year-old who scored the Americans' lone goal Tuesday night and who is clearly the future of the team's success if it's to have any. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But rather than a final goodbye to beloved superstars and a grand welcome to the future of the sport, the American men's soccer machine will have to collect itself, lick its wounds, and figure out a way to recover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And for Fox's initial investment to be worth anywhere near what it had anticipated, the USMNT must find a way to figure itself out ahead of 2022.\nPassage 3:\nOn the final day of World Cup qualification Tuesday, Argentina needed a win in Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, to advance to Russia. With everything to lose and a soccer mad country on pins and needles, the legendary Lionel Messi recorded a hat trick and Argentina was safe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s crazy to compare Argentina to the United States because one country has the history and youth system to remain an international force. And we certainly don’t have and perhaps never will have a player on the level of Messi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the mission and the pressure were the same. And all Bruce Arena’s team had to do was earn a tie against tiny Trinidad and Tobago to keep the USA’s World Cup dream alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we failed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spectacularly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A shocking 2-1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago, the worst team in the final round of CONCACAF regional qualifying and already eliminated, means no 2018 World Cup for the Red, White and Blue next summer. No trip to Russia. No grand stage for Christian Pulisic. And no luck for Fox Sports, which paid a fortune for the television rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a blemish for us,” U.S. coach Bruce Arena said. “We should not be staying home for the World Cup.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. finished fifth in the group. CONCACAF sends three teams automatically to the World Cup: Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama. The fourth, Honduras, heads to a playoff against an Asian confederation team, Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years. (Ashley Allen/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The political backdrop was impossible to ignore. Mexico gave up an 88th minute goal and lost, 3-2, to Honduras. A Mexico draw would have moved the U.S. into fourth place and a playoff with Australia. The United States needed help from Mexico. Imagine that. We didn’t get it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But really, the United States has only itself to blame. A tie would have secured third place and spot in Russia. It wasn’t asking much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We had everything there for us today,” Arena said. “No excuses for us not getting a second goal and at least a point.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. was poor throughout qualifying. Jurgen Klinsmann was fired as coach 11 months ago after losing at home to Mexico and getting embarrassed, 4-0, in a loss at Costa Rica over a four-day stretch. Arena, who led the U.S. to the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup, was installed as head coach. But a home loss to Costa Rica, followed by a draw against Honduras, put the team in the danger zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. last missed the World Cup in 1986. It clinched a berth in 1990 by winning at Trinidad and Tobago on the last day of qualification. That watershed victory sparked a growth for soccer in this country. Youth participation exploded, Major League Soccer started in 1996 and the popularity of the sport grew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even our player development improved. The best example is Pulisic, the 19-year-old budding star who scored the lone goal after the U.S. had fallen behind, 2-0, in the first half. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But we didn’t have enough players to replace some of our aging stars. Tim Howard, a world class goalie five years ago, simply doesn’t have it anymore. Clint Dempsey is no longer capable of playing 90 minutes. Michael Bradley has lost a step. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And our center back play was abysmal. Poor Omar Gonzalez, burned last month for Honduras’ goal, had his attempted clearance sail over Howard and into the net for an own goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. last missed the World Cup in 1986. (Ashley Allen/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s one that will haunt me forever,” Gonzalez said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fallout from this will be epic. Heads will roll. Arena is done. Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, could be in trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe the United States needed a major setback to move forward. Good teams, even great teams, have missed the World Cup. England and France didn’t qualify in 1994. The Netherlands is out of the 2018 World Cup. Italy has to win a playoff to get in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s also much tougher to qualify in Europe. Same with South America. The United States has a geographic advantage, especially with the financial resources and population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The players are here. We just haven’t discovered enough of them. And we haven’t developed enough of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s time for a reboot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now we have until 2022 to get it right.\nPassage 4:\nCOUVA, Trinidad and Tobago — On the most surreal and embarrassing night in U.S. soccer history, the U.S. men’s national team lost 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago (the worst team in the CONCACAF Hexagonal) and was eliminated from contention for World Cup 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The doomsday scenario happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the U.S. needed to do to qualify for the World Cup was to win or tie. And they lost, a deserving defeat that ended a miserable qualifying campaign—three wins in 10 Hexagonal games—and will raise enormous questions about the overall direction of the U.S. Soccer Federation, the players and coach Bruce Arena. The U.S. loss opened the door to Panama and Honduras, which both needed to win to ensure the U.S. elimination, which was exactly what happened. Honduras rallied from two deficits to beat Mexico in San Pedro Sula, while Panama rode a controversial Blas Perez opener and a Roman Torres late winner to beat Costa Rica in Panama City. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are three thoughts on the USA's ouster: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. should be utterly embarrassed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a night when Arena’s team had control of its own destiny, the Americans had one of the most infamous belly-flops in U.S. soccer history, losing to the already-eliminated Trinis with everything on the line for the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a pitiful first-half performance, the U.S. lacked urgency and went through the motions while the hosts looked like the ones who had a chance to qualify for the World Cup. Trinidad and Tobago took a 2-0 halftime lead on an own-goal by Omar Gonzalez and a golazo from distance by Alvin Jones, and the U.S. response was tepid at best. This was a team with players acting like they thought they had already qualified for the World Cup, and it showed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only one U.S. player had a decent game NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christian Pulisic pulled one back for the Americans early in the second half with a laser from outside the box. Pulisic was largely bottled up otherwise, but at least he had one dazzling moment. His teammates could hardly say the same. Forwards Jozy Altidore and Bobby Wood were nonexistent. Wings Darlington Nagbe and Paul Arriola were invisible. Goalkeeper Tim Howard could have been in better position on both goals. And Gonzalez showed with his own-goal and what should have been called a penalty soon thereafter that he was a poor choice by Arena to be on the field, especially with Premier League starter Geoff Cameron on the bench. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tear it all down NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The far-reaching impacts of this colossal failure will be felt for a long time, not just by the figures on the field on Tuesday but also by the millions and millions of dollars lost by any number of stakeholders in the sport in the United States. The men’s World Cup only comes around once every four years, and the missed opportunity to create millions of new soccer fans in the U.S. is a crushing blow. Missing the World Cup won’t cripple the sport in the U.S., but it will be a huge step back for a sport that had been on the rise for a long time.\nPassage 5:\nSo the U.S. men's national team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup on Tuesday, but there is reason to believe they shouldn't have been eliminated. Panama beat Costa Rica 2-1 to clinch the final spot and send the U.S. crashing out, but the Panamanian's first goal didn't even go in. As to whether it can be appealed remained to be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS Sports reached out to U.S. Soccer about whether an appeal could be filed. Press Officer Michael Kammarman said in an email, \"As far as I know there is no recourse. Decisions of the referee are final.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It all comes from Gabriel Torres's phantom goal that made it 1-1. You'll see here, the ball never crossed the line: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Estados Unidos se queda fuera del Mundial por un gol de Panamá que ni entró pic.twitter.com/k2JojPf7bq — Joaquín López-Dóriga (@lopezdoriga) October 11, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shocking. No goal-line technology, and this is what happens. An unbelievable scene, and certainly unfair. Yes, there's the human error part in any officiated match, but what recourse does the U.S. have? Rules from CONCACAF say an appeal can be filed for \"parties directly affected by a decision\" and that there are 21 days to file it -- whether this would fall under that remains to be seen: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article 54. Jurisdiction of CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland) as an appeals arbitration body NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. As an appeals arbitration body, CAS shall be entitled to hear appeals against final decisions passed by CONCACAF. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Only parties directly affected by a decision may appeal to CAS. However, where doping-related decisions are concerned, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) may appeal to CAS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. The time limit for appeal to CAS shall be twenty-one (21) days from the receipt of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR decision in question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. An appeal before CAS may only be brought after CONCACAF's or FIFA's internal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR procedures and remedies have been exhausted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. An appeal shall not have any suspensory effect as a stay of execution of a disciplinary NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR sanction, subject to the power of CAS to order that any disciplinary sanction be stayed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR pending the arbitration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. CAS shall not take into account facts or evidence which the appellant could have NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR submitted to an internal CONCACAF body by acting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, it's certainly a long shot for anything like this to be overturned. CAS usually sees more cases about doping and was involved in CONMEBOL qualifying. The goal will almost certainly stand, but the U.S. would be wise to do whatever it takes to have its voice heard after this decision. It's the difference between the U.S. going still having a chance to go to the World Cup or sitting at home and watching it.\nPassage 6:\nThe biggest failure in American soccer history is as complex as it is damaging. There is no one source, no single target for blame. The list of culprits exceeds five, 10, 20 and even 100. The building blocks of a national soccer team are nearly infinite. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Every single one of those building blocks will be smashed to bits by criticism following Team USA’s 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago, a defeat that eliminated it from World Cup contention. And rightly so. Much of the criticism is long overdue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scroll to continue with content Ad NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some of the blocks that will crumble are bigger than others. Some are massive. Here are the five most blameworthy culprits of a failure that touched every level of the sport in the United States, in descending order, beginning with the least culpable of the five. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Jurgen Klinsmann NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former national team boss is far from the biggest culprit. But he’s not exempt here. He dug the U.S. a qualifying hole with losses to Mexico and Costa Rica 11 months ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Klinsmann’s faults were spread out over much more than 180 minutes last November. He ran the program into the ground with aimless tactics, a stale vision and constant ill-preparedness. He stunted players’ development by playing them out of position, and generally didn’t fulfill the promises he made when he took over as manager in 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite all that, though, his team cruised through qualification last time around, and outperformed expectations at the World Cup. His successor couldn’t even get there … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Bruce Arena NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arena, previously in charge of the national team from 1998 to 2006, was brought in to dig the U.S. out of Klinsmann’s hole. And the odd thing is that, well, he did. He got eight points from his first four qualifiers, and had the U.S. in position to qualify with ease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story continues NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then it all went wrong. Horribly, painfully, catastrophically wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all of the wrongdoing was Arena’s. In fact, not much of it was even when the U.S. picked up just one point from two September games against Costa Rica and Honduras. Those were primarily on the players. Perhaps all of this is primarily on the players. But more on them later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arena cleaned up some of Klinsmann’s mess. But he created messes of his own, and those messes caught fire in Trinidad. His close-mindedness when it came to squad selection – his outright refusal to even care about replenishing an aging squad – came back to haunt him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His lineup philosophies were also two-faced. He seemingly believed in rotation and freshness over consistency, which worked in Mexico City in June, and barely did again in Honduras in September. But then he stuck with an unchanged starting 11 Tuesday in Trinidad, presumably thinking he had found a winning formula. He hadn’t. Instead, he found a tactically naive method to engineer the U.S.’ failure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday’s task was fundamentally different from Friday’s in every possible way. On Friday, Arena went all-out attack at home with the U.S. needing a win against Panama. Understandable. On Tuesday, with the U.S. needing only a point in substandard conditions away from home, he inexplicably chose attack again over solidity and control. He effectively played three strikers and two wingers, leaving the U.S. disjointed as a unit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also benched his best center back – a center back who played 90 minutes the previous weekend for Stoke City in the English Premier League, and who has been doing just that, and doing it well, consistently for a while now. With that center back, Geoff Cameron, sitting on the bench, the mistake-prone Omar Gonzalez made a horrendous error that ultimately cost the U.S. a spot at the World Cup. But he never should have been in that position in the first place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arena had one job. He didn’t do it. And he’s now coached his last game with the national team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Soccer Sunil Gulati has his first contested election coming up in February – if he decides to run. (Getty) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Sunil Gulati NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is impossible to shy away from criticism of the man who hired No. 4 and No. 5 on this list as well. The head honcho. United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His hires aren’t the only issue. But they’re the most easily identifiable. He had courted Klinsmann basically ever since the former German World Cup-winning striker managed his native land to third at the 2006 tournament on home soil. Gulati finally got him in 2011. It was an ambitious choice. A pricey one too. But it was probably always misguided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, Klinsmann performed somewhat admirably, at least initially. The issue was that the allure of his stature in world soccer was too much for Gulati to assess his performances accurately. The president, for some reason, rewarded his manager with a long-term contract extension before the 2014 World Cup, then clung to the coattails of a regime going backward for too long thereafter. When he did pull the trigger and axe Klinsmann 11 months ago, Arena was the right choice. The wrong choice was letting Klinsmann survive as long as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wrong choices were also many other things. Gulati’s presence in powerful positions has probably been a net positive for soccer in America. But, among other failures, one of them the mishandling of Klinsmann, he has not adequately invested in youth development. In the building blocks that allow a national team to sustain consistent success. He and the federation have invested in them, but haven’t devoted enough attention to actually solving real problems. They are sitting on millions of dollars that could be used to address the problems. Those dollars haven’t been used for that purpose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Gulati himself could pay. A U.S. Soccer presidential election looms in four months. Gulati, for the first time, has challengers. There will be louder calls for change than ever before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. The players NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gulati, though, didn’t make defensive errors. Arena didn’t misplace passes in midfield. Klinsmann didn’t waste chances in front of goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The players, in the end, are to blame for what just transpired. They were deserving of praise on several specific occasions. On the whole, they, as a collective, were sub-par. And then on Tuesday, they were worse than that. Far worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all of them were at fault. Christian Pulisic is and was special. Michael Bradley carried a massive burden and handled it fairly well. But the rest … most of them were mediocre at best. Jozy Altidore was too inconsistent. The back four were disorganized and generally underwhelming, whoever the four were. Darlington Nagbe didn’t live up to his creative billing. Tim Howard made several mistakes throughout the Hex, and in his prime might have kept out both of Tuesday’s goals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The players did not perform up to the standard expected of them. At times, circumstances could be used as legitimate excuses. But none of them excuse 12 points from 10 games against mostly inferior opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The natural follow-up question, then, is this: Did the players underperform? Or are they simply not good enough? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. A broken system NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The answer is both. The second item on this list speaks to the underperformance. The first, this one, speaks to the inadequacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. player pool is strong. Stronger than it was two decades ago. But the obvious point is the broad one: That player pool is nowhere near what a nation of 325 million should be able to produce. The reasons for this are deep-seated and poisonous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main one is the youth soccer model that was established in the U.S. decades ago. Whereas talented young players in many other countries are given scholarships to soccer academies, the vast majority of children in the U.S. “pay to play.” This slashes the size of the player pool into a fraction of what it could be, because kids from low-income families can’t afford the hefty registration fees and travel-related costs. Elite coaching eludes them. The issue is far too complex for this forum, but it’s a major hindrance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talent identification and youth coaching have also been severely lacking. Scouting efforts ignore many under-served communities. Potential pros slip through the cracks at young ages. In many cases, kids aren’t educated properly, because they’re taught by teammates’ dads who don’t know the game. The kids, therefore, don’t develop the most relevant and applicable skills. Again, the root causes are impossible to explain in two paragraphs. But they’ve plagued the U.S. for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The symptoms of the problems are easier to explain. As American Soccer Now’s Brian Sciaretta explored just last week, there is a glaring gap in the age profile of the current U.S. squad. There are talented youngsters and accomplished veterans. But the 23-27 age range – made up of players born in the years 1990-1994, players who came through the system before youth development reform truly took effect – is alarmingly bereft. A generation of players that should be spearheading the national team is absent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The “Missing Years,” as Sciaretta called them, more than anything else, explain why the U.S. shockingly couldn’t beat Trinidad and Tobago, a nation 1/230 its size. With MLS academies growing, other revamped youth systems producing and problems gradually – very gradually; too gradually – being addressed, this won’t happen again. Or at least it shouldn’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the failures in scouting and coaching have left a massive hole in the men’s national team. A hole that not even Klinsmann could dig. And one that the U.S. finally tripped into Tuesday in Trinidad.

But just how bad a loss is this? The defeat is \"the most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history,\" writes Grant Wahl for Sports Illustrated. \"Unthinkable,\" declares the New York Times. \"With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it’s not really close,\" writes Andrew Joseph for USA Today. \"It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years,\" writes Frank Isola at the Daily News. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 'South Texas Blood and Tissue Center' wants to help, but is already facing a severe shortage. By donating much-needed blood, STBTC would be able to need San Antonio’s local needs and help fill the game in Louisiana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The center said the summer months are difficult for donations. A big portion of the donors are students, many who are on summer vacation. On top of that, the Zika virus is adding to the cause of a blood shortage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Zika situation has also affected our inventory because we can't take blood from people who have traveled to Zika-affected areas for 28 days after they've returned,” said Julie Vera of STBTC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One thing that has changed is that the center can now test for the Zika virus. It's just an extra consent form to sign.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to carry the Zika virus, is photographed through a microscope at the Fiocruz institute in Recife, Pernambuco state, Brazil. (Photo: AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The massive flooding across southeastern Louisiana over the weekend could bring an increased risk for the Zika virus after the waters recede, an expert in tropical medicine said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strong floodwaters often wash away mosquito eggs, which would be good news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But mosquito eggs already laid in containers, such as empty buckets or tires, could be protected from surging water and then be stimulated to hatch after the flooding recedes, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We could be seeing an increase number of Aedes aegypti now in the coming weeks,” he said about the mosquito species that carries the Zika virus. \"This is crunch time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ben Beard of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agreed that the coming weeks will be important for monitoring the number of mosquitoes, but he does not expect an increase in the ones that carry the Zika virus, although he admits there is uncertainty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wouldn’t say right off that there’s reason to believe that (the flooding) would have significant impact,\" said Beard, deputy incident manager for the Zika outbreak program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said there could be an increase in other types of mosquitoes, but he pointed out that the Zika-carrying species is smaller and more easily washed away by floodwaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beard added that if the CDC and local monitoring authorities do begin to see increased numbers, it would trigger a massive response to prevent the spread of Zika. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No local cases of Zika have been reported in Louisiana, but Hotez said there could possibly be cases that have gone unreported. Florida is the only state where Zika was contracted locally, and not from travel outside the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flooding could increase the risk for other mosquito-borne illnesses, such as West Nile Virus, Hotez said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mustapha Debboun, director of mosquito control at Texas' Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services, told USA TODAY in April that flooding can \"create plenty of breeding habitats for mosquitoes, which will increase in larger populations as the temperature and humidity rises.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Ryan Miller on Twitter @MILLERdfillmore NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE ZIKA VIRUS IN THE NEWS Scientists are getting closer to developing an effective Zika vaccine | 1:01 The U.S. is enrolling more than 2,000 people in experimental Zika vaccine tests.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

Read More NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iowa State Representative Henry Rayhons is awaiting trial on a felony charge that he raped his wife at a nursing home where she was living. Close NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 350 people attended the wedding reception of Donna Lou Young and Henry V. Rayhons in Duncan, Iowa, on Dec. 15, 2007. Family and friends ate pork roast and danced polkas to celebrate the union of a widow and a widower, both in their 70s, who had found unexpected love after the deaths of their long-time spouses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the next six-and-a-half years, Henry and Donna Rayhons were inseparable. She sat near him in the state House chamber while he worked as a Republican legislator. He helped with her beekeeping. She rode alongside him in a combine as he harvested corn and soybeans on his 700 acres in northern Iowa. They sang in the choir at Sunday Mass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We just loved being together,” Henry Rayhons says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, he’s awaiting trial on a felony charge that he raped Donna at a nursing home where she was living. The Iowa Attorney General’s office says Rayhons had intercourse with his wife when she lacked the mental capacity to consent because she had Alzheimer’s. She died on Aug. 8, four days short of her 79th birthday, of complications from the disease. One week later, Rayhons, 78, was arrested. He pleaded not guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To convict Rayhons, prosecutors must first convince a jury that a sex act occurred in his wife’s room at the Concord Care Center in Garner, Iowa, on May 23. If prosecutors prove that, his guilt or innocence will turn on whether Donna wanted sex or not, and whether her dementia prevented her from making that judgment and communicating her wishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The State of Iowa vs. Henry Rayhons offers a rare look into a complex and thinly explored dilemma that will arise with increasing frequency as the 65-and-over population expands and the number of people with dementia grows. It suggests how ill-equipped nursing homes and law enforcement agencies are to deal with the nuances of dementia, especially when sex is involved. The combination of sex and dementia also puts enormous strains on family relationships, which turned out to be a critical element in the Rayhons case. His four children are supporting him. Two of Donna’s three daughters played a role in Rayhons’ investigation. Through their attorney, Philip Garland, the two declined to be interviewed for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sexual assault laws years ago recognized that a spouse cannot force himself or herself upon the other. Dementia confuses the issue. People with dementia can lose past inhibitions about sex and become aggressive about seeking it. They might be unable to balance a checkbook while they’re perfectly capable of deciding whether they desire a partner’s affections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts in geriatrics say that intimacy -- from a hug to a massage to intercourse -- can make dementia sufferers feel less lonely and even prolong their lives. Love complicates things further. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By many accounts, Henry and Donna Rayhons were deeply in love. Both their families embraced their marriage. The case has produced no evidence thus far that the couple’s love faded, that Donna failed to recognize her husband or that she asked that he not touch her, said Rayhons’ son Dale Rayhons, a paramedic and the family’s unofficial spokesman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on evidence generated so far, state prosecutors are likely to portray Rayhons as a sex-hungry man who took advantage of a sweet, confused woman who didn’t know what month it was, forgot how to eat a hamburger and lost track of her room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Any partner in a marriage has the right to say no,” said Katherine C. Pearson, who teaches and writes about elder law at the Penn State Dickinson School of Law and reviewed the Rayhons case at the request of Bloomberg News. “What we haven’t completely understood is, as in this case, at what point in dementia do you lose the right to say yes?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews, Rayhons said his life and reputation are already ruined. Shortly before his arrest, he withdrew from the election that probably would have won him his 10th consecutive two-year term representing a northern Iowa district in the state House of Representatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sitting in his son’s heated garage on a chilly October night, he convulses with sobs recalling the events of recent months. He says he’s most distraught about being kept from Donna during the last weeks of her life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My wife just died and you’re charged with something like this because you prayed by her bed,” he says. “It hurts. It really hurts.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This story was assembled from hundreds of pages of documents filed with Iowa regulators and the Hancock County District Court in Garner as well as interviews with more than two dozen people. Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for Iowa attorney general Tom Miller, declined to comment or make prosecutors available for interviews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry and Donna NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry Rayhons is a sturdy, 6-foot-2-inch man whose family has farmed in northern Iowa for more than a century. He graduated in 1954 from the high school in Garner, a town of clapboard homes and 3,100 people about 110 miles north of Des Moines. Rayhons took night classes in farming and never attended college. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He married Marvalyn Carolus in 1959. They had two daughters and two sons who helped them grow crops and raise dairy cows northwest of Garner. Diabetes forced Marvalyn to undergo two kidney transplants and cost her parts of her feet and her vision. At home, Rayhons dressed her wounds and hung IV bottles, his children said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Marvalyn’s condition deteriorated in 2006, Rayhons said, “She told me, ‘Don’t stay alone. Find someone to share your life with you.’” After she died that November, he grew despondent. His son Dale, 52, recalls his father saying, “I keep praying for God to just take me. I’m nothing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next summer, Rayhons got to know Donna Lou Young, an elegant woman with an infectious smile and a shock of white-on-silver hair set over her forehead like a tiara. She grew up in Garner, where her parents owned a bakery, and later worked as a secretary at the high school there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After her husband of 48 years died in 2001, Donna survived on savings, Social Security checks and what she made selling honey from bees her late husband had kept. She loved babies, cookbooks and her garden. Friends and family gobbled up her potato bread, pickles and onion rings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She and Rayhons began to flirt while singing in the choir at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Garner. “She was always a very well-dressed lady, which I admired,” Rayhons said. “She liked high-heeled shoes.” In August 2007, he asked her to accompany him to the Iowa State Fair. Donna said she’d go if he first went with her to her daughter’s 25th anniversary party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long after, Rayhons told his son Gary Rayhons, 43, that he and Donna were going to wed. “He’s not a very emotional man,” Gary said. “It’s probably only the second time in my life he gave me a hug, he was so happy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry Huber, then pastor of St. Boniface, dubbed Donna “Smoochie” because she and Rayhons often kissed at the “sign of peace” during Mass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They were two good people who were good together,” Huber said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Children of both Donna and Rayhons helped with the wedding arrangements. St. Boniface was dressed in scarlet poinsettias. The bride wore a white veil. At the reception, Malek’s Fishermen played polkas within the wood-paneled walls of the Duncan Community Ballroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons said he and Donna “danced with our grandchildren until 11 o’clock and we were so tired, we just went home and never thought of what newlyweds are supposed to do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They lived in Rayhons’ house in Hayfield before moving to a condo in Garner. Donna became a fixture at the state Capitol in Des Moines, where the part-time legislature meets for about four months each year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Her clothes were always immaculate. She was always in a skirt,” said Charity McCauley Andeweg, who clerked for Rayhons. He bought Donna more than a dozen dresses on sale at the Goodnature department store in Garner. “She was so proud that he would go shopping with her,” McCauley Andeweg said. “He treated her like a queen.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the summer, they went arm-in-arm to July 4th parades and polka festivals, pork feeds and fish fries. Rayhons got himself a bee suit. “I learned about beekeeping in a real hurry,” he said. He and Donna attended Mass once or twice a week and enjoyed leisurely drives in the flatlands surrounding Garner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was usually hard to find them at home,” said Rayhons’ daughter Carol Juhl, 54. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diagnosis: Alzheimer’s NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four years ago, Donna saw a neurologist for headaches and forgetfulness. He diagnosed her with possible early onset Alzheimer’s. Over the next few years, she began to repeat herself, family and friends say. She left belongings behind. She drove on the wrong side of the road. She put a single sock in her dryer when she meant to do a full load. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons said he took her driver’s license, unplugged the dryer, and kept her away from the stove. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 5.2 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, the Alzheimer’s Association says. Partly due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation, the association expects the number of those 65 and over with Alzheimer’s to exceed 7 million by 2025, barring medical breakthroughs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While fatal for every victim, Alzheimer’s experiences vary. A person who lacks mental capacity to fathom a grocery list could be able to choose the television show she wants to watch. Those capabilities can vary from day to day and hour to hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When somebody has dementia, their ability to know is impaired, but it also fluctuates,” said Pearson of the Penn State law school. “It’s not an on-or-off switch. It’s more of a dimmer switch.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That makes it difficult to measure with precision a sufferer’s ability to make a particular judgment at a particular moment, especially when it comes to the emotionally fraught subject of sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pearson said rape cases involving a spouse with dementia are extremely rare and she couldn’t recall another one in more than 20 years of work on elderly issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is maybe the last great frontier of questions about capacity and dementia,” she said. “And it’s all tied up with our own personal feelings about sex.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By early this year, two of Donna Rayhons’ daughters were concerned about their mother’s worsening dementia and the way Rayhons was caring for her. Linda Dunshee, 54, and Suzan Brunes, 52, had heard from a legislator, a lobbyist and other people working in the Capitol that he sometimes left her alone while he was in meetings. They worried she’d wander the hallways or outside on her own, according to their statements to investigators and other court documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brunes, a hospital administrator, and Dunshee, executive director of a non-profit serving people with intellectual disabilities, had talked to Rayhons about putting their mother in a nursing home. He had resisted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says now he didn’t want to be separated from her. He says he wanted to get her professional care that would allow her to keep living with him. His son Dale said, “I’m sure there was probably a little bit of denial in it, that things weren’t as bad as they seemed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On March 25, Dunshee picked up Donna in Des Moines and took her for lunch at a downtown restaurant, according to testimony Dunshee later gave to a state investigator. Beneath her winter coat and blazer, Donna was wearing a sleep teddy that exposed her breasts, Dunshee told the investigator. In a restaurant bathroom, Donna put her hands in the toilet bowl. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Boedeker, a family physician in the Garner area, examined Donna and recommended placing her in a nursing home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Donna Was Gone’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On March 29, Brunes and Dunshee moved their mother into Concord Care Center in Garner, two miles from the condo where Donna and Rayhons lived. Rayhons was aware that Donna might be moving, though he had resisted, according to a log kept by the daughters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While his wife was moving, Rayhons was attending a legislative forum 30 miles away. “I got home and Donna was gone,” he said, his face flushing red with anger. “I couldn’t talk to the girls. They were the boss.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Concord Care is a red-brick, one-story building that sits nine blocks from the courthouse where Rayhons is scheduled to be tried. The 66-bed facility is one of more than 50 nursing homes, assisted living centers and other long-term care facilities operated by privately held ABCM Corp. of Hampton, Iowa. Concord Care administrator Holly Brink declined to comment on the Rayhons case. She told investigators that Rayhons had trouble understanding dementia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On its website, ABCM says its properties embrace a policy of “person-directed care” designed to give each resident a prominent voice in how she or he lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Concord Care has no designated unit for dementia sufferers, though staffers try to minimize activity that could agitate them, Brink said. The home doesn’t have a specific policy on sexual matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staff notes portray Donna in her early weeks at the home as pleasant, alert and occasionally forgetful. She initiated conversation with other residents and enjoyed bingo, music and other activities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donna had a room to herself where one afternoon a nurse opened the door to find her in bed and Rayhons kneeling in prayer. Brink later told a state investigator that the two held hands and “Henry was more affectionate with Donna than most people were,” an interview summary said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the legislature was in session, Rayhons awoke many days at 5 a.m. so he could see Donna before driving two hours to Des Moines. When the House finished for the day, he drove back to have dinner with her, say a Rosary, and kiss her goodnight, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donna’s condition worsened in May. She had trouble eating and finishing sentences, didn’t recognize mashed potatoes and wandered into other residents’ rooms, according to statements to investigators and other documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was increasing friction between Rayhons and Donna’s daughters, Brunes and Dunshee. Rayhons pushed for taking his wife out on outings, which the daughters thought agitated their mother, and made derogatory remarks to Donna about the daughters and Concord Care, according to the daughters’ log. Rayhons says now that Donna became upset because he couldn’t be with her all the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brunes and Dunshee also were increasingly concerned that their mother was having sex with Rayhons when she lacked the capacity to knowingly consent, according to interviews with investigators and other documents. The daughters’ log says a nurse told the women that on a number of occasions, Donna was wearing nothing but a robe after a visit from Rayhons, and that staffers “felt sickened by what he was doing to her.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brunes told a state investigator that her mother said Rayhons wanted sex one to two times daily, and that Donna once pointed at her crotch and said, “Henry likes this a lot.” Rayhons later told the investigator that his wife enjoyed sex whenever they had it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On May 14, Brunes and Dunshee met with Brink and John Brady, another family physician caring for Donna at the home. They discussed a new plan to limit outside activities, including outings with Rayhons, so Donna’s routine would be more consistent and less agitating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consent or Not? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady initialed a one-page document listing the restrictions and including a question about whether Donna was mentally able to consent to “any sexual activity.” Brady wrote, “No.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plan and the sexual decision were based on Donna faring poorly on a standardized cognitive test called the Brief Interview for Mental Status. The BIMS is used to identify nursing home residents with dementia for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates nursing homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Test subjects score from 0 to 15 on a series of memory questions such as what year, month and day it is. They’re given the words “sock,” “blue,” and “bed” and asked to repeat them. Donna scored 2 on a BIMS given her on April 3 and zero on a May 13 test. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using the BIMS to gauge a dementia sufferer’s ability to make sexual and other decisions is a mistake made by many long-term care facilities, said Susan Wehry, a geriatric psychiatrist and commissioner of the Vermont state department that investigates sexual and other abuse in nursing homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m sensitive to the nursing home’s desire to protect their resident and certainly to the daughters’ desire to protect their mother,” Wehry said. “The BIMS in this case tells me nothing except that she has dementia. You can have virtually no short-term memory and still consent to a lot of things.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Douglas Wornell, a Tacoma, Washington, geriatric psychiatrist and author of the 2013 book “Sexuality and Dementia,” said it was “naïve” to conclude that Donna’s inability to recall words meant she couldn’t decide whether she wanted sex, which is “along the order of knowing you want some food.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons was presented with the document saying Donna couldn’t make decisions about sex in a meeting with her daughters and Concord Care staff on May 15. He said he understood and “it wouldn’t be any problem,” Brunes told a state investigator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few days later, Brunes and a Concord Care social worker discussed moving Donna into a room with a roommate she could interact with, according to the log the daughters kept. The home needed Donna’s room for a male resident and Brunes thought having a roommate might prevent “potential sexual acts,” according to a log she and Dunshee kept. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donna moved into Room 12 North on Friday, May 23. She wasn’t happy about it, according to the daughters’ log. She wept and accused Brunes of not liking her husband. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That evening, Donna’s roommate, 85-year-old Polly Schoneman, was sitting in a chair when Rayhons came to visit Donna at about 7:40 p.m. He stayed for about half an hour. Shortly after he left, Schoneman hit the call button in Room 12 North’s bathroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was crying when nurse Shari Dakin and a nurse assistant came in. “I just can’t stand him,” Schoneman told them. She said Rayhons closed a privacy curtain between the beds and said, “Honey, I’m going to get you ready for bed,” the staff notes say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schoneman said she then heard “sexual” noises, the notes say. “I’m not stupid, I know what was going on,” she told the staffers. A video camera in the hallway caught Rayhons dropping his wife’s panties into a hamper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rape Test NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A flurry of calls between staff and Donna’s daughters followed. Around 10:30 p.m., Dunshee asked that police be called. Sometime after midnight, Garner’s police chief and Brunes took Donna to a hospital for a sexual assault test, the staff notes say. Donna’s panties and bedding were sent to the state crime lab in Ankeny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brunes told nursing home staff that her mother “tolerated the hospital assessment well” and there was “no bruising or tearing of her vaginal skin,” according to a log prepared by a staffer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons returned the next morning and sat near an aviary with Donna, holding hands. “Donna was smiling, talking with him about the farm,” the staff notes say. He was unaware that police had taken Donna for a rape test the night before. Staffers told him he was no longer allowed in 12N because he made Donna’s roommate uncomfortable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “How much more are you going to cut me off from her?” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three weeks later, Rayhons was getting his mail one morning when special agent Scott Reger of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation pulled up in an unmarked Chrysler 300. Reger identified himself. As Reger followed Rayhons into his condo, the agent turned on his audio recorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By then, Rayhons knew he was under investigation for possible sexual assault. It had come up at an informal court conference about Brunes’ successful petition to become Donna’s temporary legal guardian. Rayhons initially thought he should be his wife’s guardian and backed off after learning he “had a much bigger fight coming,” son Dale said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under terms of the guardianship, Rayhons agreed to more limits on interactions with Donna. He needed Brunes’ permission to take his wife on outings. Among other things, Rayhons was kept from taking Donna to a friend’s funeral, because her daughters felt it could agitate her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons and agent Reger, 39, sat facing each other on bar stools in Rayhons’ kitchen. On the refrigerator door hung a photograph of Donna that Rayhons says he kisses whenever he opens the fridge. He and Reger talked for almost two hours, according to an 89-page transcript of the agent’s audiotape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons told Reger that Donna had “gone downhill badly” after entering Concord Care, though she had days when she could have a coherent conversation. He said she had begged him to take her for a drive so she could “see the crops growing and the honeybees coming out of the hives.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said, “She hates the place she’s in.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reger asked about their sex life. “It was not a regular thing,” Rayhons told the agent. At his age, he said, “you forget about that stuff and you just want togetherness.” He said Donna on occasion asked for sex by saying, “Shall we play a little bit?” He said he “never touched her when she didn’t want it and I only tried to fulfill her need when she asked for it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reger pressed him about the evening of May 23. Rayhons said he couldn’t remember being in Donna’s room. After suggesting that tiny video cameras had captured Rayhons having sex with Donna, Reger asked if Rayhons had placed his penis inside his wife. Rayhons said, “I would guess … if … if that’s what you’re saying, yeah.” The state hasn’t produced evidence thus far of videos taken in the room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons acknowledged seeing the document asserting that Donna couldn’t consent to sex. Then he argued with Reger about whether she could. “She still asks for it,” Rayhons said, and the agent replied, “I know that she didn’t ask for it that night, okay?” After letting Reger take DNA swabs of his mouth, Rayhons said, “I don’t remember having sex in that room with her. I really do not.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the agent left, Rayhons drove his black Cadillac to son Dale’s house in Forest City, 13 miles away. Dale recalls his father as upset and confused: “He said, ‘I don’t know what just happened.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hancock County attorney David Solheim oversees most criminal prosecutions in his jurisdiction. He said he let the state handle the Rayhons case because Rayhons “is a well-known political figure here” and “it would be better that we didn’t get into the weeds of the local politics.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Love You, Honey’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons saw his wife for the last time on Aug. 7. It was only the second time he’d been allowed to see her for several weeks. He and son Gary made the 45-minute drive to Hampton, Iowa, where Donna had been moved to an ABCM facility with an Alzheimer’s unit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dunshee and Brunes were with their mother. She was incommunicative. Rayhons knelt by her bed and prayed the Rosary. Gary said his father held Donna’s hand and said, “Love you, Honey.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She died the next day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons attended Donna’s Aug. 12 funeral at St. Boniface, the church where he married her. He was arrested three days later and released on $10,000 cash bond. The Iowa Department of Public Safety issued a one-page press release about the arrest. The release made no mention that the alleged rape victim was Rayhons’ wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In court filings, prosecutors say Rayhons confessed to having sex with his wife. They also cite what Donna’s roommate, Schoneman, told nursing home staff on May 23. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state crime lab completed Donna’s rape test Nov. 20. It took six months to process because of a backlog at the lab. The exam showed no evidence of seminal fluid or DNA other than Donna’s on swabs of her mouth and vagina. A stain in her underwear “indicated the presence of seminal fluid; however, no spermatozoa were microscopically identified,” the two-page lab report said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons’ son Dale said that the stain must be old and the test results show that his father didn’t have sex with Donna on May 23. In a recent court filing, prosecutors said Donna’s bedding has yet to be tested and the presence of the stain “is entirely consistent with the State’s theory of the case.” Prosecutors also have argued that a lack of DNA evidence wouldn’t refute Rayhons’ alleged confession. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons’ attorney, Joel Yunek of Mason City, said in a court filing that what Rayhons told agent Reger is “vague” unless “snippets of the interview are selectively taken out of context.” In a June 5 interview with a different state investigator, Schoneman revised her earlier words. She said she heard whispering, not sexual noises, although she worried for Donna’s safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iowa’s sexual assault law doesn’t explicitly define the “mental defect” that the prosecution must prove Donna had. In a review of the statute in 1980, the state Supreme Court said the language “protects those who are so mentally incompetent or incapacitated as to be unable to understand the nature and consequences of the sex act.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To show Donna lacked that capability, prosecutors may need something more than the BIMS memory tests referenced in court filings, said Wehry, the Vermont nursing home regulator. She said Donna’s doctors should have completed a broader assessment that gauged her ability to solve problems and make judgments, including judgments about sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Does she recognize her husband?” Wehry said. “Does she recognize him as her beloved even if she doesn’t know his name? Is she pleased to see him? Has she been interviewed with him present and asked whether she likes his company, whether she wants to have sex?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s possible that prosecutors possess a more comprehensive assessment. No such report has yet been produced as evidence nor is there a record of one being shown to Henry Rayhons before the alleged assault, attorney Yunek said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This was not a rape,” said Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, New York, a nursing home that has a policy of encouraging consensual sex among its residents, including those with dementia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It sounds like they had a really beautiful relationship,” Reingold said after reviewing the Rayhons case at the request of Bloomberg News. “And the law is depriving a couple of having a marital relationship. It is so big-brother-like, so intrusive, so second-guessing of what a person is experiencing in a dementia state.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons’ trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 28 in Garner. Prosecutors have asked the Hancock County court for a change of venue because they say local media coverage has poisoned the area jury pool. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donna’s daughters and Rayhons are now arguing over who should pay the nursing home bills. The daughters recently had their mother’s belongings removed from Rayhons’ condo. The house is still filled with photos of Donna and Rayhons’ first wife, Marvalyn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rayhons said he tries to stay busy. He helped his son Gary and a brother in southern Iowa with the fall harvest. Every few days, he visits the gravesites of each of his wives, in separate cemeteries a few miles apart between Garner and Duncan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I fully believe if the girls had let me take her home, Donna would still be with us,” he said. “They locked me out and I didn’t see her and I didn’t do nothing wrong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the reporter on this story: Bryan Gruley in Chicago at bgruley@bloomberg.net NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the editors responsible for this story: John Brecher at jbrecher4@bloomberg.net Cecile Daurat\nPassage 2:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry Rayhons, an Iowa state legislator, speaks during an Oct. 8 interview in Garner, Iowa. Rayhons is awaiting trial on a felony charge that he raped his wife, Donna Young, at a nursing home where she was living. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bryan Gruley (Bloomberg) has a long and detailed story on the prosecution. Here’s a short excerpt: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Iowa Attorney General’s office says [Henry] Rayhons had intercourse with his wife when she lacked the mental capacity to consent because she had Alzheimer’s. She died on Aug. 8, four days short of her 79th birthday, of complications from the disease. One week later, Rayhons, 78, was arrested. He pleaded not guilty…. By many accounts, Henry and Donna Rayhons were deeply in love. Both their families embraced their marriage. The case has produced no evidence thus far that the couple’s love faded, that Donna failed to recognize her husband or that she asked that he not touch her, said Rayhons’ son Dale Rayhons, a paramedic and the family’s unofficial spokesman. Based on evidence generated so far, state prosecutors are likely to portray Rayhons as a sex-hungry man who took advantage of a sweet, confused woman who didn’t know what month it was, forgot how to eat a hamburger and lost track of her room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question of how to deal with sex by those who aren’t mentally competent is quite complex; it also arises, of course, with regard to those who are mentally disabled all their lives (see, e.g., this post 10 years ago about an interesting Ninth Circuit decision on this and this follow-up). But I think, in cases like the Rayhons case, the key is to consider the nature of the parties’ past relationship, something Iowa law does to some extent but not enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s shocking to me that, until several decades ago, a husband’s forcing his wife to have sex wasn’t generally considered rape in the United States. (It still might not be, at least in some situations and at least as of 2010, in South Carolina.) It seems to me quite obvious that spouses are entitled to say “no.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, it seems to me equally obvious that we must consider the parties’ past and unrevoked consent as relevant in some situations where there’s neither a “no” or a “yes.” If A starts caressing B’s genitals while B is sleeping, that’s generally a serious crime. But if A and B are sexually involved, it seems to me it shouldn’t be a crime at all — especially if this has happened before and both parties were quite happy about it — unless B wakes up and says no, or has indicated lack of consent to such behavior in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is just a reflection of the fact that “consent,” like much in life, can be implied and long-lasting and not just express and short-term. If we’re good friends and you keep letting me borrow something, that may be evidence of consent to borrow it even when I’m not around to expressly say, “yes, you can borrow it again.” That immediate consent is impossible, because you’re absent, doesn’t mean that there is no consent. Sex is not identical, of course, to borrowing gardening equipment, but in this respect it strikes me as similar: Even when someone isn’t able to immediately consent, it’s sometimes (though not always) reasonable to determine whether they would have consented by looking to past practice among the parties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this is especially so, I think, when the incapacity is permanent or at least long-lasting. I don’t think the law should require lovers or spouses to wake each other up before touching each other’s genitals, even when past practice suggests this is consensual. But at least such a requirement would only slightly interfere with people’s lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the law criminalizes sex among lovers altogether once one of them has become mentally incapacitated, however warm their relationship was beforehand, that’s a lifetime constraint. And it’s not just a constraint once the incapacitation sets in. It’s a burden even on people who are not yet incapacitated but who know they are getting there, and who are upset that for many years to come they would be unable to give this sort of pleasure to their life partners — or to get this pleasure from them. If you were facing such a mental decline, would you want to know that the law will “protect” you from your beloved husband or wife this way? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interestingly, Iowa law takes this into account in some measure, treating spouses differently from others, though not enough for Mr. Rayhons (or for the hypothetical sleeping couple), and not in a way that covers long-term lovers who aren’t married. Rayhons is charged with third-degree sexual abuse: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A person commits sexual abuse in the third degree when the person performs a sex act under any of the following circumstances: 1. The act is done by force or against the will of the other person, whether or not the other person is the person’s spouse or is cohabiting with the person. 2. The act is between persons who are not at the time cohabiting as husband and wife and if any of the following are true: a. The other person is suffering from a mental defect or incapacity which precludes giving consent. b. The other person is twelve or thirteen years of age…. c. The other person is fourteen or fifteen years of age and … [t]he person is four or more years older than the other person…. 4. The act is performed while the other person is mentally incapacitated, physically incapacitated, or physically helpless. [From the definitions section:] 1. “Mentally incapacitated” means that a person is temporarily incapable of apprising or controlling the person’s own conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or intoxicating substance. 2. “Physically helpless” means that a person is unable to communicate an unwillingness to act because the person is unconscious, asleep, or is otherwise physically limited. 3. “Physically incapacitated” means that a person has a bodily impairment or handicap that substantially limits the person’s ability to resist or flee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sex with a permanently mentally incompetent lover is barred under Subdivision 2.a, at least under the prosecutor’s interpretation, unless the lover is both a spouse and cohabiting. I take it that the prosecutor’s theory in the Rayhons case is that the spouses were no longer cohabiting, because the wife was in a nursing home — but that strikes me as a hard-to-justify distinction, though one that the statute does seem to draw. And, to turn to my hypothetical, sexual touching of a sleeping lover is criminalized under subdivision 4, which lacks a spouse limitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, often the law doesn’t cause these problems, because the allegedly injured party doesn’t complain (spouses who get caressed while they’re sleeping probably won’t call the police), because other parties who know don’t complain (the children of parents who are having sex even though one parent has Alzheimer’s probably won’t call the police, either), or because prosecutors will exercise their discretion not to prosecute. But sometimes third parties might learn of the incident — caretakers, housekeepers, or, as seems to have happened in this instance, children of one party from a former marriage — and be upset enough to complain, and a prosecutor might indeed go forward with the case. The law should be crafted to preclude that, I think, as Iowa law does to some extent but not sufficiently.

Thanks to Hans Bader for the pointer.\n", "answers": ["An Iowa state lawmaker says he loved visiting his wife at a nursing home before her death at age 79.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Los Angeles-headquartered transportation company wants to build a system that involves firing a pod full of people through a low-pressure tube at speeds of up to 760 mph. It has been described by inventor Musk as a mix between Concorde, a rail gun, and an air hockey table that could take you from Los Angeles to San Francisco in under 30 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperloop Technologies said that magnetic fields in the tunnel will lift the pod before a \"thrust force\" is applied, accelerating the pod to speeds just shy of the speed of sound (767 mph).

As the pod slows down, the system's battery is recharged through what Hyperloop describes as regenerative breaking.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don't call it a Wright Brothers' \"Kitty Hawk\" moment just yet, though. The demo focused on only one piece of a very complicated system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hyperloop, envisioned by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, would move passenger-filled pods through special tubes at incredibly high speeds — as in possibly crossing the 400 miles between San Francisco and Los Angeles in a mere 30 minutes. Musk offered up his ideas in 2013, and others got to work trying to build it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the startups that jumped at the challenge is Hyperloop One, formerly Hyperloop Technologies, tested its propulsion mechanism today. Take a look, via CNBC: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Wall Street Journal wrote earlier in the day: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The focus of the test will be more on the propulsion technology — whether it can actually move the sled — than the speed.

USA TODAY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elon Musk's SpaceX was the first to propose the notion of transporting people and cargo at speeds of 700 mph, a tech dubbed hyperloop. (Photo: SpaceX) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SAN FRANCISCO – The hyperloop wars are on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, a crowdsourced enterprise led by NASA and Boeing veterans called Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced it had licensed passive magnetic levitation technology to power its prototype system, which like other hyperloop templates, promises to shuttle humans and goods in a vacuum tube system at speeds up to 750 mph. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How fast is that? Zipping from Los Angeles to San Francisco would take 30 minutes as compared to a six-hour drive or an all-day train ride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperloop Technologies, one of a number of outfits pursuing hyperloop tech, plans to show off its prototype in the desert north of Las Vegas this week. (Photo: Hyperloop Technologies) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The announcement comes just two days before rival Hyperloop Technologies Inc. plans to showcase the evolution of its technology to investors and media in the desert north of Las Vegas. On its website, Hyperloop Technologies features photos and videos showing off large tubes that would house long pods for either people or cargo. Both HTI and HTT are based in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another player in the space is skyTran, located at NASA Research Park just south of San Francisco. The company recently unveiled a technology demonstration system showcasing how its two- and four-person vehicles will work, and are aiming to build a 30-mile track in Lagos, Nigeria. skyTran has raised $30 million and is operating in partnership with NASA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperloop technology offers the possibility of moving people and things at great speeds without using fossil fuels. The pitfalls include making such transportation reliable while mitigating for potential catastrophes unfolding at around the speed of sound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And hyperloop remains more Buck Rogers than your next shuttle to work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The foundations of its tech are familiar: the maglev, or magnetic levitation, principle that allows a vehicle to achieve great speeds by riding on air is already at work on high-speed trains in Europe and Japan. But hyperloop would face the same infrastructure and regulatory hurdles that vex high-speed rail projects and autonomous cars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that's not to mention the price tag. A tube system linking L.A. and San Francisco with hyperloop pods has been estimated to cost north of $6 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's ON! We're 1 day away from some big announcements. Live-tweeting starts tomorrow @ 5PM PDT https://t.co/tASsQqwMyy#hyperloop — HyperloopTech (@HyperloopTech) May 9, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its Monday statement, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies says its design will tackle the safety concerns with a passive levitation system, which will eliminate the need for power stations along the Hyperloop track and keep construction costs low. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"From a safety aspect, the system has huge advantages, levitation occurs purely through movement, therefore if any type of power failure occurs, Hyperloop pods would continue to levitate and only after reaching minimal speeds touch the ground,\" said Bibop Gresta, chief operating officer of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also in the hyperloop race is SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who first popularized the idea of shuttling people and cargo in tubes in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, a team from MIT won an inaugural hyperloop competition sponsored by SpaceX. Similar to HTT's approach, the MIT team proposed placing magnets on the pods that react to passive coils in the tubes, thereby generating lift or levitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperloop Transportation Technologies has announced that is licensing tech that would allow high-speed transportation at lower than anticipated costs when compared to existing magnetic transportation tech. (Photo: Hyperloop Transportation Technologies) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The beauty of the system we designed is that it’s completely passive, an elegant property that will make our pod very scalable,\" team captain Philippe Kirschen, a master’s student in aeronautics and astronautics, told MIT News when the team won. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Musk has tweeted that SpaceX may build a test track for its emerging hyperloop tech, \"most likely in Texas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While SpaceX is backed by Musk's drive and billions and skyTran has government support, the other two entrants in the hyperloop sweepstakes —HTT and HTI — have taken radically different approaches to financing their efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) is powered by financial donations and the know-how of space tech veterans donating their time to the project. In contrast, Hyperloop Technologies Inc. (HTI) has raised $37 million to date, and is co-founded by early Uber investor Shervin Pishevar and former SpaceX engineer Brogan BamBrogan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HTT's passive magnetic levitation approach is based on science developed by the late physicist Richard Post of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, east of San Francisco. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By placing magnets on the hyperloop transportation pods and having them react - and cause lift - with coils in the transportation pods, one can avoid the costly approach currently used by maglev trains, which require pricey tracks laced with copper coils. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, HTT said it would be installing its hyperloop tech in a proposed 75,000-resident solar-powered city in Quay Valley, Calif., halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. In February, HTT CEO Dirk Ahlborn announced that it was in talks with the Slovakian government about possibly building a hyperloop route in the former Eastern Bloc nation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the arid northern deserts of Nevada, far from the bright lights and towering edifices of Las Vegas, the Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One took a gamble and won, successfully testing its linear induction propulsion system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A grandstand full of journalists and Hyperloop One supporters watched as a series of stators (basically electromagnetic blades) quickly powered up under the sled, which then flew by at about the speed of a fast car (115 mph or so). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: Hyperloop One/Mashable NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The test, while fast, was, to be honest, somewhat underwhelming. After the initial countdown, the sled took off from the start position and whizzed by on a track at a measured 2.4 Gs of acceleration. Special grabbers underneath the sled then slammed into a sandpit, which effectively slowed the sled down to zero and ended the test.

It's intended to be a low-energy (solar) and low-emission system. It could also be a viable mass transportation alternative for traffic-snarled corridors like those between New York and Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and San Francisco, completing the latter trip in as little as 35 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Musk produced a lengthy Hyperloop white paper and then open-sourced the concept in 2014.

Share it in the comments.\nPassage 6:\nA few days ago, an executive with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies — one of two major companies seeking to turn Hyperloop from science fiction to reality — said the major expense incurred during construction would be “the tube.” This is absolutely right if he’s thinking about building Hyperloop just as a proof of concept. If he wants to build something functional, that people use, he should prepare to spend the bulk of his company’s cash on carpeting. The problem with Elon Musk’s hyperfast hypertransport — the one people aren’t already talking about — is that riders are going to vomit everywhere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s hyperbolic of course, but the fact remains that the way Hyperloop is being pitched to the public right now — a 750 mile-per-hour pneumatically-run speed tube designed to get Tesla owners from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 35 minutes — doesn’t touch on human physiology and creature comfort. When people are commuting to and from work, trekking across town to take care of errands, or traveling long distances, they want to do so without feeling profoundly uncomfortable. Speed is great, but there’s a reason people will forgo a crowded subway for ungodly traffic if it means they can at least enjoy some space in their car. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a vacuum, humans can handle a constant speed, whether it’s at a snail’s pace or a bullet’s screech. But a real Hyperloop won’t just travel several hundred miles and then reverse course in the opposite direction. There will be stops, a lot of them if this kind of technology emerges as the successor to our aging railroad system. That means pods will be speeding up and slowing down more frequently than most of us would want. And the United States is not flat — it’s got a pretty gnarly terrain in some places. Hyperloop will be forced to go around these things, and above them in some instances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Currently, high-speed trains (all the rage in Asian countries like China and Japan) top off at around 200 miles per hour or so. Moving at this high rate of speed consistently produces few physical symptoms, but acceleration, deceleration, and turns get problematic after a certain point. The human body can only handle about 0.2 Gs of acceleration vertically or laterally. Hyperloop would involve accelerations that would potentially push way past this limit (up to seven times greater than the limits imposed on Japan’s Shinkansen bullet train). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When you move, G-forces act on your body, in both positive ways (e.g. pushing you back to your seat) and negative ways (e.g. pulling you forward into your seatbelt). When you throw in the ability to move in three different planes, you’re contending with G-forces in three different directions. Your gastrointestinal tract can lurch in a different direction than your spinal column. That’s when nausea sets in — and if the ride doesn’t end soon or if you don’t find a way to adjust, prepare to say hello again to your latest meal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The solution, naturally, is to go slower. The Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by Elon Musk and SpaceX requires teams to construct pods that go at least 240 miles per hour. Naturally, teams like MIT are building prototypes capable of moving considerably faster. As Hyperloop moves forward, however, the 240 mph range might actually be standard outside of the Great Plains. If too fast is too uncomfortable, the Hyperloop will slow down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s important to emphasize that human physiology is relative — what causes one person to wretch is someone else’s cup of tea. Some people can handle a bumpy ride better than others. The problem with the Hyperloop — in its most ideal form — is that any turns it makes will make everyone uncomfortable. As a technology, the Hyperloop is one of the most intriguing projects under development right now. But we should approach it with a healthy sense of skepticism before we start to see how actual human passengers react to getting shipped around nine-tenths the speed of sound.\nPassage 7:\nBrowser game tests you to survive Elon Musk’s Hyperloop NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excited by the prospect of high-speed travel by riding in a pod through airless tubes in Elon Musk’s concept of the Hyperloop? Want to give it a try now? Well, there’s a 8-bit styled web browser game that has you navigating a pod with the hope of keeping it one piece. Called Break-a-Pod, it’s ridiculously hard in a similar way as Flappy Bird was, but it was actually created by a team that’s building a pod prototype with the hope of bringing it to SpaceX, the company behind Hyperloop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The game has you controlling a pod’s speed and stability, with a goal of “going as fast as you can without crashing or running out of power.” It’s simple, but it’s also much harder than it looks. You only need to use the four arrow keys, with up to accelerate, down to brake, and right/left to keep it stable. Hitting the sides of the tubes too many times or losing control of the pitch sees you instantly explode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team behind the game, which calls themselves rLoop, after forming on Reddit, explains that they “hope that the game will act as a vehicle to make the Hyperloop concept fun and accessible to a wider audience, and inspire further research and engagement.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Break-a-Pod was also released as a way to bring attention to rLoop’s IndieGoGo campaign, which has a goal of raising $66,000 to finish building their prototype pod. Should they receive enough funds, the game might also see a mobile release on iOS and Android, giving them another source of raising money for the Hyperloop project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SpaceX has already held an open contest for pod designs. Out of hundreds of entrants, the rLoop team was selected as one of 18 finalists, and has been invited to the next stage of the competition. Scheduled to be held in California later this year, the event is supposed to see the prototypes demonstrated, but SpaceX hasn’t yet finished building a section of test track. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR VIA The Verge\nPassage 8:\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies filed a permit to build a 5-mile prototype in Quay Valley — a utopian, eco-friendly community planned for Central California. And while we’re rooting for them to succeed with their test track, it still doesn’t change the Hyperloop’s largest challenges. Because the biggest hurdle isn’t the tech behind Hyperloop, it’s the land rights and every other bureaucratic obstacle that goes along with building enormous infrastructure projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Back in the summer of 2013, Elon Musk announced to the world that he had a revolutionary idea about the future of transportation. He called his concept the Hyperloop, and everyone was excited that they’d soon zip between distant major cities at 600 miles per hour. The tech press quickly picked apart the technical minutia of such a proposal, debating whether Musk’s idea was technologically possible. What so many reporters then and since have continued to ignore is that you can’t build a mode of transportation between cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles without rights to the land in between them. Not to mention the other challenges things like environmental impact reports or liability considerations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After over two and a half years of research and development our team has reached another important milestone. This will be the world’s first passenger-ready Hyperloop system,” Dirk Ahlborn, the CEO of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, said in a statement released to The Verge about the plans for Quay Valley. “Everyone traveling on California’s I-5 in 2016 will be able to see our activities from the freeway.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With every puff piece that’s published about companies like Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (not to be confused with competing company Hyperloop Technologies), everyone seems focused on the tech, rather than the real challenge: Land rights and bureaucracy. Assuming their permit is approved for Quay Valley, the idea of building a Hyperloop track between two distant cities remains a techno-utopian fantasy arguably as misguided as Quay Valley itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh Stephens makes this same point in a recent blog post: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And yet, this combination of enthusiasm and magnetism doesn’t buy farmland. It doesn’t ease eminent domain takings. It doesn’t blast through bedrock or relocate utilities. It doesn’t design station area plans. It doesn’t write [Environmental Impact Reports] or dismiss [California Environmental Quality Act] suits. Trains, whether propelled by steam, diesel, or a frictionless tube, are still terrestrial things. And what terra we have in California. The very same mountains, cities, canals, farmers, and habitats that complicate [High Speed Rail] also complicate Hyperloop. The more the Hyperloop people drop hints and make innuendos about zipping this way and that without addressing the monumental public policy challenges that they’re going to face, governmental cooperation they’re going to need, and money that it’s going to cost, the less it’s going to sound like Tesla for the masses and the more it’s going to sound like a lost chapter of “Atlas Shrugged.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of this is new. Even before the official announcement back in August of 2013, I wrote a post raising skepticism that you’d be able to build a Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles without putting it underground or out in the ocean. And even then, you’d still have to get land rights and work with the government in myriad ways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So we’ll wait with earnest optimism as Hyperloop Transportation Technologies to build a working Hyperloop prototype in Quay Valley, a planned community on virgin soil by sometime this year. But until we hear that any Hyperloop company has a legal and lobbying team as big as its tech team, we’re going to remain pretty damn skeptical that this will happen within our lifetime.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Has he no sense of shame?” said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center, the American chapter of an international group that fights prejudice to honor the legacy of Anne Frank, the teenage diarist who perished in the Holocaust in 1945.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a small industry of research and investigative firms in Washington, typically staffed by a mix of former journalists and security officials, adept at finding information about politicians that the politicians would rather stay hidden. The firms often do not know who exactly is hiring them; the request could come from a law firm acting on behalf of a client from one of the parties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this case, the request for opposition research on Donald Trump came from one of his Republican opponents in the primary campaign. The research firm then hired one of its sub-contractors who it used regularly on all things Russian: a retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow’s spooks and siloviki (securocrats). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI? Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time the contractor had started his research, however, the Republican primary was over. The original client had dropped out, but the firm that had hired him had found a new, Democratic client. This was not necessarily the Hillary Clinton campaign or the Democratic National Committee. Opposition research is frequently financed by wealthy individuals who have donated all they can and are looking for other ways to help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By July, the counter-intelligence contractor had collected a significant amount of material based on Russian sources who he had grown to trust over the years – not just in Moscow, but also among oligarchs living in the west. He delivered his reports, but the gravity of their contents weighed on him. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He delivered a set to former colleagues in the FBI, whose counter-intelligence division would be the appropriate body to investigate. It is believed he also passed a copy to his own country’s intelligence service, but it felt constrained in what action it could take and left it up to the Americans to do their own investigation and draw their own conclusions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As summer turned to autumn, the investigator was asked for more information by the FBI but heard nothing back about any investigation. The bureau seemed obsessed instead with classified material that flowed through a private email server set up by Clinton’s aides. The FBI’s director, James Comey, threw the election into a spin 11 days before the vote by announcing his investigators were examining newly discovered material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former intelligence official grew concerned that there was a cover-up in progress. On a trip to New York in October, he was persuaded to tell his story to David Corn, the Washington editor of Mother Jones, who first reported the existence of the material on 31 October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI however continued to refuse to comment on the issue, despite reports that it had requested and perhaps acquired a warrant for further investigation from the Foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court. The silence was not altogether surprising. The FBI counter-intelligence division, headquartered in Washington, is extremely secretive, much more so than the New York field office, which had strong links to former prosecutor and mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was by then working for Trump. The threat of leaks from New York about Clinton emails had reportedly pushed Comey into making his October surprise announcement.

On 18 November, the annual Halifax International Security Forum opened in the Canadian city, bringing together serving and former security and foreign policy officials from around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senator John McCain, a hawkish Republican, was there and was introduced to a former senior western diplomat who had seen the documents, knew their source and thought him highly reliable. McCain decided the implications were sufficiently alarming to dispatch a trusted emissary, a former US official, to meet the source and find out more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emissary hastily arranged a transatlantic flight and met the source at the airport as arranged. (The Guardian has agreed not to specify the city or country where the meeting took place.) The meeting had a certain cold war tradecraft to it, as he was told to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times. Having found each other, the retired counter-intelligence officer drove the emissary to his house, where they discussed the documents and their background. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emissary flew back within 24 hours and showed McCain the documents, saying it was hard to impossible to verify them without a proper investigation. McCain said he was reluctant to get involved, lest it be perceived as payback for insulting remarks Trump had made about him during his rambunctious campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, on 9 December, McCain arranged a one-on-one meeting with Comey, with no aides present, and handed them over.

That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,” the senator said in a statement on Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not clear what underpinned the FBI’s decision to include a summary of the documents in its highly classified briefing to the president and president-elect and their top staff, before the bureau had completed its investigation. It may have been as a defensive measure, to prove for posterity that it was not involved in a cover-up, or because its investigators believed them to be credible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatever the motive, it was quickly leaked – first to CNN, which reported on the material on Wednesday. That triggered a controversial decision by BuzzFeed to publish an unredacted version of the documents on its website. It is unclear where the BuzzFeed version came from. The author of the reports had been insistent on blotting out references to his Russian sources in the copies he gave to the press, out of fear for their safety. The unredacted version could have come from the original client, who commissioned the research, or from intermediaries between the counter-intelligence contractor and the client.\nPassage 4:\nIn January 1961, Dwight Eisenhower delivered his farewell address after serving two terms as U.S. president; the five-star general chose to warn Americans of this specific threat to democracy: “In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.” That warning was issued prior to the decadelong escalation of the Vietnam War, three more decades of Cold War mania, and the post-9/11 era, all of which radically expanded that unelected faction’s power even further. This is the faction that is now engaged in open warfare against the duly elected and already widely disliked president-elect, Donald Trump. They are using classic Cold War dirty tactics and the defining ingredients of what has until recently been denounced as “Fake News.” Their most valuable instrument is the U.S. media, much of which reflexively reveres, serves, believes, and sides with hidden intelligence officials. And Democrats, still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss, as well as a systemic collapse of their party, seemingly divorced further and further from reason with each passing day, are willing — eager — to embrace any claim, cheer any tactic, align with any villain, regardless of how unsupported, tawdry, and damaging those behaviors might be. The serious dangers posed by a Trump presidency are numerous and manifest. There is a wide array of legitimate and effective tactics for combating those threats: from bipartisan congressional coalitions and constitutional legal challenges to citizen uprisings and sustained and aggressive civil disobedience. All of those strategies have periodically proven themselves effective in times of political crisis or authoritarian overreach. But cheering for the CIA and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S. election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self-destructive. Empowering the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and systemic deceit over the last six decades is desperation of the worst kind. Demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be instantly venerated as Truth — despite emanating from the very precincts designed to propagandize and lie — is an assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality. And casually branding domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal foreign operatives is morally bankrupt and certain to backfire on those doing it. Beyond all that, there is no bigger favor that Trump opponents can do for him than attacking him with such lowly, shabby, obvious shams, recruiting large media outlets to lead the way. When it comes time to expose actual Trump corruption and criminality, who is going to believe the people and institutions who have demonstrated they are willing to endorse any assertions no matter how factually baseless, who deploy any journalistic tactic no matter how unreliable and removed from basic means of ensuring accuracy? All of these toxic ingredients were on full display yesterday as the Deep State unleashed its tawdriest and most aggressive assault yet on Trump: vesting credibility in and then causing the public disclosure of a completely unvetted and unverified document, compiled by a paid, anonymous operative while he was working for both GOP and Democratic opponents of Trump, accusing Trump of a wide range of crimes, corrupt acts, and salacious private conduct. The reaction to all of this illustrates that while the Trump presidency poses grave dangers, so, too, do those who are increasingly unhinged in their flailing, slapdash, and destructive attempts to undermine it. For months, the CIA, with unprecedented clarity, overtly threw its weight behind Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and sought to defeat Donald Trump. In August, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell announced his endorsement of Clinton in the New York Times and claimed that “Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” The CIA and NSA director under George W. Bush, Gen. Michael Hayden, also endorsed Clinton and went to the Washington Post to warn, in the week before the election, that “Donald Trump really does sound a lot like Vladimir Putin,” adding that Trump is “the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.” It is not hard to understand why the CIA preferred Clinton over Trump. Clinton was critical of Obama for restraining the CIA’s proxy war in Syria and was eager to expand that war, while Trump denounced it. Clinton clearly wanted a harder line than Obama took against the CIA’s long-standing foes in Moscow, while Trump wanted improved relations and greater cooperation. In general, Clinton defended and intended to extend the decadeslong international military order on which the CIA and Pentagon’s preeminence depends, while Trump — through a still-uncertain mix of instability and extremist conviction — posed a threat to it. Whatever one’s views are on those debates, it is the democratic framework — the presidential election, the confirmation process, congressional leaders, judicial proceedings, citizen activism and protest, civil disobedience — that should determine how they are resolved. All of those policy disputes were debated out in the open; the public heard them; and Trump won. Nobody should crave the rule of Deep State overlords. Yet craving Deep State rule is exactly what prominent Democratic operatives and media figures are doing. Any doubt about that is now dispelled. Just last week, Chuck Schumer issued a warning to Trump, telling Rachel Maddow that Trump was being “really dumb” by challenging the unelected intelligence community because of all the ways they possess to destroy those who dare to stand up to them: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck Schumer on Trump's tweet hitting intel community: \"He's being really dumb to do this.\" https://t.co/MOcU8ruOPK — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 4, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And last night, many Democrats openly embraced and celebrated what was, so plainly, an attempt by the Deep State to sabotage an elected official who had defied it: ironically, its own form of blackmail. Back in October, a political operative and former employee of the British intelligence agency MI6 was being paid by Democrats to dig up dirt on Trump (before that, he was paid by anti-Trump Republicans). He tried to convince countless media outlets to publish a long memo he had written filled with explosive accusations about Trump’s treason, business corruption, and sexual escapades, with the overarching theme that Trump was in servitude to Moscow because they were blackmailing and bribing him. Despite how many had it, no media outlets published it. That was because these were anonymous claims unaccompanied by any evidence at all, and even in this more permissive new media environment, nobody was willing to be journalistically associated with it. As the New York Times’ Executive Editor Dean Baquet put it last night, he would not publish these “totally unsubstantiated” allegations because “we, like others, investigated the allegations and haven’t corroborated them, and we felt we’re not in the business of publishing things we can’t stand by.” The closest this operative got to success was convincing Mother Jones’s David Corn to publish an October 31 article reporting that “a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country” claims that “he provided the [FBI] with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump.” But because this was just an anonymous claim unaccompanied by any evidence or any specifics (which Corn withheld), it made very little impact. All of that changed yesterday. Why? What changed was the intelligence community’s resolution to cause this all to become public and to be viewed as credible. In December, John McCain provided a copy of this report to the FBI and demanded they take it seriously. At some point last week, the chiefs of the intelligence agencies decided to declare that this ex-British intelligence operative was “credible” enough that his allegations warranted briefing both Trump and Obama about them, thus stamping some sort of vague, indirect, and deniable official approval on these accusations. Someone — by all appearances, numerous officials — then went to CNN to tell the network they had done this, causing CNN to go on air and, in the gravest of tones, announce the “Breaking News” that “the nation’s top intelligence officials” briefed Obama and Trump that Russia had compiled information that “compromised President-elect Trump.” CNN refused to specify what these allegations were on the ground that it could not “verify” them. But with this document in the hands of multiple media outlets, it was only a matter of time — a small amount of time — before someone would step up and publish the whole thing. BuzzFeed quickly obliged, airing all of the unvetted, anonymous claims about Trump. Its editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, published a memo explaining that decision, saying that — although there was “serious reason to doubt the allegations” — BuzzFeed in general “errs on the side of publication” and “Americans can make up their own minds about the allegations.” Publishing this document predictably produced massive traffic (and thus profit) for the site, with millions of people viewing the article and presumably reading the “dossier.” One can certainly object to BuzzFeed’s decision and, as the New York Times noted this morning, many journalists are doing so. It’s almost impossible to imagine a scenario where it’s justifiable for a news outlet to publish a totally anonymous, unverified, unvetted document filled with scurrilous and inflammatory allegations about which its own editor-in-chief says there “is serious reason to doubt the allegations,” on the ground that they want to leave it to the public to decide whether to believe it. But even if one believes there is no such case where that is justified, yesterday’s circumstances presented the most compelling scenario possible for doing this. Once CNN strongly hinted at these allegations, it left it to the public imagination to conjure up the dirt Russia allegedly had to blackmail and control Trump. By publishing these accusations, BuzzFeed ended that speculation. More importantly, it allowed everyone to see how dubious this document is, one the CIA and CNN had elevated into some sort of grave national security threat. Almost immediately after it was published, the farcical nature of the “dossier” manifested. Not only was its author anonymous, but he was paid by Democrats (and, before that, by Trump’s GOP adversaries) to dig up dirt on Trump. Worse, he himself cited no evidence of any kind but instead relied on a string of other anonymous people in Russia he claims told him these things. Worse still, the document was filled with amateur errors. While many of the claims are inherently unverified, some can be confirmed. One such claim — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen secretly traveled to Prague in August to meet with Russian officials — was strongly denied by Cohen, who insisted he had never been to Prague in his life (Prague is the same place that foreign intelligence officials claimed, in 2001, was the site of a nonexistent meeting between Iraqi officials and 9/11 hijackers, which contributed to 70 percent of Americans believing, as late as the fall of 2003, that Saddam personally planned the 9/11 attack). This morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that “the FBI has found no evidence that [Cohen] traveled to the Czech Republic.” None of this stopped Democratic operatives and prominent media figures from treating these totally unverified and unvetted allegations as grave revelations.

The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, apparently by Russian government agents, and a mysterious figure calling himself “Guccifer 2.0” began to publish the stolen documents online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer with whom he had worked before. Mr. Steele, in his early 50s, had served undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain’s spy service, MI6. When he stepped down in 2009, he started his own commercial intelligence firm, Orbis Business Intelligence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former journalist and the former spy, according to people who know them, had similarly dark views of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. officer, and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear, blackmail or bribe their targets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a former spy who had carried out espionage inside Russia, Mr. Steele was in no position to travel to Moscow to study Mr. Trump’s connections there. Instead, he hired native Russian speakers to call informants inside Russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos, each a few pages long, that he began to deliver to Fusion GPS in June and continued at least until December. By then, the election was over, and neither Mr. Steele nor Mr. Simpson was being paid by a client, but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work. (Mr. Simpson declined to comment for this article, and Mr. Steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The memos described two different Russian operations. The first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence Mr. Trump, perhaps because he had contacts with Russian oligarchs whom Mr. Putin wanted to keep track of. According to Mr. Steele’s memos, it used an array of familiar tactics: the gathering of “kompromat,” compromising material such as alleged tapes of Mr. Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and proposals for business deals attractive to Mr. Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal would probably never have been to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia, but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. But if Mr. Putin and his agents wanted to entangle Mr. Trump using business deals, they did not do it very successfully. Mr. Trump has said he has no major properties there, though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that “a lot of money” was “pouring in from Russia.”\nPassage 6:\nDemocrats have resisted openly questioning Donald Trump’s legitimacy as the next president — despite Vladimir Putin’s efforts to get him elected, now acknowledged by Trump himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the party is finding it increasingly difficult to hold back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats are struggling with how far to go in exploiting Trump’s Russia troubles for political gain — wary of prolonging election-year acrimony and undermining confidence in American democracy, but tempted to try to maximize their chances of making Trump a one-term president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dilemma was heightened by this week’s explosive reports about Russia possibly obtaining compromising information on Trump, which he flatly denied at a news conference Wednesday. Where the party ends up could say a lot about how Democrats intend to mount a comeback from their shocking defeat at Trump’s hands in November. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For now, at least, they’re trying to straddle a middle ground, saying it’s up to Trump to prove his legitimacy with his own actions. That means backing stronger sanctions against Russia and allowing a full investigation into its apparent election meddling instead of bashing U.S. intelligence agencies and lavishing praise on Russian leader Putin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It casts a shadow over the presidency,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said in an interview. While Russia’s cyber-intrusion into the election “doesn’t change the outcome of the Electoral College,” he added, it does demonstrate that “there is no mandate for Trump’s vision or policies for America. He lost the popular vote — that’s the citizens’ vote — by a huge margin.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) was more direct in his challenge to Trump’s “bizarre and so otherwise inexplicable” refusal to agree with the intelligence community’s findings that Russia mounted a campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What is the nature of your compulsion to deny and to avoid this conversation?” Connolly said he would like to ask Trump. He warned Republicans who have sidestepped Trump’s friendliness toward Russia that “you put yourself at great peril depending on subsequent facts” by embracing any “rationalization of this Russian interference and possible troubling relationship between the president-elect and Putin.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, House Democrats are more willing than their Senate counterparts to assert that Trump’s presidential victory has lost credibility due to Russian meddling. Even before Trump’s Russia troubles deepened late Tuesday, two members of House Democratic leadership wryly nicknamed him “Moscow Donald” during a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This was the most un-American election ever,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversees human rights in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Trump commits to “stronger sanctions” against Russia, Cohen added, “I think people would feel comfortable that he would put America first. It would maybe limit people’s concerns that there was a relationship with Russia that was unhealthy that we don’t know about. People think Putin had something on him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who’s helped lead a Democratic push for an independent commission to investigate Russian hacking, said lawmakers should not worry about appearing to try to invalidate the results of the election because there is no evidence that Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a fear that, if you acknowledge it, you’re putting an asterisk on our president-elect, and that’s really a short-sighted way of looking at this,” Swalwell said in an interview. “It’s only an asterisk if there was any collaboration.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have called for further investigation into links between Trump emissaries and Russia, however. FBI Director James Comey said during Senate testimony Tuesday that he could neither confirm nor deny a probe of alleged coordination between Trump allies and Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He can legitimize himself by being forthcoming about his global interests,” Swalwell said, reviving long-running Democratic insistence that Trump follow presidential precedent and release his tax returns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior Democrats are renewing their push for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russia’s meddling following the revelation, first reported by CNN, that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump on Russia’s alleged attempts to collect compromising information on him. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that Trump’s friendliness toward Russia is “even more worrisome” in light of the reports, acknowledging they remain uncorroborated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The allegation that an American president could be susceptible to blackmail by a hostile foreign government is historic and deeply troubling,” Durbin said in a statement. “It makes the resistance of Republican leaders in the Senate and House to a fulsome investigation all the more inexplicable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen says Russia's preference for Donald Trump in the November election is not in dispute. | AP Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of Senate Democrats’ campaign committee, said in a Tuesday interview before the CNN report that while “it’s unknowable to what extent Russian interference affected the outcome” of the election, Moscow’s preference for Trump isn’t in dispute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What we do know is they were working hard to elect Donald Trump and try to disqualify Hillary Clinton, and that means it’s really important that we not only shine a light on what happened,” Van Hollen said, “but that we protect our electoral system and we sanction the Russians.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several Democrats steered clear of questioning Trump’s validity. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of several Democrats who joined four Republican senators Tuesday on a new Russia sanctions bill, said the Putin regime’s involvement in the election was critical — not what that involvement says about Trump’s victory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t even pass an opinion on whether it affected the legitimacy of his election,” Menendez said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) offered a road map for his party’s messaging efforts, blaming Trump for putting his own legitimacy at risk by resisting intelligence reports and underscoring Democrats’ interest in a bipartisan process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What undermines the incoming president is his unwillingness to agree with the intelligence community,” Schatz said in an interview. “There are very few serious members of Congress who are using this to question the legitimacy of the president-elect, but there are very many people on both sides who want to get to the bottom of this — not for the purpose of re-litigating 2016, but for the purpose of protecting our republic.”\nPassage 7:\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says allegations made about him in an unverified dossier prepared by ex-British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, are completely fabricated.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "length": 5652, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "11c4ec5eb86ca495cf4c6d0bd74f20059893179392643ec4"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nLONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain’s exit from the European Union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britain’s March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is a terrible result for the prime minister,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. “The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her “comfortably”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ENDANGERING BREXIT? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brexit is Britain’s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outcome will shape Britain’s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected.\nPassage 2:\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She is understood to have promised not to call a \"snap general election\" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, she added: \"I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said \"she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a \"half-hearted\" reception from MPs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had said it was not her \"intention\" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a \"politician's word\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May \"didn't really have anything new to say\" about Brexit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Whatever happens tonight I don't think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minister Margot James said she was \"proud\" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read Laura's blog NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can she survive the confidence vote? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was \"the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29\", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would \"flush out the extremists\" in his party whose Brexit agenda was \"not in the interests of the British people\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But her decision to cancel Tuesday's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: \"Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would \"get a kicking\" in the vote and that their \"pompous gesturing\" will be exposed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why are they trying to get rid of her? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They don't like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anger has focused on the so-called \"backstop\" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be \"temporary\" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does it mean for Brexit? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to \"adopt relevant conclusions\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR European Council President Donald Tusk has said the \"seriousness\" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated.\nPassage 3:\n19:29 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What about the ‘meaningful vote’? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result clearly highlights May’s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can “bin the backstop”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement – which contains the Northern Irish backstop – is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all. So the Brexit fundamentals at Westminster remain, for now, unchanged.\nPassage 4:\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement in Downing Street, London, confirming there will be a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, Wednesday Dec. 12, 2018.

Before betting was suspended, people putting money on a May win had to wager 10 pounds to win one pound.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The future status of those citizens affected by the Brexit process remains especially uncertain following the news earlier that Prime Minister Theresa May will face a no-confidence vote later from lawmakers in her own party. A withdrawal agreement ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in March has yet to be voted on by the British Parliament.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh declared fervently at his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday the court \"must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution.\" But that was at the end of a marathon day marked by rancorous exchanges between Democrats and Republicans, including dire Democratic fears that he would be President Donald Trump's advocate on the high court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The week of hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination began with a sense of inevitability that the 53-year-old appellate judge eventually will be confirmed, perhaps in time for the first day of the new term, Oct. 1, and little more than a month before congressional elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the first of at least four days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee began with partisan quarreling over the nomination and persistent protests from members of the audience, followed by their arrests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strong Democratic opposition to Trump's nominee reflects the political stakes for both parties in advance of the November elections, Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump's 2016 campaign and the potentially pivotal role Kavanaugh could play in moving the court to the right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats, including several senators poised for 2020 presidential bids, tried to block the proceedings in a dispute over Kavanaugh records withheld by the White House. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of turning the hearing into a circus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump jumped into the fray late in the day, saying on Twitter that Democrats were \"looking to inflict pain and embarrassment\" on Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president's comment followed the statements of Democratic senators who warned that Trump was, in the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, \"selecting a justice on the Supreme Court who potentially will cast a decisive vote in his own case.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Kavanaugh's own statement at the end of more than seven hours of arguing, the federal appeals judge spoke repeatedly about the importance of an independent judiciary and the need to keep the court above partisan politics, common refrains among Supreme Court nominees that had added salience in the fraught political atmosphere of the moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With his wife, two children and parents sitting behind him, Kavanaugh called himself a judge with a straightforward judicial philosophy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh also promised to be \"a team player on the Team of Nine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Supreme Court is often thought of as nine separate judges, rather than a team. And on the most contentious cases, the court tends to split into conservative and liberal sides. But justices often do say they seek consensus, and they like to focus on how frequently they reach unanimous decisions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barring a major surprise over the next two days of questioning, the committee is expected to vote along party lines to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Majority Republicans can confirm Kavanaugh without any Democratic votes, though they'll have little margin for error. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are battles worth fighting, regardless of the outcome,\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in an unsparing opening statement that criticized Kavanaugh's judicial opinions and the Senate process that Democrats said had deprived them of access to records of important chunks of Kavanaugh's time as an aide to President George W. Bush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats raised objections from the moment Chairman Chuck Grassley gaveled the committee to order. One by one, Democrats, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all potential presidential contenders, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing. They railed against the unusual vetting process by Republicans that failed to include documents from three years Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, and 100,000 more pages withheld by the Trump White House. Some 42,000 pages were released on the evening before of the hearing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing,\" said Harris at the top of proceedings. Grassley disagreed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As protesters repeatedly interrupted the session, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is fighting for his own re-election in Texas, apologized to Kavanaugh for the spectacle he said had less to do about the judge's legal record than Trump in the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is about politics,\" said Cruz. \"It is about Democratic senators re-litigating the 2016 election.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republicans' slim majority in the Senate was bolstered during the hearing by the announcement from Arizona that Gov. Doug Ducey was appointing Jon Kyl, the former senator, to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain. When Kyl is sworn in, Republicans will hold 51 of the 100 seats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators, who both favor abortion access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh sat silently and impassively for most of the day, occasionally sipping water and taking notes on senators' points. Besides his family, he was accompanied by outgoing White House Counsel Don McGahn and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several dozen protesters, shouting one by one, disrupted the hearing at several points and were removed by police. \"This is a mockery and a travesty of justice,\" shouted one woman. \"Cancel Brett Kavanaugh!\" Others shouted against the president or to protect abortion access. \"Senators, we need to stop this,\" called out one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As patience thinned and tempers flared, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, denounced what he called the \"mob rule.\" Struggling to speak over protesters, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said: \"These people are so out of line they shouldn't be in the doggone room.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told Kavanaugh the opposition being shown at the hearing reflected the concern many Americans have over Trump's \"contempt of the rule of law\" and the judge's own expansive views on executive power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's that president who's decided you are his man,\" Durbin said. \"Are people nervous about this concerned about this? Of course they are.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, described the hearing's \"very unique circumstances.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not only is the country deeply divided politically, we also find ourselves with a president who faces his own serious problems,\" she said referring to investigations surrounding Trump. \"So it's this backdrop that this nominee comes into.\"\nPassage 2:\nCSPAN Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are excerpts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s prepared opening remarks for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as released by the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also see: Day 1 of Kavanaugh nomination hearing — live video and updates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past eight weeks, I have witnessed first-hand the Senate’s deep appreciation for the vital role of the American Judiciary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the White House on the night of the announcement, the President and Mrs. Trump were very gracious to my daughters, my wife, and my parents. My family will always cherish that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero. As a Member of the Court, he was a model of civility and collegiality. He fiercely defended the independence of the Judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A good judge must be an umpire—a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. … I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.\nPassage 3:\nFollow Day 2 of the Kavanaugh hearing here: Trump’s Supreme Court nominee faces Senate grilling NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh launched Tuesday as a bitter political brawl, with loud objections from Democratic senators, the arrests of dozens of protesters and questions even from some Republicans about how Kavanaugh would separate himself from President Trump, the man who chose him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But GOP senators mostly calmly defended Kavanaugh from what Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) called the Shakespearean nature of the hearing — “sound and fury, signifying nothing” — confident that there were no defections from the solid Republican support Kavanaugh needs to be confirmed as the Supreme Court’s 114th justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 53-year-old judge, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sat impassively for nearly seven hours of senators’ statements before speaking for less than 20 minutes. Senators plan to begin questioning him Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution,” Kavanaugh said. “The justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. They do not caucus in separate rooms. If confirmed to the court, I would be part of a team of nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the team of nine.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No such conciliation was apparent on the Senate Judiciary Committee — or from the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [The story behind the withheld documents of the Kavanaugh hearing] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is,” Trump tweeted. “They will say anything, and are only looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chairman’s opening remarks were delayed for nearly an hour and a half as Democratic senators sought to cut off the hearings, raising an uproar over a last-minute document dump sent to the Judiciary Committee late Monday encompassing more than 42,000 pages from the nominee’s tenure in the George W. Bush White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats questioned Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy and even his honesty. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who has said he feels he was misled by the judge at his previous confirmation hearing for the lower court, pointedly told Kavanaugh he would question him about that “when you are under oath.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) referred to the Republican-appointed conservatives on the court headed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as the “Roberts Five” and said the justices were always looking for ways to benefit the “big fundraisers and influencers of the Republican Party.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz said his Democratic colleagues were trying to re-litigate the results of the 2016 election. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who noted that he had voted for President Barack Obama’s nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, was equally blunt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You had a chance and you lost,” Graham told Democrats. “You can’t lose the election and want to pick judges.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Hours before Kavanaugh hearings, Bush lawyer releases 42,000 pages of documents] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barring any major last-minute surprises, Kavanaugh appears to be on track to be confirmed by the end of the month. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said a committee vote is likely to occur Sept. 20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That would allow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to tee up votes on the floor confirming Kavanaugh during the last week of September. The Supreme Court’s new term begins Oct. 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Tuesday’s opening session indicated that the public fight over his nomination will be intense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was, Grassley said later, “a bad start.” Democratic senators repeatedly interrupted Grassley over the document issue, and by the end of the day more than 70 protesters had been arrested. Their theme: The Republicans are hiding something by withholding information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,” said Leahy. “And I have seen more of those than any person serving in the Senate today.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another focus was Trump himself, who has frequently leveled attacks against the judiciary and law enforcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Republican senators — Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) — praised Kavanaugh personally and professionally, but raised questions about Trump’s attacks on the Justice Department and how Kavanaugh would handle cases involving presidential power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a tweet Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican members of Congress on corruption charges and for the timing, so close to the House midterm elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold,” Flake said. He added that “many of the questions you will get on the other side of the aisle and from me” will center on separation of powers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The protesters, who were predominantly women, repeatedly heckled the senators and Kavanaugh, arguing that installing Trump’s second pick to the Supreme Court would irreparably end access to abortion and dismantle the Affordable Care Act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats have charged that documents on Kavanaugh’s career have been withheld without justification, particularly those from his tenure as a Bush staffer. Senators have reviewed nearly 200,000 pages that cannot be disclosed to the public, and the Trump administration is withholding an additional 100,000 pages from Congress, claiming that those documents are covered by presidential privilege. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh, appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by Bush, served the president in the White House Counsel’s Office from 2001 to 2003 and as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday’s proceedings brought to the surface years of anger over judicial nominees. Democrats invoked the name of Merrick Garland, who was nominated by Obama in 2016 to fill the Supreme Court seat formerly held by the late justice Antonin Scalia and who was denied a hearing by Senate Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his remarks, Kavanaugh praised Garland, the chief judge on the appeals court on which they both serve, as “superb” — a line likely to further rile Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said the Democrats’ behavior would lead them to be “held in contempt of court,” prompting a chorus of quiet boos and “Oh come on” that echoed throughout the hearing room. He later said the hearing had turned into “mob rule.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it was his turn, Kavanaugh told senators that he would be “a neutral and impartial arbiter” if confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences,” Kavanaugh said. “I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Throughout his remarks, Kavanaugh noted his appreciation for the strides that women and girls have made professionally and in sports. Kavanaugh’s critics have said his elevation to the Supreme Court would be detrimental to women’s reproductive rights and health-care options, and his emphasis on the strong women in his life seemed designed to counter those concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He talked about his record as a judge of hiring female law clerks and at length about coaching his daughters’ basketball teams, listing by name each player and noting the real-world impact of Title IX. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I see that law’s legacy every night when I walk into my house as my daughters are getting back from lacrosse, or basketball, or hockey practice,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a preview of the tough questions Kavanaugh will face Wednesday, Democratic senators said they would press the judge on his views about abortion, gun control and executive power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) addressed Kavanaugh about abortion. The question, she said, is not whether he believes that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision is “settled law,” as he has told other senators, but “whether you believe it is the correct law.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he would resurrect a controversy from Kavanaugh’s 2006 confirmation battle over whether he was involved in developing Bush-era policy on the treatment of terrorism suspects. Kavanaugh worked as a White House associate counsel at the time that Bush developed his policy, laid out in what became known as the “torture memo.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a nominee for the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh testified that he was “not involved.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, Kavanaugh’s denial came into question when The Washington Post revealed that he had participated in a White House Counsel’s Office meeting in which he was asked his opinion about how Kennedy — for whom he had clerked — was likely to view the matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) defended Kavanaugh and said the suggestion that the judge had “misled this committee in any way is absurd.”\nPassage 4:\nThings were charged enough that at one point Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) accused his Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of degrading the hearing to “mob rule.” Cornyn was rebuffed shortly after by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who disagreed with the assessment and noted that if mob rule had indeed prevailed, ultimate blame would lie with the chairman.\nPassage 5:\nTweet with a location NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats sought to take control of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing Tuesday, mounting a failed bid to delay President Donald Trump's nominee and interrupting Republicans dozens of times as multiple activists on the left disrupted the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The volley of Democratic interjections began after Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) attempted to open the high-stakes four-day hearing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) helped coordinate that strategy despite not serving on the Judiciary panel, convening a call with the committee's minority members over the weekend, according to a source familiar with the planning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley, attempting to speak over Democrats as they sought a vote on a motion to adjourn the hearing, acknowledged that \"maybe it’s not going exactly the way that the minority would like to have it go.\" One after another, Democrats repeatedly interrupted Grassley in the opening minutes, breaking into their protests to allow Kavanaugh to speak before resuming their push to stop the process until they can examine more records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the display of disruption, galvanizing as it was to Kavanaugh’s liberal critics, ultimately did little but delay a day of partisan jockeying that closed, more than seven hours later, with the nominee telling senators that “I do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley said at the end of the hearing that he’s preparing to schedule a committee vote on Kavanaugh for Sept. 13, paving the way for a final floor vote on confirmation before the new Supreme Court term opens next month. Democrats are expected to exercise their procedural right to delay that by a week, at a minimum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senators got more than 42,000 pages of documents late Monday night on a \"committee confidential\" basis, a designation that prevents their public release and likely stops Democrats from citing them during the hearing. Even before that latest release, however, Democrats already had begun discussing the protest they would mount Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move appeared to get under the skin of some in the GOP. After repeated interruptions from anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators who were escorted from the hearing room by police, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) suggested that Democrats would be held in \"contempt of court\" — drawing quick pushback from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) — and likened the moment to “mob rule.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley flatly ruled out Democrats’ repeated calls for an adjournment vote, but the fireworks at the start of the hearing already had set the tone for a raucous week to come. The White House sent a tally of the number of times each Democrat had interrupted Grassley during the first hour of the hearing, for a total of 44 interjections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh is expected to ultimately be confirmed, with the Senate headed toward a return to 51-49 GOP control following the selection Tuesday of former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) — who guided Trump’s nominee through the confirmation gantlet — to replace the late Sen. John McCain. But Democratic senators are still readying an intense volley of questions for the 53-year-old appeals court judge, focusing on his stance toward an ongoing challenge to Obamacare, the future of Roe v. Wade and his already-expressed skepticism about criminal investigations of sitting presidents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats have offered few indications that they're prepared to attempt a formal boycott of the Judiciary hearing to channel their ire over the withholding of hundreds of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh-related documents from public release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will attend the meetings. We will question assiduously. But we want to express our concerns,” the panel’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, told reporters alongside her fellow minority-party members at a gathering on the Supreme Court steps early Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans have touted the release of more than 290,000 pages of records from Kavanaugh's time in George W. Bush's White House counsel's office, noting that the volume of public disclosure has dwarfed that for previous Supreme Court picks. But Democrats have been infuriated by the GOP’s omission of any document requests governing Kavanaugh’s time as staff secretary to then-President Bush, tension that was stoked last week when the Trump administration cited executive privilege to shield more than 100,000 pages of records, angering the minority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Democrats’ interruptions cooled, Kavanaugh focused his opening statement on his family and friends as well as the support he’s provided to others as a constitutional law professor and volunteer. The judge, who also played a prominent role in drafting the Starr Report on former President Bill Clinton, described himself as “especially grateful to the dean who first hired me” at Harvard Law School — Democratic-tapped Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s nominee described himself as a player on the high court's “Team of Nine” and a “neutral and impartial arbiter,” if he wins confirmation in the coming weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liberal activists mounted their own show of force against Kavanaugh throughout Tuesday, the first of four days that are expected to stretch to marathon length. Women dressed in the red-and-white garb made famous by the dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" gathered outside the hearing room, demonstrating against Kavanaugh's potential to rule against abortion rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was among several committee members in both parties acknowledging the difficulty of speaking over the demonstrators, saying that “we ought to have this loudmouth removed” after a woman cried out about protecting pre-existing conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Capitol Police charged 61 protesters with disorderly conduct, a spokeswoman said. An additional nine were charged with obstruction or \"crowding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh notably name-checked Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama's pick for the Supreme Court who was stonewalled by Republican senators ahead of the 2016 election. Garland is currently a colleague of Kavanaugh's on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland,\" Kavanaugh said. That gesture was bound to fall on deaf ears with Democrats who view the entire confirmation process as unnecessarily hurried to get Trump a second seat on the high court in two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When Justice [Antonin] Scalia died, Republicans refused to even meet — even a meeting in their office — with President Obama’s nominee and held the seat open for one year,” Feinstein said in her opening statement. “Now, with a Republican in the White House, they’ve changed their position.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Democrats recognize their limited power to stop Kavanaugh's nomination, they're still using the confirmation process to score political points, especially given the stakes. Kavanaugh would likely bend the court significantly to the right, given that he's replacing retired justice Anthony Kennedy, who long served as a swing vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 7:\nThe start of Tuesday’s Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh erupted in chaos as Democrats demanded an adjournment and protesters interrupted with repeated shouts and were dragged out by police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) began his opening statements, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) interrupted to ask that the hearing be postponed so senators could review 42,000 pages of documents about Kavanaugh’s time in the George W. Bush White House that were dumped late Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman,” Harris insisted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You are out of order,” Grassley responded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrats’ objections were greeted by applause from activists in the audience, while some rose to scream objections to Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They were removed by police, one at a time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I’ve seen [subject] to mob rule,” fumed Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Capitol Police, 61 individuals were arrested inside the hearing and nine outside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) criticized Democrats who have 2020 presidential aspirations for grandstanding for the cameras. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They want that coveted TV clip. Frankly, I wish we could drop all that nonsense,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the morning, Kavanaugh introduces wife Ashley and daughters Liza and Margaret. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But later, as the protests heated up, Kavanaugh’s daughters were escorted out, according to Fox News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m sorry your daughters had to endure the political circus of this morning,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kids returned later to hear former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Lisa Blatt, a liberal Democrat and appellate lawyer, argue for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh finally got a chance to address the committee seven hours after the hearing began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A good judge must be an umpire, a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In our independent Judiciary, the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers, and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution … If confirmed to the court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats delivered long monologues complaining about a lack of transparency and raising concerns that Kavanaugh would roll back abortion rights, gun control and shield President Trump from criminal prosecution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Kavanaugh spoke, Trump took to Twitter to denounce the Democrats trying to block his nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is. They will say anything, and are only looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!” he wrote.\nPassage 8:\nSen.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., left, pause as protesters disrupt the confirmation hearing of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on Capitol Hill... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — Spoiling for a fight, some Democratic senators weighing 2020 presidential campaigns seized upon the opening moments of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday in a show of force aimed at countering President Donald Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One by one, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey, demanded that Republicans delay Kavanaugh's hearing after a last-minute release of more than 40,000 pages of documents and the withholding of more than 100,000 more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrats' coordinated showdown with the committee's chairman, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, served as a theatrical preview of what is expected to be a wild, unpredictable 2020 campaign against Trump, who has stoked outrage among Democratic activists and is expected to fuel an unusually large field of challengers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing showed the degree to which the Senate could be the testing ground of resistance among Democrats who are prepared to fight the Republican president's agenda in a field without an obvious front-runner. And it harkened back to how Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democratic senators battled President George W. Bush's administration before launching presidential bids of their own in the 2008 contest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley hadn't even introduced Kavanaugh by name when Harris interjected, objecting to the late Monday night release of Kavanaugh's documents. Harris has created a number of viral moments with her tough questioning of witnesses during her first term and quickly noted lawmakers hadn't had a chance to \"review or read or analyze\" the papers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're out of order. I'll proceed,\" Grassley responded, banging his gavel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Said Harris: \"We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Grassley tried to introduce Kavanaugh, Klobuchar called for the hearing to be postponed as the two senators attempted to talk over each other. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., jumped in, asking that the hearing be adjourned, prompting loud cheers and applause in the room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh, a veteran judge and a former aide to Bush, sat silently as the spectacle unfolded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker then appealed to Grassley's \"sense of decency and integrity,\" pushing for more transparency in the hearing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary,\" Booker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The three Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are considering whether to enter the presidential campaign following the November midterm elections along with other Senate Democrats not on the panel, such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who unsuccessfully battled Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, also is weighing another campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The field could include a number of Democratic governors, members of Congress, mayors and political newcomers along with familiar faces such as former Vice President Joe Biden, who appeared at a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh on Monday as he tests the waters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, even with his party facing a challenging midterm election, has relished the prospect of facing off against Democrats when the presidential campaign begins in earnest next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president didn't immediately respond to the Democrats' opposition to Kavanaugh on Tuesday. But he dismissed on Twitter the possibility of another prospective candidate, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Democrats' 2004 presidential nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I should only be so lucky,\" Trump tweeted on Monday, adding, \"although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the hearing and avoiding substance because they lack the votes to derail the nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is about Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the 2016 nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the hearing, the room was filled by demonstrators shouting at Kavanaugh, a reminder of the bitterness against Trump's presidency and Democrats' outrage over the treatment of Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court nominee, who was denied a hearing last year by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before Trump's election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minority Democrats are unable to delay a vote on Kavanaugh, making the confirmation process more of a demonstration of the party's warnings that he could help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, or undermine health care or other Democratic priorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on the issues when questioning begins on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Twitter follow Ken Thomas at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC\nPassage 9:\n• Republicans praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans used their opening statements to praise Judge Kavanaugh as highly qualified and a good man. They accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that his 12 years of appeals court rulings, which are public, are the best way to evaluate what kind of Supreme Court justice he would be. And, secure in the knowledge that they control the Senate and can confirmed the judge with a simple majority vote, Republicans expressed confidence that however unruly things get, the Senate will ultimately approve his appointment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • The hearing foreshadowed likely Democratic frustration in coming days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats signaled in their opening statements that they intend to press Judge Kavanaugh to explain in detail what he thinks about contentious legal questions, especially whether the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision was rightly decided — an issue that could illuminate whether he views it as settled precedent or vulnerable to overturning. But Republicans like Mr. Grassley said it would be inappropriate for him to indicate how he might rule on anything that might come before the court in the future. In his prepared opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for disclaiming that he will bring any ideological lens to interpreting ambiguous constitutional text, invoking the ideal of a judge as an “umpire — a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, starting with questioning by Mr. Grassley and by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat. Each senator on the committee will have 30 minutes in the first round of questioning and 20 in a second round, which is expected to wrap up on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh would then be excused, and the senators will question a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can’t get enough? The rest of our dispatches from the day are below.\n", "answers": ["One word keeps showing up in coverage of the first day of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing: \"chaos.\" (See here, here, and here.) Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a stronger phrase: \"mob rule,\" while Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois heard the \"noise of democracy.\" Democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from Kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the George W. Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time. Despite the Democrats' protests, Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley says he will not stop the hearing, which is expected to last four days, reports Politico.

Handmaid's Tale: Women dressed as characters from the Handmaid's Tale were among the protesters outside the hearing room, notes the Huffington Post. See an image here. The costumes illustrate their concerns that Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will be a setback for women's rights. Roe v. Wade: When the direct questions finally begin, Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on whether he'd be willing to overturn the ruling that legalized abortion, reports the New York Times. The question, said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is not whether he believes that Roe v. Wade is “settled law,” but “whether you believe it is the correct law.” The judge's views on executive power and gun control also were expected to be examined. 2 views: The interruptions and chaos are about \"Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election,\" said Republican Ted Cruz, per the AP.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The heaviest amount of violence took place between midnight and 3 a.m., when 30 people were shot.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I promise this city that we won’t be defeated,” Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller said during a news conference held Sunday afternoon at police headquarters. “We won’t be overrun by that small element that’s committing these reckless acts.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waller said much of the violence is being traced back to gangs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s one of our most violent weekends, there’s no question about that,” police spokesman Tom Ahern said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waller said the uptick in violence cannot be attributed to police resources being diverted to the Lollapalooza music festival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers working Lollapalooza were on their regular days off and received overtime pay, he said. “So they’re not people who would have been on the street anyway, so we’re not losing any resources to Lollapalooza,” Waller said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was downtown Sunday to announce plans for improvements to the Riverwalk, was not at the news conference. Police Supt. Eddie Johnson also was not in attendance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aftermath of many of the shootings played out inside and outside the emergency room at Stroger Hospital where extended members and friends were prevented from entering as the staff dealt with the influx of trauma patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Visitation was limited to immediate family members, leaving dozens of people to mill about the parking lot outside the emergency room, where the sounds of crying, wailing and yelling could be heard every few minutes.

The bloody toll comes as tens of thousands of concertgoers converged downtown for Lollapalooza, which drew heightened security and a large police presence following the country’s deadliest mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival last year. In contrast to the joyous scene downtown, the brunt of the violence early Sunday was felt on the West Side, where 26 people were shot in separate attacks between midnight and 6:50 a.m., according to police figures. The largest shooting, which injured eight people, happened in the South Side’s Gresham neighborhood as a group, including a 14-year-old girl, was standing in a courtyard just before 12:40 a.m. The crowd had gathered after attending a funeral repass, said Fred Waller, Chicago police chief of patrol. During a Sunday news conference, Waller voiced frustration at gang members whom he blamed for taking advantage of large summer crowds to use as cover to take revenge. The gang members do not fear repercussions from the law, Waller said. “They take advantage of that opportunity and they shoot into a crowd, no matter who they hit,” Waller said. Even a block party was not safe from the violence. READ MORE: 17-year-old boy killed on bike among 6 shot since Sunday afternoon » At 16th Street and Avers Avenue, people in lime green T-shirts from an annual block party in the West Side’s Lawndale neighborhood gathered on sidewalks and in streets after a shooting there around midnight. Crime scene tape crossed 16th Street east of Springfield Avenue and stretched far down the block past Penn Elementary School on the south side of 16th. There, a 13-year-old boy was shot twice in the right arm. A car drove up to the gathering and two people got out and opened fire into the crowd, hitting two more teenagers and a 25-year-old man. “If they shoot you, they don’t even run,” said one man watching police work the scene. “They just walk away, they ain’t trying to run.” The youngest person hurt was an 11-year-old boy shot in the left leg on the West Side — also in the Lawndale neighborhood. He was on the sidewalk with five other people, including a 14-year-old boy, when two men came up to them and started shooting, police said. Although investigations were just getting underway, Waller said many of the shootings appeared to be targeted attacks. Police also noted that many of the shootings were in four police districts, including the West Side’s Harrison, Ogden and Austin police districts, that have struggled with violent crime this year. Waller said police were sticking with their strategy that targets illegal guns, and prior to this weekend’s surge, they credited it with declines in homicides and shootings from last year. More than 5,500 illegal guns have been confiscated on the street this year. Police are planning coordinated enforcement that will target gangs and individuals they believe are driving violence, while police also seek to thwart retaliatory attacks. “I promise this city, we won’t be defeated,” Waller said. “We won’t be overrun by that small element that’s committing these reckless acts.” The level of violence on Sunday made it difficult for police and hospitals to keep track. Resources at local hospitals were taxed as the wounded and their families poured in. Access to Stroger Hospital was tightened. At one point, more than 200 people had converged on the hospital. Mount Sinai Hospital had to stop accepting new emergency cases for a while. Earlier Sunday, police said there were 47 people shot, five killed between 9 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. Sunday. Later in the day, however, police counted 34 shooting victims and five homicides in the same 24-hour period About 15 of those shot were in their teens. In the attack in Gresham, seven of those shot were 21 or younger. During one 2½-hour early morning period, 25 people were shot in five multiple-injury shootings, police said. One of the dead was 17-year-old Jahnae Patterson, who was shot in the face. Sunday evening more than two dozen relatives of Patterson, a Manley Career Academy High School senior, sobbed outside her family’s brown brick two-flat in the city’s West Garfield Park neighborhood. Friends and family members hung five poster boards on a fence outside the home with photos of the young woman. Patterson’s family said she and a friend had gone to a block party and were walking to use a bathroom when they encountered two young men who engaged in a shootout. “My baby just left the house. Twenty minutes later, I get a call saying my baby got shot,” Patterson’s mother, Tanika Humphries, said. The fifth of nine children and the first girl in the family, Patterson had her entire life ahead of her, her mother said. “My baby did not deserve this,” she said. “My baby wasn’t the type to hang out. She was in school. She worked. She did everything she was supposed to do as a teenager. And then coward (expletive) took it all away from us.” Family and friends attend a vigil for Jahnae Patterson, 17, who was killed after being shot in the face earlier in the morning on Aug. 5, 2018, in the 4200 block of West Wilcox Street in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) Humphries said her daughter was born with health problems, but survived to be a beautiful and vital young woman, beloved by her young nieces and nephews, as well as her friends. “I’m trying to be strong, but I can’t,” Humphries said as she broke down and was surrounded by relatives. “I can’t.” Earlier Sunday, people congregated at Mount Sinai Hospital, leaning against cars and embracing on the sidewalk. Yellow crime scene tape encircled two cars outside the emergency room, a white sedan and a black one that had its front crumpled and windshield cracked. Dozens of others gathered outside Stroger Hospital, clustered in small groups in the parking lot. Only immediate family members of victims were allowed inside, according to police. Families walked up to the entrance, guarded by police. Octavia White said she went to Stroger to see her daughter, who she said was among those shot in the 4700 block of West Gladys Avenue in West Garfield Park. “I thank God it wasn’t her time,” White said as she walked to the bus stop. “I’ll be back here when she wakes up.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the sun beat down during daytime Sunday, groups of family and friends remained stationed outside the hospital. Ald. Walter Burnett, 27th, stopped by to speak with the families. Burnett said the shootings affect whole families and entire communities, as evidenced by the crowd outside Stroger. “You have young kids crying, older people crying, it’s just so heartbreaking,” Burnett said. “So we try to give them some comfort, pray for them, and also at the same time try to encourage the young adult men not to try to get revenge.” DATA: The Tribune crime team tracks shooting victims in Chicago » Burnett said it’s up to the neighborhoods to stop the violence. He talked about growing up in the former Cabrini-Green housing project. “It was the mothers, it was the preachers, it was people in the neighborhood who stopped the wars in Cabrini-Green,” he said. “It wasn’t the police.” Asked what Chicago police can expect as far as outside governmental help, Waller said: “I’m not a politician. All I know is the boots on the ground are trying as hard as they can to be accountable for what’s going on. We’re moving people to different places in these different (police) districts. Some of the areas that we had covered weren’t, we hadn’t had violence — now we have violence. “But as far as anybody coming to help us, this is something we’re going to have to do on our own,” he said. Activist Eric Russell, an organizer of the anti-violence protest Thursday that shut down Lake Shore Drive, also spoke outside of the hospital. “This is the reason why we march,” he said. Russell went on to harshly criticize Mayor Rahm Emanuel for not doing enough to address gun violence. “Our people are hurting over there,” Russell said. “Our people are left to languish in a vicious cycle of gun violence.” Among the shootings since 11 a.m. Saturday through about 7 a.m. Sunday, police have released the following information: Sunday In the most recent shooting, three men and two women were hit about 6:50 a.m. when a gunman came out of an alley and opened fire on the group in the first block of North LeClaire Avenue in the South Austin neighborhood. A 32-year-old with four gunshot wounds, including two to the left side of his neck, was taken to Stroger, where he was pronounced dead, according to a police spokeswoman. A 30-year-old man shot in the back of the head was taken to Stroger in critical condition. A 27-year-old woman was taken to Stroger for gunshot wounds to her left arm and wrist, while a 21-year-old woman was treated and released from West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park for a graze wound. A 34-year-old man showed up to Stroger with a gunshot wound in his lower left leg. He was in good condition. No arrests had been made in the case, police said. Just before 5:50 a.m. in West Pullman, a 33-year-old man was shot once in each of his legs in the 12100 block of South Bishop Street by someone last seen northbound on Bishop in a small silver Ford car, police said. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in fair condition. Around 4:15 a.m. in North Austin, four more people were shot in the 1600 block of North LeClaire Avenue, one fatally. A 19-year-old man, shot in the head, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. A 21-year-old man shot in the upper right thigh and a 37-year-old man hit in the right calf were taken to West Suburban and stabilized. An unknown male also shot went to Stroger Hospital, police said. Shortly before 3:40 a.m. in the West Side’s Lawndale neighborhood, a 29-year-old man was shot in the neck. Police officers found the man, later identified as Kenyate L. Sparks, in the 1100 block of South Springfield Avenue. He was transported to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8:52 a.m. Around 2:50 a.m. in West Garfield Park, a 14-year-old boy was shot in the left leg in the 200 block of South Pulaski Road. He was taken to Stroger Hospital in good condition, police said. Around 2:35 a.m. Sunday in Lawndale, two shooters approached a group standing on the sidewalk in the 1300 block of South Millard Avenue and opened fire, hitting six people. A 17-year-old girl shot in the face was pronounced dead on scene. A 14-year-old boy shot in his left leg was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital and stabilized, as was an 11-year-old boy also shot in the left leg. A 21-year-old woman shot in the right arm and back was also taken to Sinai, where she was in critical condition. A 17-year-old boy shot in the right leg was taken to Rush University Medical Center and was stabilized. A 17-year-old girl shot in the right arm was taken to Stroger and stabilized. About 10 minutes earlier in West Garfield Park, three women standing on a front porch were wounded when two groups of males started shooting at each other about 2:25 a.m. in the 4700 block of West Gladys Avenue, police said. A 29-year-old woman shot in the back and a 28-year-old woman shot in the left arm were taken to Stroger and stabilized. A 41-year-old woman shot in the right thigh was stabilized at Loretto Hospital. Around 1:30 a.m. in Little Village, a 26-year-old man standing on the sidewalk in the 3200 block of South Keeler Avenue was hit in the right leg when someone in a white sedan fires shots, police said. He got himself to University of Illinois Chicago Medical Center and was stable. Shortly before 1:05 a.m. in Back of the Yards, a 26-year-old man was killed in a shooting in the 4800 block of South Winchester Avenue. The man, identified by the medical examiner’s office as Kendall Brown, was walking on the sidewalk with another person when someone in a white Jeep shot him in the abdomen and right ankle, police said. He was taken to Mount Sinai and later pronounced dead . The Jeep was found unoccupied and having been set on fire in the 4300 block of Paulina, police said. Around 12:50 a.m. in West Humboldt Park, four people were injured in a drive-by shootout the 900 block of North Karlov Avenue. Two people fired shots from inside a black Cadillac, and three of the people hit shot back, causing the car to crash. The two in the car ran from the scene. A 43-year-old man walking down the street was shot in the thigh during the crossfire, police said. The other three people shot were a 30-year-old man hit in the right ankle and left calf; a 43-year-old man shot in the thigh; and a 29-year-old man grazed in the chest. All were taken to Stroger in good condition.\n", "answers": ["Chicago might have been making headlines this weekend for the thousands of people who packed downtown for Lollapalooza. Instead, most of the attention is focused on the shooting violence that occurred elsewhere in the city, leaving more than 60 injured and 10 dead between Friday evening and Monday morning, reports WLS-TV. The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don’t even run,” one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain’t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called McCarthy a \"policing genius\" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, \"Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.\" The Washington Post can't resist pointing out that Giuliani misspelled McCarthy's first name as \"Jerry\" and the current mayor's last name as \"Emmanuel,\" and that McCarthy is a Democrat himself."], "length": 4100, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dc1fb7559a52f92e5cd684dc2ec9f96fe821b2cf1b1f8619"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Coast Journal included Martinez in a cover story featuring images of the 35 people listed as missing in Humboldt County on the California Department of Justice's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Playing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story titled \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" was published on Facebook on Thursday in a post that asked readers if they recognized anyone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amy Bonner O'Brien of Trinidad was the first to respond on the Facebook post and identify Martinez as a contestant on the current season of \"The Bachelor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My sister always calls me Sherlock Holmes,\" O'Brien said. \"I was just scrolling through the 35 missing people and I recognized some of them from news stories. When I got to her, I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar and I instantly thought of 'The Bachelor.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Brien doesn't regularly tune into \"The Bachelor,\" but on a recent visit to see her sister they watched this season's first episode together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Coast Journal reached out to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, who contacted Martinez over the phone and promptly removed her from the missing person's list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(The mother) had phone contact with Bekah via a friend on November 12th,\" said Public Information Officer Samantha Karges. \"Bekah had told her she was coming to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm and she wouldn't be able to contact her for a week or so.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On \"The Bachelor,\" Martinez got attention for her 14-year age difference with the lead Arie Luyendyk Jr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has been actively posting on Instagram and Twitter since she was reported missing and often posts about appearing on the show. When her bizarre story was reported by media on Feb. 2, she tweeted a message referring to the photo used in the missing person's report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bekah is us listening to Bekah’s impersonation of Krystal! #TheBachelor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her main defining aspects on the show, so far, have been that she gives great reactions to all the drama... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fact that at age 22, she is much, much younger than the bachelor, 36-year-old Arie Luyendyk Jr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But apparently, the drama in Bekah's personal life is much more complicated. In November, she was reported missing by her mother in California, and is still currently listed as missing on the attorney general's website NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bizarre story unfolded after the North Coast Journal published a cover story this week called \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" It examined why Humboldt has, according to the newspaper, \"the highest per-capita rate of people reported missing in California.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story was accompanied by a slideshow of all 35 people currently listed as missing in the county. One of them was Bekah, reported missing on Nov. 18, 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Bekah's mother called deputies on Nov. 18 and filed a missing person's report for her daughter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mother told them she had last spoken to her daughter on Nov. 12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Martinez told her mother that she was going to work on a marijuana farm and would see her in seven to eight days,\" officials said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff’s officials said they followed \"all leads\" and the proper \"procedure\" to find Bekah. They also tried to contact Bekah and people who may know her, but were not successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 12, Bekah's mother told officials she had heard from her daughter, who said she was on her way home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, sheriff's officials said they were still unable to contact Bekah, and so did not take her off the missing persons list.\nPassage 4:\nThey have been missing since 1977, or just since last November. They range in age from 1 to 94. They are men and women, and two very small girls. The sheriff's office will not call any of them \"cold cases\" but many of their names and faces have long since slipped from public recognition. They are not the \"Humboldt Five\" profiled in the sensationalist 2016 Crime Watch Daily piece with Chris Hansen, which suggested a serial killer was somehow connected to the disappearances of five young women between 1993 and 2014 and referred to Humboldt County as \"a lonely stretch of foggy California coastline [that] some think of as a doorway to Heaven on Earth — others as a gateway to Hell.\" They are the Humboldt 35 — all of the names on the California Attorney General's database of missing persons as of Jan. 18. They are identified with mugshots or grainy photos that have been digitally aged by decades. According to Journal research, Humboldt has the highest per-capita rate of people reported missing in California. Is Humboldt County, as Hansen suggested, a black hole? The answer is complicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To begin with, it's hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison of Humboldt to other parts of the state or other parts of the country. According to a Journal analysis of available AG data, we do have a high rate of missing persons reports. Between 2000 and 2016, we averaged 717 missing persons reports a year (both adults and children) per 100,000 residents. The statewide average? 384. It's worth noting that California has one of the most liberal standards for filing a missing persons report, with no waiting period or jurisdictional restrictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a fallacy that it has to be 24 hours,\" says Lt. Dennis Young of the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, adding that he thinks the AG numbers are \"askew.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We always take the report, we never delay it,\" says Sgt. Diana Freese, one of the HCSO's four detectives who work missing persons cases. \"If someone calls from Humboldt County and says someone is missing in New York, I will take the report then contact the New York office for them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is not a one-to-one ratio of reports to missing persons as some are reported missing multiple times, generating multiple reports. But most are not missing for long. Of the 313 reports filed for missing adults in Humboldt County in 2016, the vast majority were closed: 230 returned or were located, three were found dead, 15 arrested, eight were declared \"voluntary missing,\" five were marked withdrawn, one marked \"unknown\" and 51 classified as \"other,\" which includes suspicious circumstances. Of those 51 people, only one remains on the AG's website: Mitchell Hernandez, a 47-year-old man who walked out of a family member's home near Rancho Sequoia in Alderpoint the day before Thanksgiving, reportedly while carrying a .40 caliber pistol and a backpack. The backpack was found next to the Eel River near Fort Seward. Hernandez, described as possibly having mental health issues, remains missing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County ranks sixth in the state per capita for missing children reports between 2010 and 2016. One factor that may contribute to that ranking is the high number of Humboldt County children in transitional and foster care. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), these kids are at a higher risk to be chronic runaways, with each separate incident generating its own report. It has only been mandatory for states to report runaway foster youth to law enforcement and to NCMEC since 2014, thanks to an anti-sex trafficking bill passed under the Obama administration, although the Humboldt County Department of Social Services has followed this protocol since 2000. The number of annual reports for missing children in Humboldt County has hovered in the mid-600s to upper-700s for more than a decade. From 2000 through 2016, Humboldt County saw an average of 490 missing children reports annually for every 100,000 residents compared to the state average of 280. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked whether these disproportionate numbers put Humboldt County on NCMEC's radar, Bob Lowery, the organization's vice-president, says, in short, \"No.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a bit curious as to why that might be,\" Lowery tells the Journal in a phone interview. \"It could be that the county sheriff and local police are very aggressive in accepting reports and getting them into the system. I'm not aware of any critically missing children in Humboldt County. If you dig into those number a little deeper, the reports are generally going to be runaway children.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lowery emphasizes that 378 missing children reports filed do not necessarily represent 378 separate children, as some may be chronic runaways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Sometimes we've found when numbers are a little bit skewed there are reporting errors,\" he says. \"Children who go missing typically come back in the first few days but don't always come out of system.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the Eureka Police Department and Humboldt County Sheriff's Office seem to agree with this assessment, saying that the majority of runaway juvenile cases are resolved within days or weeks. But according to the Journal's analysis of data available from the AG's office over the last six years, we also outpace the state average for children missing under \"unknown circumstances.\" Statewide, runaways account for about 95 percent of missing children reports, while that percentage dips to 90 in Humboldt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only two children appear on the AG's list of missing persons for Humboldt County, Jessie and Fannie Stuart, ages 2 and 1 when they disappeared along with their mother, Mary Stuart, in December of 1977. Mary, who lived on a rural homestead in Honeydew, had driven into town on Dec. 10 to buy groceries and do laundry. Neither she nor the children were ever seen again, although the family's red station wagon was found on a logging road nearby. The Humboldt County District Attorney's Office reopened the case in 2009, saying it had new leads, according to an article in the Times-Standard. Byron Stuart, Mary's husband, remains the primary suspect in the case. Neighbors describe him as violent, erratic and often armed with guns. He died in 1996 and his homestead has since been subdivided, the site of many different cannabis grow scenes in the intervening decades. Although NCMEC continues to digitally age the photographs of tiny Jessie and Fannie Stuart, investigators seem to agree that they have been long since deceased. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We never stop looking,\" says Young. \"Investigations will stall. There comes a point in time in a lot of cases where the leads just dry up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only other missing juvenile case from Humboldt County that remains on NCMEC's database is Karen Mitchell, who disappeared as a teenager from U.S. Highway 101 on Nov. 25, 1997. A poster with an age-progressed picture of Mitchell, who would now be 37, still hangs on the wall of the Eureka Police Department's lobby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Journal began monitoring the AG's website in November of 2017, we compared several of its listings against any extra information we could find online. We were able to contact one of the reported missing — a mother and her 2-year-old daughter — via social media and ask why the Eureka Police Department had placed her on the database two months earlier. She had no idea and asked for information about how to remove the listing. We gave her contact information for the nearest law enforcement office and the listing disappeared shortly afterward. Another woman — Allison Nicole Strout — was listed as missing since May of 2016 but appears to have been active on social media the entire time. Her name was removed after she showed up in a Humboldt County Drug Task Force bust at a Eureka motel in October. These cases illustrate a small but frustrating subset of the data: Some people aren't actually missing and others just don't want to be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Young and other law enforcement professionals emphasize that Humboldt County is a good place to disappear. It's not unusual, they say, to spend resources searching for missing adults at the behest of friends, parents or spouses only to be told by the party in question that they had cut off contact for a good reason, such as estrangement or abuse, and were laying low out of choice. Many people come to the area to work in the cannabis industry, leaving town to work on remote mountains where there is no cell phone service. They may be out of communication for weeks or months, with family members only having a vague idea of where they might be that — they drove to Eureka, are in Humboldt County, or are in the general \"Emerald Triangle\" region. These cases can be particularly hard to investigate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one wants to cooperate with a missing persons investigation,\" says Young of cannabis-related cases. \"Many people from throughout the state, nation and world come to Humboldt County to work in the cannabis industry. They often times will not communicate with friends and family regarding their location, and/or they go off the grid for extended periods of time. Many of those individuals will return home and no one notifies law enforcement that they are no longer missing. Consequently, they remain in the data base. Some missing persons are victims of homicides with no apparent leads and lack of witness cooperation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While law enforcement pointed to the local cannabis industry as a primary reason for Humboldt County's high rates of missing adults, its worth noting that our rates are still roughly double those of the rest of the Emerald Triangle — Mendocino and Trinity counties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eureka, as the county seat, becomes the default location for many missing persons reports. Brittany Powell, a crime analyst with EPD, says her agency takes about 40 reports a month, with a total of about 500 reports filed last year. Patrol officers take the initial report and, if there is any sign of suspicious circumstances, reach out to friends and family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Most of the individuals have been located and cleared from the system,\" Powell wrote the Journal in an email. \"I would say most are found within a few days.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people reported missing to EPD are adults who were en route to the area when they last spoke to their family, or members of the homeless population who have fallen out of touch with their loved ones and are rumored to be in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These reports are usually for the long-term homeless community,\" Powell says. \"Family members [sometimes after the passing of a loved one] try to get in touch with an estranged family member. A lot of the time it is not known how long the person was in Eureka, if at all. Also, the descriptions and information regarding the person are often minimal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both EPD and the sheriff's office enter missing persons into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), but only after a certain period of investigation. (\"Once all potential leads have been exhausted,\" according to Young.) NamUs, a federal database of missing persons and unidentified bodies, connects each case with a caseworker who compares it against reports, looks for patterns and collaborates with families and local law enforcement. NamUs' website includes several Humboldt County area reports that don't appear on the Attorney General's website. This is not uncommon, according to NamUs' founder and Director Todd Matthews, who says the patchwork of information available through local and state organizations doesn't offer the full picture that a national registry might. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't know what I don't know,\" says Matthews, who has been advocating for legislation to mandate all law enforcement agencies put missing persons reports into the national database. \"I don't know why it isn't standardized. It might be a money thing but I say, we've already paid for it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NamUs system allows family members to submit DNA samples to its database for comparison against unidentified bodies (there are no unidentified bodies currently in the system for Humboldt County), and to also contact NamUs caseworkers to update information, refining descriptions and adding photographs. One of the names that appears on the NamUs website but not on the AG's list, Cody Conoboy, has been positively matched to a DNA sample. Conoboy, 15, was swept into the Trinity River after jumping out of a stolen car near Hoopa in January of 2011. A jawbone found the following September was positively identified Conoboy's in 2013. It's not uncommon for these cases to remain on the database, according to Young. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Some of the people we will never be able to remove from the system,\" he says. \"Maybe they were washed out to sea [in] a witnessed event but their bodies were not recovered.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Young says Conoboy's listing probably remains because the U.S. Department of Justice only removes a person whose body part has been recovered if the part is something they \"can no longer live without,\" such as a skull. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another case that remains on the NamUs database belongs to Claire Louise Christie, who was reported by her husband as lost at sea in 1977. That case gained new significance in 2010 when her husband, Ernest Samuel Christie Jr., was posthumously identified as the perpetrator of the 1988 torture and murder of Lysandra Marie Turpin. Christie was also implicated in the torture of several other women who, according to an interview with HCSO detective Steve Quenell in the Times-Standard, he would pick up in Eureka's Old Town and take back to his home in Fieldbrook. One was allegedly brought aboard Christie's fishing boat, where he duct taped her wrists and said she wouldn't be coming back. (She escaped.) Claire Louise Christie's fate may never be known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matthews says instances of people going missing for an extended period of time without something bad having happened are rare, although it does happen to the mentally ill and destitute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know a guy who recently lost his cell phone because he couldn't pay for it,\" he says, adding that along with poverty, a lack of family or community can play a role in whether someone is declared missing or eventually found. \"The biggest discrimination that exists is whether someone is expecting you to show up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many families who were expecting loved ones to call or return home from Humboldt County only to have them go missing find the process of searching for them to be frustrating. Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff Joseph disappeared in June of 2014, says that she has found community with other families whose loved ones disappeared, many of whom, like Jeff, were involved in the cannabis industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's hard to connect with anyone who understands what it's like to have a missing family member up there,\" Vikki Joseph says. Since Jeff went missing, she has corresponded with the families of Danielle Bertolini, Sheila Franks and Chris Giauque, all of whom disappeared under suspicious circumstances related to the cannabis industry. (Bertolini's remains were found in 2015.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner from Los Angeles, was visiting his farm near Weitchpec when he suddenly stopped returning calls from his sister and girlfriend. His cell phone last pinged off a tower near Bloody Camp Road near Hoopa. Vikki Joseph believes her brother was murdered in connection with his cannabis grow and says his partners were not cooperative with the sheriff's investigation, nor would they let his family access the property to gather Jeff's belongings. The partners allegedly told her brother and uncle that if they crossed the gate, they would be shot. She found their refusal to cooperate with her family or help investigators suspicious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Where I live is very suburban, it's not forest, it's not remote, we don't lose cell phone service,\" she says in a phone interview. \"It can be very dangerous. When you mix growing big amounts of weed and lots of money, it's a recipe for disaster.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trying to keep her brother's name in the public eye and communicate with investigators from so far away has been challenging. While segments like the Crime Watch Daily piece keep a laser focus on photogenic young women, little attention has been given to Jeff Joseph's case outside of local news sites like Redheaded Blackbelt and it remains unsolved four years later. But you won't find Jeff's case on the AG's listings for Humboldt County. Because Vikki Joseph made the report in Los Angeles, that's where the case is listed. She says she worked closely with Humboldt County Sheriff's Office detective Todd Fulton but received no notice when he retired, finding out only three months later that the case had bounced to a different detective. Vikki Joseph has ended up doing a lot of investigative work herself, tracking down leads and hiring private investigators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff's office wouldn't comment on the specifics of the case, stating it was an open investigation, but Freese says if they had a new lead, they would work it. In general terms, Freese says that if they had enough probable cause to cross a locked gate, they would request a warrant and do so. In the case of Jeff Joseph, she says, there's a lot she just can't share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've done extensive work on it,\" she says, adding that it's imperative for family members to keep in contact with the department and encourage others who might have information to come forward. \"I think they should call over to our department and see who is carrying the case. Often it's going to be a family member, what they forgot to say or didn't think of [that helps]. I am all about having family members call. Sometimes I will set up a day, every week or every month. I say, 'I will call you at 9 o'clock,' and update them on where we're at. That can bring some peace.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vikki Joseph isn't satisfied. She describes herself as being in a double-bind, with plenty of information but a frustrating lack of options for what to do with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have things other families don't have,\" she says. \"Things that could have all been researched. But there's only so much we can do. I can research it and research it, can provide them with all their leads and tips but I can't arrest anyone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Jeff Joseph was originally listed as \"voluntary missing,\" Vikki Joseph doesn't believe her brother would have disappeared on purpose. He was a loving, kind man, she insists. He was non-violent, refusing to carry a gun. When their mother was dying, Jeff was the one who took care of her, feeding her and changing her diapers. He would never go this long without letting his family know he was OK. It hurts Vikki Joseph to think about what he must have felt in those last moments, the fear and betrayal. She just wants to know where his body is to bring him back to Los Angeles County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked what she's going to do once that happens, Vikki Joseph doesn't hesitate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm going to put him to rest next to his mom,\" she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Journal graphic designer Jonathan Webster contributed to this report.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports a 22-year-old woman reported missing in November in California was found this week—because she's a current contestant on The Bachelor. The strange story started when Bekah Martinez's mom reported her missing to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office on Nov. 18. According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person. The Bachelor started filming in September, and it's unclear if Martinez was still filming when she was reported missing.

We want to seed ideas, connections and projects that will make the breast pump experience not suck so much. Covening talented people for a weekend is a first step. We also see this as an opportunity to catalyze innovation in maternal and pediatric health more generally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What's a hackathon? A hackathon is a high-energy, collaborative event that seeks to bring together a diverse group of people to explore key issues and challenges in a particular field. Traditionally, hackathons have been mostly technical in nature, focusing on software engineering and, occasionally, on hardware development; our goal is to reach out to a wider range of talents and skills to investigate creative solutions for the maternal and neonatal healthcare space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Who's coming? 150 people that will self-organize into teams of 5-10 people per team. For our hackathon teams, we are looking for a mix of breastpump users, engineers, designers, health care and lactation specialists, and educators. Registration is free and open to the public but space is limited. You must register in order to attend and unfortunately all of our space is now full. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Who organized this? We are a group of MIT Media Lab students and researchers who are also parents: Tal Achituv is a Research Assistant in the Fluid Interfaces group. His background is in hardware and software engineering and he has founded several companies. He is the father of Shira (2), and Lior who was born just last month. (@achituv) Catherine D'Ignazio is a Research Affiliate in the Civic Media group. She is also an Assistant Professor of Civic Media and Data Visualization at Emerson College and a Fellow at the Engagement Lab. Her background is in the arts, data visualization and software development. She likes making fun, magical things with social impact. She has three kids and has pumped for all three.

As one of the midwives at our first hackathon said, \"Maternal health lags behind other sectors for innovation.\" We are bringing together people from diverse fields, sectors and backgrounds to take a crack at making life better for moms, babies and new families. We see our role as a catalyst for new connections and new ideas that will inspire participants and highlight maternal and pediatric health as a vibrant, exciting space to be working in for the design and engineering leaders of tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why is breastmilk magic? The health benefits of breastfeeding (both to mother and baby!) are numerous and include the reductions of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, female cancers, heart disease and osteoporosis. Despite the overwhelming data and worldwide endorsement of breastfeeding for at least two years, many women do not breastfeed at all or wean after several months. In particular, low-income, working women are rarely able to take extended maternity leave, to afford the cost of a pump, or to pump breastmilk at their workplace. In emerging economies around the world, women who go back to work wean their babies rather than using a breast pump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why does breastpumping suck?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a competition to improve the condom, it was impressive that an organization decided to take an intimate problem and expose it globally. Now, MIT wants to tackle another under-the-radar, yet needs to be addressed issue—breast pumping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MIT says that maternal and neonatal health is a space that “lags behind others” in innovation, and they want to change that. Plus, breast pumping flat-out sucks. As MIT points out on its website: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The motor is loud. There are too many parts. They are hard to clean. You can’t lay down and pump. There is no good space to pump. It’s hard to keep track of what you pump. Your colleagues think pumping is weird. People are skeeved out by breastmilk. People are embarrassed by breasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, let’s not forget that you just pushed a baby out of your body. You’d think that would be the hardest part of being a new mom. But no, then you also have to deal with the annoyances of pumping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s why the MIT Media Lab is holding a “Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon” September 20 and 21 in Cambridge, where they’re bringing together 60 to 80 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to bring innovation to maternal health and make “the breast pump not suck.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MIT says on its website that they’re holding the challenge because improving breast pump technology can save lives and money: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breast pumping is an experience many women hate, yet it saves the lives of premature babies and permits working women to continue a nursing relationship with their baby. The health benefits of breastfeeding, both to mother and baby, are numerous and include the reductions of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, female cancers, heart disease and osteoporosis. Despite the overwhelming data and worldwide endorsement of breastfeeding for at least two years, many women do not breastfeed or wean after several months. In particular, low-income, working women are rarely able to take extended maternity leave, to afford the cost of a pump, or to pump breastmilk at their workplace. In emerging economies around the world, women who go back to work wean their babies rather than using a breast pump. The breast pump is the rallying cry for the event because it is a symbol of a technology that could be vastly improved in order to save lives, save money and lead to healthier and happier families. At the same time, our goal is to make space for innovation in family life more broadly and support a wide variety of different kinds of projects at the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tickets are free; Starts Saturday, September 20, 10:00 a.m.; eventbrite.com\nPassage 4:\nPhoto NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I made my way upstairs, drawn by a strange sound emanating from our bedroom. It was rhythmic, like the sound of an old dot matrix printer. As I opened the door, I was confronted with the image of my wife holding two plastic funnels over her breasts with a big frown across her face. I immediately thought of Madonna’s cone-shaped bra from the 1980s and let out a gasp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Courtney: John wasn’t laughing at me, he swore up and down. He was laughing at the ridiculousness of the contraption: a standard mechanical breast pump. New motherhood already felt like a battle to stay standing on ground in perpetual tectonic shifts. Now I realized that I was effectively dependent on a badly designed, embarrassingly loud device for any chance to leave the house. Let’s just say, I didn’t feel like Madonna. I felt like a cow at an industrial farm, awaiting a humanizing visit from Temple Grandin. It turns out, even Wikipedia describes the breast pump as “analogous to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since our first encounters with the breast pump, we wondered how women had been duped into settling for such bad design. The pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum. In theory, women have the freedom to honor the wisdom that “breast is best,” while still pursuing their own careers. And yet, to do so, they’re forced to attach themselves, multiple times a day, to a loud, sometimes painful machine that makes one feel anything but powerful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No doubt inspired by the ubiquitous public service announcements about how healthy breastfeeding is for mother and baby, 77 percent of new mothers do it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2013 Breastfeeding Report Card. In fact, a crucial provision of the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover lactation services, with the pump being the most obvious purchase. The average electric pump costs approximately $250. According to market research firm Global Industry Analysts, the breast pump market will reach 5.63 million units by 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And yet, despite the lucrative market possibilities as well as the health benefits, the modern pump remains largely unchanged since it was first invented. Edward Lasker, an engineer, produced the first mechanical breast pump and secured the patent in the 1920s. In 1956, Einar Egnell created the Egnell SMB breast pump, a more efficient answer to Lasker’s original design. Nearly 60 years later, little has changed about the fundamental design of the mechanical pump. Suffice to say that neither man, despite building their legacies on lactation, had ever breastfed a baby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once we were confronted with the appallingly outdated design of the breast pump, we started asking other parent friends about their experiences. One friend, an executive in Washington, described pumping in an airport bathroom in San Juan, P.R., holding the plastic funnels to her breast as women touched up their makeup and gave her dirty looks. The only electrical outlet was next to the sinks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another friend needed to pump during a conference call; she crossed her fingers that the client on the other line wouldn’t ask about the incessant and curious sound in the background. The noise isn’t the suction, as one might expect, but the motor. Our half-ton hybrid car is quieter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another friend commented on the transparent plastic funnels: What product designer actually thought I would want to see my nipples getting sucked into small tubes over and over again? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We believe that all mothers deserve a better, more dignifying breast pump. It’s a critical, daily tool for the working mother and a no brainer investment for early childhood health (thus, the federal government subsidizing its use at such a significant level). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And beyond the health benefits of a better breast pump, there is a lot of money to be made by the company that attempts to really understand what would make the lives of working mothers easier and more pleasant. One pregnant friend put it in stark relief, “There were approximately one zillion different kinds of baby carriers to choose from when I was registering, but breast pumps? About three, and none of them looked significantly different from one another.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are reminded of Gloria Steinem’s “If Men Could Menstruate,” an article published in Ms. Magazine in 1978, in which she used satire to point out how different the world would be if gender roles were reversed: “Men would brag about how long and how much.” If men could breastfeed, surely the breast pump would be as elegant as an iPhone and quiet as a Prius by now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s high time someone redesigned the breast pump. There’s dignity to be regained and a whole lot of money to be made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Courtney Martin is the author of multiple books, including “Do It Anyway: The New Generation of Activists.” John Cary is the author of “The Power of Pro Bono.” They are partners in life and in work.\n", "answers": ["It might not be the first thing that comes to mind after the word \"hackathon,\" but organizers of an upcoming one at MIT say the world is long overdue for a better breast pump. Engineers, designers, moms, and health experts will gather later this month for reasons spelled out by organizers at their website: \"The motor is loud. There are too many parts. They are hard to clean. You can’t lay down and pump. There is no good space to pump. It’s hard to keep track of what you pump. Your colleagues think pumping is weird. People are skeeved out by breastmilk. People are embarrassed by breasts.\" The Sept. 20-21 hackathon is an offshoot of a smaller brainstorming session in May that was in itself prompted by this article in the New York Times lamenting the baffling lack of progress on breast pumps. By and large, they remain complicated and sometimes painful. It's about time, writes Melissa Malamut at Boston Magazine. \"Let’s not forget that you just pushed a baby out of your body. You’d think that would be the hardest part of being a new mom. But no, then you also have to deal with the annoyances of pumping.\" Business Insider calls it \"one of the biggest issues for working mothers,\" and NBC News notes that half of all new mothers breastfeed for six months, meaning that most require pumps for at least parts of that stretch. The public health benefits of breastfeeding are \"huge,\" say organizers, making the current pump designs all the more frustrating. Hackathon participants will split into teams and pitch prototypes at the end of the session.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior administration official told CBS News, \"Mr. Snowden's claim that he is focused on supporting transparency, freedom of the press and protection of individual rights and democracy is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen: China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador. His failure to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the U.S., not to advance internet freedom and free speech.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowden gave documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers disclosing U.S. surveillance programs that collect vast amounts of phone records and online data in the name of foreign intelligence, often sweeping up information on American citizens. Officials have the ability to collect phone and Internet information broadly, but need a warrant to examine specific cases where they believe terrorism is involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowden had been in hiding for several weeks in Hong Kong, a former British colony with a high degree of autonomy from mainland China. The United States formally sought Snowden's extradition from Hong Kong to face espionage charges but was rebuffed; Hong Kong officials said the U.S. request did not fully comply with its laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Justice Department rejected that claim, saying its request met all of the requirements of the extradition treaty between the U.S. and Hong Kong. During conversations last week, including a phone call Wednesday between Attorney General Eric Holder and Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong officials never raised any issues regarding sufficiency of the U.S. request, a Justice representative said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States was in touch through diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries that Snowden could travel through or to, reminding them that Snowden is wanted on criminal charges and reiterating Washington's position that Snowden should only be permitted to travel back to the U.S., a State Department official said. Snowden's U.S. passport has been revoked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An unidentified Aeroflot airline official was cited by Russia's state ITAR-Tass news agency and Interfax as saying Snowden was on the plane that landed Sunday afternoon in Moscow. The Russian report said Snowden intended to fly to Cuba on Monday and then on to Caracas, Venezuela. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House was hoping to stop Snowden before he left Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the United States is likely to have problems interrupting Snowden's passage. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but does with Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador. Even with an extradition agreement though, any country could give Snowden a political exemption. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The likelihood that any of these countries would stop Snowden from traveling on to Ecuador seemed remote. While diplomatic tensions have thawed in recent years, Cuba and the United States are hardly allies after a half-century of distrust. Another country that could see Snowden pass through, Venezuela, could prove difficult, as well. Former President Hugo Chavez was a sworn enemy of the United States and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, earlier this year called President Obama the \"grand chief of devils.\" The two countries do not exchange ambassadors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowden's options aren't numerous, said Assange's lawyer, Michael Ratner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You have to have a country that's going to stand up to the United States,\" Ratner said. \"You're not talking about a huge range of countries here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also wasn't clear Snowden was finished disclosing highly classified information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowden has perhaps more than 200 sensitive documents, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\nPassage 2:\nThe Chinese government was pleased that Mr. Snowden disclosed the extent of American surveillance of Internet and telephone conversations around the world, giving the Chinese people a chance to talk about what they describe as American hypocrisy regarding surveillance practices, said Mr. Jin and the person familiar with the consultations between Hong Kong and China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the longer term, China’s overall relationship with the United States, which spans global economic, military and security issues, was more important than the feelings of the public in China and Hong Kong, who felt that the contractor should be protected from the reach of the United States, analysts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mainland Chinese officials “will be relieved he’s gone — the popular sentiment in Hong Kong and China is to protect him because he revealed United States surveillance here, but the governments don’t want trouble in the relationship,” said the person familiar with the consultations between Beijing and Hong Kong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Snowden went public in Hong Kong on June 9, the day after the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi ended, as the source of a series of disclosures in the British newspaper The Guardian and The Washington Post about classified national security programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stream of information about the extent of American worldwide eavesdropping shifted the focus in the public sniping between the Obama administration and China over cybersecurity that had been unfolding for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a series of speeches, senior officials in the Obama administration, including the national security adviser, Tom Donilon, and the defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, had taken the offensive against China, publicly accusing it of cyberespionage against American businesses. Mr. Donilon said in a speech in March that China was responsible for theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through digital intrusions on an “unprecedented scale.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to those accusations, China said that it was the victim of cyberattacks from the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Snowden’s disclosures appeared to confirm the Chinese government’s argument, and put the United States on the defensive. The highly classified documents that Mr. Snowden gave to the two newspapers showed that the N.S.A. compiled logs of virtually all telephone calls in the United States and collected the e-mail of foreigners from American Internet companies.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Snowden has denied giving China classified documents and said he had spoken only to journalists. But his public statements, directly and to reporters, have contained intelligence information of great interest to China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Western intelligence experts, who worked for major government spy agencies, said they believed that the Chinese government had managed to drain the contents of the four laptops that Mr. Snowden said he brought to Hong Kong, and that he said were with him during his stay at a Hong Kong hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If that were the case, they said, China would no longer need or want to have Mr. Snowden remain in Hong Kong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The disclosures by Mr. Snowden set off a surge of commentary against American “double faced” and “arrogant” behavior by many users of China’s version of Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some instances, the Chinese news media made snide references to what it called the gap between how the United States portrayed itself, and what the United States practiced. “Washington must be grinding its teeth because Snowden’s revelations have almost overturned the image of the U.S. as the defender of a free Internet,” Global Times, which often reflects the official point of view, wrote in an editorial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The precise details of how the Chinese government dealt with Hong Kong authorities were not immediately known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Beijing appears to have decided that weeks of focus on Mr. Snowden in Hong Kong and his disclosures about the American government’s global surveillance practices were enough, and that he could turn into a liability, said a second person familiar with the handling of Mr. Snowden. “Beijing has gotten the most they can out of the Snowden situation,” that person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior diplomat familiar with the way the Chinese government works said just before the departure of Mr. Snowden became public that he believed that Beijing would do all it could to keep Mr. Snowden out of American hands. The Chinese public would be outraged if the contractor was extradited, put on trial and jailed, he said. At the same time, the Obama administration would put relentless pressure on Beijing to get Mr. Snowden, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I see the sun of Sunnylands disappearing into the snow of Snowden,” the diplomat said.\nPassage 3:\nThis weekend NSA whistleblower/leaker Edward Snowden left a government safe house in Hong Kong and flew to Moscow, where he then booked a flight to Cuba.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Edward Snowden, sought on espionage charges after bringing secret U.S. surveillance programs to light, receded still further into the shadows Monday as the United States strenuously called on Russia to turn him over for prosecution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowden, a former government contractor who has not been seen in public since he was said to have arrived in Moscow on Sunday after slipping out of Hong Kong, set off a flurry of diplomatic activity around the globe as frustrated U.S. officials tried to interrupt his flight to asylum.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After reporters and airline officials said Snowden failed to board a flight from Moscow to Havana on Monday afternoon as expected, the United States intensified its pressure on the countries suspected of offering him possible protection. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the United States believed Snowden was still in Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The episode, which began with embarrassing disclosures about American intelligence-gathering, has reverberated from China to South America. As Snowden stays one step ahead of U.S. law, countries large and small are exploiting the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to flout American will. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We continue to hope that the Russians will do the right thing,” Secretary of State John F.
