Maybe Mexicans are right and not we?\r\nLonya: I'm not sure. I'll think about it.\r\nLonya: Maybe what I object most to is the fact that they don't explicitly say it's reconstruction.

Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!\r\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\r\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\r\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\r\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!\r\nLaura: Thank you, Dennis.\nSummary: Laura is in Cuba at the moment. She has mixed feelings about Cuba. She's travelling with her companion. Cuba is expensive for tourists. She has to spend over 100€ on a daily basis.\n", "answers": ["Kirsten reminds Alex that the youth group meets this Friday at 7 pm and go bowling."], "length": 2797, "dataset": "samsum_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b2b3903cc4020eaef687c516d4a21297b9deb76c22bd7616"}

Will a possible Brexit affect your business?\r\nTony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I’m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\nSummary: Tony's business will be affected by Brexit and both her and Gloria will never understand why people voted for it. It will also affect Tony's holiday plans.

I'll get you a small basketful of cooking apples and a bigger one with different sorts of dessert apples. So happy they'll be put to good use:)\r\nSoph: That sounds a lot! Thank you.

Can you have it done somewhere?\r\nSoph: I think last year Oli and Natt took their whole apple harvest to some organic fruiter who's got a processing unit. And in exchange they received an adequate amount of juice.\r\nSamantha: So it wasn't juice from their own apples?\r\nSoph: As I understood it, no. But doesn't matter since it was an organic grower. And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.\r\nSamantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.\r\nSoph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you!

Is it ok if I get you the apples tomorrow morning?\r\nSoph: Nobody's home then but you can leave them on the terrace in the back.\r\nSoph: I still have your apple basket. The one Mike'd bought apples last week. I'll put it on the terrace for you.\r\nSamantha: So you've got it!  I thought I was missing one.

Iza'll have to return the mutual ticket that she bought for herself and her boyfriend who agreed to come back on Saturday morning.\nDialogue: Victoria: Do you know this website <file_other>?\nDaniel: Uhm, no, why? Looks dodgy for me\nLucas: Don't use it! It's a scam!\nVictoria: Oh my god, thanks! I was just about to buy tickets from them\nLucas: I did it once, I'm telling you, it's a scam - paid a lot of money, never saw the ticket or my money back\nVictoria: I'm looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons, but they're gone everywhere :( Thanks for the warning though\nVictoria: It was the only page that had them available - in good price. I also found some on Viagogo, have you heard about it?\nDaniel: Huh, I did. I had the same problem with Guns'n'Roses concert last year, there were only some tickets left on Viagogo and I bought two - it was a scam as well\nLucas: They have legit tickets sometimes, some of my friends used it before, but it's nothing sure. It didn't work for me\nPatricia: Yeah, I had a problem with Viagogo as well. I don't know how it works really, but I got scammed as well. Buying tickets from people on Facebook worked better for me\nVictoria: But how can I find them? It's really my last resort :(\nPatricia: Find the official event of the concert and ask around. Maybe some people can't come and they're already selling their tickets\nDaniel: It's risky as well, but I think it's better than some dodgy website. On Facebook you at least have the name of the person who's selling\nPatricia: It's also good when you can buy a ticket from someone who's from the same city - you can just meet and exchange\nLucas: Yeah, so someone won't wander off with your money!\nVictoria: Why it has to be so difficult? :(((\nVictoria: I'll try it out guys, thanks!\nLucas: Next time you can set a reminder\nVictoria: Oh, where?\nLucas: Every webpage has a reminder option. You give them your email address so they can contact you to let you know that the tickets are on sale\nVictoria: Thanks! This time I totally missed it, I was away, but I would never have thought that they'll be gone within an hour\nPatricia: An hour?! Wow, that's quick!\nPatricia: When I was buying tickets for Ed Sheeran I was refreshing the page 30 minute before it started\nDaniel: It is a pain, but I think it's a trend now - you buy tickets a year before the event, otherwise you're stuck with dodgy solutions\nVictoria: I'll let you know if I find some tickets, already posted in Facebook that I'm looking for two, at least one :)\nLucas: Good luck! Be careful though ;)\nSummary: Victoria is looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons' concert. They're officially sold out so she's browsing some dubious websites like Viagogo. Patricia, Lucas and Daniel warn her against doing it and they suggest looking for the tickets on Facebook. \nDialogue: Mark: Hey, sorry to be disturbing you.

I'll call you if I get the chance, but I really am ending late (which is why a text message would be better)\r\nMark: Look, if you don't manage to call me today, then you can call me tomorrow.

Just plan the resin brake accordingly since the resin front on the top will flow faster than the on the mold surface\r\nChris: so would shooting from the side keep it even top and bottom? Maybe thats my issue with pinholes sometimes\r\nJoel: Doubt it, it’s the flow mesh that makes the top flow faster.\r\nJoel:  Best way to test is small panels done on a piece of glass so you can see what’s going on\r\nChris: Im about out of my inter-laminar flow media and dont know where to get more, that seemed to help with the speed of fill.\r\nJoel: I’ve tested with several flow meshes but never any that go in between the layers. The blue mesh seems to flow about twice as fast as the green even though they look identical other than the color\r\nJoel: But it seems letting the flow go as slow as you can get away with without it kicking too early is better at eliminating pin holes. It seams that when the resin travels fast it’s more likely to leave tiny bits of air trapped\r\nChris: I had some woven glass stuff that was stiff and didnt distort, like a flow mesh but I got it from a guy and dont know where to get rolls of it\r\nChris: my epoxy is 1500cps mixed.... slow is an understatement\r\nJoel: Yeah you might wanna find something thinner\r\nChris: :)\nSummary: Joel has tested with several flow meshes and the blue one seems to flow about twice as fast as the green one.

This is the third one only this week!\nGina: Fortunately no one’s been injured. They stole a tv, two laptops and a bit of cash.\nMichael: What does the police say?\nGina: Nothing yet, they’re investigating.\nKate: I bet this is some kind of a gang.\nDaniel: A gang? \nKate: Well, no one can get a tv, laptops and all this stuff on their own.\nGina: Regardless, I think it’d be a good thing to organise a neighbourhood watch.\nMichael: Good thinking!\nDaniel: Definitely. I know a friend who did this with his neighbours and it worked out pretty great.\nKate: How did they organise it? Did they have a schedule?\nDaniel: Well, basically, they were patrolling the streets twice a day – during the day and in the evening, always in twos.\nGina: Could you please talk to your friend so they can help us organise it?\nDaniel: Sure, no problem.\nKate: I think that we can also organise a fundraising for CCTV.\nMichael: Hm, I’m not so sure people will be keen on this.

Three burglaries in a week is three too many in my opinion.\nGina: It’s not an easy case, but I think CCTV may help to catch them if not to scare them away.\nMichael: Hm, let’s wait until Saturday so we can speak to others. We can’t do anything without their approval.\nDaniel: I’d happily suggest organising the neighbourhood watch.\nSummary: There has been another burglary in the neighbourhood.

I photographed one shocking example of it and sent it to \"Architectural Review\" to be put on file. They were quite obliging, I must say.\r\nBarbie: <file_photo>\r\nBarbie: How did you discover these houses in the suburbs!?\r\nMoira: By accident. I went on a tour of the city in an open-top bus and had a glimpse of some from the top deck. Took snaps with their GPS location and came back. By taxi.\r\nBarbie: Splendid!!! If you have some more or less complete series of photos of singular objects with their GPS, we can assemble a portfolio and submit it to \"Architectural Review\".

I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.\r\nHaley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me.

You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.\r\nNick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother.

Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.\r\nNick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D\r\nHaley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.\r\nNick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P\nSummary: Nick and Hayley finished the game.
