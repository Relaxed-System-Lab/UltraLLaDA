{"input": "Passage:\nCostermonger\nCostermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables, in London and other British towns. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, and some are still found in markets. As usual with street-sellers, they would use a loud sing-song cry or chant to attract attention. The costermonger's cart might be stationary at a market stall, or mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow).  The term is derived from the words costard (a now extinct medieval variety of large, ribbed apple) and monger (seller).\n\nCosters met a need for rapid food distribution from the central markets (e.g., Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish). Their membership as a coster was signalled by their large neckerchief, known as a kingsman, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. \n\nThe term is now often used to describe hawkers in general;  sometimes a distinction is made between the two: a costermonger sells from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, while a hawker carries his wares in a basket.\n\nHistory\n\nCostermongers have existed in London since at least the 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe. They probably were most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their \"low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language\" (John Camden Hotten, The Slang Dictionary, 1859). Costers were notoriously competitive: respected \"elder statespeople\" in the costermonger community were elected as pearly kings and queens to keep the peace between rival costermongers. \n\nHowever, crimes such as theft were actually rare among costermongers themselves, especially in an open market where they tended to look out for one another. Even common thieves preferred to prey on shop owners rather than costers, who were inclined to dispense street justice. The costers' animosity towards the police was extreme:\n\nThe activities and lifestyles of 19th century costermongers are comprehensively documented in London Labour and the London Poor, a four volume collection of erudite and well-researched articles by Henry Mayhew. Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river: \n\nSuch was London in the 1840s; but by the end of the 19th century, the costermongers were in gradual decline. They did not disappear as mobile street-sellers until about 1960, when the few that remained took pitches in local markets. They were portrayed in the music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood and Gus Elen. In The Forsyte Saga, Swithin Forsyte is driving Irene Forsyte in his carriage through the streets of London in 1886 and a costermonger (the \"ruffian\") and his girlfriend are riding alongside in their donkey cart, which is overturned in traffic. The anti-hero of Look Back in Anger (1956) by playwright John Osborne is a coster who sells sweets from a stall. The film version depicts aspects of the everyday culture of street markets, such as racial prejudice, irate customers and abusive regulatory officials.\n\nCoster style\n\nBetty May spoke of the \"coster\" style and atmosphere in London around 1900 in her autobiography Tiger Woman: My Story in 1929: \"I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.\"May, Betty. (1929) Tiger Woman: My Story. (2014 reprint) London: Duckworth. ISBN 978-0715648551\n\nLegal standing\n\nThe costermonger's trade in London is subject to regulation by law, under the administration of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. If the pitch is stationary, by-laws of local councils also apply. Legislation exists under clause six of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867, which deals with obstruction by goods to pavements (sidewalks) and streets. There are various modern amendments.\nQuestion:\nWhat does a costermonger sell?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nBilly Cotton\nWilliam Edward \"Billy\" Cotton (6 May 1899 – 25 March 1969) was an English band leader and entertainer, one of the few whose orchestras survived the British dance band era. Cotton is now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s radio and television personality, but his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for Brentford F.C. (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon F.C.), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a Gipsy Moth, which he piloted himself. His autobiography, \"I Did It My Way\", was published in 1970, a year after his death.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Smith Square, London, to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a drummer. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers by falsifying his age and saw service in World War I in Malta and Egypt, before landing at Gallipoli in the middle of an artillery barrage. He was recommended for a commission and learned to fly Bristol Fighter aircraft. He flew solo for the first time in 1918, on the day the Royal Flying Corps became the Royal Air Force. He was not yet 19 years old. In the early 1920s, he worked at several jobs, including as a bus driver, before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.\n\nAt first a conventional dance band, the London Savannah Band gradually tended towards music hall/vaudeville entertainment, introducing visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians who played in Billy Cotton's band during the 1920s and 1930s included Arthur Rosebery, Syd Lipton and Nat Gonella. The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was \"Somebody Stole My Gal\", and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.\n\nDuring the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the Billy Cotton Band Show, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show.  It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of \"Wakey Wakey\". From 1957, it was also broadcast on BBC television. Cotton often also provided vocals on many of his bands recordings and was also a vocalist on recordings that didn't feature his band.\n\nAs a racing driver, his finest moment came in 1949 when he finished fourth in the 1949 British Grand Prix, sharing an ERA with David Hampshire.\n\nCotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921. They had two sons, Ted and Sir Bill Cotton, who later became the BBC's managing director of television. In 1962 Billy Cotton suffered a stroke. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at Wembley.\n\nBilly Cotton was the great-great-uncle of TV & Radio Presenter Fearne Cotton.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n* The First Mrs. Fraser (1932)\n* Variety (1935)\n\nBibliography\n\n* I Did It My Way, Autobiography, 1970, Publisher: George G.

It is part of the region of Attica. The regional unit covers the Saronic Islands, a small part of the Peloponnese peninsula, and a few islands off the eastern Peloponnese coast. \n\nAdministration\n\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Islands was created out of part of the former Piraeus Prefecture. It is subdivided into 8 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\n*Aegina (Aigina, 3)\n*Agistri (Agkistri, 2)\n*Cythera (Kythira, 6)\n*Hydra (Ydra, 13)\n*Poros (9)\n*Salamis (Salamina, 10)\n*Spetses (11)\n*Troizinia-Methana (12)\nQuestion:\nWhich country occupies the islands called Euboea, Kefalonia, Khos, Zakynthos, Thassos, Lefkada, Karpathos and Kythira?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nBallasalla\nBallasalla ()  is a village in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man, close to the airport and the town of Castletown. The village was built mostly from the ruins of the nearby Rushen Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and dissolved in the 16th century.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe lowest-level local authority is Malew Parish Commissioners who are based in Ballasalla.\n There are currently five commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk, Mr Barry Powell.\n The commissioners' offices are located on the main road of the village close to the Whitestone Inn.\n\nResidents' association\n\nThe village has an active residents' association, Ballasalla and District Residents Association (BADRA).\n\nSince 2010 the village has had a very popular Community Partnership set up with the involvement of the Isle of Man Government, outside agencies and local residents, with Graham Cregeen, MHK for Malew and Santon, as Chairman. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe HQ of Citywing, the Isle of Man airline, is at Hangar 9 at Isle of Man Airport near Ballasalla.  The former Manx Airlines also had its head office at the Airport.  At Balthane on the eastern edge of the village is an industrial estate with local businesses including Athol Garage, sellers of motor vehicles, and Pooil Vaaish, dealing in slate, marble and monumental masonry.\n\nEducation\n\nThe village has its own primary school, Ballasalla School. \n\nSport\n\nMalew football club play their home games at the Malew Football Ground, Clagh Vane and Ronaldsway play their home games at the Ronaldsway Aircraft Factory Fields. Both clubs compete in the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 3 buses an hour to Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin operated by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at the eastern side of the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle dock and goods sidings, seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.\n\nReligion\n\nSt Mark's Church is in St Mark's Road, some distance from the village. The foundation stone was laid in 1771 and it was consecrated in 1772 by the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, Mark Hildesley. It was intended to serve as a chapel of ease and a parish school more conveniently located for those from the outlying hill district than Kirk Malew Church. There was an ancient church near the site which is said to have been dedicated to St Mark.  \n\nSt Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway. The church was consecrated in 1896 and remains in regular use today, with its own substantial church hall within its grounds.\n Both churches are Church of England in the Diocese of Sodor and Man.\n\nBallasalla has had three Methodist chapels in the past. The original Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel dates from about 1798. It was restructured in 1846, although the original roof slate is still intact.  It is now a scout hall. Ballasalla (Bridge Road) Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1833. It closed as a chapel in 1949, but continued to be used as a Sunday school until 1975. It was sold in 1980 and the seats, pulpit and choir pews were moved to Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A second Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1893. It closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1981 as the building was unsafe. \n\nAmenities and events\n\nBallasalla is the site of the mediaeval Monks' Bridge over the Silver Burn which leads to the Manx National Heritage site of Rushen Abbey; this forms part of the Story Of Mann set of attractions established in 1989 and now part of an island-wide series of attractions. The abbey was extensively redeveloped as a heritage site in 1996, having latterly been home to The Academy, one of very few nightclubs outside of Douglas.\n\nAlso near the village is the Silverdale Glen, set amongst woodland, with a small boating lake, café and sprawling playing fields and playground including a water-powered carousel. A wooded footpath alongside the Silverburn river runs between Rushen Abbey, the Monks' Bridge, and Silverdale Glen. In a small hamlet above the village the eponymous St Mark's Fair is held annually on the third Saturday in July.\n The Millennium Way long distance footpath, opened in 1979, which begins at Castle Rushen and heads north towards Ramsey, runs through the village alongside the banks of the river, leading to Poulsom Park in Castletown to the south, and to St. Mark's above the village to the north. \n\nThe village has a pub and various shops. The local authority Malew Parish Commissioners office is next to the pub and a modern office development, Portland Court, occupies former railway goods yard. This was sold off in 1985 for redevelopment and the new station lies on the opposite side of the tracks.\nQuestion:\nBallasalla and Colby are railway stations on which British island?\nAnswer:\nMan Island\nPassage:\nArnolfini\nThe Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol, England. It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist's performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. Arnolfini is funded by Bristol City Council and Arts Council England, with some corporate and individual supporters.\n\nThe gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was originally located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol's waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck's 15th-century painting, The Arnolfini Portrait. Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nHistory\n\nJeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.   \n\nThe architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstital floors. \n\nOriginally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999),  Caroline Collier (1999–2005)  and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).\n\nAs part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005,  \nthe old warehouse has been fully redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs.  One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill.   The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie. \n\nName\n\nThe Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.\n\nToday\n\nArnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a specialist arts bookshop, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a café bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois.  Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.\n\nThere is an active access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license. \n \nArnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the Encounters Short Film Festival (along with the Watershed Media Centre),  Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema,  the biennial  Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue  and the Bristol Artists Book Events.  In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nArnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England,  and Bristol City Council.  According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2009, Arnolfini had 398,000 visitors in 2008/2009. Income was £2.08 million and expenditure was £2.4 million  and the gallery employed 44 people.\nQuestion:\nThe Arnolfini Centre for Contemporary Arts is in which British city?\nAnswer:\nBristol (England)\nPassage:\nHeadlands and bays\nHeadlands and bays are two related features of coastal environments. Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either seawater (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the bay, and typically have sandy beaches. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast. \n\nGeology and geography \n\nBays form where weak, or less resistant rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger, or more resistant rocks, such as chalk, limestone, and granite), which form a headland or peninsula. Refraction of waves occurs on headlands concentrating wave energy on them, so many other landforms, such as caves, natural arches, and stacks, form on headlands. Wave energy is directed at right angles to the wave crest, and lines drawn at right angles to the wave crest (orthogonals) represent the direction of energy expenditure. Orthogonals converge on headlands and diverge in bays, which concentrates wave energy on the headlands and dissipates wave energy in the bays.  \n\nIn the formation of sea cliffs, wave erosion undercuts the slopes at the shoreline, which retreat landward. This increases the shear stress in the cliff-forming material and accelerates mass movement. The debris from these landslides collects at the base of the cliff and is also removed by the waves, usually during storms, when wave energy is greatest. This debris provides sediment, which is transported through longshore current for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.  \n\nWave refraction disperses wave energy through the bay, and along with the sheltering effect of the headlands this protects bays from storms. This effect means that the waves reaching the shore in a bay are weaker than the waves reaching the headland, and the bay is thus a safer place for water activities like surfing or swimming. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out. But then the same process starts all over again.\n\nBeach stability \n\nBeaches are dynamic geologic features that can fluctuate between advancement and retreat of sediment.  The natural agents of fluctuation include waves, tides, currents, and winds. Man-made elements such as the interruption of sediment supply, such as a dam, and withdrawal of fluid can also affect beach stabilization.   A headland bay beach can be classified as being in three different states of sedimentation.  Static equilibrium refers to a beach that is stable and does not experience littoral drift or sediment deposition or erosion.   Waves generally diffract around the headland(s) and near the beach when the beach is in a state of static equilibrium.  Dynamic equilibrium occurs when the beach sediments are deposited and eroded at approximately equal rates.  Beaches that have dynamic equilibrium are usually near a river that supplies sediment and would otherwise erode away without the river supply.  Unstable beaches are usually a result of human interaction, such as a breakwater or dammed river.  Unstable beaches are reshaped by continual erosion or deposition and will continue to erode or deposit until a state of equilibrium is reached in the bay.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat do you call a piece of land that is surrounded on three sides by water?\nAnswer:\nPenninsula\n", "answers": ["Fruiting", "Friut", "Fruiting Shrubs", "Prutas", "Bacca", "Nutritious fruits", "Simple fruit", "Culture of fruits", "Fruits", "Fleshy fruit", "Seed pod", "Pod types", "Fruit", "Fruity"], "length": 3953, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a6b0e6b9bf53f05d1569572cebd9359a0d4136a026613c7d"}

This cocktail originated in Venice, Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948    by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini. \n\nThe drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar, a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Orson Welles. Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach purée to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.\n\nThe Bellini is an IBA Official Cocktail. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach purée with an equal amount of mandarin juice, a Rossini, which uses strawberry purée, or a Tintoretto, which is made with pomegranate juice.\n\nPreparation and serving\n\nThe Bellini consists of puréed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition. The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or cherry juice to give the drink a pink glow. Due, in part, to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.\n\nCalifornia produces a white peach that works well,  and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured liqueurs (peach schnapps, for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach purée.\n\nThe Cipriani family produces Bellini Base  for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.\n\nOther sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or seltzer is used in place of the wine.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit juice is added to champagne to make a Bellini cocktail?\nAnswer:\nPeacherine\nPassage:\nGlobus cruciger\nThe globus cruciger (Latin, \"cross-bearing orb\"), also known as the orb and cross, an orb (Latin globus) topped (Latin gerere, to wear) by a cross (Latin crux), has been a Christian symbol of authority since the Middle Ages, used on coins, in iconography, and with the sceptre as royal regalia. The cross represents Christ's dominion over the orb of the world, literally held in the hand of an earthly ruler (or sometimes it is held by an angel). In the iconography of Western art, when Christ himself holds the globe, he is called Salvator Mundi, the Saviour of the World; his statue is the Infant Jesus of Prague.\n\nHistory\n\nHolding the world in one's hand, or more ominously, under one's foot, has been used as a symbol since antiquity. To citizens of the Roman Empire, the plain round globe held by Jupiter represented the world, or the universe, as the dominion held by the emperor. A 2nd-century coin from the reign of Emperor Hadrian shows the Roman goddess Salus with her foot upon a globus, and a 4th-century coin from the reign of Emperor Constantine I shows her with a globus in hand.  The orbis terrarum was central to the iconography of the Tetrarchy, representing the Tetrarchs' restoration of security to the Roman world. Constantine I claimed to have had a vision of a cross above the sun, with the words \"In this sign, you shall conquer\", at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. His soldiers painted crosses upon their shields, and then defeated their foe, Maxentius.\n\nWith the growth of Christianity in the 5th century, the orb (in Latin scriptures orbis terrarum, the 'world of the lands', hence the word \"orb\") was topped with a cross (hence globus cruciger), symbolising the Christian God's dominion over the world. The emperor held the world in his hand, to show that he ruled it on God's behalf. To non-Christians already familiar with the pagan globe, the surmounting of a cross sent a message about the triumph of Christianity. In medieval iconography, an object's size, relative to that of nearby objects, indicated its relative importance; so the world was small and the one who held it was  large, to emphasize the nature of their relationship. Although the globe symbolized the entire Earth, its use spread among many Christian rulers (some of them not even sovereign) who reigned over small parts of the earth.\n\nThe first known use was probably in the early 5th century, possibly as early as between 395 and 408 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Arcadius, but most certainly by 423 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Theodosius II.\n\nThe globus cruciger was used by powerful rulers and celestial beings alike; it adorned portrayals of both emperors and kings, as well as archangels. It first appeared on coins in the early 5th century and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages in coins, iconography, and royal regalia. The papacy, holding universal canonical jurisdiction and in the Middle Ages once rivaling the Holy Roman Emperor for the supreme feudal status of liege lord of all other (Catholic) rulers, also maintained the symbol on top of the papal tiara (\"triple crown\"; there is no separate papal orb). The crowned orb was in general use as a finial on western royal crowns, whether actual objects or merely heraldic crowns, all over Europe, for example, in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Imperial Germany, among others.  It may still be seen in the national arms of the surviving European monarchies.  Even in the modern era in England, the Sovereign's Orb symbolises both the state and Church of England under the protection and domain of the royal crown.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:RV Antoniniano Carinus - transparent background.PNG|A Roman Antoninianus coin showing Carinus holding pilum and globe.\nImage:Barbarossa.jpg|Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.\nImage:Harris-Tweed 1.jpg|The Harris Tweed Orb\nImage:Goldene-bulle 1c-480x475.jpg|The Golden Bull of 1356 by the Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nImage:Kis Karoly TK.jpg|Charles II of Hungary.\nImage:Mária Thuróczy.jpg|Mary of Hungary.\nImage:Wenzel3.jpg|Wenceslaus III of Bohemia.\nImage:Dürer karl der grosse.jpg|Charlemagne, by Albrecht Dürer.\nImage:Albrecht Dürer 082.jpg|Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, by Albrecht Dürer.\nImage:Gerard van Honthorst 006.jpg|Frederick V holding the orb.\nImage:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|Elizabeth I of England in coronation robes and the orb and scepter\nImage:Wien - Schatzkammer - Orb.png|Austrian globus cruciger, part of the Austrian Crown Jewels\nImage:Russian regalia.jpg|Regalia of Russia.\nImage:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|Holy Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary.\nImage:IconaDerzhavnaya.jpg|Virgin Mary with an orb on Our Lady Derzhavnaya icon\nFile:Heraldic Globus cruciger.svg|A generic globus cruciger as it may be used in heraldry\nImage:Uppland_vapen.svg|Coat of arms of Uppland\nImage:Coat of arms of Montenegro.svg|Orb and scepter in Montenegrin coat of arms\nQuestion:\nWhich British fabric has an ‘Orb’ trade mark?\nAnswer:\nHarris Tweed\nPassage:\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls\nGemini Reality Star#10\nAbout\nEnglish adventurer and star of the reality series Man vs. Wild.

It is broadcast on ITV and hosted by Julia Bradbury.\n\nThe show began airing on 22 July 2013 for a 30-episode run  as a summer replacement for The Chase and finished on 30 August 2013.\n\nFormat\n\nThe show consists of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many hourglasses from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other with the aim of answering as many questions correctly as possible.\n\nMain round\n\nAt the start a question is posed to the player on the far left of the studio, The contestant can choose to Stick or Twist, depending on whether they think they know the answer or not. If they decide to Stick, they will answer the question themselves, however if they decide to Twist, they choose which of the other players will answer the question. Whichever option they choose, the three options to the question will then appear. If a player sticks and answers correctly, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, control passes to the next player in the line. If they Twist and the player the question is passed to gets the answer correct, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, the player who chose to Twist gets to light a Twister instead. Once the sixth Twister is lit, the player in control gets to 'Take on the Twisters' to bank some money. They face 60 seconds of quick-fire general knowledge questions, with the idea to keep as many of the Twisters in play as possible. Once the time is up, the values of the Twisters remaining in play are revealed and the total amount of money is placed in the contestant's bank. This is repeated 4 times each show.\n\nFinal Twist\n\nThe contestant who has banked the highest amount of cash from the main round goes through to play the \"The Final Twist\" where they can win whatever they have banked in the main game. In this round, all 8 Twisters are in play and the idea is to keep as many of them in play as possible after 60 seconds of quick-fire questions. When the time is up, Julia will offer £200 (£250 in later episodes) for each Twister that remains in play, for example if the player has 5 Twisters in play, £1000 (£1250 under the £250 a Twister rule) will be offered. The contestant's money has been placed behind one of the Twisters by an independent adjudicator. One by one, the Twisters in play are revealed to determine whether the money is there. If it is not there, a red \"X\" will appear on the display, but if the money is there, a gold \"WIN\" will appear.\n\nThe Twisters\n\nThere are eight \"Twisters\" in the show. The colours are red, yellow, blue, orange, green, pink, white and purple, each worth different amounts of cash ranging from £300 to £1,000. The Twisters containing more cash will drain more quickly. If the values of all eight Twisters are revealed, then their amounts are worth double and will remain doubled for the rest of the game.\nQuestion:\nWho presents the ITV quiz show ‘Take on the Twisters’?\nAnswer:\nJULIA BRADBURY\nPassage:\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam ...\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam-Webster\nFirst Known Use of rogue elephant\n1835\nSeen and Heard\nWhat made you want to look up rogue elephant?

There are many scleroprotein superfamilies including keratin, collagen, elastin, and fibroin. The roles of such proteins include protection and support, forming connective tissue, tendons, bone matrices, and muscle fiber.\n\nBiomolecular structure\n\nA scleroprotein forms long protein filaments, which are shaped like rods or wires. Scleroproteins are structural proteins or storage proteins that are typically inert and water-insoluble. A scleroprotein occurs as an aggregate due to hydrophobic side chains that protrude from the molecule.\n\nA scleroprotein's peptide sequence often has limited residues with repeats; these can form unusual secondary structures, such as a collagen helix. The structures often feature cross-links between chains (e.g., cys-cys disulfide bonds between keratin chains).\n\nScleroproteins tend not to denature as easily as globular proteins.\n\nMiroshnikov et al. (1998) are among the researchers who have attempted to synthesize fibrous proteins.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, what is the name of the fibrous protein found in the outer layer of the skin and is a major constituent of hair and nails?\nAnswer:\nKeratin\n", "answers": ["Gordon Jackson (disambiguation)", "GORDON JACKSON", "Gordon Jackson", "Jackson, Gordon"], "length": 2682, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2a54de979ab1eec474e0411cd269f9600f54b1557608a94f"}

He played the role of Lockhart in these series from 1956 to 1967, and the character was one of the first recurring television detectives.\n\nBorn in London, his first listed television role was as Dr. Watson alongside Alan Wheatley's Holmes in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the tales. He later reprised the role in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nHis distinguished appearance often led to roles as senior policemen, military men and English aristocracy; he played such parts in series including Dickens of London, Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Cedar Tree, Tales of the Unexpected, After Julius, Drummonds, the first Joan Hickson Miss Marple episode \"The Body in the Library\" as Sir Henry Clithering, and his final appearance was in a 1987 Ruth Rendell Mysteries adaptation.\n\nHe was also a noted stage actor and made several appearances in films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky.

Blue Swede released two albums of cover versions, including a rendition of  \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which brought them international chart success.  The band consisted of Anders Berglund (piano), Björn Skifs (lead vocals), Bosse Liljedahl (bass), Hinke Ekestubbe (saxophone), Jan Guldbäck (drums), Michael Areklew (guitar) and Tommy Berglund (trumpet).  They disbanded after Skifs decided to embark on his solo career.\n\nCareer\n\nBlue Swede was first formed in 1973, when Björn Skifs, a top vocalist in Sweden, was looking for a band to accompany him during his concerts. \nThe band was originally called \"Blåblus\" (Swedish for \"blue blouse\" or \"blue jeans\", a pun on the word \"blues\" ) and featured Skifs singing the lead vocals. The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 B. J. Thomas song \"Hooked on a Feeling.\" Blue Swede recorded Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the \"ooga-chaka ooga-chaka\" introduction. Blue Swede released \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, where it reached a peak chart position of 26. To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released an album of the same name that same year.\n\nThroughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same album were released: \"Silly Milly\", which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of The Association's \"Never My Love\", which made the Top Ten by peaking at position 7. From the band's 1975 follow-up album, Out of the Blue, they recorded a medley of \"Hush\" by Deep Purple and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies' song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S, and achieving its greatest chart success in Scandinavia.\n\nIn 2014, the band's single \"Hooked on a Feeling\" featured prominently in the film Guardians of the Galaxy. Prior to the film's release, the song's appearance in a trailer resulted in a significant spike in sales.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n*Hooked on a Feeling (1974)\n*Out of the Blue (1975)\n\nSingles\n\n*\"Hooked on a Feeling\" (1974) U.S. #1\n*\"Silly Milly\" (1974) U.S. #71\n*\"Never My Love\" (1974) U.S. #7\n*\"Hush/I'm Alive\" (1975) U.S. #61\nQuestion:\nWhat was the Blue Swede's only No 1 hit?\nAnswer:\nHooked On A Feeling\nPassage:\nThe Fallen Madonna\nThe Fallen Madonna, usually referred to as The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies,   by the fictional painter van Klomp is a portrait of a bare breasted woman, which provides a running gag in the BBC1 television comedy series 'Allo 'Allo! (1982–92), written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, as well as The Cracked Vase with the Big Daisies by real artist Vincent van Gogh. The first episode of the first series of 'Allo 'Allo! (1984), following the pilot, was titled The Fallen Madonna.  In an earlier pilot the painting was referred to as the reclining Madonna.\n\nRecurring theme\n\nAllo 'Allo! was set in the French town of Nouvion during the German occupation of the Second World War. Its focus was a café in the town square run by René Artois (played by Gorden Kaye). There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the Fallen Madonna, a local treasure, to provide a nest egg after the war. Among those who coveted it were the local German commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and the Führer Adolf Hitler himself on whose behalf Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) of the Gestapo was instructed to secure it (but secretly wanted it for himself).\n\nIn the end of the \" Allo Allo\" series the Fallen Madonna is found by a Senior Rene Artois and his Mistress Yvette Carte Blanche they quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live a very happily ever after.  \n\nThe painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long knackwurst sausage. Forgeries were also in evidence.\n\nAn incredible number of forgeries of the Fallen Madonna were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur LeClerc, which were hidden in knackwurst sausages in René's kitchen. The forgeries were subsequently destroyed in various ways (burned, blown up, minced, eaten by a dog, etc.).\n\nLord Bath\n\nFollowing his assistance with an event connected with the programme, the BBC presented the 6th Marquess of Bath with a specially commissioned copy of the Fallen Madonna that was hung alongside Old Masters in Bath's ancestral home, Longleat.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the artist who painted the picture of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies as featured in TV series Allo Allo?\nAnswer:\nVan klomp\nPassage:\nBellis perennis\nBellis perennis is a common European species of daisy, of the Asteraceae family, often considered the archetypal species of that name.\n\nMany related plants also share the name \"daisy\", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy. Historically, it has also been commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys (woundworts)). Bellis perennis is native to western, central and northern Europe, but widely naturalised in most temperate regions including the Americas   and Australasia.\n\nDescription\n\nIt is an herbaceous perennial plant with short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 3/4 to 2 inches (approx. 2–5 cm) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing - hence the term 'lawn daisy'. Wherever it appears it is often considered an invasive weed. \n\nThe flowerheads are composite, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers about 3/4 to 1-1/4 in (approx. 2–3 cm) in diameter, with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on single leafless stems 3/4 - 4 in (approx. 2–10 cm), rarely 6 in (approx. 15 cm) tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as \"phyllaries\".\n\nCultivation\n\nB. perennis generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal conditions, they have a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters.  \n\nIt can generally be grown in USDA Zones 4 - 8 (i.e. where minimum temperatures are above ) in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires low or no maintenance. It has no known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained soils. The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after flowering. \n\nThough invasive, the species is still considered a valuable ground cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as well as spring meadows where low growth and some color is desired in parallel with minimal care and maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised).\n\nNumerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or spherical blooms in a range of sizes (1 cm to 6 cm) and colours (red, pink & white).  They are generally grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in Spring.  The cultivar 'Tasso series' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nEtymology\n\nBellis is Latin for \"pretty\" and perennis is Latin for \"everlasting\".\n\nThe name \"daisy\" is considered a corruption of \"day's eye\",  because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. Chaucer called it \"eye of the day\". In Medieval times, Bellis perennis or the English Daisy was commonly known as \"Mary's Rose\". \n\nThe English Daisy is also considered to be a flower of children and innocence. \n\nDaisy is used as a girl's name and as a nickname for girls named Margaret, after the French name for the oxeye daisy, marguerite.\n\nUses\n\nCulinary\n\nThis daisy may be used as a potherb. Young leaves can be eaten raw in salads   or cooked, noting that the leaves become increasingly astringent with age. Flower buds and petals can be eaten raw in sandwiches, soups and salads. It is also used as a tea and as a vitamin supplement.\n\nHerbal medicine\n\nBellis perennis has astringent properties and has been used in herbal medicine.  In ancient Rome, the surgeons who accompanied Roman legions into battle would order their slaves to pick sacks full of daisies in order to extract their juice, hence the origin of this plant's scientific name in Latin. Bandages were soaked in this juice and would then be used to bind sword and spear cuts.\n\nBellis perennis is still used in homeopathy for wounds and after certain surgical procedures,  as well as for blunt trauma in animals.   Typically, the plant is harvested while in flower when intended for use in homeopathy.\n\nBellis perennis flowers have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea (or the leaves as a salad) for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. \n\nOther uses\n\nDaisies have traditionally been used for making daisy chains in children's games. \n\nFile:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Daisies (1894).jpg|Daisies by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1894)\nFile:Maude Goodmann The daisy chain.jpg|The daisy chain by Maude Goodman (1936)\nQuestion:\nBellis perennis is the Latin name of which common flower?\nAnswer:\nDaisy (film)\nPassage:\nLonesome George\nLonesome George (c. 1910 – June 24, 2012) was a male Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii) and the last known individual of the subspecies.     In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George serves as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Galápagos Islands and throughout the world. \n\nDiscovery\n\nGeorge was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 November 1971 by Hungarian malacologist József Vágvölgyi. The island's vegetation had been devastated by introduced feral goats, and the indigenous C. n. abingdonii population had been reduced to a single individual. It is thought that he was named after a character played by American actor George Gobel.  Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, it was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world’s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Española male in San Diego. George was then penned with two females of a different subspecies. Although eggs were produced, none hatched. Unfortunately, no other Pinta tortoises were found. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct as George was in captivity.\n\nMating attempts\n\nOver the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George had been unsuccessful, due to the lack of females of his own subspecies. This prompted researchers at the Darwin Station to offer a $10,000 reward for a suitable mate.\n\nUntil January 2011, George was penned with two females of the subspecies Chelonoidis nigra becki (from the Wolf Volcano region of Isabela Island), in the hope his genotype would be retained in any resulting progeny. This subspecies was then thought to be genetically closest to George's; however, any potential offspring would have been intergrades, not purebreds of the Pinta subspecies. \n\nIn July 2008, George mated with one of his female companions. Thirteen eggs were collected and placed in incubators.  On 11 November 2008, the Charles Darwin Foundation reported 80% of the eggs showed weight loss characteristic of being inviable.  By December 2008, the remaining eggs had failed to hatch and x-rays showed they were inviable. \n\nOn 23 July 2009, exactly one year after announcing George had mated, the Galápagos National Park announced one of George's female companions had laid a second clutch of five eggs.  The park authority expressed its hope for the second clutch of eggs, which it said were in perfect condition.  The eggs were moved to an incubator, but on 16 December, it was announced the incubation period had ended and the eggs were inviable (as was a third batch of six eggs laid by the other female). \n\nIn November 1999, scientists reported Lonesome George was \"very closely related to tortoises\" from Española Island (C. n. hoodensis) and San Cristóbal Island (C. n. chathamensis).  On 20 January 2011, two individual C. n. hoodensis female partners were imported to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where George lived. \n\nDeath\n\n \nOn 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Edwin Naula, Director of the Galápagos National Park, announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena.     Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life cycle of a tortoise. A necropsy confirmed that he died of \"old age\".  The body of Lonesome George was frozen and shipped to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to be preserved by taxidermists.  The preservation work was carried out by the museum's taxidermist George Dante, with input from scientists. \n\nAfter a short display at the museum, it was expected that Lonesome George would be returned to the Galápagos and will be displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see.  However, a dispute has broken out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galapagos Islands over where the preserved body of a Galapagos giant tortoise should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wants him to be shown in the capital Quito but the Galapagos local mayor says Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home. \nMost sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old,  though others such as David Attenborough said he was probably in his eighties or possibly even younger.  Even one hundred is not especially old for a Galápagos tortoise.\n\nBiological conservation\n\nIn November 2012, in the journal Biological Conservation, researchers reported identifying 17 tortoises that are partially descended from the same subspecies as Lonesome George, leading them to speculate that related purebred individuals of that subspecies may still be alive. \n\nIn December 2015 it was reported that the discovery of another species (Chelonoidis donfaustoi) by Yale researchers had a 90% DNA match to that of the Pinta tortoise and that scientists believe this could possibly be used to resurrect the species.\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of creature was Lonesome George who died on Pinta Island in the Galapagos in 2012?\nAnswer:\nTortoise\n", "answers": ["Open back banjo", "Fingerpicking banjo", "Tenor banjo", "Electric banjo", "Banjer", "Five-string banjo", "Stealth Banjo", "Banjos", "Tenor Banjo", "Classic banjo", "Banjo string", "Banjo", "5-string banjo"], "length": 2992, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4eea3cbcc28d2e2b3588987ce428800a798ba798e2eb6f5d"}
{"input": "Passage:\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nGoogle\nAugustus: Birth and Inheritance\nOf Augustus’ many names and honorifics, historians favor three of them, each for a different phase in the emperor’s life. From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar’s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar’s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself—as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor's greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month's length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.\nOctavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle—an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.\nAugustus: The Path to Power\nThe 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar’s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler’s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian’s troops defeated Antony’s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome’s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian’s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate’s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony’s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian’s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony’s ships. Cleopatra’s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome’s undisputed ruler.\nAugustus: Emperor in All but Name\nHistorians date the start of Octavian’s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra’s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome’s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back—at least on the surface—to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.\nDuring his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire’s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).\nAugustus: Family and Succession\nAugustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony’s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons—Tiberius and Drusus—by her first husband, Mark Antony’s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.\nAugustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, “I found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,” but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.” Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.\nTags\nQuestion:\nWho was the first emperor of Rome?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCostard\nCostard is a comic figure in the play Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare.

{"input": "Passage:\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nBy Robert McNamara\nUpdated November 21, 2016.\nCharles Darwin published On the Origin of Species on November 24, 1859 and forever changed the way humans think about science. It's not an exaggeration to say that Darwin's landmark work became one of the most influential books in history.\nDecades earlier, the British naturalist and scholar had spent five years sailing around the world aboard a research ship, H.M.S. Beagle . After returning to England, Darwin spent years in quiet study, examining plant and animal specimens.\nThe ideas he expressed in his classic book in 1859 did not occur to him as sudden bursts of inspiration, but were developed over a period of decades.\nResearch Led Darwin to Write\nAt the end of the Beagle voyage, Darwin arrived back in England on October 2, 1836. After greeting friends and family he distributed to scholarly colleagues a number of specimens he had collected during the expedition around the world. Consultations with an ornithologist confirmed that Darwin had discovered several species of birds, and the young naturalist became fascinated with the idea that some species seemed to have replaced other species.\ncontinue reading below our video\nProfile of Charles Darwin\nAs Darwin began to realize that species change, he wondered how that happened.\nThe summer after returning to England, in July 1837, Darwin began a new notebook and took to writing down his thoughts on transmutation, or the concept of one species transforming into another. For the next two years Darwin essentially argued with himself in his notebook, testing out ideas.\nMalthus Inspired Charles Darwin\nIn October 1838 Darwin re-read Essay on the Principle of Population, an influential text by the British philosopher Thomas Malthus . The idea advanced by Malthus that society contains a struggle for existence struck a chord with Darwin.\nMalthus had been writing about people struggling to survive in the economic competition of the emerging modern world. But it inspired Darwin to begin thinking of species of animals and their own struggles for survival. The idea of \"survival of the fittest\" began to take hold.\nBy the spring of 1840, Darwin had come up with the phrase \"natural selection,\" as he wrote it in the margin of a book on horse breeding he was reading at the time.\nIn the early 1840s, Darwin had essentially worked out his theory of natural selection, which holds that organisms best suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce and thus become dominant.\nDarwin began writing an extended work on the subject, which he likened to a pencil sketch and which is now known to scholars as the Sketch.\nThe Delay in Publishing On the Origin of Species\nIt is conceivable that Darwin could have published his landmark book in the 1840s, yet he did not. Scholars have long speculated on the reasons for the delay, but it seems that it's simply because Darwin kept amassing information he could use to present a lengthy and well-reasoned argument. By the mid-1850s Darwin began working on a major work that would incorporate his research and insights.\nAnother biologist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was working in the same general field, and he and Darwin were aware of each other. In June 1858 Darwin opened a package sent to him by Wallace, and found a copy of a book Wallace had been writing.\nInspired in part by the competition from Wallace, Darwin resolved to push ahead and publish his own book. He realized he could not include all his research, and his original title for his work in progress referred to it as an \"abstract.\"\nDarwin's Landmark Book Published in November 1859\nDarwin finished a manuscript, and his book, titled On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races In the Struggle for Life, was published in London on November 24, 1859. (Over time, the book became known by the shorter title On the Origin of Species.)\nThe original edition of the book was 490 pages, and had taken Darwin about nine months to write. When he first submitted chapters to his publisher John Murray, in April 1859, Murray had reservations about the book. A friend of the publisher wrote to Darwin and suggested he write something quite different, a book on pigeons. Darwin politely brushed that suggestion aside, and Murray went ahead and published the book Darwin intended to write.\nOn the Origin of Species turned out to be quite a profitable book for its publisher. The initial press run was modest, only 1,250 copies, but those sold out in the first two days of sale. The following month a second edition of 3,000 copies also sold out, and the book continued selling through successive editions for decades.\nDarwin's book generated countless controversies, as it contradicted the Biblical account of creation and seemed to be in opposition to religion. Darwin himself remained mostly aloof from the debates and continued his research and writing.\nHe revised On the Origin of Species through six editions, and he also published another book on evolutionary theory, The Descent of Man, in 1871. Darwin also wrote prolifically about cultivating plants.\nWhen Darwin died in 1882, he was given a state funeral in Britain and was buried in Westminster Abbey, near the grave of Isaac Newton. His status as a great scientist had been assured by the publication of On the Origin of Species.\nQuestion:\nIn what decade was Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species' first published?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" — \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\nQuestion:\n\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTimothy o%60leary\nPassage:\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nTo call France, the following dial code is required.\n \n+33 to dial in(00 33 from UK)\nInternational access code\nTo call from France, the following dial code is required.\n \n00 code to dial out(00 44 for UK)\n \nCountry direct\nThe country direct access numbers provide phone access in more than 140 countries, the access numbers for France are:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the international telephone dialling code for France?\nAnswer:\n33\nPassage:\nRed Sky at Morning (1971 film)\nRed Sky at Morning is a 1971 American drama film based on the 1968 Richard Bradford novel of the same name, and starring Richard Thomas, Catherine Burns, and Desi Arnaz, Jr.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film follows Josh Arnold (Thomas), whose family relocates to Corazon Sagrado, New Mexico during World War II. The title of the book/film comes from a line in an ancient mariner's rhyme, \"Red sky at morning, sailor take warning\".\n\nAwards\n\nThe performance by Arnaz earned him the Golden Globe Award as \"New Star of the Year – Actor\" of 1972.\nQuestion:\nRed sky at morning, sailor take what?\nAnswer:\nThe Warning (album)\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection—whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poitín), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip José Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964–2004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. – Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nScotia Sea\nThe Scotia Sea is a sea located at the northern edge of the Southern Ocean at its boundary with the South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Drake Passage and on the north, east and south by the Scotia Arc, an undersea ridge and island arc system supporting various islands. The sea sits atop the Scotia Plate.\n\nLocation and description\n\nThe Scotia Sea is the area of water between the Drake Passage, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. These island groups all sit atop the Scotia Arc, which frames the sea on the north, east, and south. The Scotia Sea covers an area of about 900000 km2. About half of the sea stands above the continental shelf.\n\nHistory\n\nNamed in about 1932 after the Scotia, the expedition ship used in these waters by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902–04) under William S. Bruce. The most famous traverse of this frigid sea was made in 1916 by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five others in the adapted lifeboat James Caird when they left Elephant Island and reached South Georgia two weeks later.\n\nIn Argentina, the Scotia Sea is considered part of an area known as the Mar Argentino, and several territories claimed but not occupied by Argentina, such as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, lie within this region.\n\nOn 20 August 2006 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck at 1:41 a.m. local time (0341 GMT). The exact location was 61.011°S, 34.375°W at a depth of 10 km with a USGS event ID of \"usrqal.\" \nOn 17 November 2013 at 8:04 a.m. local time (1004 UTC) another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck the unpopulated Islands.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe islands bordering the Scotia Sea are rocky and partly covered in ice and snow year round; despite these harsh conditions, however, the islands do support vegetation and have been described as the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, which includes South Georgia, the volcanic South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkneys in the Scotia Sea, as well as the remote South Shetland Islands near the Antarctic Peninsula and the small isolated volcano called Bouvet Island. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichen and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.\n\nSeabirds include four species of albatross: black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophris), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). There are only five species of bird that remain on land on the islands, and these include two endemic species: a race of the yellow-billed pintail duck (Anas georgica) and South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticus). Other birds include the southern giant petrel, with sizeable colonies on Bird Island.\n\nPenguin species found here include large numbers of king penguins on South Georgia especially, as well as chinstrap penguin, macaroni penguin, gentoo penguin, Adelie penguin, and rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome).\n\nSeals include the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and sub-Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) in large numbers, leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), the huge southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), and crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). \n\nThreats and preservation\n\nAlthough the islands have a harsh climate and have never been permanently occupied, they have long been used as a base for fishing and seal-hunting. Wildlife on these remote islands is threatened by introduced species, especially on South Georgia, where even large animals, including reindeer, have been brought to the islands. Further damage to ecosystems results from overfishing.  South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island are protected as nature reserves, with Bird Island, South Georgia being a site of special scientific interest. The seals are further protected by international agreements, and fur seal populations are recovering.\nQuestion:\nWhat narrows do you sail through to reach Scotia Sea?\nAnswer:\nDrake Strait\n", "answers": ["1850s", "1850–1859", "1850's", "1850-1859", "Eighteen-fifties"], "length": 3058, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "33c79da6f8ac2588e1854e914143b1bca191c90d51db2236"}

DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out \"in solid\" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as \"Blood makes poor mortar\"), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. \"Where's your Moses now?\" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to filmand who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like, \"Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool\"?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking. – Variety Staff, Variety, Jul 7, 2010\nFresh: There is no other picture like it. There will be none. If it could be summed up in a word, the word would be sublime. And the man responsible for that, when all is said and done is Cecil B.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message – that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity – as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n‘Shamela’ (1741) was a parody of ‘Pamela’ (1740).

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region’s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n", "answers": ["Holly Heston Rochell", "John Charles Carter", "Charleton Heston", "Charleston Heston", "Holly Rochell", "Chuck Heston", "Heston, Charlton", "Carlton Heston", "Holly Heston", "Charlton heston", "Charlton Heston"], "length": 1952, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ae3ca6c00bc0c3a46831d809a0572f9290dd1c59012988a4"}

The territory was named in his honor by French explorer La Salle, who claimed the territory to the west of the Mississippi River in the 1680s for France. The huge land tract—the Louisiana Purchase—would later form all or parts of 15 states and two Canadian provinces. \nBut the cities and towns inside Louisiana have some interesting stories behind their names as well.\nNew Orleans was founded in 1718 as Nouvelle-Orléans by the French explorer Bienville. He named the city in honor of another French official, then Prince Regent of France Philip II, Duke of Orleans.\nLouisiana’s capital city, Baton Rouge , means “red stick” in French. The red stick refers to a blood-stained pole French explorer Iberville found on the bank of the Mississippi River in 1699 at the city’s present location. I’ve heard conflicting stories throughout the years about the stick’s purpose. I’ve heard it was a dividing line between lands occupied and hunted by the Bayougoula and Houma Native American tribes in south Louisiana, but I’ve also heard it was possibly placed to mark the passing of a respected tribal elder. Either way, the stick was placed by the Native Americans.\nOn a related note, several Louisiana cities owe their names to Louisiana’s first residents including Bayou Goula, Houma , Natchitoches , Opelousas , Coushatta , Jena and Ponchatoula .\nShreveport’s name is tied to a 160-mile log jam on the Red River in northwest and central Louisiana in the early 1800s. A steamboat captain and hundreds of men under his command successfully cleared the log jam opening river navigation southward to the Mississippi River. They established a port community north of the jam named for the jam-clearing captain—Henry Miller Shreve.\nLafayette was originally named Vermilionville, for the Cajun community that formed on Bayou Vermilion in the late 1700s. In the early 1800s, locals wanted to rename the small town to recognize the Marquis de Lafayette. The Frenchman aided the U.S. in the Revolutionary War and was subsequently invited on a multi-state tour in his honor as then-President James Monroe celebrated the nation’s 50-year anniversary. It is said many towns visited by Lafayette during the tour were renamed in his honor, but it’s also said Lafayette’s tour didn’t include the present day Louisiana namesake.\nSpeaking of President Monroe, the Louisiana city of Monroe is indirectly named in his honor. The then-young outpost took its name from the James Monroe, a steam-powered paddle wheeler that visited via the Ouachita River in 1819 and showed locals the river could transform the outpost into a bustling town.\nLike other U.S. states, Louisiana has places named for city founders (examples include Alexandria , Berwick and Hammond ) and for nearby natural resources, such as Louisiana’s Lake Charles , Lake Providence and Lake Arthur .\nLouisiana even has one central Louisiana 1800s sawmill town named for a defective natural resource. It’s said that a water wheel was built to power the mill, but the creek on which it sat would stop flowing and become a dry prong every summer. The water wheel was moved to a year-round flowing creek but the town name Dry Prong stuck.\nWhen you’re traveling throughout Louisiana take note of our interesting place names and enjoy the stories behind them.  Learn more about Louisiana's town names in part II and part III .\nQuestion:\n\"What American city has a name that means \"\"Red Stick\"\" in French?\"\nAnswer:\nBaton Rogue, West Florida\nPassage:\nAustralia II\nAustralia II (KA 6) is an Australian 12-metre-class America's Cup challenge racing yacht that was launched in 1982  and won the 1983 America's Cup for the Royal Perth Yacht Club. Skippered by John Bertrand, she was the first successful Cup challenger, ending a 132-year tenure (with 26 successful defences) by the New York Yacht Club.\n\nDesign\n\nAustralia II was designed by Ben Lexcen, built by Steve Ward, owned by Alan Bond and helmed by John Bertrand. Lexcen's Australia II design featured a reduced waterline length and a short chord winged keel which gave the boat a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and heeling moment (lower ballast center of gravity) but it was a significant disadvantage in choppy seas. The boat was also very quick in stays.  The winged keel was a major design advance, and its legality was questioned by the New York Yacht Club. During the summer of 1983, as selection trials took place for the Cup defence that autumn, the New York Yacht Club challenged the legality of the keel design. The controversy was decided in Australia IIs favour.\n\nAustralia II sported a number of other innovative features that contributed to her success, including radical vertical sail designs, all kevlar running rigging and a lightweight carbon fibre boom.\n\nLater claims of Dutch design\n\nIn 2009, Dutch naval architect Peter van Oossanen claimed that the winged keel was actually designed by him and his group of Dutch designers, and not Ben Lexcen.   If true, this would have been reason to disqualify Australia II, since the rules state that the yacht is to be designed by citizens of the nation it represents. The controversy arose due to Cup Rules allowing designers to use model basins for testing that are not located in the challenging country. Model testing was performed in the Netherlands and Peter van Oossanen and another Dutch engineer, Joop Sloof, performed measurements and analyses related to evaluation of winged keel designs. The suggestion that the vessel was not designed by Australians has been refuted by both John Bertrand and project manager John Longley.   Furthermore, it is well established that Lexcen had been experimenting with wing adaptations to the undersurface appendages of boats before, including his 1958 skiffs Taipan and Venom, although in the latter application they were not determined to be effective and not further adopted.   In 1983 Lexcen commented on the controversy: \"I have in mind to admit it all to the New York Yacht Club that I really owe the secret of the design to a Greek guy who helped me out and was invaluable. He's been dead for 2000 years.  Bloody Archimedes...\" \n\nCompetitions\n\nLouis Vuitton Cup\n\nAustralia II dominated the 1983 Louis Vuitton Cup before defeating Azzurra in the semi finals and Victory 83 in the final to win the trophy and earn the right to challenge for the America's Cup.\n\nAmerica's Cup\n\nAustralia II, bearing sail number KA6, represented the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia in its September 1983 challenge for the America's Cup. The defender, the New York Yacht Club, had held the cup since 1851, dominating challengers and sustaining the longest winning streak in sport.\n\nAustralia II, skippered by John Bertrand, faced Dennis Conner sailing the 12-metre Liberty in the ocean off Newport, Rhode Island. Australia II came from behind to prevail 4 races to 3. The victory on 26 September 1983  was a landmark event for the nation of Australia, not to mention the Royal Perth Yacht Club.  The achievement was underscored when Australia II was awarded the ABC Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1983.\n\nThe crew of Australia II for the America's Cup races was John Bertrand (skipper), Colin Beashel, Will Baillieu, Peter Costello, Damian Fewster, Ken Judge, Skip Lissiman, John Longley, Brian Richardson, Phil Smidmore, Grant Simmer, and Hugh Treharne. The reserves were Rob Brown, Jim Hardy, Scott McAllister. Beashel was an Olympic medal winning sailor who competed at six Olympic games. Richardson was an Olympic oarsman who had stroked the Australian men's VIII at the Moscow 1980 Olympics.\n\nPopular culture\n\nThe Boxing Kangaroo was the official mascot of the Australia II effort.\n\nThe win was received with much enthusiasm in Australia, with the Men at Work song Down Under becoming the official anthem for the crew.\n\nIn the film Wind, Australia II is portrayed as Boomerang.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Australia II was sold by Alan Bond to the Australian government. She was lent to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney for display in 1991. In 2000, Australia II was removed from the National Maritime Museum and transferred to the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle. For the 150th anniversary celebrations of the America's Cup in 2001, she was removed from the museum and shipped to the Isle of Wight, sailing with the original crew for several days of commemorative regattas.  Australia II was returned to the Western Australian Maritime Museum, where she is on permanent display.\nQuestion:\nWhat has been won by Australia II and America 3?\nAnswer:\nInternational Cup Race\nPassage:\nAlbertus Pictor\nAlbertus Pictor (English, \"Albert the Painter\"; Immenhusen, c. 1440 – c. 1507), also called Albert Pictor, Albert Målare and Albrekt Pärlstickare (Swedish), is the most famous late medieval Swedish painter, known for his wallpaintings surviving in numerous churches in southern and central Sweden. Celebrations for the quincentenary of his death were arranged for 2009.\n\nCareer\n\nAlbertus was originally called Albertus Immenhusen, after the German town of Immenhausen in Hessen of which he was a native. He occurs in Swedish historical sources from 1465, when he was admitted a burgher of Arboga. Eight years later he moved to Stockholm, where, in accordance with current practice, he took over the workshop as well as the widow of a deceased painter. \n\nHe was a versatile and prolific artist, known to his contemporaries not only for his church wallpaintings, but also as an organist and embroiderer (hence his nickname of Pärlstickare, \"Pearl-embroiderer\"). More than thirty of his schemes, mostly in a secco technique, are extant, many in the Lake Mälaren region, about a third of which bear his signature. Notable examples include wallpaintings at Bromma kyrka, near Stockholm, Lid kyrka, in Södermanland and Täby Kyrkby kyrka in Täby. Part of his life and work are depicted in the illustrated book, \"Albert målare och sommaren i Härkeberga\" (\"Albert the Painter and the summer in Härkeberga\"), which describes his painting of the small church of Härkeberga in Uppland (see below).\n\nInfluence\n\nAlbertus's illustration of Death playing chess from Täby kyrka inspired the famous scene in Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal in which a knight (Antonius Block) plays chess with personified Death. Albertus Pictor himself appears as a character in the film (played by Gunnar Olsson), in a dialog with Jöns, Antonius Block's squire, while working on a church mural.\n\nChurches with wall paintings by or attributed to Albertus Pictor\n\nAlbertus Pictor's paintings are considered preserved in 37 churches. Nine of the painting are either signed with some variant of Albertus name or the signing documented was destroyed. Other paintings ascribed to Albertus Pictor are based on attributes made by experts on the subject. Attenuation on stylistic grounds based on comparisons to those of the churches that have secure signings is difficult to determine especially when it concerns the making of the works. \n\nThe ornamentation has traditionally been important for the attribution, it is, however, in greater part in the public domain and is more general in its expression and easier to copy than figure painting. A lot of them are also strong influenced by over-liming and production with subsequent restoration. Albertus Pictor's painting, however, differ so much from contemporary Swedish painters that they usually can not be attributed to the author. It is conceivable that in some cases they rather have strong influences.\n\n* Almunge (Uppland)\n* Bromma (Stockholm)\n* Bälinge (Uppland)\n* Danmark (Uppland)\n* Dingtuna (Västmanland)\n* Ed (Uppland)\n* Floda (Sörmland)\n* Gryta (Uppsala)\n* Helga Trefaldighet (Uppsala)\n\n* Husby-Sjutolft (Uppland)\n* Håbo-Tibble (Uppland)\n* Härkeberga (Uppland)\n* Härnevi (Uppland)\n* Kalmar (Uppland)\n* Kumla (Västmanland)\n* Lid (Sörmland)\n* Nederluleå(Norrbotten)\n* Odensala (Uppland)\n\n* S Per (Uppsala)\n* Sala (Västmanland)\n* Sollentuna (Uppland)\n* Solna (Uppland)\n* Storkyrkan (Stockholm)\n* Torshälla (Södermanland)\n* Täby (Uppland)\n* Uppsala Cathedral (Uppland)\n* Vadsbro (Södermanland)\n\n* Vaksala (Uppland)\n* Vansö (Sörmland)\n* Vittinge (Uppland)\n* Vårdinge (Södermanland)\n* Vänge (Uppland)\n* Västerås Cathedral (Västmanland)\n* Yttergran (Uppland)\n* Ösmo (Sörmland)\n* Österunda (Uppland)\n* Övergran (Uppland)\nQuestion:\nA 1480s painting by Albertus Pictor in Täby Church located north of Stockholm that inspired a film director depicts a man playing chess with whom?\nAnswer:\nDevitalized\nPassage:\nPeter Parker (British businessman)\nSir Peter Parker KBE LVO (30 August 1924 – 28 April 2002) was a British businessman, best known as chairman of the British Railways Board from 1976 to 1983.\n\nEarly life\n\nParker was born in France on 30 August 1924, but spent part of his childhood in Shanghai, where his father worked for an oil company. The family were evacuated from China in 1937, and while his father went to work in Africa, his mother and the rest of the family settled in Bedford, England, where he attended Bedford School. After leaving school, he won a scholarship to study Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, as one of the \"Dulwich boys\", thirty sixth-formers recruited to boost the ranks of military translators. \n\nIn 1943 he joined the Intelligence Corps of the British Army, serving first in India and Burma, and later in the United States and Japan, eventually reaching the rank of Major. In 1947 he left the army, and after a conversation over tea with Lord Murray of Newhaven studied history at Lincoln College, Oxford.\n\nAt Oxford, he joined the Dramatic Society, where he was widely regarded as the best undergraduate actor of his day alongside contemporaries Kenneth Tynan, John Schlesinger and Lindsay Anderson. Parker met Shirley Catlin (the future Shirley Williams ) in the university's Labour Party club and they had a relationship. In her autobiography (\"Climbing the Bookshelves\") Williams says that \"...by the spring of 1949 I was in love with him, and he, a little, with me...\". He stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Bedford in the 1951 general election.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduation he spent two years with Philips before becoming Head of the overseas department of the Industrial Society. He organised a study conference on human problems in industry at the invitation of the Duke of Edinburgh, for which he was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order in 1957. He then joined Booker McConnell, becoming a Director of the company.\n\nHe remained on the board of Booker until 1970, when he was appointed chairman-designate of the newly nationalised National Ports Authority. This was scrapped following the election of a Conservative government in 1970, leaving Parker to find other directorships until his appointment in 1976 as British Rail's chairman.\n\nChairman of British Rail\n\nSucceeding Sir Richard Marsh, Parker was appointed Chairman of BR in 1976 by the Labour Government and continued to serve during the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher. He guided the organisation through difficult times to the beginnings of the resurgence in train travel in the United Kingdom.\n\nPolitically, he was a socialist (but later joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP)). His socialist principles were severely tested by the industrial relations difficulties with the three railway unions (ASLEF, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) while he was Chairman of British Rail. There were several major strikes on the railway system during his chairmanship.\n\nParker reorganised the management of the railway system, creating five business sectors, instead of having it based on geographical regions. He was a critic of the underinvestment in the railways by successive British governments, claiming that he was trying to shore up \"the crumbling edge of quality\". He also campaigned vigorously against the anti-rail lobby, most notably in successfully resisting the recommendations of the Serpell Report in 1982, which had proposed drastic closures.\n\nOn one occasion, Parker had to catch a train from Crewe to Carlisle, but arrived late and accidentally boarded a non-stopper heading for London Euston.  Parker was succeeded in 1983 by the vice-chairman, Robert Reid. \n\nLater career\n\nHis other appointments included the chairmanship of the Rockware Group (1971–76, and 1983–92); Bookers Engineering and Industrial Holdings (1966–70); Associated British Maltsters (1971–73); Curtis Brown (1971–76); Dawnay Day group (1971–76); Mitsubishi Electric UK (1984–96); and Whitehead Mann (1984–2000). He was also chairman of the National Theatre Board, of the British Tourist Authority and of Westfield College. He was knighted in 1978 and appointed KBE in 1993.  He was conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure 1st Class (1991) (Japan). \n\nPersonal life\n\nParker married Gillian Rowe-Dutton in 1951, a General practitioner and expert gardener who wrote \"The Purest of Pleasures:Creation of a Romantic Garden\". The couple had three sons (Alan Parker, public relations; Oliver Parker, film director; Nathaniel Parker, the actor ), and a daughter.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nParker died on 28 April 2002 from a suspected heart attack while on a trip to Turkey.\n\nParker was the first former Chairman of British Rail to have an engine named in his honour. At a ceremony at Old Oak Common, west London, on 17 September 2003, High Speed Train power car number 43127 was named \"Sir Peter Parker 1924–2002 Cotswold Line 150\" by Lady Parker.  The naming had been arranged between the Cotswold Line Promotion Group, which provided the nameplates, and First Great Western, to jointly celebrate the life and work of Sir Peter and the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Cotswold Line between Oxford and Worcester in 1853. Sir Peter was a regular user of Charlbury station on that line.\nQuestion:\nOf which nationalised industry was Peter Parker appointed Chairman in 1976?\nAnswer:\nBritish rail\nPassage:\nPeppa Pig Toys - Peppa & George Toys Games Bedrooms\nPeppa Pig Toys - Peppa & George Toys Games Bedrooms\nPeppa Pig Toys\nThe most wanted Peppa Pig merchandise, over 100 products including toys games clothing and bedroom items.\nPeppa Pig is a young girl who lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George.

Newspapers have reported that Berlusconi told police that a local party official would take custody of the girl, who had visited Berlusconi's Milan villa on at least one occasion.\nEven center-right commentators in Berlusconi's family-owned newspapers have criticized him for intervening in a possible criminal case. Berlusconi's now-estranged ally, Gianfranco Fini, said his antics had embarrassed the country.\nBut Berlusconi again defended his lifestyle and fondness for young women, telling a trade fair in Milan on Tuesday it was \"better to be passionate about a beautiful girl than a gay.\"\nGay rights group Arcigay demanded an apology for causing offense to both women and gays. Later, about two dozen people holding signs with a photo of Berlusconi and denouncing homophobia demonstrated across the street from the premier's office.\nThe premier's comments \"represent a dangerous incitement to prejudice and helps legitimize discrimination, injustice and suffering,\" Arcigay president Paolo Pantane wrote in a letter to Berlusconi's minister for equal opportunity, Mara Carfagna.\nIn response, Carfagna defended Berlusconi's record on anti-discrimination measures and said he had just been joking.\n\"(He) absolutely never intended to offend women or homosexuals,\" she said.\nAnother prominent supporter, Daniela Santanche, a government undersecretary, also rallied to the premier's defense, saying there was nothing disturbing in his comment.\nAfter noting that she \"esteems homosexuals,\" Santanche said: \"I am sure that all Italian parents hope to have heterosexual children.\"\nShe added that \"the hope of every mother is to some day become a grandmother and have their children avoid the problems of a life inherent in the homosexual condition,\" the Italian news agency ANSA quoted her as saying.\nBerlusconi assured supporters on Tuesday that his government still had a majority and would last the remaining half of its five-year term. He said early elections would be a disaster for a country grappling with economic crisis.\nHe contended that the Ruby scandal was whipped up by hostile, deceptive newspapers and again defended his decision to intervene in her case. Ruby was let go by police with no charges after Nicole Minetti, a party official who is also Berlusconi's dental hygienist, took custody of her.\nBerlusconi said Tuesday he'd do the same thing again.\n\"You will see when this is over that there was nothing more than an act of solidarity,\" he said.\nRuby, meanwhile, told Libero, a conservative newspaper close to Berlusconi, that she would tell her version of the story Thursday on a popular state-run TV talk show, but her lawyer later said there were no such plans. Ruby's comments have been inconsistent and prosecutors have reportedly questioned her credibility.\nShe repeated she never had intimate relations with the premier, though she said she \"adored\" him. She clarified that while another young woman linked to Berlusconi, Noemi Letizia, referred to him as \"papi\" (\"daddy\"), she called him \"premier.\"\nBerlusconi's relationship with Letizia, an 18-year-old would-be model from Naples, sparked a scandal last year that prompted Berlusconi's second wife to file for divorce.\nSoon after, a high-end prostitute, Patrizia D'Addario, claimed she had spent a night with the premier and had tape recorded their encounter.\nThe conservative leader has said he has never paid anyone for sex. Prosecutors have said Berlusconi is not under investigation in the scandals over his dalliances with women.\nAdvertisement\nQuestion:\n\"In November 2010, who was widely quoted as saying it's \"\"better to love beautiful girls than gays\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBerusconi\nPassage:\nBlock Buster!\n\"Block Buster!\" (also sometimes listed as \"Blockbuster!\") is a 1973 single by Sweet. Written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and produced by Phil Wainman, \"Block Buster!\" was the band's sole UK No. 1 hit. Released in January 1973, it spent five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart,  and also made #1 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Austria and Ireland, and #3 in Finland, Switzerland, Denmark and Norway. Outside Europe it fared less well as it peaked at #29 in Australia and at #73 on the American Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCharts\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nIts riff was considered markedly similar to fellow RCA act David Bowie's \"The Jean Genie\", released shortly before, but all parties maintain that this was pure coincidence. \n\nTV performances\n\nSome controversy rose after the band's performance of the song on the British television program Top of the Pops at December 25, 1973. In this performance, Sweet's bassist Steve Priest wore a Swastika.\nQuestion:\nWho had a number one hit for six weeks in 1973 with 'Blockbuster'?\nAnswer:\nSweetening\nPassage:\nBraeburn\nThe 'Braeburn' is a cultivar of apple that is firm to the touch with a red/orange vertical streaky appearance on a yellow/green background. Its color intensity varies with different growing conditions.\n\nIt was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by the farmer O. Moran from Waiwhero in the Moutere Hills near Motueka, New Zealand. It was then cultivated by the Williams Brothers nursery as a potential export variety. It is thought to be a cross between Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton.  The apple itself is named after Braeburn Orchard where it was first commercially grown.\n\nBraeburn apples have a combination of sweet and tart flavour. They are available October through April in the northern hemisphere  and are medium to large in size. They are a popular fruit for growers because of their ability to store well when chilled. \n\nBraeburn apples are useful in cooking in that they hold their shape and do not release a great deal of liquid making them ideal for tarts.  According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States. \n\nBraeburn Browning Disorder \n\nApples can be preserved by short, medium or long-term\nstorage. Braeburn can turn brown inside during commercial long term storage, and it’s usually not possible to tell if an apple has the Braeburn browning disorder until a person bites or cuts into it.  Apples respond dramatically to both temperature and atmosphere modification. Rapid temperature reduction and the exacting maintenance of low temperature close to the chilling point of the variety can provide good to medium quality product following 3 to 6 mo of storage and in some cases longer. However, modern commercial warehouses couple\ntemperature management with controlled atmosphere (CA) for long-term storage of apples. Braeburn can be stored at 0 °C in air for 3–4 months, and in CA for 8–10 months, with only a slight susceptibility to scalding although it is sensitive to carbon dioxide.  The variety has a relatively impermeable skin, which restricts diffusion of gases into and out of the fruit, leading to high internal carbon dioxide concentrations. \n\nThe browning disorder seems worse in overmature fruit, fruit from lightly cropped trees, and large fruit, but it can show up on different trees in different years, and in some regions, but not others.\n\nMaintaining the superior qualities of Braeburn while eliminating Braeburn browning disorder led to development of the Jazz cultivar. Since Braeburn is such a desirable variety, commercial orchards and trees in regions and locations that have proven not susceptible to the browning disorder are being maintained. Since most home orchardists do not attempt very long term storage, they do not encounter the browning disorder.\n\nDisease susceptibility \n\n*Scab: high \n*Powdery mildew: high\n*Cedar apple rust: high\n*Fire blight: high\nQuestion:\nBraeburn is a variety of which type of fruit?\nAnswer:\nApple Blossom\nPassage:\nYankee Clipper – World Book INK\nYankee Clipper – World Book INK\nworldbookblog Leave a comment\nJoe DiMaggio, who was born on Nov. 25, 1914, was one of the greatest and most popular players in baseball history. DiMaggio played his entire career, from 1936 to 1951, with the New York Yankees. He was nicknamed “the Yankee Clipper” because of his graceful fielding as an outfielder. He was also called “Joltin’ Joe” because of his powerful hitting.\nDiMaggio had a lifetime batting average of .325 and hit 361 home runs. His record of hitting safely in 56 consecutive games in 1941 is one of the most enduring in baseball history. DiMaggio played in 10 World Series and was voted the American League’s Most Valuable Player in 1939, 1941, and 1947.\nDiMaggio was a superhero in American sports before television was available to spread the popularity of celebrities. Americans eagerly followed his playing career and personal life through newspapers and on radio. DiMaggio’s brief marriage to actress Marilyn Monroe in 1954 caused a national sensation. More than 15 years after DiMaggio retired as a player, Paul Simon’s hit song “Mrs. Robinson” could still nostalgically capture the hold that the baseball great had on the American imagination:\nWhere have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?\nA nation turns its lonely eyes to you,\nWhat’s that you say, Mrs. Robinson,\n“Joltin Joe” has left and gone away.\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio was born in Martinez, California. He died in Hollywood, Florida, on March 8, 1999. Two of his brothers, Dominic and Vincent, also played major league baseball. DiMaggio was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955, the first year he was eligible.\nQuestion:\nWhich US Baseball player was nicknamed The Yankee Clipper?\nAnswer:\nJoe Dimmagio\nPassage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

The plot is centred on the illegitimate son of a British naval officer singlehandedly bringing about the downfall of a German cruiser during World War I.  The title role is played by John Mills, his first lead role, and it is also notable for being the first film to use actual Royal Navy ships.\n\nThe novel was also later adapted as Sailor of the King (also titled Single-Handed in the US, and sometimes - though rarely - Brown on Resolution), in 1953.  The 1935 version retains the novel's original World War I setting, but in the 1953 remake, the setting is realistically updated to the Second World War, as the Germans resumed commerce raiding with surface warships in 1939.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1893, Betty Brown meets a debonair young naval officer and falls in love. She conceals her pregnancy from him, and he rejoins his ship. The boy, Albert Brown, is brought up by his mother and joins the navy as soon as he is old enough.\n\nBrown's ship is posted to the Pacific during the First World War. He is marooned on the remote Galapagos island of Resolution when the cruiser he is serving on, HMS Rutland, is sunk. A German battlecruiser (the fictitious SMS Ziethen ) takes him prisoner whilst it defeats an inferior British force. It then suffers damage in a second encounter and her captain plans to pull into an isolated Pacific anchorage to try to repair his vessel.  There, the resourceful Brown escapes, steals a rifle and a small amount of ammunition, and makes his way ashore.\n\nThe German vessel's main battery cannot be brought to bear on Brown, and he is able to pick off exposed crew-members who are trying to repair her punctured hull plates.  The anchorage is an impenetrable tangle of scrub and thorn bushes, making it difficult for shore parties to run him to ground.\n\nBrown is eventually killed by a German shot, never learning that his actions delayed the repairs long enough for the raider's British pursuers to catch her up and destroy her. Brown becomes a hero, the British erect a cross on the highest point on the island to commemorate him, and the commander of the British ship discovers that Brown was the illegitimate son he always denied he had.\n\nCast\n\n*Betty Balfour - Elizabeth Brown\n*John Mills - Albert Brown\n*Barry MacKay - Lt.

That is forever England’ is from which poem by Rupert Brooke\nAnswer:\nThe Soldier (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nMarriage of the Virgin\nThe Marriage of the Virgin is the subject in Christian art depicting the marriage of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph.  The marriage is not mentioned in the canonical Gospels but is covered in several apocryphal sources, and later redactions, notably the 14th century compilation the Golden Legend.  Unlike many other scenes in Life of the Virgin cycles (like the Nativity of Mary and Presentation of Mary), it is not a feast in the church calendar.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox tradition, essentially the same scene, with very similar iconography, is considered to represent the earlier scene of the \"Entrusting of Mary to Joseph\", with Joseph being made Mary's guardian by the temple authorities.  \n\nIn art the subject could be covered in several different scenes, and the betrothal of Mary, with Joseph's blossoming rod, was often shown, despite its apocryphal origin.  Wedding processions are also shown, especially in the Early Medieval period. \n \nThe Betrothal legend in the Golden Legend\n\nThe Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, recounts how, when Mary was 14 and living in the Temple, the High Priest gathered all male descendents of David of marriageable age including Saint Joseph (though he was much older than the rest). The High Priest ordered them to each bring a rod; he that owned the rod which would bear flowers was divinely ordained to become Mary's husband. After the Holy Spirit descended as a dove and caused Joseph's rod to blossom, he and Mary were wed according to Jewish custom. The account, quoted in its entirety, runs thus:\n\nIn fact, neither the Golden Legend nor any of the early apocryphal accounts describe the actual ceremony, and they differ as to its timing, other than that it preceded the \"Journey to Bethlehem\". It is unclear whether this story was set before or after the Annunciation which, in the New Testament account, occurred after their betrothal but before their marriage. In the Gospel of James it comes after the Annunciation, but in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, the primary source in the West, it comes before it. \n\nArtists\n\nThe scene, or scenes, was a common component in larger cycles of the Life of the Virgin and thus very frequently found, especially in the Middle Ages; it is not found in the typical cycle in a Book of hours however.  The marriage scene has been painted by, among others, Giotto, Perugino, Raphael, Ventura Salimbeni (1613, his last painting), Domenico Ghirlandaio (1485-90, at the Tornabuoni Chapel), Bernardo Daddi (now in the Royal Collection), Pieter van Lint (1640, Antwerp Cathedral), Tiburzio Baldini, Alfonso Rivarola, Francesco Caccianiga, Niccolò Berrettoni, Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio, Filippo Bellini, Veronese (in San Polo church, Venice), Giulio Cesare Milani, Franciabigio (in the Santissima Annunziata, Florence), and Giacomo di Castro.\nQuestion:\nWho painted the 'Marriage Of The Virgin' found in the Pinacoteca di Brera of Milan?\nAnswer:\nRaffaello Sanzio\nPassage:\nSay What You Want\n\"Say What You Want\" is a song by Scottish pop group Texas and the first single to be taken from their fourth studio album White on Blonde.[http://www.discogs.com/Texas-Say-What-You-Want/master/89698 Texas - Say What You Want at Discogs] It was remixed as \"Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)\" featuring Method Man and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan and re-released as a double A-side with \"Insane\" in 1998. Both versions featured on their 2000 album The Greatest Hits.\n\nIt is the band's biggest hit commercially to date, peaking at #3 on the UK Singles Chart, with the remixed version reaching #4.

It is associated with 1960s style, and fashion figures such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Sir Oswald Mosley's Blackshirt movement had a barracks on the street in the 1930s. \n\nLocation\n\nKing's Road  runs for just under 2 mi through Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, from Sloane Square in the east (on the border with Belgravia and Knightsbridge) and through the Moore Park estate on the border of Chelsea and Fulham opposite Stamford Bridge. Shortly after crossing Stanley bridge the road passes a slight kink at the junction with Waterford Road in Fulham, where it then becomes New King's Road, continuing to Fulham High Street and Putney Bridge; its western end is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nHistory\n\nKing's Road derives its name from its function as a private road used by King Charles II to travel to Kew. It remained a private royal road until 1830, but people with connections were able to use it. Some houses date from the early 18th century. No. 213 has a blue plaque to film director Sir Carol Reed, who lived there from 1948 until his death in 1978. Thomas Arne lived at No. 215 and is believed to have composed \"Rule Britannia\" there. Ellen Terry lived in the same house from 1904–1920, and also Peter Ustinov; the house is commemorated by a blue plaque also. Photographer Christina Broom was born in 1862 at No 8.\n\nIn 1876, the world's first artificial ice rink, the Glaciarium, opened just off King's Road, and later that year it relocated to a building on the street.\n\nDuring the 1960s the street became a symbol of mod culture, evoking \"an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels\", one magazine later wrote.  King's Road was home in the 1960s to the Chelsea Drugstore (originally a chemist with a stylised chrome-and-neon soda fountain upstairs, later a public house, and more recently a McDonalds), and in the 1970s  to Malcolm McLaren's boutique, Let It Rock, which was renamed SEX in 1974, and then Seditionaries in 1977. During the hippie and punk eras, it was a centre for counterculture, but has since been gentrified. It serves as Chelsea's high street and has a reputation for being one of London's most fashionable shopping streets.  Other celebrated boutiques included Granny Takes a Trip, The Sweet Shop in Blantyre Street just off King's Road at World's End and Stop The Shop, a fashion boutique with a revolving floor.\n\n484 King's Road was the headquarters of Swan Song Records, owned by Led Zeppelin.  They left following closure of the company in 1983. King's Road was site of the first UK branch of Starbucks which opened in 1999.\n\n535 King's Road was the headquarters of Cube Records, a late 1960s and early 1970s independent record label. The label folded in the mid 1970s, becoming part of Elektra Records. The building has since been demolished but the new building on the same site still houses a record company.\n\nThe road has been represented in popular culture on various occasions: \"King's Road\" is the title of a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from the 1981 album Hard Promises and is name-checked in the song \"Dick a Dum Dum (King's Road)\" which was a hit for Des O'Connor in 1969. In Ian Fleming's novels, James Bond lives in a fashionable unnamed square just off King's Road.\n\nPlanning and transport\n\n;Planning\nThe eastern part of King's Road is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.\n\n;Bus\nBuses 11, 19, 22, 49, 211, 319, 328, and C3 all go down King's Road, yet most of these turn off the street at one point or another. The 11 and the 22 are the only routes which run the entirety of King's Road, with the 22 being the only route that runs all the way from Sloane Square to the end of New King's Road in Fulham.\n\n;Rail and Tube\nThe western end of King's Road is close to Imperial Wharf railway station on the London Overground network, with connections to Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction. Southern also run direct rail services to  and  from this station. At the eastern end of the street is Sloane Square, and Fulham Broadway lies at the western end, on the boundary between Chelsea and Fulham. King's Road, and the area of Chelsea as a whole, is known for having poor links to the London Underground. Due to this, the route of Crossrail 2 is proposed to have an underground station in this area, called King's Road Chelsea.\n\n;River\nChelsea Harbour Pier is also within easy reach of the western end of King's Road, with river bus services provided by London River Services and Thames Executive Charters to Putney and Blackfriars.

Because of its geographic isolation, Madagascar is home to many amazing animals found nowhere else on Earth. Lemurs may have floated there eons ago on \"rafts\" of vegetation and evolved in isolation over countless centuries.\nRing-tailed lemurs are unmistakable because of their long, vividly striped, black-and-white tail. They are familiar residents of many zoos.\nLemurs use their hands and feet to move nimbly through the trees, but cannot grip with their tails as some of their primate cousins do. Ring-tailed lemurs also spend a lot of time on the ground, which is unusual among lemur species. They forage for fruit, which makes up the greater part of their diet, but also eat leaves, flowers, tree bark, and sap.\nRing-tailed lemurs have powerful scent glands and use their unique odor as a communication tool and even as a kind of weapon. Lemurs mark their territory by scent, serving notice of their presence to all who can smell. During mating season, male lemurs battle for dominance by trying to outstink each other. They cover their long tails with smelly secretions and wave them in the air to determine which animal is more powerful.\nRing-tailed lemurs live in groups known as troops. These groups may include 6 to 30 animals, but average about 17. Both sexes live in troops, but a dominant female presides over all.\nRing-tailed lemurs are endangered, largely because the sparse, dry forests they love are quickly vanishing.\nQuestion:\nLemurs in the wild are unique to which country?\nAnswer:\nIsland of the moon\nPassage:\nGeoffrey Hughes\nGeoffrey Hughes DL (2 February 1944 – 27 July 2012) was an English actor.\n\nHughes rose to fame for portraying much-loved binman Eddie Yeats in the popular long-running British soap opera Coronation Street from 1974 to 1983, making a return to the show in 1987. He went on to appear in two popular British television sitcoms during the 1990s, playing loveable slob Onslow in Roy Clarke's Keeping Up Appearances (1990–1995) followed by Twiggy in Craig Cash and Caroline Aherne's The Royle Family (1998–2000), the latter of which he reprised his role for the specials in 2006 and 2008. \n\nFrom 2001 to 2005 he played Vernon Scripps, conman and loveable rogue, on the ITV police drama Heartbeat (2001–05), taking over as the show's main loveable rogue from Bill Maynard, and returning to the show briefly in 2007 after the character was thought dead.\n\nIn 1996 Hughes was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and in 2010 he suffered a cancer relapse which led him to retire from acting. He died from the illness, aged 68, in 2012.\n\nCareer\n\nHughes attended Ranworth Square Primary School, Liverpool until the age of 11. He then went to Abbotsford Secondary Modern School in Norris Green, Liverpool. He started his career in repertory at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent. This was followed by his first West End production, the Lionel Bart and Alun Owen musical Maggie May. His other West End productions included the stage version of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Say Goodnight to Grandma, The Secret Life of Cartoons and several seasons of Run for your Wife. He recently played \"Pistol\" in an open air production of Henry V at Barnwell Manor. He also toured extensively in Britain and abroad. He had relatives in Shetland.\n\nAmong his many other appearances on television are: An Arrow for Little Audrey; The Saint; Shadows of Fear; Z-Cars; Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased); Flying Lady; Making Out; Coasting; Doctor Who; Spender; and Boon. He played 'Trinculo' in an all filmed version of The Tempest for the BBC and 'Squire Clodpoll' in Good Friday 1663, one of Channel Four's new avant-garde operas. His comedy appearances on TV include The Likely Lads, Please Sir!, Dad's Army, Curry and Chips, No, Honestly, The Upper Hand and the character of Onslow in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances.\n\nHughes' film credits included Smashing Time (1967), The Bofors Gun (1968), Till Death Us Do Part (1969), The Virgin Soldiers (1969), The Man Who Had Power Over Women (1970), Revenge (1971), Carry on at Your Convenience (1971), Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973), Tiffany Jones (1973), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976), Nijinsky (1980), and Flick (2008). He was also the voice of Paul McCartney in the Beatles' 1968 cartoon film Yellow Submarine.\n\nIn 1974 Hughes was cast as binman Eddie Yeats in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street. Over the next nine years he became, with Stan Ogden (as played by Bernard Youens), a foil to Stan's long-suffering wife Hilda (Jean Alexander). Many fans still regard these performances as a high point in the soap's history. He left the series in 1983, making a brief final return appearance in 1987 as part of Hilda's departure from the series. In recent years he was offered the opportunity to return to the show, but declined.\n\nHughes usually appeared in pantomime over the Christmas period. He appeared on That Antony Cotton Show on 6 September 2007, in which he spoke about his role in a short film called Expresso, which also starred Sir Norman Wisdom. Hughes played the part of a man who visits a coffee shop for a \"normal\" coffee but is served by a pompous waiter. The film was sold in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.\n\nIn 2007 he performed the Angel Gabriel in the BBC production Liverpool Nativity.

Born in Wallasey, on the Wirral in Cheshire, to parents Ada and Bill, he had one younger brother Gordon and was brought up in Liverpool. He is survived by his wife, whom he first met in the Navigation Inn at Buxworth in the High Peak of Derbyshire, then owned and run by Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner in Coronation Street).\n\nHughes was also the Honorary Squire of the Dartington Morris Men and made an appearance at the Dartington Morris Ring meeting in September 2008. His musical interests included English folk-rock and he compered at Fairport's Cropredy Convention annual music festival several times.   \n\nDeath\n\nHughes received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 1996 while he was playing Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances.  He died from the illness on 27 July 2012.  He thought he had beaten the cancer, but in 2010, while attending a charity event, he suffered from extreme back pains, so painful he couldn't even stand up. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer again. Doctors said that he died \"peacefully in his sleep\".\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of the character played by Geoffrey Hughes in the TV sitcom Keeping Up Appearances'?\nAnswer:\nOnslow\nPassage:\nJohn Ridgway (sailor)\nJohn Ridgway, MBE, (born 1938), is a British yachtsman and rower.\n\nBiography\n\nRidgway was educated at the Pangbourne Nautical College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

He has become infamous because of the disappearance of his young nephews - the Princes in the Tower - and through William Shakespeare's play 'Richard III'.\nIn 2012, archaeologists and researchers began excavating beneath a carpark in Leicester, hoping to find Richard's final resting place. The search captured the public's imagination and the remains subsequently found were confirmed as those of Richard.\nPhoto: Portrait of Richard III by an unknown artist. (National Portrait Gallery)\nIntroduction\nThe Battle of Bosworth Field\nMelvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.\nMelvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, the celebrated climactic encounter of the Wars of the Roses.\nMore information about: King Richard III\nRichard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. His father was Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York and his mother Cecily Neville. Richard had a claim to the English throne through both parents. We now know that Richard had a curvature of the spine, but the withered arm and limp of legend are almost certainly either fabrications or greatly exaggerated.\nWars of the Roses\nHis father's conflict with Henry VI was a major cause of the Wars of the Roses, which dominated Richard's early life. His father and older brother died at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460. In 1461, Richard's brother, Edward, became Edward IV and created him Duke of Gloucester. In 1470, Edward and Richard were exiled when Henry VI was briefly restored to the throne. The following year, they returned to England and Richard contributed to the Yorkist victories at Barnet and Tewkesbury which restored Edward to the throne.\nThe Princes in the Tower and seizure of the throne\nWhen Edward died in April 1483, Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. As the new king travelled to London from Ludlow, Richard met him and escorted him to the capital, where he was lodged in the Tower of London. Edward V's brother later joined him there.\nA publicity campaign was mounted condemning Edward IV's marriage to the boys' mother, Elizabeth Woodville, as invalid and their children illegitimate. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed these claims. The following day, Richard III officially began his reign. He was crowned in July. The two young princes disappeared in August and were widely rumoured to have been murdered by Richard.\nThe beginning of the end\nA rebellion raised in October by the Duke of Buckingham, Richard's former ally, quickly collapsed. However, Buckingham's defection, along with his supporters, eroded Richard's power and support among the aristocracy and gentry.\nDeath of a warrior king\nIn August 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who was a Lancastrian claimant to the throne living in France, landed in South Wales. He marched east and engaged Richard in battle on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire on 22 August. Although Richard possessed superior numbers, several of his key lieutenants defected. Refusing to flee, Richard was killed in battle and Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.\nQuestion:\nFor how many years was Richard III king of England?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThomas Minton\nThomas Minton (1765 – 1836) was an English potter. He founded Thomas Minton & Sons in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which grew into a major ceramic manufacturing company with an international reputation.\n\nDuring the early 1780s Thomas Minton was an apprentice engraver at the Caughley Pottery Works in Shropshire, under the proprietorship of Thomas Turner, working on copperplate engravings for the production of transferware.  The engraver Thomas Lucas went from there to work for Josiah Spode at Stoke-on-Trent in 1783, taking some elements of the fashionable chinoiserie patterns with him.  While at Caughley Thomas Minton is thought to have worked on chinoiserie landscape patterns including willows, and to have prepared copperplates of them:  but the Salopian works never produced the standard willow pattern which includes the bridge and the fence in the foreground.  \n\nMinton left the Salopian works in 1785, and married Sarah in London in 1789. In 1793 he established his own pottery factory in Stoke-upon-Trent principally for the manufacture of white-glazed earthen tablewares or pearlware including blue transfer printed and painted wares. Variations of his willow and other designs were acquired by Spode and other factories, and it was in this context that the English willow pattern was created. He was favoured and employed by Josiah Spode, for whom he engraved a new version of the pattern. To Minton is also attributed the popular 'Buffalo' pattern engraved for Spode.  He was assisted by Henry Doncaster of Penkhull: his pupil William Greatbatch (father of William Greatbatch (1802-1885), another notable engraver) became chief engraver for Spode and for the successor company, Copeland's.  \n\nIn c. 1796 Minton went into partnership with Joseph Poulson, who produced ornamental bone china at a factory nearby, and from c.1798 Minton employed Poulson's factory for his own china wares. After Poulson's death in 1808 he continued china production there until 1816. In 1824 he built a new factory for china, on the basis of which the company of 'Thomas Minton and Sons', known more simply as 'Mintons', was developed. At his death in 1836 his son Herbert Minton (1793-1858) continued and redeveloped the business.\n\nHis portrait was made by James Northcote, R.A..\n\nSources\nQuestion:\nThomas Minton at Stoke on Trent created what in 1789?\nAnswer:\nThe Willow Pattern\nPassage:\nnavel - English-French Dictionary WordReference.com\nnavel - English-French Dictionary WordReference.com\nEnglish\nnavel nnoun: Refers to person, place, thing, quality, etc.\n(anatomy: belly button) (courant)\nnombril nmnom masculin: s'utilise avec les articles \"le\", \"l'\" (devant une voyelle ou un h muet), \"un\".

A large weapon, the arbalest had a steel prod (\"bow\"). Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) of force and be accurate up to 100 m. A skilled arbalestier (arbalester) could loose two bolts per minute.\n\nNomenclature \n\nThe term \"arbalest\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"crossbow\". \n\"Arbalest\" is a Medieval French word originating from the Roman name ' (from ' ‘bow’ + ' ‘missile-throwing engine’),  which was then used for crossbows, although originally used for types of artillery. \nModern French uses the word ', which is linguistically one step further from the stem (disappearance of the s phoneme in the last syllable, before t). \n\nThe word applies to both crossbow and arbalest (the latter may be referred to as a heavy crossbow, but an actual heavy crossbow may not be the same as an arbalest). In some cases, the word has been used to refer to arbalists, the people who actually used the weapon.\nQuestion:\nThe arbalest was a variety of which weapon?\nAnswer:\nStonebows\nPassage:\nEnd of the road for the zebra? | UK news | The Guardian\nEnd of the road for the zebra? | UK news | The Guardian\nEnd of the road for the zebra?\nSixty years after its introduction, the black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing is being replaced due to safety fears\nExperts say that zebra crossings can actually cause accidents. Photograph: Alamy\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nIn the 60 years since it was officially introduced to Britain's roads, the zebra has evolved into the panda , the pelican and the puffin . Now the original black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing, a pair of Belisha beacons its only adornment, is nearing extinction.\nMore than 1,000 zebras have gone in the past five years, and many thousands more have been replaced by higher-tech pelicans (red, amber and green lights for drivers; red and green men for pedestrians) and puffins (like pelicans, but with added sensors).\n\"Essentially, drivers don't take as much notice of zebra crossings as they should because there's no red light telling them to stop, and pedestrians don't feel as safe as they do with a signal telling them when to cross,\" says Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety.\nHoward expects plain zebras to vanish from all but the slowest-moving city-centre roads within the next few years. \"To a large extent,\" he says, \"they already have. I'm struggling to think of a single plain zebra in Basingstoke.\"\nRoad safety experts have long argued that because zebras – launched in Britain in 1951 after trials first of a blue-and-yellow, then a red-and-white version – give priority to pedestrians but do not actively slow vehicles down, they may elicit unsafe behaviour from both.\nResearch by the New Zealand Transport Agency in 2007 suggested that a zebra without any traffic slowing measures could actually increase pedestrian accidents by 28%. Combined with a speed bump, however, it reduced them by 80%. Here, five people died on zebra crossings last year and 144 were injured.\nOne example of this iconic part of the UK road network will, however, survive: the crossing on the cover of the Beatles' 1969 Abbey Road LP is now Grade II listed .\nQuestion:\nWhat road safety item was introduced into the UK on 31 October 1951\nAnswer:\nZebra Crossings\nPassage:\nHernando's Hideaway\n\"Hernando's Hideaway\" is a tango show tune, largely in long metre, from the musical The Pajama Game, written by Jerry Ross and Richard Adler and published in 1954. It was sung in the stage and film versions of the musical by Carol Haney.\n\nThe most successful recording of the song was done by Archie Bleyer, the record reaching No. 2 on the Billboard  chart in 1954. A rendition by Enoch Light was featured prominently on Command Records' Provocative Percussion as well as the Command test record. It has also been covered by David Clayton Thomas, and is often played by breakbeat DJs. The R&B singer Debelah Morgan sampled it (with different lyrics and a new middle section) on her international pop hit \"Dance With Me\" released in 2000. The instrumental section of The Johnston Brothers' 1955 recording (a No. 1 UK hit that year)   was used as the theme for Brick Top Polford in the movie Snatch.\n\nA live recording (from Carnegie Hall in 1954) by Ella Fitzgerald  can be found on the Verve/Polygram release Jazz at the Philharmonic, the Ella Fitzgerald Set, with Ray Brown on bass and Buddy Rich on drums.\n\nThe Pajama Game is set in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hernando's Hideaway was a raunchy dive in East Dubuque, Illinois, perched on a high cliff overlooking the highway between Dubuque and Galena. The movie was based on the stage play of the same name which, in turn, was based on the book; it is only in the original book that there is information about where the story takes place. A number of places around the world today are named Hernando's Hideaway, evidently based on the popularity of the song.\n\nThere are at least 15 Finnish versions by different artists of the song, the first and most popular by Olavi Virta, in 1956.\n\n\"Hernando's Hideaway\" also became a nickname for the smoking room for British parliamentarians in the House of Commons. The Labour Member of Parliament, Stephen Pound, told the House during a smoking debate on February 14, 2006: \"I refer the House to the dystopic hell – 'Hernando's Hideaway' – that is the Smoking Room on the Library Corridor. It is like the Raft of the Medusa most nights, with great groups of people crammed into it.\" \n\nIn 2014, the song was featured on the popular FOX show So You Think You Can Dance during its 11th season.

Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, whereupon the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.\n\nThe Legend\n\nIcarus' father Daedalus, a very talented and remarkable Athenian craftsman, built the Labyrinth for King Minos of Crete near his palace at Knossos to imprison the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster born of his wife and the Cretan bull. Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos's daughter, Ariadne, a clew  (or ball of string) in order to help Theseus, the enemy of Minos, to survive the Labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.\n\nDaedalus fashioned two pairs of wings out of wax and feathers for himself and his son. Daedalus tried his wings first, but before trying to escape the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun, nor too close to the sea, but to follow his path of flight. Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him, Icarus soared into the sky, but in the process he came too close to the sun, which due to the heat melted the wax. Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms, and so Icarus fell into the sea in the area which today bears his name, the Icarian Sea near Icaria, an island southwest of Samos.    \n\nHellenistic writers give euhemerising variants in which the escape from Crete was actually by boat, provided by Pasiphaë, for which Daedalus invented the first sails, to outstrip Minos' pursuing galleys, and that Icarus fell overboard en route to Sicily and drowned. Heracles erected a tomb for him.  \n\nClassical literature\n\nIcarus' flight  was often alluded to by Greek poets in passing, but the story was told briefly in Pseudo-Apollodorus.  In the literature of ancient Rome, the myth was of interest to Augustan writers. Hyginus narrates it in Fabula 40, beginning with the bovine love affair of Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun, resulting in the birth of the Minotaur. Ovid narrates the story of Icarus at some length in the Metamorphoses (viii.183–235), and refers to it elsewhere. \n\nMedieval and Renaissance literature\n\nOvid's treatment of the Icarus myth and its connection with that of Phaëthon influenced the mythological tradition in English literature  as received and interpreted by major writers such as Chaucer,  Marlowe,  Shakespeare,  Milton,  and Joyce. \n\nIn Renaissance iconography, the significance of Icarus depends on context: in the Orion Fountain at Messina, he is one of many figures associated with water; but he is also shown on the Bankruptcy Court of the Amsterdam Town Hall - where he symbolizes high-flying ambition. \nThe 16th-century painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, traditionally but perhaps erroneously attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, was the inspiration for two of the 20th century's most notable ecphrastic English-language poems, \"Musée des Beaux Arts\" by W.H. Auden and \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" by William Carlos Williams.  Other English language poems referencing the Icarus myth are \"To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Triumph\" by Anne Sexton, \"Icarus Again\" by Alan Devenish, \"Mrs Icarus\" by Carol Ann Duffy, and \"Icarus Burning\" and \"Icarus Redux\" by Hiromi Yoshida.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLiterary interpretation has found in the myth the structure and consequence of personal over-ambition.   An Icarus-related study of the Daedalus myth was published by the French hellenist Françoise Frontisi-Ducroux.    In psychology there have been synthetic studies of the Icarus complex with respect to the alleged relationship between fascination for fire, enuresis, high ambition, and ascensionism.   In the  psychiatric mind  features of disease were perceived in the shape of the pendulous emotional ecstatic-high and depressive-low of  bipolar disorder. Henry Murray having proposed  the term Icarus complex, apparently  found symptoms particularly in mania where a person is fond of heights, fascinated by both fire and water, narcissistic and observed with fantastical or far-fetched imaginary cognition.\nQuestion:\nWhat legendary figure flew too close to the sun?\nAnswer:\nIcharus\n", "answers": ["2", "Two", "two"], "length": 3056, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c392f62eb05235efcd5d07680c3cd7acc53f50726004165d"}

It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on “shaking palsy” a disease whose cause is still unknown.\n1. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.\n2. The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2\n3. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.  The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.\n4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson’s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.\nA. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as “pill rolling” because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.\nB. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.\nC. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.\n5.   Genetic factors associated with Parkinson’s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures\nto chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson’s disease.\n6.  Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient’s functional ability.\n7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson’s disease because malnutrition and constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow\nthemselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.\n8. Parkinson’s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Each patient must be evaluated to determine which medication is best for them. Some drug classes\ninclude; Dopamine Agonists, Anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors and Carbidopa/Levodopa. Levodopa is the most effective and is being used in 70 to 80 percent of all Parkinson’s patients.\n9.  Parkinson’s disease can be treated surgically through deep brain stimulation (DBS). This involves placing an electrode in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus and connecting it to a generator placed in the upper chest. The device delivers a specific current to the brain to improve motor function. This procedure is reversible if needed.\n10. Parkinson’s disease interesting opinions: Adolf Hitler is said to have had the disease, people who smoke and drink are less likely to develop the disease, and Japan is the only country in the world that has more women than men with Parkinson’s disease.\nReferences\nPDF founder William Black.

The Reversing Falls of St. John are located on a gorge that leads into the Bay of Fundy. At low tide, the water from the gorge comes cascading down on its way to the bay. At high tide, however, which in this part of the world is excessive, the bay's water level rises 5 feet higher than that of the river itself. That causes a \"bore,\" or rushing tide, to flow back into the river, and thus it pushes the water back up the falls.\nThe salt in seawater comes primarily from the fresh water that flows into the sea. As streams and rivers flow across the land, they absorb a great deal of salt from rocks and the earth, and they carry this salt out to sea. There the fresh water evaporates and leaves the salt deposits behind.\nAnne Boleyn, one of two unfortunate wives of Henry VIII sent to die in the Tower of London, had six toes on one foot, six fingers on one hand and three breasts.

Dominated by the Rocky Mountains, Idaho's Shoshone Falls on the Snake River,   drops 212 feet making it higher than Niagara             Falls . Hells Canyon , also on the Snake River,   is a gorge that is deeper than the Grand Canyon.  More             about Shoshone Falls .\nIdaho can be divided into three major land regions geographically;   the Rocky Mountains, the Columbia Plateau and the Basin and Ridge Region.\nRocky Mountains: The Rocky Mountains area is the state's largest area and extends from the Idaho Panhandle (That's   the narrow strip of Idaho that runs between Washington and Montana and borders Canada.) south and along the Wyoming border.  The Rocky   Mountains area is characterized by steep gorges, deep canyons and swift streams and rivers. Idaho has 50   mountain peaks that climb into the sky over 10,000 feet. Borah Peak , Idaho's   highest point rises 12,662 feet above sea level.\nThe Bitterroot Mountain Range lies along the Montana border in the Idaho Panhandle.  The Continental Divide   passes through Idaho in the Bitterroots. Visit the Bitterroot National Forest .\nThe Coeur d'Alene Mountains in the northern Panhandle lie to the west of the Bitterroot Mountain Range.   This triangular area of mountains stretches from Lake Pend Orielle in the north to Coeur d'Alene Lake in the   south. The highest peak in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains is Grizzly Mountain at 5, 950 feet.\nSouth of the Coeur d'Alene Mountains are the Clearwater Mountains and south   of the Clearwater Mountains are the Salmon River Mountains. The Bighorn Crags , bare   granite worn into sharp ridges and spires, are found in the Salmon River Mountains.  This mountain range is   almost completely circled by the Salmon River.\nSouth of the Salmon River Mountains are the impressive Sawtooth Mountains ;   an extremely rugged series of granite peaks and beautiful meadows and alpine lakes. 33 mountains in this range   exceed 10,000 feet above sea level.\nThe Seven Devils Mountains rise along Idaho's border with Oregon in the west. To the west of the Seven Devils Mountains , lies the Snake   River and Hells Canyon .  From the summits of the Seven Devils Mountains to the bed of the Snake River, the deepest   gorge in North America is over 7,800 feet, deeper than the Grand Canyon.\nIn central Idaho, the Lost River Range extends 70 miles, northwest to southeast, from the Salmon River   almost to Arco. It's bordered on the west by the Big Lost River Valley and the Salmon River and on the east   by the Little Lost River and Pahsimeroi Valleys.  The Lost River Range is a vast wilderness of snow-capped peaks   and home to Borah Peak , Idaho's   highest mountain as well as six other 12,000 foot peaks.\nThe Lemhi Range runs in a southeasterly direction about 100 miles from the Salmon River to the Snake River Plains.  This chain   of mountains is from 10 to 15 miles wide. The Lemhi Range is bordered on the west by Pahsimeroi and Little   Lost River valleys and on the east by the Lemhi and Birch Creek Valleys. The highest point in the Lemhi   Range is Diamond Peak at 12,197 above sea level.\nFurther south, the Blackfoot Mountains form a group of barren ridges that trend from northwest to   southeast for more than 50 miles between Idaho Falls and Soda Springs. From the west, slopes of the   Blackfoot Mountains climb roughly 2,400 feet above the Snake River. On the east, the slopes rise   only 600 feet above Willow Creek and the Blackfoot River. Blackfoot Peak is the highest point in this   range at 7, 404 feet. Wolverine Canyon, a scenic gorge, is on the western slope of the Blackfoot Mountains.\nQuestion:\nTo ten thousand square miles, what is the area of Idaho?\nAnswer:\n82751 area\nPassage:\nGoose\nGeese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese). A number of other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have \"goose\" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"goose\" is a direct descendent of Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root gave Old English gōs with the plural gēs and gandres (becoming Modern English goose, geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), Frisian goes, gies and guoske, New High German Gans, Gänse, and Ganter, and Old Norse gās. This term also gave Lithuanian žąsìs, Irish gé (goose, from Old Irish géiss), Latin anser, Greek χήν/khēn, Dutch gans, Albanian gatë (heron), Sanskrit hamsa and hamsi, Finnish hanhi, Avestan zāō, Polish gęś, Ukrainian гуска and гусак, Russian гусыня and гусь, Czech husa, and Persian ghāz. \n\nThe term goose applies to the female in particular, while gander applies to the male in particular. Young birds before fledging are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump. \n\nTrue geese \n\nThe three living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey geese, including the greylag goose, and domestic geese; Chen, white geese (often included in Anser); and Branta, black geese, such as the Canada goose.\n\nTwo genera of \"geese\" are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like Coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese.\n\nFossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named Anser atavus (meaning \"progenitor goose\") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nGeese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.\n\nOther birds called \"geese\" \n\nA number of mainly Southern Hemisphere birds are called \"geese\", most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. These are:\n* Orinoco goose, Neochen jubata\n* Egyptian goose, Alopochen aegyptiacus\n* The South American sheldgeese, genus Chloephaga\n* The prehistoric Madagascar sheldgoose, Centrornis majori\n\nThe spur-winged goose, Plectropterus gambensis, is most closely related to the shelducks, but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.\n\nThe blue-winged goose, Cyanochen cyanopterus, and the Cape Barren goose, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, have disputed affinities. They belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the Tadorninae, Anserinae, or closer to the dabbling ducks (Anatinae).\n\nThe three species of small waterfowl in the genus Nettapus are named \"pygmy geese\". They seem to represent another ancient lineage, with possible affinities to the Cape Barren goose or the spur-winged goose.\n\nA genus of prehistorically extinct seaducks, Chendytes, is sometimes called \"diving-geese\" due to their large size.\n\nThe unusual magpie goose is in a family of its own, the Anseranatidae.\n\nThe northern gannet, a seabird, is also known as the \"Solan goose\", although it is a bird unrelated to the true geese, or any other Anseriformes for that matter.\n\nIn popular culture \n \n\nThere are a number of well-known sayings regarding geese.\n\n\"What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\" means what's appropriate treatment for one person is equally appropriate for someone else.\n\nSaying that someone's \"goose is cooked\" means that they have suffered, or are about to suffer, a terrible setback or misfortune.\" \n\n\"Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" derived from an old fable, is a saying referring to any greed-motivated, unprofitable action that destroys or otherwise renders a favorable situation useless.\n\n\"A wild goose chase\" that one goes on or sends someone else on is a useless, futile waste of time and effort.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the collective name for a flock of geese in flight, especially in V-formation?\nAnswer:\nSkein\nPassage:\nKeebler Company\nThe Keebler Company is the largest cookie and cracker manufacturer in the United States. Founded in 1853, it has produced numerous baked snacks. Keebler has marketed its brands such as Cheez-It (which have the Sunshine Biscuits brand), Chips Deluxe, Club Crackers, E.L. Fudge Cookies, Famous Amos, Fudge Shoppe Cookies, Murray cookies, Austin, Plantation, Vienna Fingers, Town House Crackers, Wheatables, Sandie's Shortbread, Chachos and Zesta Crackers, among others.\nThe Keebler slogans are \"Uncommonly Good\" and \"a little elfin magic goes a long way\". Tom Shutter and Leo Burnett wrote the familiar jingle.\n\nCompany history \n\nGodfrey Keebler, of German descent, opened a bakery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1853. In 1927, this bakery and others formed the United Biscuit Company, which at one point was headquartered in West Drayton, Middlesex, England.\n\nKeebler-Weyl Bakery became the official baker of Girl Scout Cookies in 1936, the first commercial company to bake the cookies (the scouts and their mothers had done it previously). By 1978, four companies were producing the cookies.  Little Brownie Bakers is the Keebler division still licensed to produce the cookies.\n\nKeebler was acquired by United Biscuits in 1974.  In 1995, United Biscuits sold Keebler to a partnership between Flowers Industries and Artal Luxembourg, a private equity firm.  Artal Luxembourg sold its holdings in Keebler in an IPO in 1998. \n\nIn March 2001, The Keebler Company was acquired by the Kellogg Company. At that time, headquarters were based in Elmhurst, Illinois.  Currently, Keebler has manufacturing plants in United States, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\nKeebler Elves \n\nThe animated Keebler Elves, led by \"Ernest J. Keebler\", or \"Ernie\", rank among the best-known characters from commercials. The elves have appeared in countless television advertisements throughout the years, shown baking their unique products. In the commercials, The Keebler tree logo is often turned into the tree in which the elves reside.\n\nLeo Burnett Worldwide, an advertising agency, created the elves in 1968, calling the bakery \"The Hollow Tree Factory.\"\n\nJ.J. Keebler was the \"\" original head elf in 1969 and was featured in a classroom film about how animated commercials are made, \"Show and Sell\", with J.J.'s voice done by Alan Reed Sr. Ernie Keebler became \"head elf\" in 1970.  White-haired Ernie wears a green jacket, a white shirt with a yellow tie, a red vest, and floppy shoes.\n\nErnie Keebler was first voiced by Walker Edmiston, and then later by Parley Baer. and then Andre Stojka.\n\nOther elves were Fryer Tuck (who promoted \"Munch-ems\"), Zoot and J.J. (known for Pizzarias), Ernie's mother Ma Keebler, young Elmer Keebler, Buckets (who threw fudge on the cookies), Fast Eddie (who wrapped the products), Sam (the peanut butter baker), Roger (the jeweler), Doc (the doctor and cookie maker), Zack (the fudge shoppe supervisor), Flo (the accountant), Leonardo (the artist), Elwood (who ran through the dough), Professor, Edison, Larry and Art.\nMany of the Keebler commercials were narrated by the announcer Danny Dark. The first Keebler elves were drawn by children's author/illustrator and commercial artist Roger Bradfield.\n\nList of Keebler Snacks\n\nExamples of Keebler products include: \n* 100 Calorie Right Bites,\n* Vienna Fingers Reduced Fat cookies,\n* Chips Deluxe Chocolate Lovers cookies,\n* Chips Deluxe Rainbow cookies,\n* Animals Frosted cookies,\n* Grahams Cinnamon,\n* Ice Cream Cups,\n* Grahams Original,\n* Club® variety, including Original, Reduced,\n* Fat crackers, Multigrain, minis,\n* Keebler Fudge Shoppe Cookies\n* Pizzerias\n* Simply Made cookies \n* Munch'Ems \n\nIn popular culture \n\n* In the Angel season 5 episode \"Power Play,\" Spike says to Drogan, a hero who lives in a fortress that is entered through a hole in a tree, \"Oh, so you tacked up a sign on your tree, waved bye to the Keeblers, hopped the puddle and somehow managed to sniff me out in a city of ten million?\"\nQuestion:\nWho has been the “head” elf in the Keebler Cookie Tree since 1970?\nAnswer:\nErnie (disambiguation)\n", "answers": ["Notable sufferers of parkinson's disease", "Symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Signs of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons", "Pakinson's Disease", "Parkinson's", "Parkinsonism, primary", "Parkinston's disease", "Shaking Palsy", "Hypokinetic rigid syndrome", "Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson's disease and Diet", "Morbus Parkinson", "Motor symptoms parkinson's disease", "Parkinsonians", "Antiparkinsonism", "Shaking palsy", "Parkinson’s", "Neuropsychiatric symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Epidemiology of parkinson's disease", "History of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s Disease", "Parkinsons' disease", "Diagnosis of parkinson's disease", "Prognosis of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson disease", "Parkinsons Disease", "Traumatic Parkinson's", "Parkinson's disease research directions", "Parkinson's Disease", "Causes of parkinson's disease", "Research directions in parkinson's disease", "Parkinston’s disease", "Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s disease", "Pathophysiology of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons' Disease", "Classification of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons disease", "Parkinsonian tremor", "Research directions of parkinson's disease", "Paralysis agitans", "Parkinsonian tremors", "Genetic causes of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson facies"], "length": 3756, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c4b386c53685937af74499b525d67f81ae166c5503849214"}

It is first sung in the musical by the character Alex Dillingham, which was originated by Michael Ball in both the London and Broadway casts.  The song was released as a single in 1989, also sung by Ball,  and stayed in the UK singles chart for 14 weeks, peaking at #2 and becoming Ball's signature tune.  The song was later featured on Ball's 1992 self titled debut album and Love Changes Everything: The Collection.   \n\nIn the prologue to Aspects of Love, a young Englishman, Alex, is lovestruck by a French actress, Rose. This upends his world, and he sings that \"Love changes everything ... How you live and / How you die\" for better or for worse.  He notes that love \"Makes fools of everyone\" and concludes that, once love strikes, \"Nothing in the / World will ever / Be the same.\"  Musically, it is a \"simple, effective three-chord piano-accompanied anthem\".  The song became the best-known number from Aspects of Love and it \"delivered yet more proof that Andrew Lloyd Webber could deliver soaring, anthemic ballads\".  \n\nThe song was featured at the 44th Tony Awards.  Artists who have covered it include Jonathan Antoine, John Barrowman, Sarah Brightman, Michael Crawford, Il Divo (with Michael Ball), Audra McDonald, Nana Mouskouri, Marti Webb, Opportunity Knocks winner Mark Rattray, Anthony Warlow, and Hayley Westenra.

The total area is 21 square kilometers (8.1 sq mi). The December 2 to 6 census puts the population at 9,275. The 2009 estimate is 14,019. The density is 476.2/km2. The island can be found at the South Pacific.\nGeneral Information\nNauru is the tiniest independent republic on the planet. It also holds the distinction of being the only republic that doesn’t have a capital. Based on archaeological findings, the island was first inhabited by Polynesians and Micronesians over 3,000 years ago. A dozen tribes were on the island. This can be seen by the 12 points on its flag.\nEarly History\nThe smallest island nation in the world had its first European visitor in 1798. It was a whaler named Captain John Fearn. Other Europeans would get wind of it. European criminals and deserters would often escape to the island.\nThe local inhabitants began trading food for firearms. This practice would lead to a tribal war. The Nauruan Tribal War lasted for ten years. It devastated the island and reduced the population by 1/3.\nThe 1800s and World War I\nThe war ended in 1888 when the nation fell under German rule. The war ended when the Germans forbade firearms and alcohol. The island nation became part of the German Marshall Islands Protectorate. Christian missionaries began arriving that year as well.\nThe Germans lost Nauru to the UK during World War I. The island nation would become part of the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These countries took control of the phosphate mining in Nauru.\nWorld War II and Independence\nThe country fell to the Japanese in World War II. Over a thousand native inhabitants were sent to the Chuuk Islands for slave work. It was liberated by the Allies in 1945.\nThe UN designated administrative rights to the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Nauru was granted independence in 1966. Operation and ownership of the phosphate deposits were given to the country.\nPopulation\nIndigenous peoples make up most of the country’s population. 58% are native to the island while 26% are Pacific Islanders. Europeans and some Chinese constitute the remaining eight percent. The dominant religion is Christianity.\nThe smallest island nation also has numerous minority religions. The most prominent is Baha'i. The per capita income is $2,500 (2006 estimates). It still doesn’t have a capital, but Yaren is the seat of government. It is also the most populated area.\nFollow Us!\nQuestion:\nAt 21 square kilometers, which is the world's smallest island nation?\nAnswer:\nList of islands of Nauru\nPassage:\nQuality control\nQuality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as \"A part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements\". \n\nThis approach places an emphasis on three aspects:\n# Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes,   performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records\n# Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.\n\nControls include product inspection, where every product is examined visually, and often using a stereo microscope for fine detail before the product is sold into the external market. Inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface blemishes for example.\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is deficient in any way.\n\nQuality control emphasizes testing of products to uncover defects and reporting to management who make the decision to allow or deny product release, whereas quality assurance attempts to improve and stabilize production (and associated processes) to avoid, or at least minimize, issues which led to the defect(s) in the first place. For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract. \n\nNotable approaches to quality control\n\nThere is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:\n\nQuality control in project management\n\nIn project management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the project scope.  In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality control team which focuses on this area.\nQuestion:\nWhat does T.Q.C. mean in manufacturing industry ?\nAnswer:\nQuality Standards\nPassage:\nJerry Kasenetz\nJerry Kasenetz (born May 5, 1943, Brooklyn, New York) is an American bubblegum pop producer who worked with Jeff Katz, the two working together as the Super K Productions company,  to manufacture and produce bands such as Shadows of Knight, Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, The Music Explosion, 1910 Fruitgum Company, Crazy Elephant, and The Ohio Express.\nQuestion:\nThe name of what genre has its origin in what producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz had in their mouths when they discussed music targeting the younger crowd?\nAnswer:\nBubblegum Pop/Bubblegum Rock\nPassage:\nKielder Water\nKielder Water   is a large artificial reservoir in Northumberland in North East England.  It is the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity and it is surrounded by Kielder Forest, the largest man-made woodland in Europe. The scheme was planned in the late 1960s to satisfy an expected rise in demand for water to support a booming UK industrial economy. But the decline of traditional heavy industry, together with more water-efficient industrial processes and better control of water supply leakage, served to undermine the original justification for the reservoir and many came to criticise the government-funded project as a white elephant. \n\nKielder Water is owned by Northumbrian Water, and holds 200 billion litres (44 billion gallons, or 0.2 cubic km), making it the largest reservoir in the UK by capacity (Rutland Water is the largest by surface area).  It has a  shoreline, and is 39.7 km (24.6 miles) from the sea. \n\nConstruction\n\nAfter the scheme was approved by Parliament in 1974, work to build the reservoir and the dam in the Kielder Valley began in 1975. The reservoir and dam was designed for Northumbrian Water by consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw and Morton.     with Sir Frederick Gibberd and Partners as consulting architect.  Earth moving and infrastructure construction was undertaken in a joint venture with AMEC and Balfour Beatty. \n\nThe design meant the loss of numerous farms and a school. The former permanent way of the Border Counties Railway was also taken away through the development of the reservoir.\n\nWork was completed in 1981. Elizabeth II officially opened the project the following year. The valley took a further two years to fill with water completely.\n\nHydro electric plant\n\nKielder Water is also the site of England's largest hydro electric plant. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1982 and is owned by Northumbrian Water. In December 2005, RWE Npower Renewables bought the rights to operate the plant and sell the electricity generated by it, with a contract lasting until 2025. Following the takeover, the turbines were refurbished in 2005–2006, which increased the efficiency of the electricity generation. Controls were also updated, meaning that the plant can be operated from Dolgarrog in Wales.\n\nThe plant generates electricity using dual turbines which produce 6 megawatts (MW) of electricity. This comes from a combination of a 5.5 MW Kaplan turbine, which generates electricity when water release takes place, and a 500 kilowatt (kW) Francis turbine that generates constantly from the compensation flow of water from the reservoir into the North Tyne. This gives the reservoir an average production of 20,000 MWh of electricity per year, a saving of 8,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to fossil fuel based methods of generation.\n\nOperations\n\nThe reservoir's main use is to provide compensating discharges into the North Tyne to support abstractions of water further downstream. It also underpins the £167m Kielder Transfer Scheme, where water can be transferred to the Wear and the Tees rivers, to meet shortfalls in those areas. In recent years, Kielder Water has become increasingly important, with underground springs ensuring that it always remains at high levels, regardless of the prevailing climate condition. This means that while the south of England is often forced to implement drought strategies and hosepipe bans, north east England enjoys plentiful water supplies.\n\nThere are two main visitor centres at Kielder Water—Leaplish waterside park and Tower Knowe visitor centre—and other facilities at Kielder, Falstone and Stannersburn villages. It is also one of the region's major tourist venues, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year who come to enjoy the wide range of leisure opportunities on offer.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n=\nQuestion:\nKielder Water is the largest artificial lake in the UK.

It was directed by Anthony Asquith and starred Michael Redgrave.\n\nPlot\n\nAndrew Crocker-Harris is an aging Classics master at an English public school, and is forced into retirement by his increasing ill health. The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final few days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realization that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school.\n\nThe emotional turning-point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, Robert Browning's translation of the Agamemnon, which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master.\"\n\nDifferences between play and film\n\nRattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends on Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with warm applause and cheers by the boys. The film ends with a conversation between Crocker-Harris and Taplow, and the suggestion that Crocker-Harris will complete his translation of the Agamemnon.\n\nCast\n\n* Michael Redgrave as the embittered Andrew Crocker-Harris\n* Jean Kent as his wife Millie\n* Nigel Patrick as her lover Frank Hunter, Andrew's fellow schoolmaster who eventually rejects Millie for her cruelty towards her husband\n* Ronald Howard as Gilbert, Crocker-Harris's successor\n* Wilfrid Hyde-White as the Headmaster\n* Brian Smith as Taplow\n* Bill Travers as Fletcher\n* Judith Furse as Mrs. Williamson\n* Peter Jones as Carstairs\n* Sarah Lawson as Betty Carstairs\n* Scott Harold as Rev.

The school exteriors were filmed on location at the Sherborne School in Sherborne, Dorset.\n\nThe Greek text that appears on the blackboard in Crocker-Harris's classroom is from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?docPerseus:text:1999.01.0003:line\n403 the Agamemnon].

Films  rated X are intended only for viewing by adults, usually legally defined as people over the age of 18 or 21.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Australian Classification Board (ACB), a government institution, issues ratings for all movies and television shows exhibited, televised, sold or hired in Australia. Material showing explicit, non-simulated consensual sex that is pornographic in nature is rated X18+.\n\nPeople under 18 may not buy, rent, exhibit or view these films. The exhibition or sale of these films to people under the age of 18 years is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,500.\nFilms classified as X18+ are banned from being sold or rented in most Australian states. They are legally available to be sold or hired in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. \nImporting X18+ material from these territories to any of the Australian states is legal, as the constitution forbids any restrictions on trade between the states and territories. \n\nThe X18+ rating does not exist for video games.\n\nFrance\n\nFilms may be shown in theaters in France only after classification by an administrative commission of the ministry of Culture. In 1975, the X classification (officially: \"pornographic or violence-inciting movies\") was created for pornographic movies, or movies with successions of scenes of graphic violence. The commission has some leeway in classification, it may for instance take into account the artistic qualities of a movie not to count it pornographic.\nMovies with an X rating may only be shown in specific theaters (which hardly exist nowadays in France); they bear special taxes and tax rates, including a 33% tax on revenue.\nIn 2000, some conservative associations sued the government for granting the movie Baise-moi, which contained graphic, realistic scenes of sex and violence, a non-X classification. The Conseil d'État at litigation ruled that the movie should have been rated X. The decision was highly controversial, and some suggested changing the law under which it was rated 18.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe original X certificate, replacing the H certificate, was issued between 1951 and 1982 by the British Board of Film Censors in the United Kingdom. It was introduced as a result of the Wheare Report on film censorship. From 1951 to 1970, it meant \"Suitable for those aged 16 and over,\" and from 1970 to 1982 it was redefined as meaning \"Suitable for those aged 18 and over\". The X certificate was replaced in November 1982 by the 18 certificate.\n\nSometimes the rating of a film has changed significantly over time. For example, the French film  Jules and Jim received an X rating in 1962 that was changed to a PG rating in 1991.  In some early cases, films politically motivated received an X rating. The Battleship Potemkin was rejected for \"inflammatory subtitles and Bolshevik propaganda\" in 1926, rated X in 1954, and finally rated PG in 1987. \n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, the X rating was applied to a film that contained content judged unsuitable for children, such as extreme violence, strongly implied sex, and graphic language. When the MPAA film rating system began in the US on November 1, 1968, the X rating was given to a film by the MPAA if submitted to it or, due to its non-trademarked status, it could be self-applied to a film by a distributor that knew beforehand that its film contained content unsuitable for minors. From the late 1960s to about the mid-1980s, many mainstream films were released with an X rating such as Midnight Cowboy, Last of the Mobile Hot Shots, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, A Clockwork Orange, Fritz the Cat, Last Tango in Paris and The Evil Dead. (Films that achieved critical and commercial success were later re-rated R after minor cuts, including Midnight Cowboy and A Clockwork Orange.) The threat of an X rating also encouraged filmmakers to re-edit their films to achieve an R rating. Certain films, such as Cruising (1980), received an R rating that some theatre owners felt should have been an X (Cruising was withdrawn from distribution after it was clear that required cuts to obtain the R rating had not been made). \n\nBecause the X rating was not trademarked, anybody could apply it to their films, including pornographers, as many began to do in the 1970s. As pornography began to become chic and more legally tolerated, pornographers placed an X rating on their films to emphasize the adult content. Some even started using multiple X's (i.e. XX, XXX, etc.) to give the impression that their film contained more graphic sexual content than the simple X rating. In some cases, the X ratings were applied by reviewers or film scholars, e.g. William Rotsler, who wrote \"The XXX-rating means hard-core, the XX-rating is for simulation, and an X-rating is for comparatively cool films.\"  Nothing beyond the simple X rating has ever been officially recognized by the MPAA. Because of the heavy use of the X rating by pornographers, it became associated largely with pornographic films, so that non-pornographic films given an X rating would have fewer theaters willing to book them and fewer venues for advertising. Moreover, many newspapers refused to advertise X rated films. This led to a number of films being released unrated sometimes with a warning that the film contained content for adults only. In response, the MPAA eventually agreed in 1990 to a new NC-17 rating that would be trademarked, and could only be applied by the MPAA itself. By trademarking the rating, the MPAA committed to defending a NC-17 film charged with violating obscenity laws.\nQuestion:\nWhich was the first X-rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture?\nAnswer:\nMidnight cowboy\nPassage:\nWarren Clarke\nWarren Clarke  (26 April 1947 – 12 November 2014) was an English actor. He was known for his appearances in many films after a significant role as Dim in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and for numerous television appearances, including lead roles in the TV series Dalziel and Pascoe (as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel), The Manageress and Sleepers.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Alan James Clarke in Oldham, Lancashire, his father worked as a stained-glass maker and his mother as a secretary. \nHe left Barlow Hall Secondary Modern School, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, aged 15 and began work at the Manchester Evening News as a copy boy. He later moved on to amateur dramatics and performed at Huddersfield Rep before working as an actor full-time.  During this period he also decided to change his first name to Warren, a name he chose as his girlfriend of the time had a crush on Warren Beatty.\n\nCareer\n\nClarke's first television appearance was in the long-running Granada soap opera Coronation Street, initially as Kenny Pickup in 1966 and then as Gary Bailey in 1968. His first major film appearance was in Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (1971) where he played a 'droog' named 'Dim' opposite Malcolm McDowell. He appeared with McDowell again in the film O Lucky Man! (1973) and in the TV film Gulag (1985).\n\nClarke appeared in a wide range of roles in television and film productions including The Breaking of Bumbo (1970), Home (1970) opposite Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud, Charlton Heston's Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), S.O.S. Titanic (1979), Hawk the Slayer (1980), Masada (1981), Enigma (1982), Lassiter (1984), Top Secret! (1984), Ishtar, (1987) and I.D. (1995). He played a Russian dissident in Clint Eastwood's Firefox (1982).\n\nIn Granada Television's series The Jewel in the Crown (1984) Clarke played the role of the overtly homosexual 'Sophie' Dixon, and he was Colonel Krieger in the first series of LWT's Wish Me Luck (1988). In 1989 Clarke played the Captain Lee in the film Crusoe. The same year he played the role of Martin Fisher, the chairman of a football club, in The Manageress and the role of Managing Director of an engineering firm, Vic Wilcox, in the TV adaptation of the David Lodge novel Nice Work. He also starred in an episode of Lovejoy entitled \"Bin Diving\". Clarke played Larry Patterson in Gone to the Dogs (1991), which was followed by the series Gone to Seed (1992), in which Clarke again starred.  He also appeared in Our Mutual Friend (the 1976 TV mini-series) as Bradley Headstone.\n\nIn Sleepers (1991), alongside Nigel Havers, Clarke played one of the two lead roles as two KGB sleeper agents living in Britain and leading their own lives until they are reactivated. He played Bamber in the ITV comedy-drama Moving Story (1994). His comedic talents can be seen in the one-off special Blackadder: The Cavalier Years, in which he played Oliver Cromwell, and in the episode \"Amy and Amiability\" of the series Blackadder the Third. From 1996 he appeared regularly as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel in the TV series Dalziel and Pascoe.  In 1997 he starred in the drama The Locksmith. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 Clarke played Brian Addis, a father who moved his family from the bustle of London to a Devon farm, in the BBC TV series Down to Earth. He appeared as Mr Boythorn in the BBC One dramatisation of Bleak House (2005) and starred alongside Anthony Head in the BBC Drama The Invisibles (2008) and in the Channel 4 trilogy Red Riding (2009). Around the same time, Clarke appeared as Commander Peters in the ITV production of Agatha Christie's Marple Why Didn't They Ask Evans? (2009) and the BBC series Inspector George Gently (\"Peace and Love\", 2010) and played Mr Bott in Just William (also 2010).  He guested as innkeeper Samuel Quested in Midsomer Murders (\"The Night of the Stag\", 2011) and as John Lacey in Call the Midwife (also 2011).\n\nIn 2014 he began filming Poldark as Charles Poldark. The character's final scene in the series, in episode four in which Poldark lies on his deathbed before dying, was also Clarke's own final scene as an actor: he was very ill at the time of filming and died a few weeks later, and the first episode of the television series was then dedicated to his memory.  \n\nPersonal life\n\nClarke was a keen golfer and had been a Manchester City supporter from the age of seven. \n\nClarke’s marriage to his first wife ended in divorce a few years after his parents died. They had a son together, Rowan. He also had a daughter, Georgia. \n\nOn 12 November 2014 Clarke died in his sleep, after a short illness. He is survived by his second wife Michelle, their daughter Georgia and his son.\nQuestion:\nFor playing which detective, created by Reginald Hill, on television was Warren Clarke perhaps best known?\nAnswer:\n(Detective Superintendent) Andy Dalziel\n", "answers": ["Chief inspector of prisons", "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons", "Chief Inspector of Prisons", "HM Inspector of Prisons", "(CHIEF) INSPECTOR OF PRISONS", "Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons", "HM Inspectorate of Prisons"], "length": 2599, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "649a8c0ed52d328838bf66bac9bf291fbe586df09d8ae890"}

The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caffè and Il Giorno. Each story takes a scientific \"fact\" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero.\n\nAll of the stories in Cosmicomics, together with those from t zero and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin UK, 2009).\n\nThe first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html \"National Book Awards – 1969\"].

Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.\n*At Daybreak — Life before matter condenses.\n*A Sign in Space — The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory — that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.\n*All at One Point — The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  \"Naturally, we were all there—old Qfwfq said—where else could we have been?

The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like \"civilized\" people.\n*How Much Shall We Bet — A story about betting on the long term evolution of mankind.\n*The Dinosaurs — How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.\n*The Form of Space — As the unnamed narrator \"falls\" through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H'x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).\n*The Light Years — The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies, and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying \"I saw you.\"  Given that there's a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day, and finds out that it was something he wished to hide.

Tony Jacklin shot under-par in all four rounds on his way to a seven-stroke victory and his only U.S. Open title, the second of his two major championships. He was the first golfer born in England to win the title since Cyril Walker at the 1924 U.S. Open.\n\nJacklin led wire-to-wire and was hardly threatened throughout the championship. He took a four-shot lead over Dave Hill into the final round, and despite bogeys at the 7th and 8th, made a long birdie putt at 9 to quell any talk of a collapse. Jacklin shot a third consecutive round of 70 and a 281 total, seven clear of the field and the only player under par.\n\nOpened eight years earlier, Hazeltine was hosting its first major championship, and reviews were less than positive.

Britain took possession of the Dutch Cape colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, sparking resistance from the independence-minded Boers, who resented the Anglicization of South Africa and Britain’s anti-slavery policies. In 1833, the Boers began an exodus into African tribal territory, where they founded the republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The two new republics lived peaceably with their British neighbors until 1867, when the discovery of diamonds and gold in the region made conflict between the Boer states and Britain inevitable.\nMinor fighting with Britain began in the 1890s, and in October 1899 full-scale war ensued. By mid June 1900, British forces had captured most major Boer cities and formally annexed their territories, but the Boers launched a guerrilla war that frustrated the British occupiers. Beginning in 1901, the British began a strategy of systematically searching out and destroying these guerrilla units, while herding the families of the Boer soldiers into concentration camps. By 1902, the British had crushed the Boer resistance, and on May 31 of that year the Peace of Vereeniging was signed, ending hostilities.\nThe treaty recognized the British military administration over Transvaal and the Orange Free State and authorized a general amnesty for Boer forces. In 1910, the autonomous Union of South Africa was established by the British. It included Transvaal, the Orange Free State, the Cape of Good Hope, and Natal as provinces.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWhat major war began on 10 October, 1899?\nAnswer:\nThe Boer War\nPassage:\nHistory of the Iron Lung or Respirator - About.com Money\nHistory of the Iron Lung or Respirator\nBy Mary Bellis\nUpdated August 06, 2016.\nBy definition the iron lung is \"an airtight metal tank that encloses all of the body except the head and forces the lungs to inhale and exhale through regulated changes in air pressure.\"\nAccording to Robert Hall author of History of the British Iron Lung, the first scientist to appreciate the mechanics of respiration was John Mayow.\nJohn Mayow\nIn 1670, John Mayow demonstrated that air is drawn into the lungs by enlarging the thoracic cavity. He built a model using bellows inside which was inserted a bladder. Expanding the bellows caused air to fill the bladder and compressing the bellows expelled air form the bladder. This was the principle of artificial respiration called \"external negative pressure ventilation\" or ENPV that would lead to the invention of the iron lung and other respirators.\nIron Lung Respirator - Philip Drinker\nThe first modern and practical respirator nicknamed the \"iron lung\" was invented by Harvard medical researchers Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw in 1927.\ncontinue reading below our video\nWhat to Do If Your Identity is Stolen\nThe inventors used an iron box and two vacuum cleaners to build their prototype respirator. Almost the length of a subcompact car, the iron lung exerted a push-pull motion on the chest.\nIn 1927, the first iron lung was installed at Bellevue hospital in New York City. The first patients of the iron lung were polio sufferers with chest paralysis.\nLater, John Emerson improved upon Philip Drinkers invention and invented an iron lung that cost half as much to manufacture.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name for the negative pressure generator invented by Robert Henderson and used extensively by Phillip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw?\nAnswer:\nNegative pressure ventilator\nPassage:\nAlpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill\nThe Men's Downhill competition of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid was held at Whiteface Mountain on Thursday, February 14.\n\nThe defending world champion was Josef Walcher of Austria, while Switzerland's Peter Müller was the defending World Cup downhill champion and led the 1980 World Cup.\nDefending Olympic champion Franz Klammer did not compete; he was not selected to the Austrian Olympic team in 1980.\n\nGold medalist Leonhard Stock was an alternate on the Austrian downhill team, at the Olympics for the slalom.

It is the site of a number of now-defunct sardine canning factories. The last cannery closed in 1973. The street name, formerly a nickname for Ocean View Avenue, became official in January 1958 to honor John Steinbeck and his well-known novel Cannery Row.  In the novel's opening sentence, Steinbeck described the street as \"a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\"\n\nHistory\n\nCannery Row was the setting of John Steinbeck's novels Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). Both were the basis for the 1982 movie Cannery Row, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.  It is also mentioned in Bob Dylan's song \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\".\nPacific Biological Laboratories, a biological supply house, was located at 800 Ocean View Avenue (now 800 Cannery Row) from 1928 to 1948, and operated by Edward F. Ricketts, who was the inspiration for several characters in Steinbeck novels. The laboratory is still preserved. Across from the laboratory still exists a Chinese-American-owned store mentioned in both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, as well as a vacant lot that was the \"home\" of some of the homeless characters in the novel.\n\nThe canneries failed after the collapse of the fishing industry in Monterey Bay in the mid-1950s, which resulted from a combination of factors, including unfavorable oceanic conditions, over-fishing, and competition from other species.   In his investigation of where the sardines had gone, Ed Ricketts finally concluded \"They're in cans.\" Before the collapse, the fishery was one of the most productive in the world due to the upwelling of cold, yet nutrient-rich water from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean that is funneled to the surface via the vast underwater Monterey Canyon.\n\nOld Hovden Cannery steam boilers\n\nToday\n\nToday the area offshore from Cannery Row is the Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area (part of the larger Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary)   and is home to a large resurgent population of California sea lions. \n\nCannery Row itself is now a tourist attraction with many restaurants and hotels, several of which are located in former cannery buildings, and a few historic attractions. Some privately owned fishing companies still exist on Cannery Row, housed on piers located a short distance from the historic district frequented by tourists. \n\nIn recent years, Cannery Row has become increasingly popular among sport fishermen due to extensive public fishing facilities. MacAbee Beach and San Carlos Beach, which bookend Cannery Row  are both popular spots for kayak-launching; San Carlos Beach is one of Monterey Bay's most popular scuba-diving spots.\n\nThe Monterey Bay Aquarium (opened 1984) is located at the north end of Cannery Row, at the former site of the major Hovden Cannery. Norwegian immigrant Knut Hovden founded Hovden Food Products Corporation which opened on July 7, 1916. By canning squid at the end of its life, Hovden Cannery managed to outlast its neighbors, finally closing its doors in 1973 when it became the last cannery on the row to close.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the novel Cannery Row?\nAnswer:\nJohn Steinbeck III\nPassage:\nBridge of Sighs (Oxford)\nHertford Bridge, popularly known as the Bridge of Sighs, is a skyway joining two parts of Hertford College over New College Lane in Oxford, England. Its distinctive design makes it a city landmark.\n\nMisnomer and myth \n\nThe bridge is often referred to as the Bridge of Sighs because of its supposed similarity to the famous Bridge of Sighs in Venice. However, Hertford Bridge was never intended to be a replica of the Venetian bridge, and indeed it bears a closer resemblance to the Rialto Bridge in the same city.\n\nThere is a false legend saying that many decades ago, a survey of the health of students was taken, and as Hertford College's students were the heaviest, the college closed off the bridge to force them to take the stairs, giving them extra exercise. However, if the bridge is not used, the students actually climb fewer stairs than if they do use the bridge. \n\nBuilding \n\nThe bridge links together the Old and New Quadrangles of Hertford College (to the south and the north respectively), and much of its current architecture was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson.  It was completed in 1914, despite its construction being opposed by New College.\n\nThe building on the southern side of the bridge houses the College's administrative offices, whereas the northern building is mostly student accommodation. The bridge is always open to members of the College, who can often be seen crossing it.\nQuestion:\nIn which foreign city would you be if you were walking over the Bridge of Sighs\nAnswer:\nSestiere (Venice)\n", "answers": ["Almond tree", "Luz (nut)", "Amygdalus amara", "Almond oil", "Marcona almonds", "Mandel (nut)", "Badam", "Almond Bitter Oil", "Prunus dulcis", "Almond trees", "Amygdalus communis", "Almendrado", "Amygdalus dulcis", "Marcona Almonds", "Prunus amygdalus dulcis", "Druparia amygdalus", "Marcona almond", "Marcona Almond", "Prunus amygdalus", "Almond extract", "Amygdalus fragilis", "Amygdalus sativa", "Baadaam", "Oil of bitter almond", "Toasted Almond", "Oleum amygdalae", "Bitter almonds", "Sweet almond oil", "Almond", "لوز", "Almonds", "Oil of Bitter Almonds", "Almond syrup", "Bitter almond"], "length": 2960, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "58cff152249fc6c5b994bf016d4fe88a54d016459b46e86d"}

The company closed its final salary scheme to new members in 2002, but this was not enough to stem rising deficits at the fund due partly to falling share prices and partly to rising long term liabilities and increased longevity.\nAmong the plans to be closed is the Mirror Group fund, which was the victim of former proprietor Robert Maxwell's grab.\nThe scheme has 3,000 active members, and they will now be transferred to a defined-contributions scheme, in which their pension payout is related to the amount they put in, as opposed to a fixed amount related to their salary at the end of their careers. As such, pensions will invariably be less generous than under the previous system.\nPaul Holleran of the National Union of Journalists said: \"The scrapping of the final-salary scheme is the latest in a long line of attacks on staff at Trinity Mirror and serious questions need to be asked and answered about the capability of the senior Trinity\ndirectors.\"\nThe group owns five national newspapers, more than 120 regional titles and over 400 digital products, but has struggled in the face of the recession and a sharp fall in advertising revenues.\nThe Daily Mail's owner Daily Mail and General Trust recently shut its own final salary scheme to new members, and the number of defined benefit schemes throughout the private sector is falling fast.\nThe pair are not the only newspaper groups to be struggling. The Observer – the Sunday newspaper owned by the Guardian Media Group – is set from next week to reduce the number of sections to only four. The Scott Trust, the charity that owns GMG, ruled out shutting the title and replacing it with a Guardian-branded edition.\nIts staff will learn which magazines and sections – and how many full-time staff – will survive this week,\nQuestion:\nWho was the owner of Mirror Group newspapers who misused the pension fund\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTake Your Pick!\nTake Your Pick! was a United Kingdom game show originally broadcast by Radio Luxembourg in the early 1950s. The show transferred to television in 1955 with the launch of ITV, where it continued until 1968. As it was the first game show broadcast on commercial television in the UK (and the BBC did not at that point offer monetary prizes on its game shows), it was also by default the first British game show to offer cash prizes.The programme was later revived from 24 February 1992 to 28 August 1998.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first television version was produced by Associated-Rediffusion (later Rediffusion London), while the revival was made by Thames Television (whose arrival as the new London weekday ITV company had led to the original show's demise).\n\nIf they got through the \"Yes-No Interlude\" (in which they had to answer a series of questions without using the words \"yes\" or \"no\" or be gonged off the stage), contestants would answer questions to win modest monetary prizes and at the climax of the show had to decide whether to \"take the money\" or \"open the box\". The box could contain good prizes (for the time), such as a holiday or a washing machine, but could also contain booby prizes such as a mousetrap or a bag of sweets.\n\nThe first version was hosted by Michael Miles (after its demise, Miles hosted a similar show for Southern Television called Wheel of Fortune, not to be confused with the later Wheel of Fortune of the same title). Bob Danvers-Walker, the voice of Pathé News from 1940 until its demise in 1970, was the show's announcer, and Alec Dane was on hand to bang the gong. At the electronic organ was Harold Smart.\n\nDes O'Connor became the host for the second version in the 1990s. His future wife Jodie Wilson was one of the hostesses; she would later be replaced by Neighbours twins Gayle and Gillian Blakeney.\n\nIt was revived again for one night only as part of Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon in 2005, a series of the Geordie duo presenting classic ITV gameshows as part of the channel's 50th anniversary in their own style.\n\nA similar formula was used for Pot of Gold, another game show, hosted by O'Connor.\n\nThe Des O'Connor series is currently being repeated on Challenge.\n\nThe game was played during the ninth series of Britain's Got More Talent.\n\nYes/No interlude\n\nIn this opening game, the host asked the contestant a series of questions for 60 seconds and the contestant could not say yes, no, nod or shake their heads. If they did, the co-host would bang the gong and the contestant would be eliminated (unless other contestants did the same).\n\nBox numbers and the prizes\n\nThere were 10 boxes numbered from 1 to 10 and an additional Box 13. Of the former, there were 3 boxes containing booby prizes, 1 containing a star prize (e.g. a small car) and 6 containing other prizes (of which 1 was a \"treasure chest\" of cash). One box also included the option to choose Box 13. The host offered an alternative prize of up to about £50 (or, in the revival, a number of hundreds of pounds) in cash and the contestant had to choose between \"taking the money\" and \"opening the box\".\n\nIn this game, the contestant might answer 3 out of 4 questions correctly before the contestant picks the boxes from 1 to 10 and activating box 13 within the 10 boxes like cinema tickets, baby food,cowboy hats or pork pies which relates to a prize, but also with larger prizes containing such as television sets, video players, cash, karaoke machines, double beds, music vouchers & sofas and booby prizes containing nose hair trimmers, last night's cold food, a box of chocolates, breakfast cereals, rotten tomatoes, cat food and dog food and the star prizes containing kitchen appliances, cars, motorbikes, jet skis, hotels, computers and holidays.\n\nCultural references\n\nA sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus (called \"Spot the Brain Cell\" in a later audio version) has John Cleese  playing an \"evil\" game show host, hitting contestants over the head with a giant hammer, which is clearly a wildly exaggerated version of Michael Miles (the game he is hosting is a parody of the \"Yes-No Interlude\" from Take Your Pick!). An early version of this sketch appeared in At Last the 1948 Show. For a time after Miles' death the sketch was not shown by the BBC, but it has since been reinstated.\n\nAlso, in the Hungarian Tourist sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus, a prosecutor (played by Eric Idle) plays the game with Alexander Yalt (played by Michael Palin). The prosecutor manages to gong Yalt \"out\" for answering a question with \"yes\" (although, Yalt was probably unaware of playing the game in the first place).\n\nA sketch in the BBC Radio comedy series The Burkiss Way featured a \"Dinosaur-Cheese Interlude\", in which contestants were required to answer questions without mentioning any species of dinosaur or any variety of cheese (besides Edam, which was \"made\" backwards). Naturally, all the contestants did accidentally mention them.\n\nA fifth season episode of the radio show Hancock's Half Hour (broadcast May 1958) had Tony Hancock appear on the (unnamed) show and win £4,000.\n\nThe British progressive rock band Hatfield and the North named one of their songs \"The Yes No Interlude\". It is included in their second LP, The Rotters' Club.\n\nThe 1970s radio programme I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again made frequent references to Take Your Pick with phrases such as \"Stake the bunny!\" \"Open the box!\"\n\nTransmissions\n\nAssociated-Rediffusion\n\nOnly 6 out of the 494 episodes from the Associated-Rediffusion era survived from the archives including Episode 2 of Series 1, Episode 39 of Series 10, Episodes 1-2 of Series 12 and Episodes 18 & 44 of Series 13. \n\nThames\nQuestion:\nWhich New Zealander presented Take Your Pick on radio and TV\nAnswer:\nMichael Miles\nPassage:\nTrophies - The Championships, Wimbledon 2016 - Official ...\nTrophies - The Championships, Wimbledon 2017 - Official Site by IBM\nInformation about the five Championship trophies. READ MORE\nGentlemen's Singles Championship\nGentlemen's Singles Trophy first presented by the All England Club in 1887. It replaced the Field Cup (1877-1883) and the Challenge Cup (1884-1886) which were both won by William Renshaw after twice winning the gentlemen's title three times in succession. The AELTC spent 100 guineas to purchase a trophy as the Club was not prepared to risk losing a third Cup to a future three-times Champion so the decision was taken that the new trophy would never become the property of the winner.\nThe Cup, which is made of silver gilt, stands 18 inches high and has a diameter of 7.5 inches. The inscription on the Cup reads: \"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World\".\nAround the bowl are engraved the dates and names of the Champions. In 2009, there being no space left to engrave the names of the Champions, a black plinth with an ornamented silver band was designed to accompany the Cup. The Champions receive a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches).\nLadies' Singles Championship\nThe Ladies' Singles Trophy is a silver salver, sometimes referred to as the Rosewater Dish or Venus Rosewater Dish, which was first presented to the Champion when the challenge round was introduced in 1886.\nThe salver, which is made of sterling silver, partly gilded, is 18.75 inches in diameter. The theme of the decoration is mythological. The central boss has a figure of Temperance, seated on a chest with a lamp in her right hand and a jug in her left, with various attributes such as a sickle, fork and caduceus around her.\nThe four reserves on the boss of the dish each contain a classical god, together with elements. The reserves around the rim show Minerva presiding over the seven liberal arts: astrology, geometry, arithmetic, music, rhetoric, dialectic and grammar, each with relevant attribute.\nThe rim of the salver has an ovolo moulding. The Champions receive a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 14 inches).\nDoubles and Mixed Championships\nThe Gentlemen's Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup for the Gentlemen's Pairs' competition. When the doubles moved to Wimbledon in 1884 the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club presented the trophy to the All England Club.\nThe Ladies' Doubles Trophy is an elegant silver cup and cover, known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, presented to the Club in 1949 by HRH The Princess Marina, President of the All England Club.\nThe Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of the late S.H. Smith. S.H. Smith won the doubles title in 1902 and 1906, in partnership with the late F.L.

It is considered to be a subcontinent, rather than being a part of either continent. There are seven countries in this region called; Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Belize. Central America covers about 534,000 km2 (202,000 sq mi), which is just 0.1% of the Earth’s surface! Despite this fact, Central America is home to the 19th largest lake in the world (by area). Let’s find out the name of this lake and where it is located.\nWhat is the largest lake in Central America?\nThe largest lake in Central America is Lake Nicaragua (Spanish: Lago de Nicaragua), also known as Cocibolca or Granada. Lake Nicaragua has a total surface area of 8,264 km2 (3,191 sq mi). The lake is not overly deep with a maximum depth of 26 m (85 ft). It drains from west to east into the Caribbean Sea via the San Juan River.\nAs the name suggests, Lake Nicaragua is located entirely within the country of Nicaragua. This lake is located in the southwest of the country close to the border with Costa Rica.\nDid you know?\nNicaragua is also home to Lake Managua, which is the second largest lake in Central America. Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua are sometimes connected via the Tipitapa River. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, lies on the southwestern shore of Lake Managua.\nPlans were once may to made a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, the Panama canal was built instead and plans for the Nicaragua were put on hold.

The series \"C\", which was introduced in 1949, had a 998 cc 50 degree OHV V-twin engine running a 7.3:1 compression ratio.\n\nModel history\n\nThe first model from Vincent was the Rapide, followed by the Black Shadow in response to a demand for a more \"sports oriented model\". The Black Shadow was developed from an early-model Rapide that had been specially tuned by factory tester and racer George Brown, his brother Cliff and designer Phil Irving.  With relatively minor modifications, such as enlarged ports, bigger carburettors and increased compression, the test model, known as \"Gunga Din\", gave 55 bhp, creating the basis for the Black Shadow.  The Black Shadow  proved very popular and its production overtook the Rapide. The Black Shadow's engine, instead of being cradled in a set of frame rails, was suspended from above, becoming a stressed member, or integral part, of the structure. \n\nThe Black Shadow featured several new technological innovations, such as: an original alternative to the primitive telescopic front forks of the day, a sprung rear sub-frame, extensive use of aluminium alloy, and a unit construction stressed engine. Overall weight was a relatively light 458 lb.   While other contemporary motorcycles tended to be polished and chromed, the \"Black Shadow\" was unusual in being predominantly black. The black enamel crankcase was effective both for marketing and heat dissipation.  Some 16 \"White Shadows\" were built, made to Shadow specification but with the Rapide's plain aluminium finish.  Fewer than 1,700  Vincent Black Shadows were made,  all hand-assembled.\n\nIn 2007, The Vincent H.R.D. Owners Club commissioned the VOC Spares Company Limited to build a replica Black Shadow from new parts. Among other things, the project was to prove that all the parts were in stock and available from the VOC Spares Company Limited.

It is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.  Mina De La O, Getty Images\nUpdated August 02, 2016.\nVelocity Definition\nVelocity is defined as a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. The scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of the motion. In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time.\nThe most common way to calculate the constant velocity of an object moving in a straight line is with the formula:\nr = d / t\nwhere\nr is the rate, or speed (sometimes denoted as v, for velocity, as in this kinematics article )\nd is the distance moved\nt is the time it takes to complete the movement\nUnits of Velocity\nThe SI units for velocity are m / s (meters per second). It may be expressed in any units of distance per time. Other units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and kilometers per second (km/s).\nSample Velocity Problem\nA physics student drops an egg off an extremely tall building.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nWhat is the egg's velocity after 2.60 seconds?\nThe hardest part about solving for velocity in a physics problem is selecting the right equation. In this case, two equations may be used to solve the problem.\nUsing the equation:\nd = vI*t + 0.5*a*t2\nwhere d is distance, vI is initial velocity, t is time, a is acceleration (due to gravity, in this case)\nd = (0 m/s)*(2.60 s) + 0.5*(-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)2\nd = -33.1 m (negative sign indicates direction downward)\nNext, you can plug in this distance value to solve for velocity using the equation:\nvf = vi + a*t\nwhere vf is final velocity, vi is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the egg was dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity is 0.\nvf = 0 + (-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)\nvf = -25.5 m/s\nAlthough it's common to report velocity as a simple value, remember it's a vector and has direction as well as magnitude. Usually, moving upward is indicated with a positive sign, and down carries a negative sign.\nRelating Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration\nSpeed, velocity, and acceleration are all related to each other. Remember:\nSpeed is a scalar quantity that indicates rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length/time.\nVelocity is a vector quantity that indicates distance per time and direction. Like speed, its units are length/time, but direction is also cited.\nAcceleration is a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length/time2.\nQuestion:\nIn physics, 'the rate of change of position' is a basic definition of what term?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nParrothead\nParrot Head or Parrothead is a commonly used nickname for fans of Jimmy Buffett. \"Parakeets\"  or \"Keets\" is the term used for younger fans of Jimmy, or children of Parrotheads.\n\nOrigin of the term\n\nThe term \"Parrot Head\" was coined in 1985 at a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Timberwolf Amphitheater in Cincinnati, OH.  Buffett has said numerous times that he attributes much of his fame to this area. At the show, Jimmy commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term \"Parrot Head\" to describe each of those fans.\n\nActivities\n\nEvents range from single act concerts or happy hours to the annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida, which attracts approximately 3,500 Parrotheads each year.  The several day event, sponsored by the Parrot Heads in Paradise includes live music, but also a Toy Drive for the Monroe County Salvation Army, a blood drive, Zonta Walk for Breast Cancer, raffles and other events to raise money for charities. Some regional groups will focus on one or two key charities, while others may switch between several.  Environmental causes, cancer research, Alzheimer's research and the March of Dimes all have received large donations from Parrothead organizations.  In 2011, there were 239 Parrothead Club chapters in the United States, Canada and Australia, spanning 3 different countries, 47 states and 3 Canadian provinces. The total membership in 2011 was almost 28,000 members. In the ten-year period 2002-2011, member clubs of the international Parrothead organization raised over $26.2M to support charitable organizations, and collectively worked almost 2.9 million hours of community service.

Kevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThis week two people in the tech industry lost their jobs because of jokes gone awry at a conference.\nA couple of male developers were joking around about \"big\"   dongles. When a female developer evangelist heard their jokes she   tweeted it out with their photo, complaining that they were being   rude. One of those developers lost his job, and then eventually,   so did the evangelist.\nIn the developers' defense, the word \"dongle\" is funny. It's   nearly impossible to say without giggling or making childish   jokes.\nSome people in our office had heard the word before, but didn't   know what a dongle is. Merriam-Webster  defines   a dongle as a small device that plugs into a computer and   serves as an adapter or a security measure to enable the use of   certain software.\nKevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThe term, dongle, was rumored to have originated from a 1992   advertisement for Rainbow Technologies. The ad claimed the word   dongle was derived from the name \"Don Gall.\" Though untrue, this   has given rise to an urban myth, we learned from Wikipedia .\nAccording to the University of   Pennsylvania's language log , the earliest citation of the   word dongle began appearing in 1982:\n1982   MicroComputer   Printout  Jan. 19/2 The word ‘dongle’ has been   appearing in many articles with reference to security systems for   computer software [refers to alleged coinage in 1980].\nBut as the term 'dongle' became more widespread its meaning   changed from strictly a scientific term to mainstream. UPenn   clarifies:\nThe current meaning   for dongle seems   to be something like \"a self-contained device that plugs into   a  port on a computer that is normally used for connections   to a separate external device\". Thus in addition to the original   serial-port dongles, and the USB dongles that Suzanne (and   Stephen Fry) wrote about, there are also  \"firewire   dongles\" , and presumably there could be dongles for any   other sort of port as well. \nSimply put, dongles are computer peripherals that plug into   your computer like a USB flash drive or a cord connecting a   computer with a printer for example.  Dongles are also huge in the video game   world because they allow consoles to have added features like   increased audio quality.\nAn Xbox 360 Audio Dongle Wikimedia   Commons\nBefore USB was the standard in   attaching PC peripherals, there were tons of different dongles   that came in various shapes and sizes.\nQuestion:\nIn computing, what is the device which is plugged into a computer which serves as an adapter or to enable the use of certain software?\nAnswer:\nDongle\nPassage:\nEast Anglian Daily Times\nThe East Anglian Daily Times is a British local newspaper for Suffolk and Essex, based in Ipswich.\n\nIt started publication on 13 October 1874,  incorporating the Ipswich Express, which had been published since 13 August 1839.

It was only his third race for Williams.\nWilliams' cars have carried his name ever since the tragedy at the Imola racing circuit, and Bruno, who made his debut for HRT in 2010, says he is excited to follow in his uncle's footsteps.\nFerrari's Alonso slams F1 testing rules\n\"It will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with Ayrton,\" the 28-year-old told Williams' website.\n\"Hopefully we can bring back some memories and create some great new ones too. I also want to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today.\n\"I am very proud to be Brazilian and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what I can do. Ever since I first sat in a go-kart I never wanted to do anything else.\"\nTeam principal Frank Williams, who was in charge of Williams when Ayrton Senna died, said he was looking forward to seeing Bruno compete at the highest level.\nThe driver struggled with HRT in the team's debut season, then moved to Renault as a reserve driver before replacing Nick Heidfeld for the final eight races of 2011, but scored points in just one of his eight races as he finished ninth at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\"The circumstances of Bruno's two seasons in Formula One have not given him an ideal opportunity to deliver consistently so it was essential that we spent as much time with him as possible to understand and evaluate him as a driver,\" he said.\n\"We have done this both on track and in our simulator and he has proven quick, technically insightful and above all capable of learning and applying his learning quickly and consistently.

Simply fill out this order form .\nWhere did the idea come from?\nIn 1991 – a decade after the emergence of HIV – a group of 12 artists gathered to discuss a new project for Visual Aids; a New York arts organisation that raises awareness of HIV. They were photographers, painters, film makers and costume designers, and they sat around in the shared gallery space in New York's East Village.\nAfter a short brainstorm they had come up with a simple idea that later became one of the most recognised symbols of the decade – the red ribbon, worn to signify awareness and support for people living with HIV.\nPhotos courtesy of The Elizabeth Taylor Archive\nWhy did we need a symbol?\nWhen the artists sat down to work on this project, their aim was to get people talking about HIV. This was during a time where HIV was highly stigmatised and people living with the virus were suffering behind closed doors, some too scared to even tell their loved ones. The artists wanted to create a visual expression of compassion for people living with, and affected by, HIV.\nThe artists were inspired by the yellow ribbons tied on trees to show support for the US military fighting in the Gulf War. Pink and rainbow stripes were rejected because they were too closely associated with the gay community, and they wanted to convey that HIV went beyond the gay community and was relevant to everyone.\nRed was chosen as it is bold and visible – symbolising passion, a heart and love. The shape was chosen simply because it was easy to make and replicate – anyone can make one by just cutting out a piece of ribbon, looping it around your finger and pinning it on themselves.\nHow did the red ribbon become so well known?\nIn the early days, the artists made the ribbons themselves and distributed them around the New York art scene and dropped them off at theatres. Initially there was text that went with it, to explain why they were being worn, but eventually this was dropped as its symbolism no longer needed an explanation.\nWithin weeks of the red ribbon idea being born, world-famous actors starting wearing it to high-profile award ceremonies such as the Oscars and talking about why it was important. The media also took notice, and within a short space of time the red ribbon symbol became universally recognised.\nAt the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, held at London's Wembley Stadium on Easter Sunday, 1992, more than 100,000 red ribbons were distributed among the audience, with performers such as George Michael wearing one. The red ribbon continues to be a powerful force in the efforts to increase public awareness of HIV.\nConnect with us\nQuestion:\nWhat emblem was adopted in 1991 as a symbol of AIDS awareness?

Debates over its meaning and origin have largely centered on attempts to match the old woman with historical female figures who have had large families, although King George II (1683–1760) has also been proposed as the rhyme's subject.\n\nLyrics\n\nThe most common version of the rhyme is:\n\nThe earliest printed version in Joseph Ritson's Gammer Gurton's Garland in 1794 has the coarser last line:\n\nMany other variations were printed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Marjorie Ainsworth Decker published a Christian version of the rhyme in her The Christian Mother Goose Book published in 1978:\n\nOrigins and meaning\n\nIona and Peter Opie pointed to the version published in Infant Institutes in 1797, which finished with the lines:\n\nThe term \"a-loffeing\", they believe, was Shakespearean, suggesting that the rhyme is considerably older than the first printed versions. They then speculated that if this were true, it might have a folklore meaning and pointed to the connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her honeymoon, or tying shoes to the departing couple's car. Archaeologist Ralph Merifield has pointed out that in Lancashire it was the custom for females who wished to conceive to try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth.\n\nDebates over the meaning of the rhyme have largely revolved around matching the old woman with historical figures, as Peter Opie observed \"for little reason other than the size of their families\". Candidates include:\n*Queen Caroline, the wife of King George II (1683–1760), who had eight children.\n*Elizabeth Vergoose of Boston, who had six children of her own and ten stepchildren.\n\nAlbert Jack has proposed a political origin for the rhyme. George II was nicknamed the \"old woman\", because it was widely believed that Queen Caroline was the real power behind the throne. According to this explanation, the children are the Members of Parliament (MPs) that George was unable to control, the whip refers to the political office of that name – the MP whose role is to ensure that members of his party vote according to the party line – and the bed is the House of Commons, which MPs were required to attend daily. The phrase \"gave them some broth without any bread\" may refer to George's parsimony in the wake of the South Sea Bubble of 1721, and his attempts to restore his own and the country's finances.\nQuestion:\n\"Where did the old woman who \"\"had so many children she didn't know what to do\"\" live?\"\nAnswer:\nOrthopaedic footwear\nPassage:\nKolossi Castle\nKolossi Castle is a former Crusader stronghold on the south-west edge of Kolossi village 14 km west of the city of Limassol on the island of Cyprus.  It held great strategic importance in the Middle Ages, and contained large facilities for the production of sugar from the local sugarcane, one of Cyprus's main exports in the period. The original castle was possibly built in 1210 by the Frankish military, when the land of Kolossi was given by King Hugh I to the Knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Hospitallers). \n\nThe present castle was built in 1454 by the Hospitallers under the Commander of Kolossi, Louis de Magnac, whose arms can be seen carved into the castle's walls. \n\nOwing to rivalry among the factions in the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, the castle was taken by the Knights Templar in 1306, but returned to the Hospitallers in 1313 following the abolition of the Templars. \n\nThe castle today consists of a single three-storey keep with an attached rectangular enclosure or bailey about 30 by. \n\nAs well as its sugar. the area is also known for its sweet wine, Commandaria.  At the wedding banquet after King Richard the Lionheart's marriage to Berengaria of Navarre at nearby Limassol, he allegedly declared it to be the \"wine of kings and the king of wines.\"  It has been produced in the region for millennia, and is thought to be the oldest continually-produced and named wine in the world, known for centuries as \"Commandaria\" after the Templars' Grand Commandery there.    \n\nIn literature\n\nKolossi Castle appears in many works of fiction, including La milicia de Dios by the Spanish writer Eduardo García-Ontiveros Cerdeño. It also appears in Snow Wasted by the Cypriot author Matthew Malekos and in the novels of several British writers, including Race of Scorpions: The House of Noccolo by Dorothy Dunnett, In Search of Sixpence by Michael Paraskos and Lionheart by  Stewart Binns.\n \nGallery\n\nFile:KolossiCastle2.jpg|A hall inside the castle\nFile:LusignanCoatOfArms.jpg|Lusignan escutcheon on the eastern wall\nFile:Escutcheon of Kolossi Castle01.JPG|Lusignan escutcheon of Kolossi Castle\nFile:Kolossi Castle05.JPG|Fireplace, Kolossi Castle\nFile:Kolossi Castle06.JPG|Fireplace, Kolossi Castle, lily bas-relief (Fleur-de-lis)\nFile:Kolossi Castle01.JPG|Inside Kolossi Castle window view\nFile:Kolossi Castle04.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins (Sugar Factory)\nFile:Kolossi Castle03.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins\nFile:Kolossi Castle02.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins\nFile:Kolossi Castle view.JPG|View from top of Kolossi Castle\nFile:Festung Kolossi 063.jpg|South-east view of Kolossi Castle\nFile:KOLOSSI 01.jpg|South-east view of Kolossi Castle\nQuestion:\nOn which holiday island is Kolossi Castle built by the Knights Templar in the 13th century?\nAnswer:\nCulture of Cyprus\nPassage:\nPianist\nA pianist ( , ) is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ.\n\nPianists past and present\n\nModern classical pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching as well as learning new works/expanding their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and chamber music while others (relatively few) will perform as full-time piano soloists.\n\nClassical \n\nMozart could be considered the first \"concert pianist\" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and Hans von Bülow. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.\n\nJazz \n\nJazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is freer than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known Jazz pianists include Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Herbie Hancock.\n\nPopular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include Victor Borge who performed as a comedian; Richard Clayderman, who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer Liberace, who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.\n\nWell known pianists\n\nA single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical, given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument.  Below are links to lists of well-known or influential pianists divided by genres:\n\nClassical pianists\n\n*List of classical pianists (recorded)\n*List of classical pianists\n*List of classical piano duos (performers)\n\nJazz pianists\n\n*List of jazz pianists\n\nPop and rock music pianists\n\n*List of pop and rock pianists\n\nBlues pianists\n\n*List of blues musicians\n*List of boogie woogie musicians\n\nGospel pianists\n\n*List of gospel musicians\n\nNew-age pianists\n\n*List of new-age music artists\n\nPianists-composers\n\nMany important composers were also virtuoso pianists.

As a result, there are prominent communities of amateur pianists all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts just because of their love to music, but not to earn money.  The International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs, held annually in Paris, attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio. It is also a notable fact that Jon Nakamatsu, the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for professional pianists in Fort Worth, Texas (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or major in music, and worked as a high school German teacher then. It was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.\n\nThe German pianist Davide Martello is known for travelling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst]\nQuestion:\nWhich composer and pianist, usually included as one of the Three B's of classical music, wrote A German Requiem ?\nAnswer:\nBrahm's\nPassage:\nBeamer (cricket)\nIn the terminology of the game of cricket, a beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball (bowled at a fast pace), without bouncing, passes above the batsman's waist height.   Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, due to the lack of control a bowler has over high full tosses.  Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it.\n\nThis type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty for this type of delivery is an immediate no-ball signal given by the umpire and a free hit (In t20s and ODIs) . The use of beamers is governed under Law 42.6.  The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match), as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Fast or express bowlers, particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques, are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers, albeit accidentally.\n\nA beamer can severely injure a batsman, especially if the batsman's head is struck. Some cricket boards are considering introducing additional penalties in the form of monetary fines for the bowler if any batsman is injured as a result of this delivery.\n\nA bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces, called a bouncer. These are much easier to play or avoid than beamers.\n\nTypically a beamer is quite hard to bowl because the ball is usually released very early on in the action. Beamers are sometimes bowled when the ball is wet and it slips out of the bowler's hand.  Some excuses given have been that it was an attempted yorker that slipped but this is generally not the case as a yorker is delivered much later in the action.\n\nAbdur Rehman, a Pakistani spin bowler, bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh, and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legal ball, despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.\nQuestion:\nBeamer, Flipper and Rabbit are terms used in which sport?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nBritish Classic Races\nThe British Classics are five long-standing Group 1 horse races run during the traditional flat racing season. They are restricted to three-year-old horses and traditionally represent the pinnacle of achievement for racehorses against their own age group. As such, victory in any classic marks a horse as amongst the very best of a generation. Victory in two or even three of the series (a rare feat known as the English Triple Crown) marks a horse as truly exceptional.\n\nRaces\n\nThe five British Classics are:\n\nIt is common to think of them as taking place in three legs.\n\nThe first leg is made up of the Newmarket Classics – 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas. Given that the 1,000 Guineas is restricted to fillies, this is regarded as the fillies' classic and the 2,000, which is open to both sexes, as the colts' classic, although it is theoretically possible for a filly to compete in both.\n\nThe second leg is made up of the Epsom Derby and/or Oaks, both ridden over 1 1/2 miles at Epsom in early June. The Oaks is regarded as the fillies' classic, the Derby as the colts', although, as with the Guineas, a filly could theoretically contest both.\n\nThe final leg is the St. Leger, held over 1 mile 6 1/2 furlongs at Doncaster and is open to both sexes.\n\nThe variety of distances and racecourses faced in the Classics make them particularly challenging as a series to even the best horses. It is rare for a horse to possess both the speed and stamina to compete across all these distances, making the Triple Crown a particularly notable achievement. In fact, in the modern era, it is rare for any attempt on the Triple Crown to be made.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough the oldest race in the series, the St Leger, was first run 1776, the races were not designated 'classics' until 1815, shortly after the first running of the 1,000 Guineas.\n\nMultiple classic winners\n\n(see also Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing)\n\nIn 1902 Sceptre became the only racehorse to win four British Classic Races outright, winning both Guineas, the Oaks and the St Leger. Previously, in 1868, Formosa won the same four races but dead-heated in the 2,000 Guineas. \n\nFifteen horses have won the standard Triple Crown (2,000 Guineas – Derby – St Leger), the last being Nijinsky in 1970.\n\nIn addition to Sceptre and Formosa above, eight horses have won the fillies' Triple Crown (1,000 Guineas – Oaks – St Leger), the last being Oh So Sharp in 1985.\n\nMany horses have won two classics, some of whom have gone on to attempt the Triple Crown, losing in the last leg at Doncaster.

The Orchestra's current Principal Conductor is Vladimir Jurowski , appointed in 2007.  Andrés Orozco-Estrada became our Principal Guest Conductor in September 2015. Magnus Lindberg is the Orchestra’s current Composer in Residence.\n'The London Philharmonic Orchestra is looking the most adventurous of London’s orchestras.'\nFinancial Times, Mar 2015\nWhere we perform\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra has been performing at Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall in London since it opened in 1951, becoming Resident Orchestra there in 1992. We also have flourishing residencies in Brighton and Eastbourne , and in summer we play for Glyndebourne Festival Opera where we have been Resident Symphony Orchestra since 1964. Touring abroad forms a major part of the Orchestra's schedule: highlights of the 2016/17 season include visits to New York, Germany, Hungary, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Switzerland.\n'Exceptional playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra.'\nThe Times, July 2015\nRecordings and film\nHaving long been embraced by the recording, broadcast and film industries, the London Philharmonic Orchestra broadcasts regularly on TV and radio. We also work with the Hollywood and UK film industries, and have been recording soundtracks for over half a century. Big headliners include The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Maurice Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia, gems like East is East and most recently Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3.\nIn 2005 we established our own record label , which now numbers over 90 releases. Recent releases include The Genius of Film Music: Hollywood Blockbusters 1960s to 1980s , as well as archive recordings of Tennstedt conducting Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 5 and 6 . Other projects have included a recording of James Horner's Collage: A Concerto for Four Horns – one of the very last commissions, written for members of the LPO's horn section, by the film composer just before his tragic early death in 2015.\nGet involved\n'Jurowski …  has established sufficient rapport with the orchestra to achieve the effects he desires while doing far less than most conductors do. The result was a noble and articulate reading of [Shostakovich's] great symphony, grand in scale and urgent in delivery.'\nThe Guardian, July 2015\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra runs an energetic programme of activities for young people and local communities including our FUNharmonics family concerts and the BrightSparks schools' concerts .

For example, a 15-watt LED light bulb draws 15 watts of electricity at any moment when turned on.\nWatt-hours are a measurement of energy, describing the total amount of electricity used over time. Watt-hours are a combination of how fast the electricity is used (watts) and the length of time it is used (hours). For example, a 15-watt light bulb, which draws 15 watts at any one moment, uses 15 watt-hours of electricity in the course of one hour.\nKilowatts and kilowatt-hours are useful for measuring amounts of electricity used by large appliances and by households. Kilowatt-hours are what show up on your electricity bill, describing how much electricity you have used. One kilowatt (kW) equals 1,000 watts, and one kilowatt-hour (kWh) is one hour of using electricity at a rate of 1,000 watts. New, energy-efficient refrigerators use about 300-400 kilowatt-hours per year. The typical American home uses about 7,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year [1].\nMegawatts are used to measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. One megawatt (MW) = 1,000 kilowatts = 1,000,000 watts. For example, a typical coal plant is about 600 MW in size.\nGigawatts measure the capacity of large power plants or of many plants. One gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. In 2012, the total capacity of U.S. electricity generating plants was approximately 1,100 GW [2].\nNotes and References\nWe Need Your Support\nto Make Change Happen\nWe can shift our nation away from dirty fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable sources of power—but not without you. Your generous support helps develop science-based solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future.\n$25\nQuestion:\nIn what units are household electricity bills measured?\nAnswer:\nMWth\nPassage:\nGoathland\nGoathland is a village  and parish in the Scarborough district of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is in the North York Moors national park due north of Pickering, off the A169 to Whitby. It has a station on the steam-operated North Yorkshire Moors Railway line.\n\nAccording to the 2011 UK census, Goathland parish had a population of 438,  an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 407. \n\nGoathland village is 500 feet above sea level and has a history extending from Viking times. The name Goathland is probably a corruption of 'good land'. Alternatively, it may come from 'Goda's land', Goda being an Old English personal name. In 1109 King Henry I granted land to Osmund the Priest and the brethren of the hermitage of Goathland, then called Godelandia, for the soul of his mother Queen Matilda, who had died in 1083.  This is recorded in a charter held at Whitby Abbey.    The village was a spa town in the 19th century. There are many hotels and guest houses in the village, the largest, the Mallyan Spout Hotel, is named after a nearby waterfall. There is a caravan site, reached by driving along the track which is the site of the older railway route, 1835 to 1860.\n\nMuch of the surrounding land is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster. The Duchy's tenants have a common right extending for hundreds of years to graze their black faced sheep on the village green and surrounding moorland.\n\nHeartbeat connection \n\nThe village was the setting of the fictional village of Aidensfield in the Heartbeat television series set in the 1960s. Many landmarks from the series are recognisable, including the stores, garage/funeral directors, the public house and the railway station. The pub is called the Goathland Hotel, but in the series is the Aidensfield Arms. After filming for some years a replica was built in the studio. \n\nNorth Yorkshire Moors Railway \n\nGoathland railway station is on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The railway is run by a charitable trust with some paid staff but is mostly operated by volunteers, running nearly all the year including Christmas. It carries more than 250,000 passengers a year and is the second-longest preserved line in Britain. It links Grosmont in the north with Pickering in the south, along the route of the Whitby - Pickering line built by George Stephenson in 1835 and upgraded in 1865.  From 2007 some trains on the railway were timetabled to run to Whitby and in March 2014 work began in Whitby station to replace a platform and allow more North Yorkshire Moors Railway services to be timetabled Whitby - Pickering.\n\nGoathland railway station was used as the location for Hogsmeade railway station in the Harry Potter films, and the line filmed for Harry's journey.\n\nFile:Goathland-south-heather.jpg|Country just south of Goathland\nFile:Goathland moor north yorkshire.jpg|Moorland at Goathland\nFile:Goathland_Road.jpg|Goathland's main road\nFile:Goathland_Church.jpg|Goathland Church\nFile:Goathland_Railway_Station.jpg|Goathland Railway Station\nFile:Goathland_Shops.jpg|The shops on the green at Goathland, often seen in ITV's Heartbeat.\nFile:Goathland_Shops_2.jpg|More shops\nFile:Goathland_Tea_Room.jpg|Tea room\nFile:Scripps_Petrol.jpg|Scripps' Funeral Services and Petrol Station, seen on Heartbeat\n\nAppearance in literature\n\nAs well as serving as the location for the fictional village of Aidensfield, Goathland features in its own right as an important setting in Dan Chapman's 2014 dystopian, futuristic novel Closed Circuit. Forming a setting for the denouement of the novel, it is explained that the antagonist owns the entire village, and the nearby MoD site serves as a base for his operations.  Goathland also features in \"Ice\", a novel by Australian writer Louis Nowra (Allen & Unwin, 2008).\nQuestion:\nGoathland, near Whitby, is the setting for which TV show?\nAnswer:\nHeart · Beat\nPassage:\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker is a British children's book first published in 1991, written by Jacqueline Wilson and illustrated by Nick Sharratt.\n\nBackground\n\nThe book is told from the point of view of Tracy Beaker, a very naughty ten-year-old girl. The reason Tracy is often unhappy and has problems with her behaviour is because she is lonely, frustrated and feels unloved. Tracy resides in a children's residential care home (nicknamed \"The Dumping Ground\") where she has been placed as a result of neglect. Her mother often left Tracy to stay by herself when Tracy was very young and does not appear to have an interest in her daughter's life. Tracy is unhappy because she has not had any contact with her mother for a long time. She has difficulty getting along with the staff and the other children at the care home, (especially a girl named Justine Littlewood). Another reason Tracy is frustrated and angry is because she was rejected by two couples who attempted to foster her.\n\nFrom an adult's point of view, Tracy has \"behavioural problems\" and she is always telling tales. Tracy's stories seem to provide a high level of comfort and security for her. For example, a recurring story that Tracy likes to tell is that her mother is a glamorous Hollywood movie star, and that she is coming to collect her someday. Tracy says that her mother is so busy being in films that she does not have time for Tracy. Among other things, Tracy's autobiography details her life so far, her being \"deprived and abused\" in the children's home (for example, she is deprived of Mars Bars and Smarties) and the types of revenge she would like to take upon her enemies. She is very imaginative and believes that her mum will come home one day. She often portrays a deep and complicated mind.\n\nIn 2002 the book was voted the winner of the Blue Peter People's Choice Award. Wilson has written three sequels to the book, The Dare Game, Starring Tracy Beaker, and Tracy Beaker's Thumping Heart (a Red Nose Day Special).\n\nAdaptations\n\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\n\nA TV adaptation of the book was made by the BBC. There have so far been five series of the TV programme, which mainly airs on CBBC, starring Dani Harmer in the role of Tracy Beaker. Montanna Thompson plays Justine Littlewood, Tracy's worst enemy, and Nisha Nayar plays her social worker, Elaine 'the pain' Boyak. There are many characters in the TV adaptation that do not feature in the book itself. The TV adaptation has several series, and towards the end, some episodes do not feature Tracy. The TV programmes expand on the lives of the children's daily affairs, whereas the book ends with Cam fostering Tracy and her living happily ever after. In the TV programme, Tracy has disagreements with Cam and ends up back in the children's home but maintains a strong relationship with Cam. Cam gets married to Gary at the end of the series, and the last we see of Tracy is when she is talking to Justine on the steps of the children's home, after being told she will be adopted by them. Having heard this, Justine decides to give living with her dad another go.\n\nTracy Beaker Returns\n\nA new series of Tracy Beaker entitled Tracy Beaker Returns began on 8 January 2010. It had 13 episodes. A second series was also announced by the BBC. It began on 7 January 2011 and concluded on 25 March 2011. It also had 13 episodes. A third series started on 6 January 2012 and concluded on 23 March 2012. It had 13 episodes. Series 3 was the final series of Tracy Beaker Returns, as Dani Harmer left the series.\n\nThe Dumping Ground\n\nThe Dumping Ground is a spin-off to Tracy Beaker Returns, which started in January 2013. It has an extremely similar format to Tracy Beaker Returns, with the only difference being that Tracy no longer features in the series. The only character in The Dumping Ground who featured in the original novel is Mike, a care worker at the children's home, although his characterisation has changed a lot from the book – in the TV series he is shown to be an amazingly kind care worker who understands all the children, whereas in the novel not much is revealed about him, and he is only mentioned in passing a few times by Tracy. The only departed character shown in the series was Gus Carmichael (Noah Marullo) as he gets fostered by a lesbian couple\n\nTracy Beaker Gets Real\n\nIn 2006, Tracy Beaker Gets Real, a musical version of The Story of Tracy Beaker, toured up and down Britain in various theatres.\nQuestion:\nWhich children's author created Tracey Beaker?\nAnswer:\nJacqueline Aitken\nPassage:\nCreme Anglaise I Recipe - Allrecipes.com\nCreme Anglaise I Recipe - Allrecipes.com\nJenniRuff\n11/26/2008\nQuick, simple, easy version of Creme Anglaise - and a tasty one too.

They also compete in the Anglo-Welsh Cup and European Rugby Cup competitions.\n\nHistory \n\nEarly years\n\nExeter Rugby Club was founded in 1871. The club played its first match in 1873 against St. Luke's College. In 1890, they won the Devon Cup. In 1905, Exeter Rugby Club hosted the first match played by the New Zealand national rugby union team on English soil and in the Northern Hemisphere at the County Ground between New Zealand and the Devon County XV.  It was from that game, that New Zealand became known as the \"All Blacks\". \n\nWhen league rugby started, Exeter were initially placed in the Devon leagues. In the 1990s, Exeter Rugby Club turned semi-professional and changed their name from Exeter Rugby Club to Exeter Chiefs after previously being referred to as the Chiefs in the 1930s. Often their teams at the time were composed of members and former members of the British Army.  In 1993 and 1995, they reached the quarter finals of the Pilkington Cup before being knocked out by English Premiership opponents Leicester Tigers and London Wasps respectively. \n\nProfessional era\n\nIn 1997, Exeter were promoted into the Premiership Two for the first time from National League 1. They regularly finished in the top half of the table. In 2005, Exeter finished second in the league, missing out on promotion by four points behind Bristol Rugby. The next season, they moved from the County Ground to Sandy Park due to a need for modern facilities that included corporate hospitality. In 2008 they again finished in second place and again missed out on promotion by finishing behind Northampton Saints. The same situation happened the next season when Exeter finished behind Leeds Carnegie. \n\nPremiership\n\nIn 2009, National Division One was reorganized into the RFU Championship with playoffs. During the regular league season, Exeter finished second behind Bristol. In the playoffs, they defeated Bedford Blues and Nottingham R.F.C. before facing Bristol in the two legged final.  Exeter won 9–6 in the first leg at Sandy Park and then won 29–10 at Bristol's Memorial Stadium in the second leg to win promotion to the Premiership for the very first time. \n\nIn their first season in the Premiership, they finished eighth despite a two-point deduction and a £5,000 fine for fielding too many overseas players during their match against Leeds Carnegie at Headingley Stadium.  They also made their debut in the European Challenge Cup, making their way to the quarter finals where they lost to Stade Français.  In the next season, they finished fifth in the Premiership which permitted them to play in the Heineken Cup for the first time. In their first season in the Heineken Cup, they were drawn against French Clermont Auvergne, Irish Leinster Rugby and Welsh Scarlets in the group stage. They finished the group third with nine points ahead of Scarlets.  Also in 2013, they, along with Saracens, were the only rugby club to hold a minutes silence before their game against London Irish to remember the death of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher.  In 2014, Exeter Chiefs won their first major rugby trophy after they defeated Northampton Saints in the Anglo-Welsh Cup 15-8 at Sandy Park. \n\nStadium\n\nExeter play their home games at Sandy Park, which is located on the outskirts of the city. The club moved from their previous home, the County Ground, in 2006 having played there regularly since 1905.  In 2002, Exeter Chiefs started looking for a new stadium because they felt the County Ground was insufficient for growth. Despite concerns of opposition from traditionalists within the club, the motion to move was passed by 99% of the attendees at Exeter's Annual General Meeting. Sandy Park can currently accommodate 12,600 spectators, however, there are plans to increase this capacity to 20,600 with phase one having begun in early 2014.  These plans came about because of a requirement for later stages of European matches to be played at grounds with a capacity of at least 20,000. \n\nClub honours\n\n* Courage League Division 4\n** Champions 1995–96 \n* Courage League Division 3\n** Champions 1996–97 \n* The Championship\n** Champions 2009–10\n* Aviva A League\n** Champions 2011–12, 2015–16\n* Anglo-Welsh Cup\n** Champions: 2013–14\n\nCurrent squad\n\n2016-17\n\nAcademy squad\n\n \n\nCurrent kit\n\nThe kit is supplied by Samurai Rugby Gear.

As the country's chief international and domestic airport, it is definitely Southern Africa's busiest airport. It is the main airport of South African Airways as well as several other local airlines. Designated Africa's leading airport in the 2005 World Travel Awards, O.R.Tambo International Airport is a hub of convenience and comfort for travelers.\nThe airport, originally named Jan Smuts Airport, was established in 1952. Right from its beginnings, the airport gained the great privilege of receiving a De Havilland Comet jet's first commercial flight from London's Heathrow International Airport to the city of Johannesburg. In the 1970s it took part in Concorde tests as a high altitude airport. In 1994 the new South African government renamed Jan Smuts Airport to Johannesburg  International Airport and established a policy stating that airports would not be named for politicians. By 1996 Johannesburg International had taken the lead from Cairo International Airport as Africa's busiest airport. In 2004 some 15.3 million passengers passed through the airport. 27 October 2006 brought another name change to the airport. Under much criticism it was named O.R.Tambo International Airport in honor of the past ANC President.\nO.R.Tambo International Airport has 2 parallel north-south runways. The western runway is amongst the longest in the world, measuring 4,400m. The airports 6 terminals are divided into the domestic terminal, the transit terminal and the international terminal. In 2003 the domestic terminal was upgraded and reopened offering travelers greater facilities. The terminal is focused around the convenience of all its travelers with necessary amenities, easy movement and quick drop-off/pick-up zones. O.R.Tambo Airport's updated facilities include a wide variety of restaurants and shops as well as ATM's and other banking services. The airport also has an outstanding medical clinic with doctors, physiotherapists, optometrists and a dentist. Business men and women can take advantage of the great Internet connections including wireless. The relatively new parkade offers more than 5,000 parking bays. There is plenty of transport to and from O.R.Tambo International Airport including taxis, shuttles and buses. It is projected that by 2015 the airport will be handling some 24 million passengers every year.\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich African city is served by O R Tambo airport?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThe Krays (film)\nThe Krays is a 1990 British drama film based on the lives and crimes of the English gangster twins Ronald and Reginald Kray, often referred to as The Krays.

It would be nearly impossible to not know someone who has been affected by conditions such as ADD, Alzheimer's, anxiety, autism, brain fog, depression, or fatigue. In part one of this series on natural mental health I gave my favorite tips for a healthy and happy brain and in part two I went over the things you would want to avoid.\nIn the mainstream medical system, if someone is struggling with one of these issues, he's typically left to pick between pharmaceutical A or B. For many, medications like antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications provide only temporary or marginal relief from their suffering. For others, they live in a constant state of medicated numbness. If medications don't provide sustainable solutions for you, or if you feel like they are not addressing the root cause of why you feel the way you do, this article is for you. In this article I want to share with you the underlying commonality between most of the people I see suffering with these mental health concerns: Inflammation.\nWe hear the term \"inflammation\" a lot when dealing with chronic health conditions. What is inflammation exactly, and how can it cause problems with your brain? Inflammation is normally a healthy response. For example, when you hurt your knee, acute inflammation enables your body to repair itself. Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is inflammation with no end in sight. Like a fire that's fueled with endless gasoline, chronic inflammation doesn't heal — it destroys. Chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation has been directly implicated in just about every chronic disease; brain conditions are no exception. Unlike other organs, your brain has no pain fibers. Chronic inflammation of the brain can manifest as problems like brain fog, depression or fatigue.\nA growing field of study referred to as the cytokine model of cognitive function , attempts to explain how inflammation affects how your brain works. Cytokines are proteins that regulate your bodies immune response. Wherever there's inflammation there are pro-inflammatory cytokines. There are many different ways in which your brain can become inflamed, both directly and indirectly. One of the main inflammatory mechanisms I come across doesn't even necessarily have to start directly in your brain, but actually can originate in your \"second brain:\" your gut.\nJust like your brain, the inner mucosal lining of your gut has no pain fibers. 95% of your body's serotonin, your \"feel-good\" hormone, is made in your intestines and it has many of the same neurological features as your brain. I've written in a previous MindBodyGreen article about how your gut-brain axis can cause weight loss resistance; it's also at the center of the cytokine model of mental health .\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother key player is zonulin , a protein that's released during inflammatory gut conditions like leaky gut syndrome , small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or a chronic yeast or parasite infection. One of zonulin's jobs is to open up your intestinal tight junctions , which are typically closed to protect your gut's delicate environment. Zonulin and certain bacterial endotoxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are normally isolated to your gut, can be released from your gastrointestinal system and circulate throughout your body, causing systemic inflammation . Just as zonulin opens your protective gut lining, it has also been shown to open your protective blood-brain barrier. The leaky gut has now caused a leaky brain.\nWhen your brain's protective barrier is breached it can activate the glial cells, your brain's immune cells. More than half the weight of your brain is made up of these immune cells. Once these \"immune soldier\" glial cells are activated it can turn on an inflammatory response in your brain, and they don't have an off switch. This chronic inflammation can decrease neuron firing and can be linked to just about any problem of the brain. In return, altered brain output then can also decrease its communication with your gut, impairing it's function, causing a vicious, perpetual cycle of inflammation. This inflammation can also impact your brain's communication with the endocrine (hormone) system such as the thyroid (HPT axis) and adrenal glands (HPA axis).\nIn addition to inflammatory gut conditions, we must also investigate and address any other underlying causes of brain and gut inflammation, such as:\nGluten Sensitivity\nQuestion:\nIf you were suffering from encephalitis, which of your organs would be inflamed?\nAnswer:\nYour brain\nPassage:\nPottery Marks | English Potters\nPottery Marks | English Potters\nWelcome to Pottery-English\nWelcome to Pottery-English.com\nIf, like us, you have an interest in antiques and pottery, Pottery-English is the site for you.

Don’t forget to check back in with us for new guides and reference material.\nCollecting Pottery\nSylvac cat\nPeople have admired fine china pottery for centuries, but collecting ordinary domestic pottery and local wares is a more recent interest.\nPottery by fashionable makers and designers is expensive, especially in antique shops and specialised sales, but it is still possible to build an interesting collection of modern ceramics without breaking the bank.\nStarting a pottery collection\nKeep your eyes open. You need great enthusiasm and a willingness to hunt for interesting pottery everywhere you go.Look out for antique fairs, general auctions, house clearance sales, junk shops and car boot sales – anywhere that might have china and pottery for sale. Have you looked in your own attic.\nFakes and copies\nBeatrix Potters Tailor of Gloucester by Beswick\nCopies of expensive china are common. After years of the Antiques Roadshow, there are not many genuine Ming vases just waiting to be picked up for a song, but some copies have become collectable and valuable in their own right. The recent vogue for Clarice Cliff has led to faking of pieces like the conical sugar shakers – the originals can fetch thousands of pounds at auction.\nThe cunning forgers use household dust from vacuum cleaners and tea to age their copies. Look out for normal wear, particularly on the base of household pottery – genuine wear from years of use is more difficult to fake than dust.\nPottery Marks\nPottery marks\nThe makers pottery marks can help with identification, but fakes may have convincing copies of the makers mark – though it may not be the right mark. Some fakes of Wedgwood pieces bear the marks of Dresden and Chelsea.Most makers have changed their marks over the years, so identification of genuine marks can be tricky. Happily there are plenty of books on pottery marks, which you can buy or consult in libraries.\nLearn about pottery\nTry to learn as much as you can about the makers and objects that you collect through books and sale catalogues. There may be collectors clubs that you can join to find out more and to share information with fellow enthusiasts.\nThematic collections\nCollecting objects to do with a particular subject is popular. Favourites include famous characters, pets, farm or wild animals and birds. Sporting themes, especially golf and cricket, which appeal to many collectors are priced accordingly.\nLocal potteries\nSmall potteries flourished almost everywhere in Britain. Interest in their wares is continuing to grow and they have become very popular with collectors. Nowadays the best pieces command high prices, especially in local sales.\nSmall is beautiful\nAnd often less expensive. You could choose from the many small 20th-century domestic pieces which are still widely available, especially items such as bowls, mugs, jugs, eggcups, toast-racks, ashtrays and thimbles.\nDamage\nAs with all collectables, damage and wear reduces the value. It is arguable whether even a skilful repair will add much to the value, but it may improve the appearance.\nPackaging\nIf you can find it, the original packaging may add to the interest and value of the piece.\nGood luck with the pot hunting!\nOur Site\nQuestion:\n\"Name the English pottery designer, whose \"\"Bizarre\"\" ware from the 1930's is still much sought after?\"\nAnswer:\nCLARICE CLIFF\nPassage:\nThinking man's/woman's crumpet\nIn British English, the thinking man's crumpet or  thinking woman's crumpet is a humorous term for a person who is popular with the opposite sex because of their intelligence and their physical attractiveness.[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-thinking-woman-s-man-s-crumpet The thinking woman's/man's crumpet - definition in the British English Dictionary & Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online]\n\nThe expression is derived from the slang use of the term \"crumpet\" to refer to a woman who is regarded as an object of sexual desire. \n\nUsage\n\nThe first person to be called \"the thinking man's crumpet\" was Joan Bakewell, by humourist Frank Muir, following her appearances in highbrow television discussion programmes such as BBC2's Late Night Line-Up.  Bakewell is still synonymous with the phrase, but it has subsequently been applied to other high-profile women such as Anne Gregg,  Joanna Lumley, Kate Bush and Felicity Kendal, and, more recently, Helen Mirren,  Jennifer Saunders, Lucy Worsley and Gillian Anderson.   Trumpeter Alison Balsom is sometimes referred to as the \"trumpet crumpet\".  In a poll in the Radio Times in 2003, Nigella Lawson received the most votes to be the readers' \"thinking man's crumpet\",  with Carol Vorderman in second place.\n\nAlmost half a century after Muir deployed the term, Bakewell (by then Baroness Bakewell and a Dame of the British Empire) remarked that \"it has taken me a lifetime to live it down. It was meant as a compliment I suppose, but it was a little bit of a put-down\". \n\nActors Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and Bill Nighy have been repeatedly called by the press \"the thinking woman's crumpet\".

{"input": "Passage:\nSwarkestone\nSwarkestone is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England. The population at the 2011 Census was 187. \n\nSwarkestone has a very old village church, a full cricket pitch, a plant nursery/ garden centre and restaurant called \"Swarkestone Nursery\", the Crewe and Harpur pub, a canal with locks and moorings. It was mentioned twice in Domesday as Sorchestun or Suerchestune, when it was worth twenty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. ISBN 0-14-143994-7 p.742 & 749\n\nSwarkstone Bridge\n\nThe ancient bridge at Swarkestone crosses the River Trent about 6 miles south of Derby and was for about 300 years the Midlands' main crossing of the Trent. The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nHistory\n\nSwarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge.[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid\n1088337 Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway], English Heritage, retrieved 7 September 2014 It was financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiances, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.\n\nSwarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England.\n\nIn 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne.\n\nAccording to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.  Substantial work was carried out in 1795–1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of  £3,550.\n\nThe Bridge Today\n\nThe bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic.\n\nLocal Legends\n\nThe bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops.\n The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about.\n\nThe bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fatal-crash-car-road-says-expert/story-11566348-detail/story.html#axzz2On4yqTMl A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner. | This is Derbyshire]\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the Beaker people living near Swarkestone was discovered in the 1950s. At that time it was estimated that people had lived near Swarkestone for at least 3,800 years.  The only surviving Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the Trent valley is at Swarkestone Lows near the A50. The barrow is a registered national monument. \n\nIn the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers.\n\nIn the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day.\n\nIn 1745 during the Jacobite Rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.\n\nSport\n\nSwarkestone cricket club has gained quite a reputation in recent years. After gaining promotion to the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League in 2011, they finished 2nd in the subsequent year and won the Premier League in the 2013 season, thus becoming the top league team in Derbyshire.\n\nThe Pavilion\n\nNearby is the Jacobean grandstand called Swarkestone Hall Pavilion and walled area, formerly connected with Harpur Hall, where (it is believed, see Pevsner, loc. cit.), they used to bait bulls. The pavilion is attributed to John Smythson who also designed Bolsover Castle, and is Grade I Listed.  It was repaired and is now owned by the Landmark Trust who maintain it and rent it out to holidaymakers.\n\nImages\n\nimage:SwalkestoneLockRH.jpg|Swarkestone Lock and Keeper's House\nimage:SwalkestoneChurchRH.jpg|St James' Church, Swarkestone\nimage:SwalkestoneLowesRH.JPG|Swarkestone Lowes\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Thomas Bancroft, poet, was born here in the early 17th century.Thomas Bancroft in the Dictionary of National Biography\nQuestion:\nThe advance south into England by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 reached approximately as far as the Swarkstone Bridge on which major English River?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nHow Delta Force Works | HowStuffWorks\nHow Delta Force Works | HowStuffWorks\nHow Delta Force Works\nA Delta Force operator prepares for a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) Exercise.\nPhoto Greg Matheison/Mai/ Time LifePictures/ Getty Images\nConsider a special operations force that's trained to the highest level in the United States military . The force is armed with cutting-edge weaponry, well-funded and answers only to one man. How can a group -- trained as professional assassins and approaching the status of mercenaries -- be reeled in if the U.S. government won't even confirm that the group exists? Does such a force make the United States safer or more vulnerable? It's questions like these that swirl around the United States' most elite tactical combat group, the Delta Force.\nDelta Force is often referred to as Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta. It's also known as the Combat Applications Group (CAG). While it often draws its ranks from the Army Special Forces (the Army Green Berets ) and shares Fort Bragg, N.C. , headquarters with them, it isn't an Army Special Forces detachment. Delta Force is a unit unto itself, composed of members from all branches of the military.\nUp Next\nThe U.S. Armed Forces Quiz\nThey're not called soldiers, but operators and are said to shun the traditional philosophies of military life. They wear civilian clothes. They work for whomever needs them -- for the Army, the FBI and the CIA . Mark Bowden, author of the book \"Blackhawk Down\" -- for which he interviewed several Delta Force members -- famously said of the operators, \"They are professional soldiers who hate the Army\" [source: Military.com ].\nIt must be said that neither the United States government nor the military officially acknowledges the existence of Delta Force. To this end, almost all of the information contained in this article is unsupported by any official reports from the United States. It's only in recent years that vague references by the government to the group's existence have been allowed to go uncensored. These references have turned up in transcripts from Congressional hearings and biographies of high-ranking military leaders.\nBut it's nearly impossible to keep a force so deadly and made up of the stuff of legends entirely under wraps. Since its inception in 1977, stories of the Delta Force's exploits and missions have leaked out, little by little, eventually forming a brief sketch of the unit. In 1993, Delta Force came under the microscope when its operators were among those who fought and died in a failed operation to remove a Somali warlord. And in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983, reports of two missions by Delta Force -- one failed and one successful -- have become common knowledge [source: SOC ].\nBut the group has been criticized for undertaking missions that are on the fringe of regular laws governing the military. This causes some to worry that Delta Force has more power and less accountability than any military organization in a free democracy should. Delta Force is funded out of secret government accounts, away from the public eye, and is believed to answer only to the president.\nBut others claim that its purpose -- maintaining the United States' role as a leading power and as the world's police force -- necessitates the lack of restrictions and accountability surrounding its activities.\nIn the next section, we'll look at how the Delta Force is structured.\n1\nQuestion:\nActive since 1977, Which unit is the only official US Army Counter-Terrorism force?\nAnswer:\nFunny Platoon\nPassage:\nAnchovy\nAn anchovy is a small, common salt-water forage fish of the family Engraulidae.\n\nThe 144 species are placed in 17 genera; they are found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Anchovies are usually classified as oily fish. \n\nGenera\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAnchovies are small, green fish with blue reflections due to a silver-colored longitudinal stripe that runs from the base of the caudal fin.  They range from 2 to in adult length, and their body shapes are variable with more slender fish in northern populations.\n\nThe snout is blunt with tiny, sharp teeth in both jaws.  The snout contains a unique rostral organ, believed to be sensory in nature, although its exact function is unknown. The mouth is larger than that of herrings and silversides, two fish which anchovies closely resemble in other respects. The anchovy eats plankton and recently hatched fish.\n\nDistribution\n\nAnchovies are found in scattered areas throughout the world's oceans, but are concentrated in temperate waters, and are rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas. They are generally very accepting of a wide range of temperatures and salinity. Large schools can be found in shallow, brackish areas with muddy bottoms, as in estuaries and bays. They are abundant in the Mediterranean, particularly in the Alboran Sea,  Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. The species is regularly caught along the coasts of Crete, Greece, Sicily, Italy, France, Turkey, and Spain. They are also found on the coast of northern Africa. The range of the species also extends along the Atlantic coast of Europe to the south of Norway. Spawning occurs between October and March, but not in water colder than 12 °C (54 °F). The anchovy appears to spawn at least 100 km from the shore, near the surface of the water.\n\nEcology\n\nThe anchovy is a significant food source for almost every predatory fish in its environment, including the California halibut, rock fish, yellowtail, shark, chinook, and coho salmon.  It is also extremely important to marine mammals and birds; for example, breeding success of California brown pelicans  and elegant terns is strongly connected to anchovy abundance.\n\nFeeding behavior\n\nAnchovies, like most clupeoids (herrings, sardines and anchovies), are filter-feeders that open their mouths as they swim. As water passes through the mouth and out the gills, food particles are sieved by gill rakers and transferred into the esophagus. \n\nCommercial species\n\n* Type species\n\nFisheries\n\nBlack Sea\n\nOn average, the Turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300,000 tons per year, mainly in winter. The largest catch is in November and December. \n\nPeru\n\nThe Peruvian anchovy fishery is one of the largest in the world, however, it collapsed catastrophically in 1973 due to the combined effects of overfishing and El Niño. \n\nAs food\n\nA traditional method of processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, allow them to mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac.  Today, they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman's Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter.  For domestic use, anchovy fillets are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.\n\nThe strong taste people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process. Fresh anchovies, known in Italy as alici, have a much milder flavor.  In Sweden and Finland, the name anchovies is related strongly to a traditional seasoning, hence the product \"anchovies\" is normally made of sprats  and herring can be sold as \"anchovy-spiced\". Fish from the Engraulidae family are instead known as sardell in Sweden and sardelli in Finland, leading to confusion when translating recipes.\nQuestion:\nWhat small green fish with blue reflections (due to a silver longitudinal stripe that runs from the base of the caudal fin) is found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans?\nAnswer:\nAnchovy\nPassage:\nBBC Bitesize - KS3 Physics - Energy in the home - Revision 1\nBBC Bitesize - KS3 Physics - Energy in the home - Revision 1\nEnergy\nEnergy in the home\nEnergy is measured in J and kJ.

Passy studied law and practised for a short time before accepting a position as an accountant in the State Council (Conseil de Droit) from 1846 to 1849. However, under his uncle's influence he gave up this post and returned to the university to study economics. True to his republican principles, he withdrew from politics after the coup d'état of Louis Napoleon and refused to be reconciled to the Second Empire; he was therefore ineligible for any government post. He became a professional economist in 1857, and in 1860 he began to teach political economy both in Paris and in the provinces.\n\nHis reputation was established through his Mélanges économiques (1857) essays and a lecture series given at the University of Montpellier and published as the Leçons d'économie politique. He was an advocate of free trade and adherent to the ideas of Richard Cobden. In 1877 he became a member of the French Académie des sciences morales et politiques, a component of the Institut de France; and he was a commander of the Legion of Honor. He was president of the Society of Political Economy for 70 years.\n\nPassy directly engaged in political questions, advocating educational reform and intervening to prevent war between France and Prussia during the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867.  In 1868, he helped found the Ligue internationale et permanente de la paix (International and Permanent League of Peace) to avert possible future conflicts and became its permanent secretary. When the organization dissolved during the Franco-Prussian War, Passy helped restructure it as the Société française des amis de la paix, which in 1889 became the Société d'arbitrage entre les Nations.\n\nIn 1881, he won election to the Chamber of Deputies, where he advocated foreign policy changes and labor reform, including legislation on industrial accidents. He won reelection in 1886 but lost in 1889. He also supported a system of international conflict arbitration, which was inspired by Randal Cremer's resolution that established arbitration between the United States and England. In 1888, his efforts led to a meeting between British Parliamentary members and French deputies to discuss the concept of organized arbitration. The following year, the Inter-Parliamentary Union was established with Passy as one of its presidents. He was a member of the International Bureau of Peace at Bern, Switzerland.\n\nPassy's writings and speeches advocating peace were widely recognized. In 1909, he published Pour la paix, a work which chronicled the establishment of the various peace and arbitration organizations with which he was associated.  From 1881 to 1902, he was professor of political economy in several colleges.\n\nHe died on June 12, 1912.  A short obituary was published in The New York Times the next day.\n\nHe was father to Paul Passy, a prominent linguist, founder of the International Phonetic Association (1886).\n\nWorks\n\n*Mélanges économiques (1857)\n*De la Propriété Intellectuelle (1859)\n*De l'Enseignement obligatoire (1859)\n*Leçons d'économie politique (1860–61)\n*La Démocratie et l'Instruction (1864)\n*La Guerre et la Paix (1867)\n*L'Histoire du Travail (1873)\n*Malthus et sa Doctrine (1868)\n*La Solidarité du Travail et du Capital (1875)\n*L'Histoire et les sciences morales et politiques (1879)\n*Le Petit Poucet du 19ième Siècle: George Stephenson (1881)\n*Historique du mouvement de la paix (1905)\nQuestion:\nWho shared the 1901 Nobel Peace Prize (the first) with Frederic Passy, for his work which inspired the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention?\nAnswer:\nJean Dunant\n", "answers": ["Trent", "Trent (disambiguation)", "TRENT"], "length": 3121, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "10b46ba322d1d3087af3ac259c78251ce11034c65818348d"}

Except for those that fall at the same time as UK public holidays, none of these holidays are bank holidays. There is, however, much support for the recognition of St David's Day as a bank holiday in Wales, in the same way as St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland, and St Andrew's Day in Scotland.\n\nMany of the seasoned festivals originate in the Celtic culture of Wales, as does the manner of their celebration.\n\nHistoric Practice\n\nAs recorded in the Laws of Hywel Dda, the three main holidays (gwyliau) of the medieval Welsh kingdoms were Christmas (Nadolig), Easter (Pasg), and Whitsuntide (Sulgwyn). \n\nOther important holidays were the feasts of St Patrick (Gwyl Badric) on 17 March; St. Quiricus (Gwyl Giric) on 16 June; the Beheading of John the Baptist (called in Welsh Gwyl Ieuan y Moch  St. John of the Swine  as it was the day the pigs were turned out into the woods to forage through the winter ) on 29 August; St Michael (Gwyl Fihangel) on 29 September; and the Calends of Winter (Calan Gaeaf) on 1 November, All Saints' Day (yr Holl Saint).  A special drink called the \"liquor of the Apostles\" (gwirawd yr ebestyl) was brewed for and distributed on these saints' days. \n\nSaints' Days\n\nSt. David's Day\n\nThe patron saint, of Wales is St David, .

Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.\nToday, Tiergarten Schönbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.\n\nDescription\n\nTiergarten Schönbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (福豹), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. \n\nOther zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.\n\nOn 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. \n\nFrom its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.\n\nPrivate and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.\n\nHistory\n\nThe zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Schönbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.\n\nThe central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf Bäuerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().\n\nAt the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.\n\nBombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.\n\nThe zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.\n\nPechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the \"Tyrolean farmhouse\". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.\n\nIn the media\n\nA number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. \n\nThe zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.\n\nThe 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin\n\nThe zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.\n\nThe reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.\n\nLiterature \n\n* Ash, Mitchell and Dittrich, Lothar (ed.), Menagerie des Kaisers – Zoo der Wiener, Pichler Verlag, Vienna, 2002.

If the opposition party is elected to government, the Shadow Home Secretary often becomes the new Home Secretary though this is not always the case.  The office is held by Labour MP Andy Burnham.\n\nList of Shadow Home Secretaries\nQuestion:\nWho is the Shadow Home Secretary?\nAnswer:\nAndy Burnham\nPassage:\nRoy Greenslade\nRoy Greenslade (born 31 December 1946) is Professor of Journalism at City University London  and has been a media commentator since 1992, most especially for The Guardian. He writes a daily blog on The Guardian media site and wrote a column for the London Evening Standard for ten years from 2006.  \n\nEarly life and career\n\nHe was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957–63) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail.\n\nAt The Sun and elsewhere\n\nIn 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department.\n\nHe left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time subbing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star.\n\nIn 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was very involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nWhile editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable.  He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: ″On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.″ \n\nHe departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today.\n\nThe Guardian and other outlets\n\nFrom 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993–95) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters.\n\nAfter leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper.  In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: \"Whatever happens, this I know:journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled\".\n\nOther work\n\nHe is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson.\n\nGreenslade has been credited with coining the term: \"The Hierarchy of Death\" as well as writing extensively on the subject.  \n\nHe is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).\n\nIrish republicanism\n\nDuring the late 1980s, when he was managing news editor of The Sunday Times, he secretly wrote for An Phoblacht, a newspaper published by Sinn Féin.  His pseudonym was 'George King'. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht.  Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn Féin conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn Féin, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.   He also stood surety for IRA member John Downey, one of the suspects in the 1982 bombing of Hyde Park which killed four soldiers. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married to Noreen Taylor, the former Daily Mirror journalist and mother of actress Natascha McElhone.\nQuestion:\nWhich national newspaper has been edited by Roy Greenslade, Colin Myler and Piers Morgan?\nAnswer:\nThe Daily Mirror\nPassage:\nBirchfield Harriers\nBirchfield Harriers is an athletics club, founded in 1877.

Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.\nIn 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.\nIn 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.\nOn February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nAt which castle was Mary Queen of Scots beheaded?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nUrban Dictionary: nothing but net\nUrban Dictionary: nothing but net\nnothing but net\nSaid when a 'swish' is made on the basketball court.

He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner's lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linné Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.\n\nReturning home in 1834, he entered his father’s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig's laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.\n\nIn Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas’ lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813–1891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eugène Chevreul’s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig’s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.\n\nIn 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published Précis de chimie organique (1844–1845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron’s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.\n\nHe obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an École de chimie pratique (\"School for practical chemistry\") for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Zürich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the École Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for Traité de chimie organique (4 vols., Paris, 1853–56), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.\n\nWork\n\nGerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843–1846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.\n\nGerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in chemical combination.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his birthday, after being poisoned by his own chemicals during laboratory work. He was 39 years old.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n\"in 1853 while working on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt made acetylsalicylic acid by mixing acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate).

The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca – also referred to as Hashemites – who ruled Mecca continuously from the 10th century until its conquest by the House of Saud in 1924. Their eponymous ancestor is Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The current dynasty was founded by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, who was appointed as Sharif and Emir of Mecca by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, then in 1916 was proclaimed King of the Arab Lands (but only recognized as King of the Hejaz) after initiating the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His sons Abdullah and Faisal assumed the thrones of Jordan and Iraq in 1921.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Hashemites  claim to trace their ancestry from Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf (died c. 497 AD), the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although the definition today mainly refers to the descendants of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah.  The early history of the Hashemites saw them in a continuous struggle against the Umayyads for control over who would be the caliph or successor to Muhammad. The Umayyads were of the same tribe as the Hashemites, but a different clan. After the overthrow of the Umayyads, the Abbasids would present themselves as representatives of the Hashemites, as they claimed descent from Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, an uncle of Muhammad. Muhammad's father had died before he was born, and his mother died while he was a child, so Muhammad was raised by his uncle Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, chief of the Hashemites. \n\nFrom the 10th century onwards, the sharif (religious leader) of Mecca and its Emir was, by traditional agreement, a Hashemite. Before World War I, Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite Dhawu-'Awn clan ruled the Hejaz on behalf of the Ottoman sultan. For some time it had been the practice of the Sublime Porte to appoint the Emir of Mecca from among a select group of candidates. In 1908, Hussein bin Ali was appointed to the Emirate of Mecca. He found himself increasingly at odds with the Young Turks in control at Istanbul, while he strove to secure his family's position as hereditary Emirs.\n\nDuring and after World War I \n\nSharif Hussein bin Ali rebelled against the rule of the Ottomans during the Arab Revolt of 1916.  Between 1917 and 1924, after the collapse of Ottoman power, Hussein bin Ali ruled an independent Hejaz, of which he proclaimed himself king, with the tacit support of the British Foreign Office. His supporters are sometimes referred to as \"Sharifians\" or the \"Sharifian party\". Hussein bin Ali's chief rival in the Arabian Peninsula, the king of the Najd (highlands), Ibn Saud, annexed the Hejaz in 1925 and established his own son, Faysal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as governor. The region was later incorporated into Saudi Arabia.\n\nHussein bin Ali had five sons:\n\n* Ali, who briefly succeeded to the throne of Hejaz before its loss to the Saud family in 1925.\n* Abdullah, became the amir of Transjordan in 1921 and king of Jordan in 1946, and whose descendants continue to rule the kingdom known ever since as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n* Faisal, briefly proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, became King of Iraq in 1921.\n* Prince Zeid bin Hussein, who moved to Jordan when his brother's grandson, King Faisal II of Iraq, was overthrown and murdered in a coup in 1958.\n* Hassan, died at a young age.\n\nFamily tree\nQuestion:\nThe Hashemite ruler Faisal 2nd was the last king of which country?\nAnswer:\nEragh\nPassage:\nBrassica oleracea\nBrassica oleracea is the species of plant that includes many common foods as cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, savoy, kohlrabi and kai-lan.\n\nIn its uncultivated form, it is known as wild cabbage. It is native to coastal southern and western Europe. Its high tolerance of salt and lime and its intolerance of competition from other plants typically restrict its natural occurrence to limestone sea cliffs, like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel,  and the windswept coast on the western side of the Isle of Wight.\n\nWild B. oleracea is a tall biennial plant, forming a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year, the leaves being fleshier and thicker than those of other species of Brassica, adaptations to store water and nutrients in its difficult growing environment. In its second year, the stored nutrients are used to produce a flower spike 1 to(-) tall bearing numerous yellow flowers.\n\nCultivation and uses \n\nB. oleracea has become established as an important human food crop plant, used because of its large food reserves, which are stored over the winter in its leaves. It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C.  A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower) is linked to a reduced risk of several human cancers.Verhoeven DT, Goldbohm RA, van Poppel G, Verhagen H, van den Brandt PA (1996)Epidemiological studies on brassica vegetables and cancer risk.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev5(9):733–748. Higdon JV, Delage B, Williams DE, Dashwood RH (2007) Cruciferous vegetables and human cancer risk: Epidemiologic evidence and mechanistic basis. Pharmacol Res 55(3):224–236.\n\nAlthough it is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years, its history as a domesticated plant is not clear before Greek and Roman times, when it was a well-established garden vegetable. Theophrastus mentions three kinds of rhaphanos (ῤάφανος):  a curly-leaved, a smooth-leaved, and a wild-type.  He reports the antipathy of the cabbage and the grape vine, for the ancients believed cabbages grown near grapes would impart their flavour to the wine.  It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collards, and kale, some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus, let alone species. The historical genus of Crucifera, meaning \"cross-bearing,\" may be the only unifying feature beyond taste.\n\nOrigins \n\nAccording to the Triangle of U theory, B. oleracea is very closely related to five other species of the genus Brassica.\n\nThe cultivars of B. oleracea are grouped by developmental form into seven major cultivar groups, of which the Acephala (\"non-heading\") group remains most like the natural Wild Cabbage in appearance:\n*Brassica oleracea Acephala Group – kale and collard greens\n*Brassica oleracea Alboglabra Group – Chinese broccoli or Kai-lan\n*Brassica oleracea Botrytis Group – cauliflower, Romanesco broccoli and broccoflower\n*Brassica oleracea Capitata Group – cabbage\n*Brassica oleracea Gemmifera Group – brussels sprouts\n*Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group – kohlrabi\n*Brassica oleracea Italica Group – broccoli\n\nIn places such as the Channel Islands and Canary Islands where the frost is minimal and plants are thus freed from seasonality, some cultivars, known as Jersey cabbages, can grow up to three meters tall. These \"tree cabbages\" yield fresh leaves throughout the year, are perennial, and do not need to be destroyed at harvest as with a normal cabbage. Their woody stalks are sometimes dried and made into [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bâtons_d%27chour.jpg walking sticks]. \n\nHistory \n\nWith the advent of agriculture and the domestication of wild crop plants, the peoples of the Mediterranean began cultivating wild cabbage. Through artificial selection for various phenotype traits the emergence of variations of the plant with drastic differences in looks took only a few thousand years. Preference for leaves, terminal bud, lateral bud, stem and inflorescence evolved the wild cabbage into the many forms we know today. \n\nImpact of Preference  \n\n* The preference for the eating of the leaves led to the selection of plants with larger leaves being harvested and their seeds planted for the next growth. Around the 5th century BC the formation of what we now know as kale had developed. \n* Preference led to further artificial selection of kale plants with more tightly bunched leaves, or terminal bud. Somewhere around the 1st century AD emerged the phenotype variation of Brassica oleracea that we know as cabbage. \n* Phenotype selection preferences in Germany led kale down another evolutionary pathway. By selecting for fatter stems the variant plant known as kohlrabi emerged around the 1st century AD. \n* Further selection in Belgium in lateral bud led to the Brussels sprout in the 18th century.\n* European preference emerged for eating immature buds, selection for inflorescence. By the 15th century AD cauliflower had developed leading also to the emergence of broccoli in Italy about 100 years later.\n\nCultivars\nQuestion:\nWhich vegetable, of the species Brassica Oleracea, has the varieties Nevada and Canberra?\nAnswer:\nPurple cauliflower\nPassage:\nThe Blue Moon Boys\nThe Blue Moon Boys were a band formed by Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. The group members were introduced by Sun Studio owner Sam Phillips in 1954, except for D.J. Fontana, who joined the group during a Louisiana Hayride tour in 1955.\n\nBackground \n\nOn July 18, 1953, Elvis Presley recorded a single in the studio as a gift for his mother's birthday, the Ink Spots' \"My Happiness\", with \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\" on the flipside. \nPresley's recording was managed by Phillips' secretary, Marion Keisker, who also kept a demo recording for the absent owner of the studio. \nKeisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later, he returned on June 26, 1954, and although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the country music band Starlight Wranglers' guitarist Scotty Moore, who later introduced Presley to bassist Bill Black.\n\nSun recordings \n\nOn July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs \"Harbor Lights\" and \"I Love You Because\", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right\", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded. \nPhillips played the recording for WHBQ's DJ Dewey Phillips, who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8. \nOn July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to \"That's All Right\", an uptempo rockabilly version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\".   \nThe single was released on July 19, 1954,  and was a local hit in Arkansas, Mississippi and New Orleans.\n\nLive appearances \n\nScotty Moore became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. ISBN 0-316-33225-9. Both Moore and Black focused more on the group after they let Presley perform at the regular Starlight Wrangler's show on the Bon Air club, where the reception of the audience was unfavorable, and led to animosity between them and the other members of the group for having to leave the stage.\nThe Blue Moon boys appeared on a regular basis on Eagle's Nest club in Memphis, Tennessee.  Sam Phillips booked the band an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry, which was not well received.\nAfter the failure, Phillips contacted Opry's main competition, the Louisiana Hayride. They made their first appearance on October 16, 1954. Presley sang \"That's All Right\" followed by the flipside of the record, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\". The performance was well received and they signed a one-year contract to be official members of the Hayride, while Presley also signed a new management contract with Bob Neal. \nOn August 8, D.J. Fontana joined the band as the drummer on a regular basis after having played occasionally with them, the first time in Shreveport and subsequently on tour.\nAfter disputes with Hank Snow's manager, Tom Parker, who booked most of Presley's appearances, Bob Neal turned over the contract to Colonel Parker who became officially Presley's manager on December 15, 1955. \n\nRCA Records and later years \n\nIn January 1956 Presley signed a $40,000  contract with RCA Records,  recording for the first time on January 10, 1956, Mae Axton's \"Heartbreak Hotel\".  The Blue Moon Boys continued appearing on Presley's recordings as well as in movies like Loving You. The first live appearance of the band since Presley's army return was in 1960, during The Frank Sinatra Show's special Welcome Home Elvis. The band's last appearance was during the Elvis 1968 Comeback Special —minus Bill Black, who had died in 1965 of a brain tumor. In 2007, the Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. \n\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhose original back up group were The Blue Moon Boys?\nAnswer:\nElvis Aron Presley\nPassage:\nBulb\nIn botany, a bulb is a short stem with fleshy leaves or leaf bases  that function as food storage organs during dormancy. (In gardening, plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called \"ornamental bulbous plants\" or just \"bulbs\".)\n\nA bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. Roots emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. Tunicate bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.  Species in the genera Allium, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and Tulipa all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as Lilium and Fritillaria species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales. \n\n \nOther types of storage organs (such as corms, rhizomes, and tubers) are sometimes referred to as bulbs, although as the term is used in botany, they are not. The technical term for plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as tubers and corms, is geophyte. Some epiphytic orchids (family Orchidaceae) form above-ground storage organs called pseudobulbs, that superficially resemble bulbs.\n\nNearly all plants that form true bulbs are monocotyledons, and include:\n*Amaryllis, Crinum, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and several other members of the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae. This includes onion, garlic, and other alliums, members of the Amaryllid subfamily Allioideae.\n*Lily, tulip, and many other members of the lily family Liliaceae.\n*Two groups of Iris species, family Iridaceae: subgenus Xiphium (the \"Dutch\" irises) and subgenus Hermodactyloides (the miniature \"rock garden\" irises).\nOxalis, in the family Oxalidaceae, is the only dicotyledon genus that produces true bulbs. \n\nBulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring. Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.\n\nAfter the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.\n\nBulbil \n\nA bulbil is a small bulb, and may also be called a bulblet, bulbet, or bulbel.\n\nSmall bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called renewal bulbs. Increase bulbs are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.\n\nSome lilies, such as the tiger lily Lilium lancifolium, form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf axils. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including Allium sativum (garlic), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers. The so-called tree onion (Allium × proliferum) forms small onions which are large enough for pickling.\n\nSome ferns, such as Hen and Chicken Fern produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae, which are sometimes referred to as bulbils.\n\nImage:Lilium lancifolium bulbils.jpg|Bulbils form in the leaf axils of Lilium lancifolium\nImage:Alliumvineale1web.jpg|Wild garlic (Allium vineale) bulbils sprouting\nImage:Allium fistulosum bulbifera0.jpg|\"Tree onions\" form clusters of small bulbs instead of flowers\nQuestion:\nWhich autumn-flowering bulbous plant is sometimes known as ‘the belladonna lily’?\nAnswer:\nMarch lilly\nPassage:\nNational Trails\nNational Trails are long distance footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales.

{"input": "Passage:\nHow the Kinks' Beloved 'Village Green Preservation Society ...\nHow the Kinks' Beloved 'Village Green Preservation Society' Completely Flopped\nSubscribe to Ultimate Classic Rock on\nThe Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society was both ahead of and behind the times when it arrived in November 1968. A critical success, but commercial disappointment at the time, the LP eventually became the Kinks’ bestselling studio album – prompting frontman Ray Davies  to once refer to it as “the most successful flop of all time.”\nDavies got the idea for a concept record about small-town life when the Kinks recorded the song “Village Green” in 1967 during the sessions for Something Else by the Kinks. The rural snapshots seemed to capture his imagination. He wrote insightful and engaging songs about memories, nostalgia, eccentric village characters and acceptance, or rejection, of the changing times. The result was the audio equivalent to the scrapbook Davies sings about in “Picture Book.”\nThe sounds of the Village Green album matched its subject matter: folksy and baroque, with an emphasis on acoustic strumming and symphonic arrangements. Most of the orchestral sounds heard on the LP were courtesy of legendary session man Nicky Hopkins playing the Mellotron. Although the Kinks’ “pinky in the air” approach was an extension of recent hits like “Autumn Almanac” and “Days” (the latter was actually recorded during the Village Green sessions), when all of these songs were placed together, the album suggested a band that was out of step with the late ’60s. Even reviewers who heaped praised on Village Green Preservation Society couldn’t help but shake their heads at a group that was looking backward while war protesters were obsessed with the present and hippies were dreaming of a future.\nBut is this why Village Green Preservation Society failed to connect with rock fans at first? Didn’t the back-to-basic approach of the Band and Paul McCartney ’s dance hall obsessions sound just as antiquated in 1968? Maybe the album’s initial failure also can be blamed on the lack of a strong single. “Starstruck” was the only one released from the LP. One can’t help think that the title track or “Picture Book” would have been a better choice.\nRegardless, the album (which Davies wanted to turn into a double LP, but settled on a 15-track single record) marked the end of an era for the Kinks. It became their first LP to not chart in the U.K. and appeared to slam the door on any future commercial ambitions in their home country. Things were not as dire in the U.S., where the album came out in January 1969, even though it remains the only original Kinks album to fail to graze the U.S. charts. Village Green also was the last time the founding Kinks members would record together, after bassist Pete Quaife left the band in early 1969.\nBut Village Green Preservation Society would live on in many ways. Davies, pleased with the results if not the public’s reaction, would continue his efforts with two more Preservation albums, and he considers them a trilogy.

In addition, there were 8,000 cigars and 1,500 bottles of wine.\nThe 1898 novel Futility by Morgan Robertson seemed to foreshadow the Titanic disaster. The work describes the demise of the Titan, an 800-foot passenger liner that strikes an iceberg on its starboard side in April and sinks with great loss of life due to insufficient lifeboats.\nSeveral years before becoming captain of the Titanic, Edward J. Smith stated: I cannot imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder.Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\nThe radio call sign of the Titanic was MGY.\nThe liner featured new davits that could accommodate at least 48 lifeboats. However, for both financial and aesthetic reasons, White Star decided to carry only 20, which was still 4 more than was required by the British Board of Trade.\nThe Titanic had three types of lifeboats. Fourteen were standard boats, capable of holding approximately 65 people each. Two were emergency cutters, which could carry 40 people. They were designed for quick lowering for such events as a person overboard. There were also four collapsible boats, which had canvas sides and could be folded for easy storage. These lifeboats had a capacity of 47 each.\nAs the Titanic sank, wireless operator Jack Phillips initially sent out a CQD, which was still used even though SOS had become the official distress signal several years earlier. However, after his assistant, Harold Bride, joked that he might not have a chance to use SOS again, Phillips began sending out both distress signals.\nIn CQD, the CQ signifies a general call, and the D represents distress. Contrary to popular belief, SOS does not mean save our ship. The letter combination was selected because of the distinct sound it makes in Morse Code.\nThe Titanic employed a bugler who would play The Roast Beef of Old England to alert passengers when meals were being served.\nA number of passengers brought dogs on the Titanic. During the sinking, the kennels were reportedly opened. Although accounts differ, it is likely that only two dogs were rescued.\nThe ship's maiden voyage was initially scheduled for March 20, 1912. However, after the Olympic collided with the Hawke, work on the Titanic temporarily halted so that its sister ship could be repaired.\nBoth the Carpathia and the Californian were sunk by German U-boats during World War I. The Britannic, which was still being constructed when its sister ship Titanic sank, foundered after reportedly striking a German mine.\nCrew members Violet Jessop and John Priest survived the sinkings of both the Titanic and the Britannic. In addition, they were also onboard the Olympic when it collided with the Hawke.\nAfter the Titanic sank, a number of people talked of raising the wreck. Among the ideas proposed was filling the hull with Ping-Pong balls.\nIn the wake of the disaster, White Star contracted several boatsnotably the Mackay-Bennettfor the grim job of retrieving bodies. Badly deteriorated corpses were buried at sea, while the others were brought to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and placed in a curling rink until being claimed.\nAmong the bodies recovered was John Jacob Astor's. He was assigned number 124 by the Mackay-Bennett, and his effects included a gold watch, a diamond ring, a gold pencil, and $2,240 in bank notes.\nAfter the collision, Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall determined the Titanic's position as 41°46¢ N 50°14¢ W. In accordance with his wishes, Boxhall's ashes were spread at that location following his death in 1967. When the wreck was found in 1985, it was some 13 nautical miles (24 km) away.\nCharles Lightoller, the Titanic's second officer, remained with White Star until it became apparent that he would never be given command of a ship. During World War II he sailed a yacht to Dunkirk, France, to help with the evacuation of Allied troops and rescued some 130 men.\nAfter the Olympic's collision in 1911, some claimed that White Star had switched the Titanic and Olympic and it was actually the Olympic that sank in 1912. This conspiracy theory, however, was largely discredited, especially after the discovery in the wreckage of a propeller and other items that bore the Titanic's yard number, 401; the Olympic's was 400.\nQuestion:\nThe Titanic had three anchors.  What was their combined weight (in tons)?\nAnswer:\n31 tons\nPassage:\nChrometophobia - money fear, money phobia, fear of money ...\nChrometophobia - money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia\nWebsites\nWelcome to my site for Chrometophobia.

Please use the other links in the navigation bar to find information on Chrometophobia.\nWhat is phobia?\nA phobia is a strong, persistent fear of situations, objects, activities, or persons. The main symptom of this disorder is the excessive, unreasonable desire to avoid the feared subject. Phobias are believed to be developed by heredity, genetics and brain-chemistry combine with life-experiences.\nTypes of phobias: Social phobias, Specific phobias and Agoraphobia\nSocial phobias are fears that involve other people or social situations such as performance anxiety, fears of embarrassment or humiliation by scrutiny of others. Examples of these phobias would be eating in public, giving a speech, and even sexual activities. People with these phobias tend to  avoid the situations they fear.\nSpecific phobias are typically fears of certain objects or situations. Specific phobias usually contain specific panic triggers, such as spiders, snakes, mice, elevators, or flying. These fears develop during childhood and tend to go away, for example, the fear of the dark. If the fear continues through to adulthood, treatment would be the only solution. These fears can keep people from having a normal life, depending on how often they must encounter/avoid the fear.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of experiencing a panic attack in a place or situation from which escape may be difficult or embarrassing or they cannot obtain help. People with this phobia may fear being alone, being in a crowd, flying, being in an elevator. Agoraphobia is the only phobia regularly treated as a medical condition.\n \nNote: If you are going to do a search, some common Chrometophobia search terms include Chrometophobia, money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia.\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ - By printing, downloading, or using you this information, you agree to the following: 1) I am only providing this material for information and research purposes. 2) The information is \"AS IS\", \"WITH ALL FAULTS\". 3) You understand the information was gathered by doing a general search on Internet search engines for the following terms: Chrometophobia, money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia. 4) User assumes all risk of use, damage, or injury. 5) Information may have errors or be outdated. 6) Some information is from historical sources or represents opinions of the author. 7) You agree that we have no liability for any damages. 8) I are not liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, or special damages.

For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.\n\nWhile the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder: \n*Places his or her front foot behind or on the front bolts of the board and towards the heel-side edge of the board.\n*The skater pushes the ball of the back foot on the tail of the board slightly angled initiating the \"pop\" and a slight spin. \n*The rider's front foot is slid out diagonally in order to start the board rotating while the shoulders are centered over the board.\n*His or her feet are lifted out of the way so that their board can spin completely.\n*The rider catches their board and roll away. Skateboarders considered it good execution of the trick to stop the board's rotation with the feet in midair rather than to allow contact with the ground to stop the board.\n\nVariations\n\nVariations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:\n\n*Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.\n*Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.\n*Heelflip Body Varial,(not to be confused with the disco flip, in which a riders performs a sex change 180 while executing a Kickflip), where the skater does a backside 180 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.\n*Varial Heelflip, where the board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees frontside (frontside pop shove-it) at the same time.\n*Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.\n*Late Front-Foot Heelflip, in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.\n*Late Heelflip, in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.\n*The Heelflip Grab, a variation on grabs where the rider flips the board and catches it with his hand rather than the feet. It was first done on a vertical ramp but now is very commonly seen done on launch ramps or other surfaces which can generate sufficient air time.\n*Inward Heelflip, a combination of the backside pop shove-it and the Heelflip, this trick is usually executed with the crossing of the skater's legs. The opposite of a Hardflip.\n*Bigspin Heel, the skaters body does a frontside 180 while their board does a laser flip.\nQuestion:\nHeel flip, kick flip, and ollie are tricks in which action sport?\nAnswer:\nTAK Skateboarding\n", "answers": ["The Kinks", "John Gosling (The Kinks musician)", "Gordon John Edwards", "The Ray Davies Quartet", "Kinks", "The Kinks (band)", "Kinks, The", "THE KINKS"], "length": 3078, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "43c422d9cef2d1e15c3e13aa540c027512d990abdb28615c"}

This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes. \nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.  It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury's other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4's Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don't mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn. Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791. Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow. The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats. It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.  At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.  After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks. \nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.  Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCaryn\nCaryn is a given name.

The song is also referred to by the title \"Oh, My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\", \"My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\" or \"Red, Red Rose\" and is often published as a poem.\n\nThe poem\n\nO my Luve's like a red, red rose\nThat’s newly sprung in June;\nO my Luve's like the melodie\nThat’s sweetly play'd in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonnie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I:\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a’ the seas gang dry:\n\nTill a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi’ the sun:\nI will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o’ life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only Luve\nAnd fare thee weel, a while!\nAnd I will come again, my Luve,\nTho’ it were ten thousand mile.\n\nOrigins of the song\n\nBurns worked for the final ten years of his life on projects to preserve traditional Scottish songs for the future. In all, Burns had a hand in preserving over 300 songs for posterity, the most famous being \"Auld Lang Syne\". He worked on this project for James Johnson's the Scots Musical Museum (1787-1803) and for George Thomson's five-volume A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice. \nBurns had intended the work to be published as part of Thomson's selection. However, he wrote to a friend that Thomson and he disagreed on the merits of that type of song. \"What to me appears to be the simple and the wild, to him, and I suspect to you likewise, will be looked on as the ludicrous and the absurd.\"\n\nInstead, Burns gave the song to Scots singer Pietro Urbani who published it in his Scots Songs. In his book, Urbani claimed the words of The Red Red Rose were obligingly given to him by a celebrated Scots poet, who was so struck by them when sung by a country girl that he wrote them down and, not being pleased with the air, begged the author to set them to music in the style of a Scots tune, which he has done accordingly. In other correspondence, Burns referred to it as a \"simple old Scots song which I had picked up in the country.\"\n\nThe lyrics of the song are simple but effective. \"My luve's like a red, red rose/That's newly sprung in June\" describe a love that is both fresh and long lasting. David Daiches in his work describes Burns as \"the greatest songwriter Britain has produced\" for his work in refurbishing and improving traditional Scots songs including \"Red, Red Rose\" which he described as a \"combination of tenderness and swagger.\"\n\nMusical performances\n\nUrbani published the song to an original tune that he wrote. The song appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1797 to the tune of Niel Gow's \"Major Graham\" which was the tune that Burns wanted. In 1799, it appeared in Thomson's Scottish Airs set to William Marshall's Wishaw's Favourite  with the lyric \"And fare thee weel awhile\" changed.\n\nThe song became more popular when Robert Archibald Smith paired it with the tune of \"Low Down in the Broom\" in his Scottish Minstrel book in 1821. This has become the most popular arrangement. The song has been widely performed by a range of artists in the 20th and 21st centuries including Jean Redpath, Pat Boone, Kenneth McKellar, the Fureys, Eddi Reader, Camera Obscura, Eva Cassidy, Izzy, and Ronnie Browne of the Corries (in his solo album after Roy Williamson's death, 'Scottish Love Songs'(1995)).\n\nRobert Schumann composed a setting of a German translation of Burns's poem in 1840.\n\nSinger and actor Pat Boone performed the song on piano in the 1959 film adaptation of A Journey to the Center of the Earth.\n\nFour modern choral arrangements include a four-part, a cappella version by David Dickau, an intimate, Irish folk music-influenced setting, also SATB a cappella, by Matthew Brown (\"A Red, Red Rose,\" published by Santa Barbara Music), an accompanied SATB setting by James Mulholland as well as a broader version by American composer René Clausen.  Clausen's arrangement incorporates a piano, two violins, and a four-part chorus. (SATB) A Swedish translation and recording named \"Min älskling (du är som en ros)\" was made famous by the renowned Swedish musician Evert Taube.\n\nCarly Simon sang a solo version of \"A Red, Red Rose\" on the album The Simon Sisters Sing The Lobster Quadrille And Other Songs For Children that she produced with her sister Lucy Simon.\nA version of Oh My Love is like a Red, Red Rose by Italian singer Ariella Uliano was performed with classical guitar accompaniment on the album Leave Only Your Footsteps Behind.\n\nThe lyrics are included in the song \"Final Breath\" by the post rock band Pelican on their album What We All Come to Need.\n\nMoscow-based indie rock band \"Red Red Rose\" derives its name from the poem and has a song called \"RRR\" inspired by the poem.\n\nInspiration\n\nWhen asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration, American singer songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burns' 1794 song A Red, Red Rose, as the lyrics that have had the biggest effect on his life.  \n\nSymbolism \n\nThe song is highly evocative, including lines describing rocks melting with the sun, and the seas running dry. Burns may have been inspired by the concept of deep time put forward a few years earlier by geologist James Hutton in his Theory of the Earth in 1789\n \n.  Hutton and Burns were contemporaries, and would have mixed in similar circles in Edinburgh.\nQuestion:\nWhich poet’s love is like a red, red, rose that’s newly sprung in June?\nAnswer:\nRabbie Burns\nPassage:\nPule cheese\nPule cheese, or just pule, is a cheese made from the milk of Balkan donkeys from Serbia.\n\nA distinctive dairy product of Serbian cuisine, pule is reportedly the \"world's most expensive cheese\", fetching 1,000 Euros per kilogram. In September 2013, the cheese was valued by a news source at $600 USD per pound. It is so expensive because of its rarity: there are only about 100 jennies in the landrace of Balkan donkeys that are milked for pule-making, each jenny must be hand-milked thrice daily, it takes 25 litres (6.6 gallons) of milk to create one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cheese, and the cheese is then smoked.\nQuestion:\nPule cheese, said to be the world's most expensive was in the news in Dec 2012 when Novak Djokovic bought the world's supply for his restaurant chain.

It is the only Level 42 song to be a top 10 hit in the United States, where it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and it is their second top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, reaching #6 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Something About You\" appears in many Level 42 collections: Level Best, The Very Best of Level 42, and The Definitive Collection.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video of \"Something About You\" is directed by Stuart Orme, who also directed videos for the Level 42 songs \"Lessons in Love\" and \"Running in the Family\", as well as Phil Collins and Genesis. The music video appears in their video album Family of Five, released in 1987.\n\nMark King appears as a dark clown magician, representing the negative aspects in the relationships of Mike Lindup, Phil and Boon Gould with their girlfriends, all played by actress Cherie Lunghi. \n\nCover versions\n\n* In 1993, Paul Shaffer and the Party Boys of Rock 'n' Roll recorded an instrumental version for their album The World's Most Dangerous Party.\n* In 2006, Anthony David recorded a cover of the song for his album The Red Clay Chronicles.\n* In 2008, American R&B duo Zo! and Tigallo (Phonte, formerly of Little Brother) recorded a cover for their EP entitled Zo! & Tigallo Love the 80's.\n* In 2010, Cary Brothers included a cover of the song on his album Under Control.\n* In 2011, guitarist Craig Sharmat covered the song on his album Outside In, released on Innervision records in February of that year.\n* In 2012, the Virgo Vertigo (aka - Tory World) covered the song for a video journal on YouTube.\n\nSampling\n\nJapanese rapper Zeebra sampled Something About You in his song \"Touch The Sky\".\n\nAppearances in other media\n\nThe song was featured on the soundtrack of the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional in-game station \"Vice City FM\".\n\nChart performance\n\nWeekly singles charts\n\nYear-end charts\nQuestion:\nSomething About You and Lessons In Love were top ten hits for which group\nAnswer:\nLevel 42\nPassage:\nMidori (liqueur)\nMidori is a sweet, bright-green-coloured, muskmelon-flavored liqueur made by Suntory. It is manufactured in Japan, USA, Mexico, and France, although it was made exclusively in Japan until 1987. Midori is usually 20–21% alcohol by volume. Its name is the Japanese word for \"green\". French-made Midori is sweeter than the original Japanese version.\n\nAs it is extremely sweet, Midori is not usually taken \"straight\"; it is generally used in a mixed drink (i.e., a cocktail), such as a Japanese slipper. It is usually used in a range of long drinks – with lemonade, fresh lemon juice, lime juice, pineapple juice, or orange juice.

Is this true? What's the tale?\nIf only it were that simple. The true story is that the queen of hearts was once wed to the king of hearts, until he caught her giving the jack of diamonds a royal flush, whereupon he yanked the jack off, grabbed the nearby ace of spades, and clubbed them both to death.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nBut seriously. Playing cards are cultural artifacts tracing back at least a millennium, beginning in China before A.D. 1000. By the 13th century, they had reached the Middle East; the oldest known deck, from Egypt's Mamluk period, already consisted of 52 cards.\nThe Islamic suits were adapted variously in southern Europe in the late 14th century, and figures and caricatures were added. The pattern that we now consider standard -- hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds, kings, queens, and jacks -- originated in France in the mid-15th century. The French liked to use representations of specific persons on their court cards, but they varied from deck to deck, place to place, and time to time. These featured kings supposed to represent Charlemagne, Alexander the Great, Caesar, and King David, and queenly portrayals of Pallas, Greek goddess of war and wisdom, Helen of Troy, and Rachel and Judith, two Old Testament heroines. Speculation abounds about the jacks, but most experts agree that they are based on La Hire, one of Joan of Arc's comrades; Hector, a prince of Troy; Judas Maccabaeus, an ancient Jewish warrior; and Brad Pitt.\nGot a question?

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2½ furlongs (5,331 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1957, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers. \n\nThe race's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history, and this now represents British racing's longest commercial sponsorship. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001.\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

The southern extent of the range fall within East Dunbartonshire. The range overlooks the villages of Strathblane, Blanefield and Lennoxtown to the south; Killearn to the west; Fintry and Strathendrick to the north. The Fintry Hills lie further to the north; Kilpatrick Hills lie to the west and the Kilsyth Hills to the east.\n\nThe Earl's Seat is the highest point of the Campsie Fells, measuring 578 m (1896 ft).  On the top of the Earl's Seat is a trig point. Two main ways of climbing the Earl's Seat are by going past Dumgoyne from the Glengoyne Distillery or going up the Fin Glen from Clachan of Campsie.\n\nThe name is taken from one of the individual hills in the range, called Campsie; meaning \"crooked fairy hill\", from the Scottish Gaelic cam, meaning crooked, and sìth meaning fairy. \"Fell\" originates from the Old Norse word fjal, meaning hill.\n\nErosion along the line of a geological fault known as the Campsie Fault has left tiers of rock representing some 30 lava flows which date from the Carboniferous period. The headwaters of the River Carron rise in the Campsies.\n\nThe Campsie Fells have cemented their place in history as the birthplace of Scottish skiing, when W.W.

Months were invented and first used in Mesopotamia to measure the natural period related to the cycle of the moon.\nNames of full moons\nThe addition of January and February moved the months September , October , November , and December to later in the year so they no longer correspond with the original meaning of their names. In the Roman calendar their original names in Latin mean the “seventh”, “eighth”, “ninth”, and “tenth” month.\nIs there a perfect calendar?\nThere are many calendars that use months to divide up the year. The Islamic calendar, the Hebrew calendar, and the Hindu calendar are a few examples. Although the Gregorian calendar is the most commonly used calendar today, other calendars are still used to calculate certain holidays and annual feasts to correspond with the Gregorian calendar.\nOld Names of Months\nMonths in the ancient Roman calendar include:\nMercedonius - an occasional month after February that would be used to realign the Roman calendar. Today we use Leap Day for this alignment.\nQuintilis - renamed July in honor of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE.\nSextilis - renamed August in honor of Roman Emperor Augustus in 8 BCE.\nHow Many Have 28, 30, or 31 Days?\nThe Gregorian calendar has 4 months that are 30 days long and 7 months that are 31 days long. February is the only month that is 28 days long in common years and 29 days long in leap years.\nThe 12 Months of the Year\nThe Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar both consist of the following twelve months:\nQuestion:\nHow many months of the year end in the letter ‘Y’?\nAnswer:\nFour\nPassage:\nBoycie\nHerman Terrance Aubrey \"Boycie\" Boyce (born 31 January 1948) is a fictional character in the popular BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses played by John Challis. His story is continued in the spin-off series The Green Green Grass, which began filming in June 2005, in which Boycie and family have fled from a gang of criminals to the countryside. A younger Boycie also appears in the prequel series Rock & Chips. With Denzil, he is one of only two characters to appear in all three.\n\nProfile\n\nBoycie is a local second-hand car dealer from Lewisham and for a long time was the richest and most successful regular at the Nag's Head pub. Boycie, although materially successful and ostentatious in his spending, remains competitive with Del and other friends, enjoying their company, although he does enjoy reveling in his superiority. Despite this, it appears that he dearly loves his friends throughout the series. He generally wears clothes and carries accessories synonymous with 1980s yuppie success, such as trench coats and very early mobile telephones. In the episode Sickness and Wealth, in which the series regulars took part in a seance, the medium asked for \"an Audrey. Audrey. No... Aubrey?\" When Boycie replied that his middle name was Aubrey, Trigger said \"You never told us your name is Aubrey.\" Boycie replied \"Nor would you if your name was Aubrey.\" Boycie's drink of choice in the Nag's Head is a large cognac.\n\nBoycie and Del share a loose friendship, but prefer to play a long-standing game of one upmanship. They play each other at poker,  in which they both cheat and the stakes are high.  Boycie is at pains to maintain the upper hand over Del in that he is a mason, a successful businessman and wealthier than the Trotters. One of the his trademarks is his deep, mocking laugh, usually following a sarcastic, biting remark at the expense of Del or other characters, as well as his distinctive South London nasal twang. Boycie has appeared since the second episode of the first series; he made sporadic appearances from series 2 - 5 and appeared more in series 6 and 7.\n\nIt is, however, usually Del (a character more street smart and popular with the Nag's Head social group) that wins the upper hand, often trading on the fact that he has a long-standing, flirtatious friendship with Boycie's wife, Marlene. Del has alluded to past sexual encounters with Marlene, and to her reputation amongst Nag's Head regulars as 'The Peckham Bicycle'. He has also claimed to have inside knowledge, through Marlene, of Boycie's marital secrets, and has alleged that Boycie has at times suffered from impotence; these rumours were not fully quashed even after the eventual birth - following many attempts - of Boycie and Marlene's son, Tyler.\n\nBoycie enjoys overt displays of wealth, formerly living in (the fictional) Kings Avenue, the most expensive street in south east London.  Kings Avenue is a parody on one of London's real richest streets, the Bishops Avenue in Hampstead. He also owns a holiday cottage in Cornwall.\n\nIn The Green Green Grass Boycie is portrayed with the same personality as in Only Fools and Horses but he seems to be more respected by the women. In one episode, \"Sex and the Country\" he is seduced by Tyler's English teacher who admits she likes more mature men, and in another episode, \"Life Swap\", Boycie's swapped wife tries to seduce him.\n\nIn two episodes, it is alluded to that Boycie has had at least two extramarital affairs. In \"Go West Young Man\", he reveals he has a 'bit on the side', whom he buys a E type Jaguar for, but Del Boy later crashes it. In \"Dates\", Del blackmails Boycie into doing a favour for him by threatening to inform Marlene of an encounter Boycie had with a woman in Sheffield.\n\nIt is revealed in the episode 'From Prussia With Love' that Boycie spent some time in prison while younger - for unspecified reasons he was convicted of perjury, embezzlement, conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the fraudulent conversion of traveler’s cheques and attempting to bribe the Mayor of Lambeth.\n\nIn Rock & Chips, Boycie is portrayed as a young man and a member of Del's gang at school. From the start, it is obvious that he is still the tight person seen in the original stories, although he is much more amiable and humorous as a young man. Later in the series, after leaving school, he gets a job as a car cleaner for Alberto Balsam, a Spanish second-hand car dealer. Although the series would end following John Sullivan's passing, it is possible that Boycie inherited the showroom from Balsam and turned it into his own business. Though Boycie is clean shaven throughout the prequel, Sullivan had reportedly intended for Boycie to grow his trademark moustache in later episodes.\n\nFirst name\n\nThroughout Only Fools and Horses and The Green Green Grass, Boycie is given many first names including Aubrey, which later is identified as his middle name, as can be heard during the seance scene in the episode \"Sickness and Wealth\". At his remarriage, after discovering he hadn't been married to Marlene for forty years because the registrar was unlicensed, the Vicar names him as Herman Aubrey Boyce. However, in \"Strangers on the Shore\", his first name is clearly seen as Terrance on the contract book towards the end of the episode.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of Boycie's wife in 'Only Fools and Horses?\nAnswer:\nMARLENE\nPassage:\nWhy must opposite faces of dice always add up to 7 (1/6,2 ...\nWhy must opposite faces of dice always add up to 7 (1/6,2/5,3/4)?

Would it make any difference if they didn't?\nBill Thomson, Watford, Herts\nThe design as a whole is to provide a randomly determined integer from one to six, each of those values being equally likely to militate against concerns that the faces of dice cause a small bias. For a single roll of a fair s-sided die, the probability of rolling each value is exactly 1/s-an of a discrete uniform distribution. For n multiple rolls, with a s-sided die the possibility space is equal to sn. So, for n rolls of an s-sided die the probability of any result is 1/sn. As the number of dice increases, the distribution of the sum of all numbers tends to normal distribution by the central limit theorem.\nGOTETI MVSR KRISHNA, TADEPALLIGUDEM,ANDHRAPRADESH INDIA\nIf you take the numbers 1,2....6 then add opp faces!

He is also one of Tintin 's closest friends. Haddock is highly addicted to whiskey but he also likes other spirits like rum. He first appeared in The Crab with the Golden Claws and had been in every Tintin  book since then. \nContents\n[ show ]\nHistory\nCaptain Haddock sailed over twenty years with his old friend, Captain Chester , before becoming commander of the Karaboudjan where his alcoholism was taken advantage of by his crooked first mate Allan Thompson . Tintin rescued him from the ship and the two friends were barely ever parted again. He is a direct descendant of the 17th century seafarer Sir Francis Haddock , a sea captain under Charles II. He was the captain for two expeditions during his adventures with Tintin, commanding the Aurora in The Shooting Star during the expedition to find the meteorite and the Sirius , Captain Chester's ship that he lent to Haddock to find Red Rackham's treasure. At the end of the latter adventure, Haddock acquired with the proceeds of the sale of his friend Cuthbert Calculus ' patent for the Shark-proof submarine , Marlinspike Hall , which once belonged to Captain Haddock's ancestor Francis. Haddock retired from sailing there and invited Tintin and Calculus to indefinitely live there with him.\nName\nAs for the origin of the name of Captain Haddock's name, who first appeared in Hergé 's notes in 1938 , according to Philippe Goddin , author of Chronology of a work, it is inspired by Captain Craddock, Franco-German film Hanns Schwarz and Max Vaucorbeil (1931), of which Hergé was a big fan. In the original french version of The Crab with the Golden Claws, Captain Haddock even sings a song in the film: Guys navy. However, according to the first wife of Hergé, Germaine Kiekens , the name \"Haddock\" comes from the English fish dish, the smoked haddock. However, the name Haddock is a real surname in English, examples such as Sir Richard Haddock (1629-1715) ordered the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay. His second son, Nicholas Haddock followed the career of his father. In addition, Herbert James Haddock (1861-1946) was commander of the White Star Line and the Titanic among others in the technical tests before delivery to the transatlantic company, and then the sister ship of the Titanic, the Olympic.\nDrunkness\nCaptain Haddock was a drunkard, Which is one of his weaknesses. He hates drinking anything that doesn´t contain alcohol, like water. He did make attampts to shake this habit, even becoming the president of the Society of Sober Sailors , a seafarers equivalent to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Professor Calculus invented the pills to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant in Tintin and the Picaros , this weakness was gone.\nNames\nCaptain Haddock has a large amount of names hne isyvocabularyells many when he wishes to insult.\nBianca's Names\nBianca Castafiore has trouble remembering Haddock's last name and has created many new names, below is a list:\nAddock, Capslock, Kapok, Bangkok, Bartok, Fatstock, Drydock, Hopscotch, Stopcock, Hammock, Paddock, Hassock, Havoc, Maggot, Bootblack, Balzac, Bedsock, Padlock, Hatbox, Stockpot, Harrock, and Hemlock.\nOne reason why Bianca Castafiore always has trouble saying Haddock's last name correctly may be because when they first met in the book The Calculus Affair, Haddock was unable to say his name correctly:\nCastafiore: Aha, you little flatterer, so you've come to congratulate me, with this... fisherman...

Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nBéchamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by  François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier's Répertoire presents one recipe as: \"White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes.\" \n\nPreparation\n\nBéchamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nBéchamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Crème sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term \"white sauce\" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with béchamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman's Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\nQuestion:\nWhat is the sauce made from adding cheese to a Bechamel sauce?\nAnswer:\nMornay (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nJohn Hicks\nSir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist and one of the most important and influential economists of the twentieth century. The most familiar of his many contributions in the field of economics were his statement of consumer demand theory in microeconomics, and the IS/LM model (1937), which summarised a Keynesian view of macroeconomics.  His book Value and Capital (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory.  The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him.\n\nIn 1972 he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly)  for his pioneering contributions to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory. \n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nHicks was born in 1904 at Warwick, England. His father was a journalist at a local newspaper.\n\nHe was educated at Clifton College (1917–22) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1922–26), financed by mathematical scholarships. During his school days, and in his first year at Oxford, he specialised in mathematics  but also had interests in literature and history. In 1923, he moved to Philosophy, Politics and Economics, the \"new school\" just being started at Oxford, graduating with second-class honors and, so he states, \"no adequate qualification in any of the subjects\" that he had studied. \n\nCareer, influences, and honours\n\nFrom 1926 to 1935 Hicks lectured at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He started  as a labour economist and did descriptive work on industrial relations but gradually he moved over to the analytical side, where his mathematics background returned to the fore. Hick's influences included Lionel Robbins and such associates as Friedrich von Hayek, R.G.D. Allen, Nicholas Kaldor, and Abba Lerner – and Ursula Webb, who, in 1935, became his wife.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938, he lectured at Cambridge where he was also a fellow of Gonville & Caius College. He was mainly occupied in writing Value and Capital, which was based on the work he had done in London. From 1938 to 1946, he was Professor at the University of Manchester. It was there that he did his main work on welfare economics, with its application to social accounting.\n\nIn 1946 he returned to Oxford, first as a research fellow of Nuffield College (1946–52), then as Drummond Professor of Political Economy (1952–65), and finally as a research fellow of All Souls College (1965–71) where he continued writing after retirement. He was also an honorary fellow of Linacre College.  He died in 1989.\n\nHicks was knighted in 1964 and was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (with Kenneth J. Arrow) in 1972. He donated the Nobel Prize to the London School of Economics and Political Science's Library Appeal in 1973.\n\nContributions to economic analysis\n\nHicks's early work as a labour economist culminated in The Theory of Wages (1932, 2nd ed. 1963), still considered standard in the field.  He collaborated with R.G.D. Allen in two seminal papers on value theory published in 1934.\n\nHis magnum opus is Value and Capital published in 1939.  The book built on ordinal utility  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the substitution effect and the income effect for an individual in demand theory for the 2-good case. It generalised the analysis to the case of one good and a composite good, that is, all other goods. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the aggregation problem, most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced general equilibrium theory to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory for dynamic analysis, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.  In the course of analysis Hicks formalised comparative statics.  In the same year, he also developed the famous \"compensation\" criterion called Kaldor–Hicks efficiency for welfare comparisons of alternative public policies or economic states.\n\nHicks's most familiar contribution in macroeconomics was the Hicks–Hansen IS–LM model,  which formalised an interpretation of the theory of John Maynard Keynes (see Keynesianism). The model describes the economy as a balance between three commodities: money, consumption and investment. Hicks himself did not embrace the theory as he interpreted it; and, in a paper published in 1980, Hicks asserted that it had omitted some crucial components of Keynes's arguments, especially those related to uncertainty.\nQuestion:\nIn 1972 John Hicks became the first Briton to win which of the Nobel Prizes?\nAnswer:\nResponse probability\nPassage:\nAstraphobia\nAstraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, or nicaduranaphobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia derives from the Greek words ἀστραπή (astrape; lightning) and φόβος (phobos; fear). \n\nSymptoms\n\nA person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, the sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, the feeling of dread, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm.  They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows.\n\nA sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. An astraphobic person will be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. In very extreme cases, astraphobia can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home.\n\nChildren\n\nA 2007 study found astraphobia the third most prevalent phobia in the US.  It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child's phobia should be addressed, for it may become a serious problem in adulthood.\n\nTo lessen a child's fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment; a fearless adult is an excellent role model for children. Sometimes children cannot be attracted to video games and activities while a thunderstorm is happening. Some children usually go to basements and other places that are quiet or places that have no windows.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also often used to treat astraphobia.  The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to himself or herself in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort.\n\nDogs and cats\n\nDogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol - a hormone associated with stress - affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and Dog Appeasing Pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers. \n\nStudies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is very rare, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm. \n\nGenerally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals. Showing fearlessness is, arguably, the best method to \"cure\" the anxiety.\nQuestion:\nTonitrophobia is the fear of which weather condition?\nAnswer:\nThundering\nPassage:\nReginald Doherty\nReginald \"Reggie\" or \"R.F.\" Frank Doherty (14 October 1872 – 29 December 1910) was a British tennis player.\n\nDoherty was a World No. 1 ranked player, and the older brother of British tennis player Laurence Doherty. He was known in the tennis world as \"R.F.\" rather than \"Reggie\".[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res\nF50F14F7385417738DDDA90B94DA415B808DF1D3  \"Famous Tennis Player Dead: R.F. Doherty, Once American Champion, Passes Away in London\"], The New York Times, 30 December 1910\n\nEarly life\n\nDoherty was born on 14 October 1872 at Beulah Villa in Wimbledon, Surrey, the oldest son of William Doherty, a printer, and his wife, Catherine Ann Davis. Doherty began tennis early in life and as a boy at Westminster School showed great promise. At age 14 he won the boys' singles title at an open championship in Llandudno. Doherty was educated at the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall), where he played for the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club.  In 1895 and 1895 he was part of the Cambridge team that beat Oxford and won the Scottish and Essex championships.\n\nCareer\n\nGrand Slams\n\nDoherty played in his first Wimbledon Championships in 1894 and lost in the first round to Clement Cazalet in four sets. In 1897 Doherty won his first singles Wimbledon title after beating reigning champion Harold Mahony in three straight sets (6–4, 6–4, 6–3). He successfully defended his title for the next three years (1898, 1899, 1900). In 1898 he did so by beating his brother in the Challenge Round in five sets (6–3, 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1). In 1901 he finally lost his Wimbledon crown when he was defeated in the Challenge Round by Arthur Gore in four sets (6–4, 5–7, 4–6, 4–6). He was also a runner-up at the US Championships in 1902 where he was beaten by the defending American champion William Larned in four sets (6–4, 2–6, 4–6, 6–8). Together with his brother Laurie he won eight Wimbledon Championships doubles titles and two US Championship doubles titles.\n\nDavis Cup\n\nDoherty represented the British Isles in the prestigious Davis Cup contest from 1902 to 1906. In 1902 he won the doubles match with his brother but lost the final and decisive singles match against American Malcolm Whitman in straight sets (1–6, 5–7, 4–6). In 1903 he contributed significantly to his team's first Davis Cup title against the United States by winning the doubles match and the decisive singles match against Robert Wrenn. Doherty won the Davis Cup trophy a further three times (1904, 1905, 1906) although in these years he only competed, and won, in the doubles matches. \n\nOlympics\n\nDoherty won the doubles title (gold medals were not given at the 1900 Games) at the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris with his brother.  He also competed in the singles tournament and reached the semifinal, where he was scheduled to play against his brother. Reggie withdrew, since the brothers refused to play each other before the final.  He also won the mixed doubles title with five-time Wimbledon champion Charlotte Cooper. Doherty did not compete in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis. In the 1908 Olympics in London Reggie again won the doubles title, this time with compatriot George Hillyard. \n\nR.F. Doherty was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980 together with his brother. \n\nDeath\n\nDoherty died of heart failure and neurasthenia on 29 December 1910 at the age of only 38 at his home in Kensington a day after returning from a convalescence stay in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. \n\nAccording to his obituary in The New York Times, Doherty had \"been ill health for some time\". The article further stated, he \"held at various times every important championship the world of tennis has for a man to win. He was not beaten until he began to fail in health\". Both brothers apparently suffered from respiratory problems throughout their lives. \n\nR.F. and his brother had been urged to take up lawn tennis by their father, reportedly for health reasons.\n\nGrand Slam finals \n\nSingles: 6 (4 titles, 2 runners-up)\n\nDoubles: 13 (10 titles, 3 runners-up)\nQuestion:\nReginald Doherty, Arthur Gore and Fred Perry are associated with which sport?\nAnswer:\nLawn tennis\nPassage:\nHappy Hour (The Housemartins song)\n\"Happy Hour\" is a 1986 single by British Indie rock band The Housemartins.  It was the third single from the album London 0 Hull 4 and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart.   It was written on Wednesday 22 January 1986 - the same day Me and the Farmer was penned.  \n\nThe band's first big hit, it stayed on the singles chart for 13 weeks, peaking in the week of 28 June 1986.   The song also enjoyed exposure on United States college radio.  \n\nRolling Stone noted that despite \"irrepressibly giddy music hooks\", the song's \"sobering\" lyrics \"hammer away at the hypocrisy and sexism of young British business types on the move.\"  \n\nOn their 1992 album, Gordon, the Barenaked Ladies paid tribute to this song by breaking into it at the end of the song \"Hello City\". \n\nComedian Phill Jupitus makes an appearance in the music video, reading a newspaper.\n\nCharts\nQuestion:\nWhich Hull group had a Top Five single in 1986 with 'Happy Hour’?\nAnswer:\nHousemartins\nPassage:\nScientific law\nA scientific law is a statement based on repeated experimental observations that describes some aspects of the universe. A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. Factual and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the philosophy of science, going back to David Hume, is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to constant conjunction. \n\nLaws differ from scientific theories in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. Ohm's law only applies to linear networks, Newton's law of universal gravitation only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of aerodynamics such as Bernoulli's principle do not apply in case of compressible flow such as occurs in transonic and supersonic flight, Hooke's law only applies to strain below the elastic limit, etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take mathematical forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the Law of Conservation of Energy can be written as \\Delta E 0, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the First Law of Thermodynamics can be written as \\mathrm{d}U\n\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,.\n\nThe term \"scientific law\" is traditionally associated with the natural sciences, though the social sciences also contain laws.Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg (1993), \"[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]\", Nature, 365:6445 (30), page 385. An example of a scientific law in social sciences is Zipf's law.\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be falsified if they are found in contradiction with new data.\nQuestion:\nWhich scientific law can be expressed in the form V = IR*?

But the past few years, I've read several articles that refer to a \"new\" taste called \"umami.\" In the articles I've read, it's never very clearly described, and I'm not even sure if researchers agree that it counts as a separate taste category. Any chance you could give us the straight dope on this flavor?\n— Janet Zimmerman, San Francisco, CA\nAh, taste . . . right up there with sight, as far as I'm concerned. Whether it's Fruit Loops or General Tso's Chicken, I'm happy to tackle any questions about food. After all, all the taste I've got is in my mouth, or so I've been told.\nIn any case, yes, indeed, there is a fifth taste known as \"umami\" (that's \"oo-MOM-mee,\" and I shudder to think of when the term might be uttered when the speaker is not referring to taste). This is the term that's been given to the taste associated with monosodium glutamate, or MSG.\nMonosodium glutamate is the salt form of glutamic acid, a non-essential amino acid. It's found naturally in many if not most edibles. The flavor, though, is apparently substantially different than just plain salt, and has been described as \"meaty.\" The taste bud receptor for this taste was discovered in 1996, although the Japanese have supposedly been aware of it as a separate taste since around the turn of the century.\nWhile MSG occurs naturally in all kinds of foods, it is also added to many others. Most processed foods have some MSG added, since it's been known as a \"flavor-enhancer\" for decades. There are several methods for adding MSG to processed foods: sometimes it's added directly; sometimes it's added by processing other substances in a way which concentrates the MSG (hydrolyzed vegetable protein and autolyzed yeast extract are examples). In any case, if you eat any processed foods at all, chances are you're getting more MSG than you'd be getting if everything you ate came out of your own garden.\nThis is not seen as a good thing by many. On November 4th, 1991, CBS ran a \"60 Minutes\" segment on people who are supposedly \"sensitive\" to MSG. These people blame MSG sensitivity for everything from slight headaches to migraines to nausea and diarrhea to death. The number of people who are sensitive varies greatly, depending on who you listen to: in the \"60 Minutes\" story, Michael Taylor, Deputy of Policy for the FDA, stated that possibly 2% of the U.S. population is MSG reactive, about 5,000,000; a chart called \"Major Causes of Restaurant Syndrome\" in the Jan-Feb 1987 NER Allergy Proc. Book, Vol 8, No 1, estimates that 15 to 20% of our population is sensitive, about 50,000,000; Dr. George Schwartz, M.D., author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Symptom Complex, believes the numbers are much higher, perhaps 40% to 50%.\nNaturally, the processed food industry scoffs, citing the fact that MSG occurs naturally, even in the human body. On the other hand, \"natural\" substances cause various allergies and sensitivities in millions of people daily, so it seems plausible to me that increased amounts of a \"naturally-occurring substance\" could, indeed, set off someone's internal red alert. Fortunately for me, I don't suffer any of the symptoms normally associated with MSG sensitivity, so my Doritos are safe. For more information on MSG senstivities put out by the people who supposedly suffer from them, see www.nomsg.com (this is most definitely an anti-MSG website, so please take everything you read with a grain of sodium, mono-glutamated or not; I don't offer this site as the definitive word on MSG sensitivities, simply as a place to read one side of the argument).\nSo, Janet, the next time you have some of General Tso's Chicken and think to yourself, \"mmmm, meaty,\" take pride in knowing that your umami-receptors are functioning admirably. And make sure you've got your Excedrin with you, just in case.\n— Veg\nStaff Reports are written by the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board, Cecil's online auxiliary.

It stars Robin Williams, Daryl Sabara, and Alexie Gilmore. The film was released on July 24, 2009 on video on demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21, 2009.\n\nPlot\n\nLance Clayton (Williams) is a single father and high school English teacher. He dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son, Kyle (Sabara), is a pornography-obsessed underachiever who despises everyone, especially his father.  Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his alcoholic mother. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal (Geoff Pierson), who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire (Gilmore), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike (Henry Simmons), whose writing class is more successful than Lance's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie (Mitzi McCall).\n\nOne night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom. To avoid embarrassing his son, he stages Kyle’s death as a suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle’s computer and hangs his son’s body in the closet. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.\n\nEnjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a post-mortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew finds Kyle’s suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle’s honor. \n\nAt the library dedication, Lance finds that he can no longer live with his lie and confesses before the school. Lance is denounced by the students and faculty, including Claire. Lance nevertheless feels reborn, and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Andrew tells Lance he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed Lance's writing. The two of them happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.\n\nCast\n\n* Robin Williams as Lance Clayton\n* Alexie Gilmore as Claire Reed\n* Daryl Sabara as Kyle Clayton\n* Evan Martin as Andrew\n* Geoff Pierson as Principal Wyatt Anderson\n* Henry Simmons as Mike Lane\n* Mitzi McCall as Bonnie\n* Jermaine Williams as Jason\n* Lorraine Nicholson as Heather\n* Morgan Murphy as Morgan\n* Toby Huss as Bert Green\n* Tom Kenny as Jerry Klein (talk show producer)\n* Jill Talley as Make-Up Woman\n* Bruce Hornsby as himself\n* Krist Novoselic as Newspaper Vendor (cameo)\n* Bobcat Goldthwait as the limo driver (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot in Seattle, Washington, largely at the former F.A. McDonald School in Wallingford.  Seattle resident and former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic has a wordless cameo while consoling Williams' character at a newspaper stand (Goldthwait had previously opened for Nirvana). Bruce Hornsby appears as himself at the library dedication.\n\nHome video\n\nThe DVD was released on December 8, 2009 and featured an audio commentary track with the director, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a making of featurette.\n\nReception\n\nWorld's Greatest Dad received critical acclaim, holding an 89% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10, with the critical consensus: \"World's Greatest Dad is a risky, deadpan, dark comedy that effectively explores the nature of posthumous cults of celebrity.\"  The film also holds a score of 69 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" \n\nThe film was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, the website hailing it as a \"lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy.\" It also commented on Robin Williams' performance as outstanding. Sandra L. Frey observed the film's portrayal of teen angst, and said that the film also reminds the audience that adults can offer strong angst of their own.  Devin Faraci called the film \"brilliant\" and \"genius.\" Paul Fischer named it as one of the best films of the year.  Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz both gave the film favorable reviews on At The Movies. Mankiewicz saluted Daryl Sabara's performance as exceptionally well done, commented on the film's \"remarkably funny script,\" and overall considered it a \"little gem.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave World's Greatest Dad 3 out of 4 stars, but noticed that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director's intention.\nQuestion:\nWhich actor said, in the film ‘World’s Greatest Dad’, ‘I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone.   It’s not.  The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone’?\nAnswer:\nRobin Willaims\nPassage:\nCarat (mass)\nThe carat (ct) is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg (0.2 g; 0.007055 oz) and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls.\nThe current definition, sometimes known as the metric carat, was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures,  and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.  The carat is divisible into one hundred points of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.\n\nIn terms of diamonds, a paragon is a flawless stone of at least 100 carats (20 g).\n\nThe ANSI X.12 EDI standard abbreviation for the carat is CD. \n\nEtymology\n\nFirst attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word carat came from Italian carato, which came from Greek kerátion (κεράτιον) meaning carob seed (literally \"small horn\") and potentially from  Arabic qīrāṭ (قيراط).  \n(diminutive of - keras, \"horn\" )\nand was a unit of weight \nthough it was not likely used to measure gold in classical times.\nThe Latin word for carat is siliqua.\nThis common belief that carat derives from carob seeds stems from the assumption that the seeds had unusually low variability in mass.\n\nHowever, one group of researchers has found that carob seeds in fact have typical variability compared to the seeds of other species. \n\nThis was not the only reason. It is said that, to keep regional buyers and sellers of gold honest, potential customers could retrieve their own carob seeds on their way to the market, to check the tolerances of the seeds used by the merchant. If this precaution was not taken, the potential customers would be at the mercy of \"2 sets of carob seeds\". One set of \"heavier\" carob seeds would be used when buying from a customer (making the seller's gold appear to be less). Another, lighter set of carob seeds would be used when the merchant wanted to sell to a customer.\n\nIn the past, each country had its own carat. It was often used for weighing gold. Starting in the 1570s, it was used to measure weights of diamonds.\n\nHistorical definitions\n\nUK Board of Trade \n\nIn the United Kingdom the original Board of Trade carat was exactly  grains (~3.170 gr);  in 1888, the Board of Trade carat was changed to exactly  grains (~3.168 gr).  Despite its being a non-metric unit, a number of metric countries have used this unit for its limited range of application.\n\nThe Board of Trade carat was divisible into four diamond grains,  but measurements were typically made in multiples of  carat.\n\nRefiners' carats \n\nThere were also two varieties of refiners' carats once used in the United Kingdom — the pound carat and the ounce carat.  The pound troy was divisible into 24 pound carats of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four pound grains of 60 grains troy each; and the pound grain was divisible into four pound quarters of 15 grains troy each. Likewise, the ounce troy was divisible into 24 ounce carats of 20 grains troy each; the ounce carat was divisible into four ounce grains of 5 grains troy each; and the ounce grain was divisible into four ounce quarters of  grains troy each. \n\nGreco-Roman \n\nThe solidus was also a Roman weight unit. There is literary evidence that the weight of 72 coins of the type called solidus was exactly 1 Roman pound, and that the weight of 1 solidus was 24 siliquae. The weight of a Roman pound is generally believed to have been 327.45 g or possibly up to 5 g less. Therefore, the metric equivalent of 1 siliqua was approximately 189 mg. The Greeks had a similar unit of the same value. \n\nGold fineness in carats comes from carats and grains of gold in a solidus of coin. One solidus 24 carats, 1 carat \n 4 grains, is preserved right up to this day. Woolhouse's Measures, Weights and Moneys of all Nations  gives gold fineness in carats of 4 grains, and silver in (pound) of 12 ounces each 20 dwt.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nHow many carats are there in pure gold?\nAnswer:\n24\n", "answers": ["Savory taste", "Umame", "Savouriness", "Xian wei", "Savour", "Umami taste", "Umani", "Savoryness", "Osmazome", "Umami", "Malinamnam", "Meaty taste", "Linamnam", "Gamchilmat"], "length": 2424, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e7926c10fef2c78fa1c333f97c4a0d4f35d3fd619cbcdb45"}

Instead, it concerns the future of the programme itself.\nJulian Fellowes, the creator of Downton, has suggested that the next series of the ITV1 drama may be its last.\nIn an interview, the screenwriter admitted there was no way he could continue to write the show’s storylines at the same time as working on his next major project – to create what has been described as an American version of the series.\nThe Gilded Age, to be set in New York in the late 19th century, has been commissioned by the US network, NBC Universal, but its production is being held up by Fellowes’s continuing commitment to Downton, which is due to return for a fifth series later this year.\nFellowes, however, who was elevated to the peerage in 2011, has now indicated that this series could be the last.\nRelated Articles\nDownton Abbey, Christmas special, review: sweet but uneventful\n25 Dec 2013\nHe dropped his bombshell during an interview in the US, last week. Asked about The Gilded Age, he said: “It will happen when Downton finishes, because I just couldn’t do both at once.”\nWhen pressed on whether this meant there would still be a fifth series of Downton, he added: “Yes. I don’t know yet if there is a season six, but it’s not going to go on forever. It won’t be Perry Mason.”\nFellowes has combined his Downton duties with writing a second period drama in the past.\nHowever, the resulting series, Titanic, in 2012, was received with markedly less favour than the ongoing saga of the Crawley family.\nNews of Downton Abbey’s possible demise will alarm fans of the show, as well as managers at ITV, where it has been one of the channel’s biggest successes of recent years, coping with the loss of some of its leading characters as actors have departed, among them Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, and Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil.\nThe most recent series, which ended in the autumn, had average viewing figures of 11.8 million, and the Christmas Day special was watched by about seven million. Since its beginning in 2010, the show has been sold in more than 220 territories worldwide and has been a notable success in the US, becoming the highest-rated drama series in the history of its broadcaster, PBS.\nIts popularity there has led to heightened interest in The Gilded Age project, and it emerged last February that Fellowes had signed up to write and produce the drama.\nThe new series takes its name from the period of US history from the 1870s to the turn of the 20th century, an era of great social and technological change, as well as rapid economic growth, especially in the north and west of the country.\nThe term was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in an 1873 novel they wrote to satirise what they saw as the greed and corruption of the time. Fellowes’s project will explore the rise of newly rich families who emerged during the period – some of whom became known as “robber barons” – and replaced the older, established aristocracy.\nAs with the British series, the main characters will be fictional. It had been suggested that Fellowes could hand over the main Downton Abbey writing responsibilities to others, to allow him to concentrate on US show.\nBut his latest comments, in The Wall Street Journal, have made clear he does not see that as an option.\nFellowes writes the scripts for Downton alone, although he said in the US interview that he bounces ideas off his wife. “She gets to read [the scripts] first. It only goes off to my agent after it’s been through her,” he said.\nThe last series caused controversy over a storyline in which Anna, the housemaid played by Joanna Froggatt, was raped by a guest’s valet. ITV received 200 complaints after the episode on Oct 6, while Ofcom, the media watchdog, received 250.\nOfcom decided not to pursue the complaints “after careful assessment … because they did not raise issues warranting investigation”.\nQuestion:\nWho writes the scripts for the TV series Downton Abbey?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nPraise and Thanksgiving - Sheet Music Plus\nPraise And Thanksgiving\nPraise and Thanksgiving\nDetailed Description\nOrgan\nSeven Majestic Hymn Settings for Organ.

What a tool!\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhat is a “Scotch Bonnet”?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nSwansea Bay\nSwansea Bay () is a bay on the Bristol Channel on the southern coast of Wales. Places on the bay include Swansea and Port Talbot. The River Neath, River Tawe, River Afan, River Kenfig and Clyne River flow into the bay.\n\nSwansea Bay (and upper reaches of the Bristol Channel) experience a large tidal range (Springs max 10m).  The shipping ports in Swansea Bay are Swansea Docks, Port Talbot Docks and Briton Ferry wharfs.\n\nHistory \n\nOyster fishing was once an important industry in Swansea Bay, employing 600 people at its height in the 1860s. However, overfishing, disease and pollution had all but wiped out the oyster population by 1920. In 2005 plans were announced to reintroduce the Oyster farming industry.  \n\nBeaches\n\nThe bay is lined with sandy beaches. Each stretch of beach within the bay has its own individual name:\n*Aberavon Beach\n*Baglan Bay\n*Jersey Marine Beach\n*Swansea Beach\n*Mumbles Beach\n\nPollution\n\nFor the last two decades of the 20th century, the bay was blighted by pollution, partly from the surrounding heavy industry and partly from sewerage outlets being sited at inappropriate locations including the main one that was located just seaward of Mumbles Lighthouse. A pumping station inside the cliff adjacent to Knab Rock brought all of Swansea city's effluent in a raw form to this point. Adding to the problem was the natural current flow of the waters in the Bay which often did not move the polluted waters further out to sea. Ironically, the outgoing tide did not carry the raw sewage down the adjacent Bristol Channel, but instead cause it to be sucked in around the circumference of the Bay and only then out down the Channel. If not fully discharged on that tide, the incoming tide would then push the same effluent up the Channel, and once again circulate around the Bay. Efforts were made by the local authority to reduce the pollution in the Bay but care had to be taken to ensure the pollution did not move to the popular beach resorts in south Gower instead.\n\nThis original sewer outlet was finally made inactive in around 1996 following the construction of a brand new pipeline which ran all the way back around the Bay following the line of the old Mumbles Railway as far as Beach Street, along the sea-side of the Maritime Quarter and through Swansea Docks to a new £90 million sewage treatment plant at Crymlyn Burrows near Port Tennant from which a new outlet was made, extending further out to sea. As a consequence of the huge improvement these works have made, it is hoped that Swansea Bay will achieve Blue Flag Beach status.  Aberavon beach was awarded Blue Flag status in December 2007. \n\nPower generation\n\nFossil\n\nThere is one existing GE built gas-fired power station located just inland at Baglan Bay.  A second gas fired power station, the \"Abernedd Power Station\" has been approved for construction. \n\nBiomass plans\n\nA new biomass power station has been approved for construction near the coast at Port Talbot. \n\nTidal plans\n\nSwansea Bay (along with the rest of the Bristol Channel) has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. This offers a potential for electricity generation using tidal lagoons.  A proposal has been put forward by Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Ltd. for a tidal lagoon to be constructed.   The tidal lagoon would be sited just south of the Queen's Dock between River Tawe and River Neath estuaries.  This project is controversial, partly due to the amount of subsidy required to make the project viable and also because of the potential damage to an AONB and MCZ in Cornwall where Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay seek to re-open a disused quarry at Dean Point from which to source the rock for the lagoon.    \n\nWind plans\n\nIn addition to tidal power, construction of an offshore windfarm in the Bay has been approved,  but construction has now been deferred owing to the costs involved. The windfarm was to have been sited at Scarweather Sands, about 3 mi off the coast and visible from Porthcawl.\nQuestion:\nWhich geographical feature separates Swansea Bay from Carmarthen Bay?\nAnswer:\nGwyr\nPassage:\nCap de Formentor\nCap de Formentor forms the eastern end of Majorca's Formentor peninsula. The Majorcans also call the cape the Meeting point of the winds.\n\nLocation\n\nCap de Formentor is a spectacular place, located on the northernmost point of the Balaeric Island Majorca in Spain. Its highest point, Fumart, is  384m above sea level. It has many associated bays, including Cala Fiquera, Cala Murta and Cala Pi de la Posada. \nThe 13.5 km road which runs from Port de Pollença to Cap de Formentor was built by the Italian engineer Antonio Parietti. He also constructed the snake road to Sa Calobra. Instead of being overwhelmed by what stood in his way on the cliffs, Parretti observed the Tramuntana winds and understood: where the slope was too steep, he made a curve. When he had to remove part of the cliffs, he placed the waste in other places where it was needed. The result was the two roads, which are nestled together in the mountains.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1863 the Formentor Lighthouse was opened, the remote and rugged location on the Cap de Formentor making construction difficult. The only access being from the sea or via a long mule track. \n\nWhen the poet Miquel i Llobera, who owned the Cap de Formentor peninsula, died, it was divided into lots and sold. In 1928 Adan Diehl, an Argentinian native and art lover, decided to build the Hotel Formentor.\n\nAttractions\n\nThe headland has quite a few lookout points with spectacular views. The most well-known is Mirador del Mal Pas, also named Mirador d'es Colomer after the small island Colomer, the view from which can be seen in the picture above. The panorama from Majorca's Finisterre illuminates Menorca in the east, Cala Fiquera in the west, and Alcudia with its sandy beach in the south. However, the view of the cliffs below is not for sufferers of vertigo as sea roars 300m below and the winds on the headland can be vicious.\n\nA German radio operator and pilot built a private weather station here in 1996, which transmits encoded radio transmissions to the base station 56 km away (via a beam radio). Data is then sent all over the world wirelessly. The analyses are used by hotels, organizers, sailing clubs, flying clubs, and others. They are freely available to anyone who has the necessary receiving equipment. The official weather department is located in Porto Pi, on the Palma de Mallorca harbour. It is responsible for international ships, air travel and other sites.\n\nIn the southeastern part by Racó de Xot there is a cave with an opening into the sea. It has two entrances located about 8m over the surface of the water. The cave has a length of 90 m and a height of 8 m and is one of the most important sources of information for the prehistoric talaiot culture.\n\nImage:Old_Donkeypath_from_Faro_Formentor.JPG|Old & New: An ancient donkeypath and the modern road\nImage:Cala_de_Pollenca_from_Faro_Formentor.JPG|The bays of Alcúdia and Pollença as seen from the lighthouse\nImage:Punta_de_la_Noa.JPG|Punta de la Nao and road to the cape\nImage:Talayot_de_Almallutx.JPG|The old watchtower as seen from Punta de la Nao\nFile:Cap Formentor (Mallorca) (18039145392).jpg|A Road to Cap Formentor\nQuestion:\n'Cap de Formentor' is the northernmost point of which popular holiday island?\nAnswer:\nMajorca\nPassage:\nMasashi Ozaki\nis a Japanese professional golfer. Ozaki is often known as Jumbo Ozaki (ジャンボ尾崎 Janbo Ozaki) on account of his height and length off the tee. He featured in the top ten of the Official World Golf Rankings for almost 200 weeks between 1989 and 1998.  He is the most successful player of all time on the Japan Golf Tour, having led the money list a record 12 times and won 94 tournaments, more than 40 more than the second highest tally. Ozaki was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2010 and was inducted in May 2011. \n\nBiography\n\nOzaki was born in Kaifu District, Tokushima. He was a professional baseball pitcher/outfielder from 1965 to 1967 with the Nishitetsu Lions,     but he turned to professional golf at the age of 23 and won the Japan PGA Championship the following year.\n\nOzaki led the Japan Golf Tour in earnings in 1973–74, 1977, 1988–90, 1992, and 1994–98.  Ozaki finished 8th at The Masters in 1973 and finished 6th at the U.S. Open in 1989. He competed at the Masters 19 times. He played occasionally on the PGA Tour from 1972 to 2000, in 96 tournaments, though never more than seven in one year. His best finish was a T-4 at the 1993 Memorial Tournament. Ozaki played on the International Team in the 1996 Presidents Cup. Ozaki built \"AON Age\" with his rivals Isao Aoki and Tsuneyuki \"Tommy\" Nakajima.  Ozaki's brothers Tateo \"Jet\" and Naomichi \"Joe\" are also professional golfers. Now in his sixties, he still plays regularly on the Japan Golf Tour.\n\nProfessional wins\n\nJapan Golf Tour wins (94)\n\n*1973 (5) Tohoku Classic, Kanto Pro Championship, ANA Sapporo Open, Tokai Classic, Taiheiyo Club Masters\n*1974 (6) Tohoku Classic, Japan PGA Championship, Suntory Open, ANA Sapporo Open, Japan Open Golf Championship, Nippon Series\n*1975 (1) Tohoku Classic\n*1976 (3) Kanto Open, Hiroshima Open, Sanpo Classic\n*1977 (4) Pepsi-Wilson Tournament, Kanto Open, Tokai Classic, Nippon Series\n*1978 (2) Pepsi-Wilson Tournament, Hiroshima Open\n*1980 (3) Dunlop International Open, Fujisankei Classic, Nippon Series\n*1982 (1) Kanto Open\n*1983 (1) Jun Classic\n*1984 (1) Hiroshima Open\n*1986 (4) Fujisankei Classic, Nikkei Cup, Maruman Open, Jun Classic\n*1987 (3) The Crowns, Fujisankei Classic, Jun Classic\n*1988 (6) Dunlop Open, Nikkei Cup, Maruman Open, Japan Open Golf Championship, Golf Digest Tournament, Bridgestone Open\n*1989 (7) Fujisankei Classic, Japan PGA Championship, Sendai Classic, Yonex Open Hiroshima, Japan PGA Match-Play Championship Unisys Cup, ANA Open, Japan Open Golf Championship\n*1990 (4) Fujisankei Classic, Yonex Open Hiroshima, Maruman Open, Daiwa KBC Augusta\n*1991 (2) Japan PGA Championship, Jun Classic\n*1992 (6) Dunlop Open, The Crowns, PGA Philanthropy Tournament, ANA Open, Japan Open Golf Championship, Taiheiyo Masters\n*1993 (3) Fujisankei Classic, Japan PGA Championship, Golf Digest Tournament\n*1994 (7) Dunlop Open, Yonex Open Hiroshima, ANA Open, Japan Open Golf Championship, Daiwa International, Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters, Phoenix Tournament\n*1995 (5) The Crowns, Yonex Open Hiroshima, ANA Open, Dunlop Phoenix Tournament, Golf Nippon Series Hitachi Cup\n*1996 (8) The Crowns, Japan PGA Championship, Mitsubishi Galant Tournament, JCB Classic Sendai, Hisamitsu-KBC Augusta, Gene Sarazen Jun Classic, Dunlop Phoenix Tournament, Golf Nippon Series Hitachi Cup\n*1997 (5) Token Corporation Cup, The Crowns, Mitsubishi Galant Tournament, Hisamitsu-KBC Augusta, Bridgestone Open\n*1998 (3) Yonex Open Hiroshima, Hisamitsu-KBC Augusta, Philip Morris Championship\n*1999 (2) Token Corporation Cup, Yonex Open Hiroshima\n*2000 (1) Sun Chlorella Classic\n*2002 (1) ANA Open\n\nInternational wins (1)\n\n*1972 New Zealand PGA Championship\n\nOther wins (18)\n\n*1971 (5) Japan PGA Championship, Nippon Series, Golf Digest Tournament, Miki Gold Cup (tie with Billy Casper), Setouchi Series Hiroshima leg\n*1972 (9) Wizard, Sapporo Open, Kanto Open, All Nippon Doubles, Nippon Series, Grand Monaco, First Flight, Chiba Open, Asahi International\n*1976 (1) Chiba Open\n*1984 (1) Kanagawa Open\n*1985 (1) Kanagawa Open\n*1992 (1) Sanko Grand Summer Tournament\n\nResults in major championships\n\nDNP = did not play\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nTeam appearances\n\nThis list may be incomplete.\n*World Cup (representing Japan): 1974, 1988\n*Four Tours World Championship: (representing Japan) 1986 (winners), 1987, 1989\n*Presidents Cup (International team): 1996\nQuestion:\nWhat is Japanese golfer Masashi Ozaki's nickname?\nAnswer:\nJumbo\nPassage:\nCastoreum\nCastoreum is the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) and the European Beaver (Castor fiber). \n\nCastoreum is the yellowish secretion of the castor sac. Beavers use castoreum in combination with urine to scent mark territory.   Both beaver sexes have a pair of castor sacs and a pair of anal glands, located in two cavities under the skin between the pelvis and the base of the tail.  The castor sacs are not true glands (endocrine or exocrine) on a cellular level, hence references to these structures as preputial glands or castor glands are misnomers.  Castor sacs are a type of scent gland.\n\nIt is used as a tincture in some perfumes  and as a food additive.\n\nTrapping \n\nToday, the government of Ontario pays trappers to harvest beaver castor sacs. The sacs can bring around 10–40 dollars a pound when sold to the Northern Ontario Fur Trappers Association.\n\nUses \n\nPerfume \n\nIn perfume-making, the term castoreum is more liberally applied to denote the resinoid extract resulting from the dried and alcohol tinctured beaver castor.  The dried beaver castor sacs are generally aged for two or more years to mellow and for their raw harshness to dissipate.\n\nIn perfumery, castoreum has largely been used as an animalic note suggesting leather, compounded with other ingredients including top, middle, and base notes as a composition. Some classic perfumes incorporating castor are Emeraude, Chanel Antaeus, Cuir de Russie, Magie Noire, Lancôme Caractère, Hechter Madame, Givenchy III, Shalimar, and many \"leather\" themed compositions.\n\n\"New-car sprays\" are available that purportedly reproduce the smell of a new car in older vehicles using an aerosol spray. The probable origin of this fragrance concept was before the use of plastics and related chemicals, being simply a leather scent (based on castoreum and birch tar oil) to mimic the smell of expensive leather upholstery.\n\nMedicinal use \n\nNo pharmaceutical authorities in the Western world recommend castoreum for any medical condition. It was still in the materia medica in the 18th century as a treatment for many ailments—including headache, fever, and hysteria.  The Romans believed the fumes produced by burning castoreum could induce an abortion. Paracelsus thought it could be used in the treatment of epilepsy.  Castoreum was also used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Castoreum was described in the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical conditions (i.e., pertaining to the womb), for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. \n\nIt is one of the 65 ingredients of mithridate, a semi-mythical remedy used as an antidote for poisoning. It is also an ingredient of theriac, a medical concoction originally formulated by the Greeks in the 1st century AD as an alexipharmic, or antidote, considered a universal panacea.\n\nFood use \n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration lists castoreum extract as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive. In 1965,  the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association's GRAS program (FEMA 2261 and 2262) added castoreum extract and castoreum liquid.  Product ingredient lists often refer to it simply as a \"natural flavoring.\" While it is mainly used in foods and beverages as part of a substitute vanilla flavor,  it is less commonly used as a part of a raspberry or strawberry flavoring.  The annual industry consumption is very low, around 300 pounds,  whereas vanillin is over 2.6 million pounds annually. \n\nCastoreum has been traditionally used in Sweden for flavoring schnapps commonly referred to as \"Bäverhojt\" (literally, beaver shout). \n\nOther uses \n\nCastoreum is also used to contribute to the flavor and odor of cigarettes. \n\nMedieval beekeepers used it to increase honey production.The Beaver: Its Life and Impact. Dietland Muller-Schwarze, 2003, page 43 ([http://books.google.fr/books?id\nHZ5WjXB5Pr8C&lpgPA39&ots\nWYwTmWi-yJ&dqCastoreum%20beekeeping&lr&hl\nfr&pgPA43#v\nonepage&qCastoreum%20beekeeping&f\nfalse book at Google Books])\n\nChemical composition \n\nAt least 24 compounds are known constituents of beaver castoreum. Some of these have pheromonal activity. These are the phenols 4-ethylphenol and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol) and the ketones acetophenone and 3-hydroxyacetophenone. Five additional compounds noted are 4-methyl-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (4-methylcatechol), 4-methoxyacetophenone, 5-methoxysalicylic acid, salicylaldehyde, and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid.  Other neutral compounds are oxygen-containing monoterpenes such as 6-methyl-l-heptanol, 4,6-dimethyl-l-heptanol, isopinocamphone, pinocamphone, two linalool oxides and their acetates.  Other compounds are: benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, borneol, o-cresol, 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, hydroquinone, phenol. All those compounds are gathered from plant food. It also contains nupharamine alkaloids  and castoramine,  and cis-cyclohexane-1,2-diol. \n\nRelated animal products \n\n* Taxea, a secretion of the badger's subcaudal glands comparable in its medicinal use to the better-known castoreum\n* Hyraceum, the petrified and rock-like excrement composed of urine and feces excreted by the Cape Hyrax (Procavia capensis), and a sought-after material that has been used in traditional South African medicine and perfumery\nQuestion:\nCastor (or castoreum) is an oily substance secreted by which animal, and historically used in medicine and perfume?\nAnswer:\nBeaverdams\nPassage:\nWhat does Stamina mean? - Definitions.net\nWhat does Stamina mean?\nDefinitions for Staminaˈstæm ə nə\nThis page provides all possible meanings and translations of the word Stamina\nPrinceton's WordNet(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition:\nstamina, staying power, toughness(noun)\nGCIDE(4.00 / 1 vote)Rate this definition:\nStamina(n. pl.)\nHence: The power of endurance; the ability to withstand fatigue, disease, deprivation, etc., and continue working.\nWiktionary(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition:\nstamina(Noun)\nThe energy and strength for continuing to do something over a long period of time; power of sustained exertion, or resistance to hardship, illness etc.\nstamina(Noun)\nThe basic elements of a thing; rudimentary structures or qualities.\nOrigin: From stamina, plural of stamen.\nWebster Dictionary(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition:\nStamina\nsee Stamen\nStamina\nthe fixed, firm part of a body, which supports it or gives it strength and solidity; as, the bones are the stamina of animal bodies; the ligneous parts of trees are the stamina which constitute their strength\nStamina\nwhatever constitutes the principal strength or support of anything; power of endurance; backbone; vigor; as, the stamina of a constitution or of life; the stamina of a State\nThe numerical value of Stamina in Chaldean Numerology is: 1\nPythagorean Numerology\nQuestion:\nWhat word means the energy and strength for continuing to do something over a long period of time?\nAnswer:\nStamina\nPassage:\nHaptic perception\nHaptic perception ( \"palpable\", haptikόs \"suitable for touch\") literally denominates \"to grasp something\". Perception in this case is achieved through active exploration of surfaces and objects by a moving subject as opposed to passive contact of a static subject during tactile perception.  The term Haptik was coined by the German Psychologist Max Dessoir who suggested in 1892 to name the academic research about the sense of touch in the style of \"acoustics\" and \"optics\".  \n\nGibson (1966)  defined the haptic system as \"The sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body\". Gibson and others further emphasized what Weber had realized in 1851 – the close link between haptic perception and body movement: haptic perception is active exploration.\n\nThe concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of extended physiological proprioception according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.\n\nHaptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.  This research allows the creation of \"virtual\", illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities  which has clear application in haptic technology. \n\nExploratory procedures \n\nPeople can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.   They do so through the use of exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand. \n\nThe following exploratory procedures have been identified so far:\n#lateral motion\n#pressure\n#enclosure\n#contour following\nThus gathered object or subject properties are: size, weight, contour, surface and material characteristics, consistency and temperature.\n\nImpairments of haptic sensitivity \n\nHaptic sensitivity can be impaired by a multitude of diseases and disorders. Predominantly are skin injuries (insicions, burns etc.) and nerve lesions (through injury or impaired circulation). Additionally, loss of sensitivity (neuropathy) may be caused by metabolic, toxic and/or immunologic factors. Exemplary medical conditions that can cause neuropathies are: diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction (hyper- and hypothyroidism) as well as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and alcohol dependency.\n\nLoss of the sense of touch is a catastrophic deficit that can impair walking and other skilled actions such as holding objects or using tools.\nQuestion:\nThe word ‘haptic’ relates to which of the five senses?\nAnswer:\nTouches\nPassage:\nVictor Vroom\nVictor Harold Vroom (August 9, 1932,  Montreal, Canada) is a business school professor at the Yale School of Management.

He first said this in a theatre in Coventry. Fifty years later, deciding he needed a rest from the business (he planned a cruise around the world with his wife), he again said it in a Coventry theatre, for the last time.\n\nEarly life \n\nBorn Albert Arthur Powell in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England in 1900, he attended White's school in Masbrough where he helped his mother (stage name of Lily le Maine) to put on a marionette show. At age nine, she put him in a velvet suit with a lace collar and he went on stage and sang. After he left school he became a music hall entertainer, often wearing a kilt in the guise of a Scottish comedian. During this part of his career he was associated with the singer Gracie Fields, and released several records where he collaborated with her.\n\nStage and recording \n\nHe made a total of eighty five 78rpm records between 1929 and 1942,  mostly double-sided sketches with him in various occupations. He sold seven and a half million records, earning a penny a side, so over £60,000. The first, The Lost Policeman on the cheap Broadcast label, sold almost half a million copies (he had turned down a flat fee of £60 for this), and his subsequent recordings for Broadcast and Rex were extremely popular. He said in a 1982 interview  that he used his stage work to advertise the records, rather than the other way about, though it was later said of him that his records introduced him so wherever he went to put on a show, they already knew him..\n\nSandy had a stooge in his act during the 1930s, the boy soprano, Jimmy Fletcher, father of the actor Gerard Fletcher, of Emmerdale, Coronation Street and other TV. From 1930 he took his own revue, Sandy Powell's Road Show, on tour – it ran for ten years and was extremely popular despite having only a handful of performers and two backdrops.\n\nRadio and film \n\nIn the 1930s he began to work on the radio, always introducing his show with catchphrase Can You Hear Me, Mother? Powell said that the catchphrase originated on an occasion when he had dropped his script and was killing time at the microphone while rearranging the pages. It is also attributed to his mother's coercion and her hardness of hearing, during his early career. At his next booking, the theatre manager asked him to say it again as everyone was saying it now. He also appeared in a number of films during the 1930s, usually as himself. In 1939 he was voted the fifth most popular British star at the local box office. \n\nA popular figure, he worked continually on radio, television and pantomime through the 1940s and 1950s. Aged 21 at the time, Pat Phoenix was brought in to play Sandy's wife and played four parts in the film. After that he want onto a variety tour and she came with him as his wife, earning £12 a week. He performed with his Starlight company in the Eastbourne Pier theatre for over fifteen seasons in the 1950s and 1960s, earning himself the sobriquet 'Mr Eastbourne', and he was still performing occasionally up to his death in 1982. Part of his act was a comedy ventriloquism act, where the dummy would fall apart. After being on stage for a few weeks with a series of awful ventriloquists, he bought a dummy himself and did his own act as a ventriloquist. When Pat Phoenix as his wife who \"fed him lines\" asked if the dummy could sing something, he replied \"If I know it, he can sing it!\"\n\nHonour \n\nHe was still well-known enough to have a pub in his home town of Rotherham [http://www.rotherhampubs.f9.co.uk/Comedian.html dedicated to him] in 1970 and was awarded the MBE in 1975. \n\nDeath\n\nFor a day or two, he thought he had bad indigestion but it was worse than he realised and he died of a heart attack on 26 June 1982.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n*The Third String (1932)\n* Soft Lights and Sweet Music (1936)\n*It's a Grand Old World (1937)\n*I've Got a Horse (1938)\n*Home from Home (1939)\n*Cup-tie Honeymoon (1948)\nQuestion:\nWhose catchphrase was 'Can you hear me Mother'?\nAnswer:\nSandy Powell (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nAmy Williams\nAmy Joy Williams MBE (born 29 September 1982)  is a British former skeleton racer and Olympic gold medallist.\n\nOriginally a runner, she began training in skeleton after trying the sport on a push-start track at the University of Bath. Although unable to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics, she was a member of her nation's team four years later at the 2010 Games, and won a gold medal, becoming the first British individual gold medallist at a Winter Olympics for 30 years and the only British medallist of those specific Olympics.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilliams was born in Cambridge and brought up in Bath, being educated at Hayesfield School Technology College, Beechen Cliff School and the University of Bath. \n\nHer father, Ian Williams, is a professor of Chemistry at the University of Bath, and her mother, Janet Williams, is a former midwife. Williams has a twin sister and an older brother.\n\nCareer\n\nWilliams was originally a 400m runner but she was unable to qualify for the national athletics team. She began competing in skeleton in 2002 after trying out at a push-start track at the University of Bath. She described her first experience on a skeleton track as exhilarating and terrifying, but she nonetheless enjoyed it and began training in skeleton.\n\nAt her first major event, the 2009 World Championships in Lake Placid, she won a silver medal. \n\nWilliams was unable to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, as Great Britain was only allowed to enter a single skeleton athlete in that year's competition, a spot won by Shelley Rudman, who went on to win the silver medal. Four years later, she qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, where her country was allowed to send two skeleton athletes. \n\nAt the 2010 Games, Williams won the gold medal in the women's skeleton breaking the track record twice along the way and winning by more than a half a second.  At the end of the first day, on which Williams had established a 0.3s advantage over second placed Kerstin Szymkowiak, two protests were filed by other nations over the aerodynamics of Williams' helmet. The protests claimed that the helmet's spoilers were illegal and gave her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. The manufacturer claimed that they were integral to the helmet's design. Both protests were rejected by the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation, which had passed the helmet—with ridges—days earlier.    \n\nWilliams became the first British gold medallist in an individual event at the Winter Olympics for 30 years, following Robin Cousins' victory in figure skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and the first British female individual Winter Olympics gold medallist since Jeannette Altwegg in 1952.\n\nIn June 2011, Williams appeared in an episode of the television show Top Gear in which she raced against a rally Mini Cooper at Lillehammer, Norway. Williams was 1.31 seconds slower in her skeleton run down the two kilometre Olympic track (1m 01.04s) than the car (59.73s) (which covered the same distance on a road that interweaves the circuit). \n\nWilliams was a contestant in the second series of the ITV show 71 Degrees North in late 2011.    She finished the series in third place.\n\nShe has also appeared in the CBBC series, 12 again.\n\nPost-retirement\n\nOn 1 May 2012, Williams announced her retirement from skeleton and said her injuries were behind her quitting the sport. \n\nIn January 2013, BBC Two announced Williams as a co-presenter on the 35th series of Ski Sunday. \n\nApproached by motorsports pundit and part-time rally driver Tony Jardine, Williams agreed to co-drive a Honda Civic, with the aim of competing in Rally GB. After gaining her licence, the pair successfully trained and qualified to compete in the 2013 Welsh-based Rally GB. \n\nAs well as taking up a new role as TeamGB Ambassador, with Robin Cousins, she has also taken a commentator role with the BBC Sport commentating team specialising in the ice sports of skeleton and bobsleigh. \n\nOn 25 April 2014, it was announced that Williams would replace Rachel Riley as a presenter on Channel 5's The Gadget Show. \n\nIn August 2015, Amy married Craig Ham 18 months after first meeting him via Tinder. The couple tied the knot at St Nicholas's Church in Bathampton, the village where Amy was raised.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nWilliams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.  She was installed as an Honorary Freeman of the City of Bath on 5 June 2010.\nQuestion:\nAmy Williams and Lizzy Yarnold of Great Britain have won the Winter Olympic Gold Medal at the last two games in which event?\nAnswer:\nSkeleton\n", "answers": ["Top Gear UK", "Top Gear (disambiguation)", "TopGear", "Top gear", "Top Gear", "Top Gear (Disambiguation)", "Top Gear (TV series)"], "length": 1657, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a73fb21e88b89752cf78e2ff4f158b13c6d0deca71b088fc"}

Little is known about his personal life prior to his role in the Portuguese Age of Discovery, and was considered a household servant and shield-bearer of the Infante Henry the Navigator. He was a native of Lagos on which he based his sea voyages, in the southern Algarve.  \n\nHe joined the service of Prince Henry's expeditions in 1433, when the Infante entrusted him with a vessel and crew, in order to attempt to round Cape Bojador, an impassable cape, with the then level of knowledge and equipment.  Sailing from Lagos, Portugal, Eanes made an unknown number of voyages along the west coast of Africa, before being driven west towards the Canary Islands.  In the islands he captured some inoffensive natives and returned with them as captives to Sagres, excusing his failure by recounting the dangers of the trip. His return was greeted with reserve and coldness in the court of Prince Henry, who had expected the navigator to succeed in rounding the Cape. Eanes hoped to return to favour in the following year, if the Prince would favour him with a second expedition. In 1434, his barquentine-caravel and crew was able to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return to Sagres, reporting the conditions of the water, land and ease of navigation beyond the Cape, and bringing with him some wild roses to prove that they had succeeded in their expedition.  The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. \n\nEanes made another voyage, with Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia, in 1435. They sailed about 30 leagues (144 km), or even 50 leagues (240 km) south of Cape Bojador and reached the African coast. Although they did not discover any inhabitants immediately, they did find traces of a human presence, during a voyage that was considered favourable. They named the bay in which they anchored Angra dos Ruivos (Cove of Reds), for the abundance of fish (resembling gurnets) that they caught in the waters.\nQuestion:\nIn 1434, Portuguese mariner Gil Eanes made a major breakthrough to obtain a reliable trade route to Western and Eastern Africa and India by finding a route around which cape?\nAnswer:\nCabo Bojador\nPassage:\nWebb Ellis Cup\nThe Webb Ellis Cup is the trophy awarded to the winner of the Rugby World Cup, the premier competition in men's international rugby union. The Cup is named after William Webb Ellis, who is often credited as the inventor of rugby football. The trophy is silver gilt and has been presented to the winner of the Rugby World Cup since the first competition in 1987. It has been held thrice by New Zealand (1987, 2011 & 2015), twice by Australia (1991 & 1999) and South Africa (1995 & 2007), and once by  England in 2003.\n\nThe 38 centimetre trophy weighs 4.5 kg, is gilded silver and is supported by two cast scroll handles.  On one handle there is a head of a satyr, on the other there is the head of a nymph. On the face of the trophy, the words International Rugby Football Board and below that arch The Webb Ellis Cup are engraved. The Webb Ellis Cup is also referred to (incorrectly) as the \"Webb Ellis Trophy\" or colloquially as \"Bill\", a nickname coined by the 1991 Rugby World Cup winners, the Wallabies.\n\nHistory\n\nThere are two official Webb Ellis Cups, which are used interchangeably. One cup is a 1906 trophy made by Carrington and Co. of London, which was a Victorian design of a 1740s cup by Paul de Lamerie, while the other is a 1986 replica.\n\nJohn Kendall-Carpenter, former England forward and the organiser of the first Rugby World Cup and Bob Weighill, the secretary of the International Rugby Board also a former England forward, visited Garrard & Co, the crown jeweller in Regent Street, London. Director Richard Jarvis, brought the particular cup down from the vault and showed it to both of them.\n\nIt was chosen for use in February 1987. Ronnie Dawson of Ireland, Keith Rowlands of Wales, Bob Stuart and  Dick Littlejohn of New Zealand and the Australians Nick Shehadie and Ross Turnbull approved of the choice of the trophy.  The trophy is being cared for and restored after each game by silversmiths Thomas Lyte.  \n\nIt was soon named \"The Webb Ellis Cup\". New Zealand became the first nation to win the Webb Ellis Cup when they won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The Webb Ellis Cup has been held by four nations; New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.\n\nThe current holders are New Zealand after beating Australia 34–17 in the 2015 Final in England. The trophy was on display in Newlands, South Africa until 2007, where it had stayed for two years following their victory. Later it was returned to the home of World Rugby, Ireland. One cup recently went on tour around the New Zealand provinces along with the Dave Gallaher Trophy, Bledisloe Cup, Hillary Shield, Women's World Cup, Rugby Sevens World Series and the Junior World Cup trophies.\nQuestion:\nFrom 2011 to 2019 who are the holders of the William Webb Ellis Cup?\nAnswer:\nN Z\n", "answers": ["A train", "A Train", "A Train (disambiguation)", "A-train", "A-Train (disambiguation)", "The A-Train"], "length": 993, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f59935dcbf0164432f91845606f42c9b88f1c79fb162ff55"}

While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line \"and if you doooooo...\" when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby. Another newcomer in the cast is Forest Whitaker, who would later make his mark in The Crying Game and as the host of the update TV series \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n8 of 10 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nQuestion:\nWhat is Robin Williams character called in Good Morning Vietnam?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nPurlin\nIn architecture, structural engineering or building, a purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.\n\nPurlin plates in wooden construction\n\nA purlin plate in wooden construction is also called an \"arcade plate\" in European English,  \"under purlin\", and \"principal purlin\". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction, also called \"major purlin\", \"side purlin\". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a \"double roof\" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  \"Through purlins\" pass over the top; \"butt purlins\" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; \"clasped purlins,\" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered. \n\nCommon purlins in wood construction\n\nCommon purlins in wood construction, also called a \"major-rafter minor-purlin system\".  Common purlins are typically \"trenched through\" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards. \n\nSteel construction\n\nIn steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.\n\nIt is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.\n\nCold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.\n\nEtymology\n\nInformation on the origin of the term \"purlin\" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.\n\nGallery\n\nNote: The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia.  \n\nFile:Rf-trad-section.gif| A section though lightweight timber frame construction showing the position of under purlins.\nImage:Metal-purlins.jpg|Roll formed metal roof purlins.

It has been regarded as such by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS) since the 1912 additions of New Mexico and Arizona to the United States.\n\nOverview\n\nIts position as located in a 1918 survey is located at , in Kansas about   northwest of the center of Lebanon, approximately 12 mi south of the Kansas-Nebraska border.  \n\nWhile any measurement of the exact center of a land mass will always be imprecise due to changing shorelines and other factors, the NGS coordinates are recognized in a historical marker in a small park at the intersection of AA Road and K-191.  It is accessible by a turn-off from U.S. Route 281.\n\nIt is distinct from the geographic center of the United States, which reflects the 1959 additions of the states of Alaska and Hawaii, which is located at a point northeast of Belle Fourche, South Dakota.\n\nIn an unusual technical glitch, a farmstead northeast of Potwin, Kansas became the default site of 600 million IP addresses (due to their lack of fine granularity) when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company MaxMind changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000. \n\nMarker\n\nIn order to protect the privacy of the private land owner where the point identified by the 1918 survey falls,  a proxy marker was erected in 1940 some half a mile away. \n\nIts inscription reads:\n\nThe GEOGRAPHIC CENTER of the UNITED STATES\nLAT. 39°50' LONG. -98°35'\nNE 1/4 - SE 1/4 - S32 - T2S - R11W\nLocated by L.T.

April 25, 1940\n\nAn American flag usually flies atop a pole placed on the monument. A covered picnic area and small four-pew chapel are nearby.\n\nMethod of measurement\n\nIn 1918, the Coast and Geodetic Survey found this location by balancing on a point a cardboard cutout shaped like the U.S. Includes a reprint of  Describes cardboard method used \"a number of years ago\". Incredibly, this method was accurate to within twenty miles, but while the Geodetic Survey no longer endorses any location as the center of the U.S., the identification of Lebanon, Kansas has remained.\nQuestion:\nIn which state is the geographical centre of the USA?\nAnswer:\nSouth dakota\nPassage:\nMountain range\nA mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.\n\nMountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys. Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology. They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes, for example thrust sheets, uplifted blocks, fold mountains, and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types.\n\nMajor ranges \n\nMost geologically young mountain ranges on the Earth's land surface are associated with either the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide Belt. The Pacific Ring of Fire includes the Andes of South America, extends through the North American Cordillera along the Pacific Coast, the Aleutian Range, on through Kamchatka, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, to New Zealand.  The Andes is 7000 km long and is often considered the world's longest mountain system. \n\nThe Alpide belt includes Indonesia and southeast Asia, through the Himalaya, and ends in the Alps, Spain and Atlas Mountains.  The belt also includes other European and Asian mountain ranges. The Himalayas contain the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, which is 8848 m high and traverses the border between China and Nepal. \n\nMountain ranges outside of these two systems include the Arctic Cordillera, the Urals, the Appalachians, the Scandinavian Mountains, the Altai Mountains and the Hijaz Mountains. If the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains, then the Ocean Ridges form the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of . \n\nDivisions and categories\n\nThe mountain systems of the earth are characterized by a tree structure, where mountain ranges can contain sub-ranges. The sub-range relationship is often expressed as a parent-child relationship. For example, the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Blue Ridge Mountains are sub-ranges of the Appalachian Mountains. Equivalently, the Appalachians are the parent of the White Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains, and the White Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains are children of the Appalachians.\n\nThe parent-child expression extends to the sub-ranges themselves: the Sandwich Range and the Presidential Range are children of the White Mountains, while the Presidential Range is parent to the Northern Presidential Range and Southern Presidential Range.\n\nClimate\n\nThe position of mountains influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools producing orographic precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (in accordance with the adiabatic lapse rate) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will affect the leeward side of a range.\n\nErosion\n\nMountain ranges are constantly subjected to erosional forces which work to tear them down. Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted and long after until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains. The rugged topography of a mountain range is the product of erosion. The basins adjacent to an eroding mountain range are filled with sediments which are buried and turned into sedimentary rock.\n\nThe early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado provides an example. As the uplift was occurring some 10000 ft of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east.  This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from the core of the range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted isostatically in response to the removed weight.\n\nExtraterrestrial \"Montes\"\n\nMountains on other planets and natural satellites of the Solar System are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts, though there are examples of mountain ranges (or \"Montes\") somewhat similar to those on Earth. Saturn's moon Titan  and Pluto,  in particular exhibit large mountain ranges in chains composed mainly of ices rather than rock. Examples include the Mithrim Montes and Doom Mons on Titan, and Norgay Montes and Hillary Montes on Pluto. Some terrestrial planets other than Earth also exhibit rocky mountain ranges, such as Maxwell Montes on Venus taller than any on Earth  and Tartarus Montes on Mars,  Jupiter's moon Io has mountain ranges formed from tectonic processes including Boösaule Montes, Dorian Montes, Hi'iaka Montes and Euboea Montes.\nQuestion:\nWhich mountain range contains thirteen of the worlds twenty highest mountains\nAnswer:\nHimilaya\nPassage:\nUnit of length\nA Unit of length refers to any discrete, pre-established length or distance having a constant magnitude which is used as a reference or convention to express linear dimension. The most common units in modern use are U.S. customary units in the United States and metric units elsewhere. British Imperial units are still used for some purposes in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The metric system is sub-divided into SI and non-SI units.  \n\nMetric system\n\nSI\n\nThe base unit in the International System of Units (SI) is the metre, defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.\"  It is approximately equal to 1.0936 yards. Other units are derived from the metre by adding prefixes from the table below:\n\nFor example, a kilometre is 1000 metres.\n\nNon-SI\n\nIn the Centimetre–gram–second system of units, the basic unit of length is the centimetre, or 1/100 of a metre.\nOther non-SI units are derived from decimal multiples of the meter.\n\nImperial/US\n\nThe basic unit of length in the Imperial and U.S. customary systems is the yard, defined as exactly 0.9144 m by international treaty in 1959. \n\nCommon Imperial units and U.S. customary units of length include: \n* thou or mil (1/1000 of an inch)\n* line (1/12 of an inch)\n* inch (2.54 cm)\n* foot (12 inches, 0.3048 m)\n* yard (3 ft, 0.9144 m)\n* (terrestrial) mile (5280 ft, 1609.344 m)\n* (land) league (3 miles)\n\nMarine\n\nIn addition, the following are used by sailors:\n* fathom (for depth; only in non-metric countries) (2 yards = 1.8288 m)\n* nautical mile (one minute of arc of latitude = 1852 m)\n\nAviation\n\nAviators use feet for altitude worldwide (except in Russia and China) and nautical miles for distance.\n\nSurveying\n\nSurveyors in the United States continue to use:\n* chain (~20.1m)\n* rod (also called pole or perch) (~5 m)\n\nScience\n\nAstronomy\n\nAstronomical measure uses:\n*Earth radius  ≈ 6,371 km \n* Lunar distance LD ≈   average distance between the center of Earth and the center of the Moon.\n*astronomical unit AU, au or ua. Defined as .  Approximately the distance between the Earth and Sun.\n*light-year ly ≈  The distance that light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year. \n*parsec pc ≈  or about \n*Hubble length 14.4 billion light-years or 4.55 gigaparsecs\n\nPhysics\n\nIn atomic physics, sub-atomic physics, and cosmology, the preferred unit of length is often related to a chosen fundamental physical constant, or combination thereof. This is often a characteristic radius or wavelength of a particle. Some common natural units of length are included in this table:\n\nArchaic\n\nArchaic units of distance include:\n*cana\n*cubit\n*rope\n*league\n*li (China)\n*pace (the \"double pace\" of about 5 feet used in Ancient Rome)\n*verst (Russia)\n\nInformal\n\nIn everyday conversation, and in informal literature, it is common to see lengths measured in units of objects of which everyone knows the approximate width. Common examples are:\n*Double-decker bus (9.5–10.9 metres in length)\n*Football field (generally around 110 metres, depending on the country)\n*Thickness of a human hair (around 80 micrometres)\n*A beard-second is a unit created as a teaching concept.  It is the distance that a beard grows in a second (about 5 nanometres)\n*Smoot, a jocular unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity prank\n\nOther\n\nHorse racing and other equestrian activities keep alive:\n* furlong ≈ \n*horse length ≈ 8 ft\nQuestion:\nWhat unit of distance is approximately 6 trillion miles?\nAnswer:\nLight-year\nPassage:\nLet's Hear It for the Boy (song)\n\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\" was the second number-one song for Deniece Williams and appeared on the soundtrack to the feature film Footloose.

{"input": "Passage:\nTannochbrae\nTannochbrae is a fictional town in Scotland which serves as the setting for A. J. Cronin's Dr. Finlay stories, as well as for the television and radio series based on these short stories.  \n\nThe filming of the original BBC series, Dr Finlay's Casebook, took place in Callander.  The second ITV series, Doctor Finlay, was filmed in Auchtermuchty.\nQuestion:\nWhich fictional UK television doctor lives in Tannochbrae?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nLiverpool Tart\nThe earliest known mention of a Liverpool Tart is 1897, when it was hand-written into a family cookbook, which was recently included in the village website for Evershot, in Dorset.\n\nBasically a pasty tart, the distinctive taste comes from the mixture of moist sugar (sic) and a boiled lemon, minced. In 2006 this recipe was taken up by Gerry Jones of Liverpool and developed with a view to the tart becoming as widely known and appreciated as the Bakewell and Manchester tarts. In 2008 it was being produced as a regular line by two bakeries in Merseyside, Satterthwaites in Crosby and Dafna's Cheesecake Factory in south Liverpool.  The original recipe called for \"½lb moist sugar, 2oz butter, 1 egg, 1 lemon, pastry\".\n\nThe process read;\n\" Put the butter and sugar into a moderate oven to melt. When melted, let it cool. Boil your lemon whole very slowly (or it will break) until quite soft. Mince it whole as it is, saving the juice as much as possible and taking out the pips. Mince very fine.\n\nBeat the egg well. Mix all well together. Line a flat open tart dish with good paste, and pour in the mixture to one uniform thickness (about ½ an inch), cross bar over and bake. Serve hot or cold.\"\n\nCurrent thinking is that \"moist\" sugar meant dark muscovado, while the lemon may be shredded (after removal of the pips) instead of \"boiling and mincing\". Once the basic tart is baked and setting, thought is then given to a decorative finish. The original \"cross bar over\" is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top, but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool's  Liver Bird in one form or another. It is possible to buy bespoke pastry cutters which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste. While these produce the most attractive tarts, they do add yet another level of sweetness,  and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms. Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template, which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart, then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view. This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit is traditionally used in the recipe for Liverpool Tart?\nAnswer:\nLemon\nPassage:\nFlag of Haiti\nThe flag of Haiti is a bicolour flag featuring two horizontal bands coloured blue and red, defaced by a white panel bearing the coat of arms.\n\nThe coat of arms depicts a trophy of weapons ready to defend freedom and a royal palm for independence. The palm is topped by the Cap of Liberty.\n\nThe motto is on a white scroll reading L'Union Fait La Force (\"Unity Makes Strength.\")\n\nPresent design\n\nThe present design was first used by the Republic of Haiti under President Alexandre Pétion in 1806.  It was readopted by Article 3 of the current Constitution of Haiti on February 25, 2012, and made square as part of its readoption.\n\nIn its semi-official English translation, Article 3 reads: \nThe emblem of the Haitian Nation shall be a flag with the following description:\na. Two (2) equal sized horizontal bands: a blue one on top and a red one underneath;\nb. The coat of arms of the Republic are: a Palmette  surmounted by the liberty cap, and under the palms a trophy with the legend: In Union there is Strength.\n\nOmitted from the English translation is section b of the French original: Au centre, sur un carré d'étoffe blanche, sont disposées les Armes de la République (\"In the center, on a square of white cloth, are placed the Coat of Arms of the Republic.\")\n\nThe civil flag and ensign lacks the coat of arms. \n\nHistory\n\nThe first purely Haitian flag was adopted on May 18, 1803, on the last day of the Congress of Arcahaie, about fifty miles north of Port-au-Prince. Haitian lore holds that the newly appointed revolutionary leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines created the flag by taking a French tricolor and ripping out the white center, which he discarded. He then asked Catherine Flon, his god-daughter,  to sew the remaining bands together. The white pale removed, the blue was taken to represent Haiti's black citizens and the red the gens de couleur. The story is widely known in Haiti: the anniversary of the date is celebrated as the Haitian Flag Day and images of Catherine Flon have appeared on Haitian currency and stamps. \n\nFollowing his proclamation as Emperor Jacques I, Dessalines promulgated a new constitution on May 20, 1805. In it, the colors of the flag were altered to black and red.  This flag being subsequently adopted by Henri Christophe, the republicans under Alexandre Pétion returned to the colors blue and red, subsequently turning them horizontal and adding the newly adopted Haitian coat of arms.\n\nDuring the period of the Haitian Empire of Faustin I, his coat of arms was used on the flag and for official functions, but it was subsequently abandoned upon his removal from office.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1986, the family dictatorships of François \"Papa Doc\" and Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier returned to Dessalines' black and red design. They included the national coat of arms, but altered the flags in its trophy to black as well.\n\nBecause the coat of arms is only used for national and military flags, whereas the civil flag consists solely of the two unaugmented horizontal bands, it was discovered at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics that Haiti and Liechtenstein were using the same flag. This led to the addition of a crown to the design of the flag of Liechtenstein. \n\nFile:Flag of Haiti 1803.svg|Flag of the Revolution (1803) with the white band removed from the French flag inscribed with the words meaning, Liberty or Death.\nFile:Flag of Haiti 1964 (civil).svg|Flag of the Empire of Haiti (1804–1806)\nFile:Flag of Haiti 1806.svg|Flag of the State of Haiti (1806-1811)\nFile:Kingdom of Haiti flag (1811-1820).JPG|Flag of the Kingdom of Haiti (1811–1820)\nFile:Flag of Haiti (1849-1859).png|Flag of the Empire of Haiti (1849–1859)\nFile:Flag of Haiti (1964-1986).svg|Flag of Haiti used by Duvalier (1964–1986)\nDuring his leadership of the Haitian Revolution, Toussaint Louverture usually portrayed himself as a legitimate agent of a French administration. As such, his forces typically flew the Revolutionary French Tricolore — vertical bands of blue, white, and red.\nQuestion:\nThe flag of Haiti consists of which two colours?\nAnswer:\nBLUE AND RED\nPassage:\nWoodwind instrument\nWoodwind instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments.  There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound.  Examples are a saxophone, a bassoon, piccolo and others.\n\nFlutes\n\nFlutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.  The flute family can be divided into two sub-families: open flutes, and closed flutes. \n\nTo produce a sound with open flutes, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream .  This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes and ocarinas.  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold. \n\nTo produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct.  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge.  As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, and organ pipes. \n\nReed instruments\n\nReed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.  Similar to flutes, Reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.   \n\nSingle-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).  When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.  \n\nDouble-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.   The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. \n \nExposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips.  This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.\n\nOn the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.  The player  blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.\n\nBagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.  However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. \n\nFree reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' –  small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).  \n\nModern orchestra and concert band woodwinds \n\nThe modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments. The section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone(s).\n\nThe concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's. The concert band's woodwind section typically includes: piccolo, flutes, oboes, B clarinets, bass clarinets, bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. The cor anglais, E clarinet, alto clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, and soprano saxophone are also used, but not as frequently as the other woodwinds.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the mouthpiece on most woodwind instruments?\nAnswer:\nReed (disambiguation)\nPassage:\n1956: Prince Rainier marries Grace Kelly - BBC News\nBBC ON THIS DAY | 19 | 1956: Prince Rainier marries Grace Kelly\n1956: Prince Rainier marries Grace Kelly\nPrince Rainier III of Monaco has married the American film actress Grace Kelly.\nThe religious ceremony follows yesterday's civil ceremony held  in the throne room in the Palace of Monaco.\nThe celebration of the Nuptial Mass was held in the Cathedral of Monaco.

The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872–75, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.\n\nDescription\n\nThe portrait measures 83 × 67.3 cm (32.7 × 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right \"Æ'TA SVÆ 26/A°1624\", which expands to \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624\" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624.   The identity of the man was unknown for centuries, and though the recorded 19th century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian and Pieter Biesboer has identified him as Tieleman Roosterman.  The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff.  There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying \"the pleasures and pains of love\" are \"bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire\", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune. \n\nIn general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting.  But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work. \n\nThe effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier in 1822.  After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate.  It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as portrait d'un homme (\"portrait of a man\"), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes.  The exhibition was a huge success and A Cavalier (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England.  By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become Laughing Cavalier, though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect.   The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that \"The man smiles rather than laughs\".  Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Laughing Cavalier is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughing Cavalier enjoying the beer. \n\nIn the Scarlet Pimpernel adventure series by Emma Orczy, The Laughing Cavalier is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nThe \"eyes following you round the room\" trope has long been a stand-by in British comedy, used by Pete and Dud in The Art Gallery,  among many others, sometimes in the form of a portrait with cut-away eyes that can be used as a peephole.\nQuestion:\n'The Laughing Cavalier' was painted by who?\nAnswer:\nFrans Hals\nPassage:\nFinger Anatomy Picture Image on MedicineNet.com\nFinger Anatomy Picture Image on MedicineNet.com\nNEXT\nFinger Anatomy: Fingers are easily injured, and broken fingers are some of the most common traumatic injuries seen in an emergency room. Finger fractures may account for  up to 10% of all bone fractures. Because fingers are used for  many everyday  activities, they are at higher risk than other parts of the body for traumatic injury, including sports injuries, workplace injuries, and other accidents.\nUnderstanding the basic anatomy of the hand and fingers is useful in  understanding different types of finger injuries, broken fingers, and how some  treatments differ from others. Fingers are constructed of ligaments (strong supportive tissue connecting   bone to bone), tendons (attachment tissue from muscle to bone), and three  phalanges (bones). There are no muscles in the fingers;   and fingers move by the pull of  forearm muscles on the tendons. The three bones in each finger are named according to their relationship to the palm of the hand. The  first bone, closest to the palm, is the proximal phalange; the second  bone is the middle phalange; and the smallest and farthest from the hand is the distal phalange.  The thumb does not have a middle phalange.\nThe knuckles are joints formed by the bones of the fingers and are commonly  injured or dislocated with trauma to the hand.\nThe first and largest knuckle is the junction  between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This  joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a  boxer's fracture.\nThe next knuckle out toward the    fingernail is the proximal inter-phalangeal  joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or  object directly strikes the finger.\nThe farthest joint of the finger is the distal inter-phalangeal joint (DIP).  Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon  (avulsion) injury.\nImage Source: MedicineNet, Inc.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the three bones that make up a human finger?\nAnswer:\nPhalangeal formula\n", "answers": ["Dr Finlay", "Dr. Finlay", "Dr Findlay's Casebook", "Dr Finlay's Casebook", "Dr. Finlay's Casebook"], "length": 3377, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9cec815da4ad7cb64e558c547dc65805f6e5280432d5ba9c"}

It is best known as the location of Claude Monet's garden and home.\n\nLocation\n\nGiverny sits on the \"right bank\" of the River Seine where the river Epte meets the Seine. The village lies 80 km from Paris, west and slightly north, in the old province of Normandy (it is officially in the département of Eure, in the région of Haute-Normandie).\n\nHistory\n\nA settlement has existed in Giverny since neolithic times and a monument uncovered attests to this fact. Archeological finds have included bootees dating from Gallo-Roman times and to the earlier 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The town was known in ancient deeds as \"Warnacum\". The cultivation of grapes has been an occupation of the inhabitants of Giverny since Merovingian times. The village church dates from the Middle Ages and is built partially in the Romanesque style, though additions have since been made. It is dedicated to Sainte-Radegonde. The village has remained a small rural setting with a modest population (numbering around 301 in 1883 when Monet discovered it) and has since seen a boom in tourism since the restoration of Monet's house and gardens.\n\nMonet at Giverny\n\nClaude Monet noticed the village of Giverny while looking out of a train window. He made up his mind to move there and rented a house and the area surrounding it. In 1890 he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his garden in Giverny, famous for its rectangular Clos normand, with archways of climbing plants entwined around colored shrubs, and the water garden, formed by a tributary to the Epte, with the Japanese bridge, the pond with the water lilies, the wisterias and the azaleas.\n\nMonet lived in the house with its famous pink crushed brick façade from 1883 until his death in 1926. He and many members of his family are interred in the village cemetery.\n\nThe Giverny Colony \n \n\nBeginning around 1887, a number of American Impressionist artists settled to work in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. These included Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Wendel, and John Leslie Breck.  Soon many American extended their visits from summer through the entire year.  American painter Theodore Earl Butler married Monet's stepdaughter and sometime-model Suzanne Hoschedé there in 1892.  \n\nFrederick Carl Frieseke spent every summer from 1906 through 1919 in a residence next door to Monet's.  The term Decorative Impressionism was coined in 1911 to describe Frieseke's work, and the term describes the work of a \"second wave\" of American painters in Giverny such as Richard E. Miller.  In December 1910, six of the Giverny artists (Frieseke, Miller, Lawton S. Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson) were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them \"The Giverny Group.\"  \n\nWorld War I largely marked the end of the art colony.\n\nAttractions\n\nClaude Monet's property at Giverny (house and gardens), left by his son to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1966, became a Museum opened to public visit in 1980 after completion of large-scale restoration work: the huge Nymphea's studio was restored and the precious collection of Japanese engravings was displayed in several rooms, hung in the manner chosen by the master himself; the gardens were replanted as they once were.  The house became a popular tourist attraction (the Claude Monet Foundation), particularly in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.\n\nThe other main attraction of the village is the Museum of Impressionism Giverny dedicated to the history of impressionism and its continuation in the Giverny art colony and along the valley of the river Seine.\n\nThe Hôtel Baudy was a center of artistic life in the Giverny heyday. It is now still a café and restaurant, with period decoration.\n\nPopulation\nQuestion:\nWhich French painter famously designed a garden at his home in Giverny, in which he created many of his most famous paintings?\nAnswer:\nClaude-Oscar Monet\nPassage:\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss | Art History: Symbolism | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss (video) | Khan Academy\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss\nPractice: Symbolism and Art Nouveau\nVideo transcript\n[MUSIC PLAYING] DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We're in the Belvedere in Vienna, and we're looking at Gustav Klimt's The Kiss from 1908. Probably the most famous Klimt, and actually, I have to admit that I had forgotten that the painting was almost a perfect square, because I've seen in so many posters where it's been cut down and made into a rectangle. DR: BETH HARRIS: It's a very large painting and there's so much gold that it's hard not to think of a religious icon. And I think in some ways Klimt was trying to create a modern icon-- something that suggested a sense of transcendence. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well there's no question that the gold here makes you think of the Byzantine tradition, maybe some of the tile work at Ravenna. There is a way that the patterning, especially around the faces, becomes a kind of halo, as well. You have Klimt building up the gold. He's got those gold circles, they actually rise off the surface of the canvas. DR: BETH HARRIS: And catch the light, much the way that the gold was tooled in medieval paintings. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: There is this sense of the male figure of patterns that are direct of linear in contrast to the curvilinear to the circles and the ovals that we seen in the female form. But the point that you made about the sense of the spiritual is so powerful in this painting. I think we forget that that darker gold ground seems so much as if the figures are somehow being dissipated into the cosmos, that there are so lost in the intensity, the eternity of that kiss. DR: BETH HARRIS: And all removed from the everyday world. I mean, we have to remember that this is a time of incredible modernization in Vienna. The city of Vienna has been transformed in the previous 30 years into a modern city. Here Klimt is abstracting a universal experience from the trauma, the difficulties, the anxieties of everyday life. I think it's also important to see this in relationship to Klimt's Beethoven Frieze, where the figures confront evil forces-- these mythic figures-- and in the end, there's this embrace, this kiss, this emergence from evil into fulfillment and perfection. A minute ago, we were looking at the painting by Egon Schiele called The Embrace, but there there was so much more of a sense of the physicality, of the body's. The way that the bodies really aren't present here and are cloaked in these decorative forms, reminds us how much Klimt, although he was exploring this kind of sensuality, was also disguising it, or covering it with a kind of decorative patterning. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And that's absolutely right, with the exception of the faces. And here, this is where the entire painting changes. The female figure is completely full frontal but horizontal. So that there's this beautiful sense of here passivity receiving that kiss, but also a kind of deep interior feeling with her eyes closed. Her fingers just delicately touching his as he holds her head and his neck reaches out and round, and you get a sense of his physical power through the strength of that neck, but also the intensity of his desire. And of course, they're both crowned. As on his head you can see a wreath of leaves, on hers almost as if they were the stars of the heavens. DR: BETH HARRIS: Schiele gives us an image of a couple that's electrified by kind of agitated outlines. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Schiele is showing us a kind of truth through the energy of the moment. Whereas Klimt seems to be reaching out to a truth that is for all time, that is so aestheticized it feels as if it has a degree of absolute permanence.

It produces large, ball-shaped white flowers that grow in clusters. The plant is believed to be native to the Dutch province of Gelderland. Today, it is often grown in parks and lawns in the United States. It is a cultivated form of high bush cranberry and grows from 7 to 12 feet (2.1 to 3.7 meters) tall. The flowers of the cultivated species are sterile and do not produce fruit, but a wild variety bears juicy, red berries.\nScientific classification. The snowball is in the honeysuckle family, Caprifoliaceae. It is Viburnum opulus. Snowdrop is the name of a group of flowering plants native Europe, the Middle East, and western Asia. Some species, including the common snowdrop of Europe, are commonly grown in gardens. Snowdrops bear nodding, white, bell-shaped flowers. Snowdrops are one of the earliest spring flowers, and they sometimes during warm spells in midwinter. Some snow-drops bloom in the fall. The common snowdrop is sometimes called the Fair Maid of February. Snowdrops grow from a small bulb that produces two or three narrow leaves and a flower stalk. The stalk of the common snowdrop usually grows from 4 to 9 inches (10 to 23 centimeters) tall. Snowdrops are easy to cultivate, and they grow best in partial shade and moist soil. The bulbs are planted 3 to 4 Inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) deep in the fall. The plants multiply each year, and a few bulbs may eventually produce large clumps of snowdrops.\nQuestion:\n'Fair Maid of February' was a once popular name for which small, white flower?\nAnswer:\nSnow drops\nPassage:\n100m Olympics history - from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt ...\n100m Olympics history - from Jesse Owens to Usain Bolt | Daily Mail Online\ncomments\nThe men’s 100 metres final has been the blue riband event at every Olympic Games, generating the greatest hype and excitement.\nIt is an event done and dusted in 10 seconds or less, but it carries a great history and dozens of stories.\nTimes have tumbled over the decades, with Jim Hines the first athlete to run under ten seconds in an Olympic final in 1968.\nHistory men: Jesse Owens (left) was the golden boy in 1936, while Usain Bolt ruled in 2008\nBut the advance from cinder to rubberized artificial tracks, the advent of hi-tech running spikes and kits, and the fact that Olympic sprinters now devote their entire year to training help to ever lower records.\nWe will have to wait and see if the current world record of 9.58 seconds, held by Usain Bolt, will be bettered in London.\nBut in the meantime, enjoy these video clips of every Olympic 100m final from Berlin in 1936 to the last Olympics in Beijing.\n \n2008 Beijing - Usain Bolt (Jamaica) 9.69\nThe uncatchable Bolt smashes the world and Olympic records and is so far ahead with 30 metres to go, he cruises over the finish line before celebrating in trademark fashion.\n2004 Athens - Justin Gatlin (USA) 9.85\nThe American Gatlin runs a great race but is almost caught on the line by Portugal’s Francis Obikwelu and his compatriot Maurice Greene.

Wells\nPassage:\nAlan Bleasdale\nAlan Bleasdale (born 23 March 1946) is an English writer, best known for social realist drama serials based on the lives of ordinary people. A former teacher, he has written for radio, stage and screen, and has also written novels.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Liverpool, Lancashire, Bleasdale is an only child; his father worked in a food factory and his mother in a grocery shop. From 1951-57, he went to the St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Infant and Junior Schools in Huyton-with-Roby outside Liverpool. From 1957-64, he attended the Wade Deacon Grammar School in Widnes. In 1967, he obtained a teaching certificate from the Padgate College of Education in Warrington (which became Warrington Collegiate Institute, now part of the University of Chester).\n\nFor four years he worked as a teacher at St Columba's Secondary Modern School in Huyton from 1967–71, then King George V School (now the King George V & Elaine Bernacchi School in Bikenibeu in South Tarawa) on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (now called Kiribati) from 1971–74, and lastly at Halewood Grange Comprehensive School (now known as Halewood College) in Halewood from 1974-75. From 1975 to 1986, he worked as a playwright at the Liverpool Playhouse (becoming associate director) and the Contact Theatre in Manchester (a University of Manchester venue).\n\nBroadcasting\n\nHis first successes came as the writer of radio dramas for the BBC; several of these plays followed the character of Scully and were broadcast on BBC Radio Merseyside in 1971 (Scully was a young man from Liverpool). Bleasdale's plays typically represented a more realistic, contemporary depiction of life in that city than was usually seen in the media.\n\nThe character became so successful that Bleasdale wrote a stage play, two novels and in 1978, a Play for Today (\"Scully's New Year's Eve\"). That same year, he wrote another single play for the BBC1 anthology series, entitled The Black Stuff about a group of Liverpudlian tarmac layers.\nAlthough the play was not transmitted for two years as it waited for an available slot, on its eventual broadcast in 1980 it won much praise, and producer Michael Wearing of BBC English Regions Drama managed to commission the sequel serial that Bleasdale had already been working on. The series, Boys from the Blackstuff, was transmitted on BBC Two in 1982, with a cast including Bernard Hill in the role of Yosser Hughes, whose catch-phrase \"Gizza job\" became synonymous with the mass unemployment of the Thatcher years. The series established Bleasdale as one of Britain's leading television writers and social commentators. \n\nBleasdale scripted the film No Surrender (1985), a black comedy in which a group of elderly Protestant hardliners are booked into a party at a pub on the same night as a group of Catholic old-timers.\n\nSince Boys from the Blackstuff, Bleasdale has been responsible for further award-winning television dramas, including The Monocled Mutineer (1986, BBC 1), G.B.H. (1991, Channel 4) and Jake's Progress (Channel 4, 1995) the story of a couple (Robert Lindsay and Julie Walters) struggling to cope with a 'difficult' child (Barclay Wright). In 1999, Bleasdale adapted Oliver Twist for ITV. The adaptation was well received but attracted some controversy as Bleasdale expanded the narrative by adding a backstory.\n\nIn 1987, Charlottetown Festival director Walter Learning presented the Canadian premiere of the Bleasdale musical Are You Lonesome Tonight? at the Confederation Centre of the Arts, a national arts centre located on Prince Edward Island. The musical, which took a tough look at the life of Elvis Presley, attracted controversy at a festival usually known for lightweight family fare such as Anne of Green Gables - The Musical. The chairman of the Board of Directors resigned in protest over the Bleasdale play, and objections to the rough language and subject matter were even brought up in the provincial legislature. However, the play was allowed to proceed and became a major critical and financial success for the festival that season.\n\nAfter an eleven-year absence from television, Bleasdale returned in January 2011 on BBC 2 with a two-part TV film, The Sinking of the Laconia. Bleasdale had been working on the screenplay since 2004, which depicted the events surrounding the World War II ocean liner RMS Laconia and the Laconia incident. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1967, Bleasdale married Julie Moses; they have two sons and one daughter.\n\nBleasdale's house is the main location in Nickelodeon's new youth series called House of Anubis, which premiered in January 2011.\nQuestion:\nWho played Michael Murray in Alan Bleasdale's TV drama G.B.H.?\nAnswer:\nRobert Lindsay\n", "answers": ["Allmhaigh", "Alloway"], "length": 2576, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4e0e4aaf78f098a5fe4f7881039a5110f4f08296e89309f4"}

As a writer, she completed her first novella in 2003 entitled The Man with the Dancing Eyes and followed this with Playing With the Grown-ups in 2008. In 2010 she wrote Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights, a cookery book which featured recipes that were recreated for a six-part BBC 2 series called The Delicious Miss Dahl.\n\nBorn in London, Dahl made her debut on the English catwalk in London Fashion Week in the Autumn of 1997.  That year, she was discovered by Isabella Blow, who was then a stylist for Vogue magazine. Blow introduced her to the management at the Storm Model Agency in London who signed her to a number of modelling campaigns, including those for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, DKNY, Boucheron and Pringle.\n\nDahl is the daughter of actor Julian Holloway and writer Tessa Dahl. Her maternal grandparents were the children's author Roald Dahl and the  American actress Patricia Neal. Her paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and the former chorus dancer Violet Lane. Dahl was the inspiration for Sophie, the main character in her maternal grandfather's book The BFG. She is married to the singer Jamie Cullum.\n\nEarly life \n\nDahl was born Sophie Holloway in London  to the actor Julian Holloway and the writer Tessa Dahl. As a child, Sophie led a turbulent lifestyle; she attended 10 schools and lived in 17 homes in various locations including London, New York, and India.  Dahl often spent time at both her maternal and paternal grandparents' houses in Great Missenden \nand Angmering respectively.  Dahl has noted that her childhood was \"an odd one, but with such magic\".\n\nCareer \n\nModelling \n\nDahl became interested in modelling after a chance meeting with the Vogue stylist Isabella Blow on the streets of West London.  Blow found Dahl crying after an argument with her parents over her reluctance to study art history. Blow consoled her and  introduced her to Sarah Doukas of the Storm Model Agency. Dahl made her modelling debut on the catwalk of Lainey Keogh's first major show, in London Fashion Week for Autumn 1997.  Under their management, Dahl appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, Pringle, and Gap, among others. \n\nDahl has worked with numerous notable photographers, including Richard Avedon, David Bailey, Peter Lindbergh, Bruce Weber, Steven Klein and Steven Meisel.  Over the course of her career, she appeared in many editorials for high fashion magazines such as Visionaire, French and German Vogue, W, ID and V magazine. In 1997 she appeared with Kate Moss in the Elton John music video \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\".  In 2000, Dahl became the face of Yves Saint-Laurent's Opium. The ad, art-directed by Tom Ford and shot by Steven Meisel, was a photograph of Dahl with cherry red hair posing nude on black satin. It was removed from UK billboards after complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority.  Accused of sexually objectifying women, it is in the top ten most-complained about advertisements of all time.  Dahl responded to the criticism: \"I think the photograph is beautiful... it was seen as being anti-women, when in fact I think it is very empowering to women\".   In 2012, Dahl was announced as the new face of Aubin & Wills.\n\nWriting \n\nDahl has written extensively for Vogue, and in November 2012, she won a Jasmine award for her column about scent.  In 2003 Dahl completed her first book, The Man with the Dancing Eyes, published by Bloomsbury Publishing.  After this she began writing regularly for publications such as American Vogue, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Observer and the Saturday Times. \n\nFrom 2005 Dahl was a contributing editor and regular columnist at Men's Vogue, prior to its closure in 2008. Dahl is the author of three other books: Playing with the Grown-Ups (2008)  and two cook books, Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights (2009)  and From Season To Season (2011).  She was a contributor to an anthology, Truth or Dare edited by Justine Picardie, which included works by Zoë Heller and William Fiennes.  Dahl provided introductions to the Puffin Classic new edition of The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett,  the Virago Press re-issue of Stella Gibbons' 1938 novel Nightingale Wood which was released in April 2009, and Nancy Mitford's \"Don't Tell Alfred\", reissued by Penguin in March 2010. \n\nDuring March and April 2010, Dahl wrote and presented a six-part cookery series entitled The Delicious Miss Dahl, which was broadcast on BBC 2. The following year, she filmed a documentary about the Victorian cook, Isabella Beeton which was transmitted on BBC2. \n\nPersonal life \n\nDahl comes from an artistic background, with notable grandparents on both sides. Her paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and the former chorus dancer Violet Lane.  Her paternal lineage has been associated with the stage since 1850; Charles Bernard (1830–1894), an ancestor, was a successful Shakespearean actor and theatre manager both in London and the English provinces. Bernard's son, Oliver Percy Bernard OBE MC (1881–1939), was an English architect and scenic designer, responsible for the sets for Sir Thomas Beecham's Ring Cycle at Covent Garden.  Her maternal grandparents were the author Roald Dahl and the American actress Patricia Neal. \n\nOn 9 January 2010 Dahl married the singer Jamie Cullum.  They had their first child, a daughter named Lyra, on 2 March 2011;  she was followed by a second daughter, Margot, on 4 March 2013.   The family live in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire.\nQuestion:\nWriter and model, Sophie Dahl is married to which musician?\nAnswer:\nJamie Cullum\nPassage:\nFritz Ligges\nFritz Ligges (29 July 1938 in Asseln – 21 May 1996 in Herbern) was a German equestrian and Olympic champion. He won a gold medal in show jumping with the West German team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. \n\nLigges was later coach for the national junior team of Germany.\nQuestion:\nElizabeth Ashton, Fritz Ligges, Josef Neckermann, Bridget Parker, Mark Phillips and Harvey Smith competed in what sports at the 1972 Olympic Ganes?\nAnswer:\nEquestrian (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nBilly Clanton\nBilly Clanton (1862 – October 26, 1881) was a rancher in Cochise County, Arizona Territory. He worked with his father Old Man Clanton and his brother Ike Clanton on their ranch and stole livestock from Mexico and later U.S. ranchers. He was a member of group of outlaws that had ongoing conflicts with lawmen Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp. The Clantons repeatedly threatened the Earps because they interfered with the Cowboy's illegal activities. On October 26, 1881, Billy, Tom McLaury, and Frank McLaury were killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in the boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory. The shoot out was his only gunfight.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Hamilton County, Texas, William Harrison \"Billy\" Clanton was one of seven children of Newman Haynes Clanton, (1816–1881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton: John, Ike Clanton, Alonzo, Mary, and Ester. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in Arizona Territory.\n\nHis father moved his wife Mariah and their six children to California after the end of the Civil War, where they moved several times over the next decade. Clanton's mother died in 1866.\n\nMove to Arizona\n\nClanton moved with his family in 1873 to Pima County, Arizona Territory and then to Charleston. His father started the \"Clanton Ranch\" in 1877. In the same year prospector Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the hills east of the San Pedro River on a plateau known as Goose Flats, less than 15 mi from the Clanton ranch. The boom town of Tombstone grew within two years from less than 100 to more than 7,000 residents. \n\nBilly Clanton and his brother Ike often went into Tombstone on weekends, and he did business in Tombstone associated with the ranch, alongside the two McLaury brothers. By most accounts, Ike was not well liked in and around Tombstone because he was a drunk and a braggart. Clanton was generally well liked and looked upon as hard working and level headed. \n\nLivestock thefts\n\nA few days after Wyatt Earp's arrival in Tombstone in December 1879, one of his prized horses was stolen. He heard several times that the Clantons had his horse. Almost a year later he got a tip that it had been seen at the Clanton's ranch near Charleston. Earp rode to their ranch and saw the horse being ridden down the street and placed in a corral. He stabled his horse at another corral and telegraphed James Earp in Tombstone to send up ownership papers for the horse to Charleston. Warren Earp brought the papers out that night. Earp testified in a later court hearing, \"While I was waiting for the papers, Billy Clanton found out that I was in town and went and tried to take the horse out of the corral. I told him that he could not take him out, that it was my horse. After the papers came, he gave the horse up without the papers being served, and asked me if I had any more horses to lose.\"\n\nIn July 1879, several rustlers attacked a rancho in northern Sonora, Mexico, killing several of the inhabitants. Hunting the murderers, Mexican Rurales led by Commandant Francisco Neri illegally crossed the border into Arizona and were ambushed. Johnny Ringo later said that Old Man Clanton and his sons Ike and Billy were among the murderers. \n\nOn August 13, 1881, Billy's father was killed in an ambush Guadalupe Canyon by Mexican Rurales. The Clanton sons continued operating the ranch. On October 25, 1881, Ike, Billy, and the McLaury brothers headed to Tombstone after working to gather scattered cattle, lost during an earlier Apache raid. The events that transpired over that night and the next day have various versions.\n\nShoot out in Tombstone\n\nIke had repeated confrontations with the Earps and Doc Holliday. On October 26, 1881, events came to a head when Billy and Ike got together with Billy Claiborne and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury at the Dexter Corral. When they were seen in town \"heeled\" (armed), anxious citizens warned the Earps. Upon attempting to disarm the Cowboys, a shoot out broke out, later named the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.\n\nThere remain today conflicting versions of what actually happened and who fired first. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran away in the opening moments. Billy Clanton emptied his gun during the fight, and was killed along with both McLaurys. Doc Holliday and Virgil and Morgan Earp were wounded.\n\nThe town was divided, with many supporting the Clantons, and others supporting the Earps. The funeral that followed was the largest in Tombstone's history, with more than 300 people following the hearse and 2,000 watching from the city's sidewalks. The three Cowboys were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery. William McLaury, Frank and Tom's brother, tried to indict the Earps for killing the Cowboys. He wrote in a letter during the preliminary hearing that the two brothers and Billy Clanton were preparing to come to Fort Worth, Texas to visit after selling their cattle.\nQuestion:\nWhere did Billy Clanton and the brothers Tom and Frank MacLaury famously die on October 26, 1881?\nAnswer:\nGunfight at the O K Corral\nPassage:\nLily the Pink (song)\n\"Lily the Pink\" is a 1968 song released by the UK comedy group the Scaffold. It is a modernisation of an older folk song titled \"The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham\". The lyrics celebrate the \"medicinal compound\" invented by Lily the Pink, and, in each verse, chronicle some extraordinary cure it has effected.\n\nThe Scaffold version\n\nThe Scaffold's record, released in November 1968, became No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for the four weeks encompassing the Christmas holidays that year.   \n\nBacking vocalists on the recording included Graham Nash (of the Hollies), Elton John (then Reg Dwight), and Tim Rice; while Jack Bruce (of Cream) played the bass guitar.  \n\nThe lyrics include a number of in-jokes. For example, the line Mr Frears has sticky out ears refers to film director Stephen Frears who had worked with the Scaffold early in their career; while the line Jennifer Eccles had terrible freckles refers to the song \"Jennifer Eccles\" by the Hollies, Graham Nash's former band.\n\nCovers and derivative versions\n\nAnother version of the song, released a few months after the Scaffold's by the Irish Rovers, became a minor hit for North American audiences in early 1969. At a time when covers were released almost as soon as the originals, the release from the Rovers' Tales to Warm Your Mind Decca LP became a second favorite behind \"The Unicorn\".\n\nThe song has since been adopted by the folk community. It has been performed live by the Brobdingnagian Bards and other Celtic-style folk and folk artists.\n\nThe song was successfully adapted into French by Richard Anthony in 1969: this version described humorously the devastating effects of a so-called panacée (universal medicine).\n\nEarlier folk song\n\nThe U.S. American folk (or drinking) song on which Lily the Pink was based is generally known as \"Lydia Pinkham\" or \"The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham\". It has the Roud number 8368.  The song was inspired by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, a well-known herbal-alcoholic patent medicine for women. Supposed to relieve menstrual and menopausal pains, the compound was mass-marketed in the United States from 1876 onwards.\n\nThe song was certainly in existence by the time of the First World War. F. W. Harvey records it being sung in officers' prisoner-of-war camps in Germany, and ascribes it to Canadian prisoners.  According to Harvey, the words of the first verse ran:\nHave you heard of Lydia Pinkum,\nAnd her love for the human race?\nHow she sells (she sells, she sells) her wonderful compound,\nAnd the papers publish her face?\n\nIn many versions, the complaints which the compound had cured were highly ribald in nature. During the Prohibition era (1920–33) in the United States, the medicine (like other similar patent medicines) had a particular appeal as a readily available 40-proof alcoholic drink, and it is likely that this aided the popularity of the song. A version of the song was the unofficial regimental song of the Royal Tank Corps during World War II.\nQuestion:\nWhich group had a hit with 'Lily the Pink' in 1969?\nAnswer:\nScaffold (band)\nPassage:\nScottish Grand National\n|}\n\nThe Scottish Grand National is a Grade 3 National Hunt steeplechase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Ayr, Scotland, over a distance of approximately 4 miles and 110 yards (6,538 metres) and 27 fences. It is a handicap race, and takes place each year in April.\nIt is Scotland's equivalent of the Grand National, and is held during Ayr's two-day Scottish Grand National Festival meeting.\n\nHistory\n\nThe race, then known as the \"West of Scotland Grand National\", was first run at a course near Houston, Renfrewshire in 1858.  It consisted of 32 jumps, mainly stone walls.\n\nIn 1867, after objections by the leader of the Free Kirk in Houston, the race moved to Bogside Racecourse, near Irvine. The inaugural winner at Bogside, The Elk, was owned by the Duke of Hamilton. During the early part of its history the race's distance was about three miles. It was later extended to 3⅞ miles, and became known by its present title in 1880, when it was won by Peacock.\n\nBogside Racecourse closed in 1965, and the Scottish Grand National was transferred to Ayr the following year. At this point the race was increased to its present length. Several winners of the Scottish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at Aintree. The first to complete the double was Music Hall, the winner of the 1922 Grand National. The feat has been achieved more recently by Little Polveir and Earth Summit, but the only horse to win both races in the same year was Red Rum in 1974.\n\nPrize money\n\nThe winning horse in 1867 won £100, increasing to £440 by 1906, £1030 in 1950, £5,436 in 1963 and  £119,595 in 2015.\n\nTelevision coverage\n\nThe first television coverage of the Scottish National was in 1953 on the BBC.  It was also shown the following year, but then wasn't screened again until 1969 on ITV and has been shown live ever since.  Coverage moved to Channel 4 in 1986.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse (3 wins):\n* Couvrefeu II – 1911, 1912, 1913\n* Southern Hero – 1934, 1936, 1939\n* Queen's Taste – 1953, 1954, 1956\n\nLeading jockey\n*All-time (4 wins)\n**Charlie Cunningham - Bellman (1881), Wild Meadow (1885), Orcadian (1887), Deloraine (1889)\n*At Ayr (3 wins)\n** Mark Dwyer – Androma (1984, 1985), Moorcroft Boy (1996)\n\nLeading trainer\n*All-time (5 wins)\n**Neville Crump – Wot No Sun (1949), Merryman II (1959), Arcturus (1968), Salkeld (1980), Canton (1983)\n**Ken Oliver – Pappageno's Cottage (1963), The Spaniard (1970), Young Ash Leaf (1971), Fighting Fit (1979), Cockle Strand (1982)\n*At Ayr (4 wins)\n**Ken Oliver – The Spaniard (1970), Young Ash Leaf (1971), Fighting Fit (1979), Cockle Strand (1982)\n\nWinners at Ayr\n\n* Weights given in stones and pounds; Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\nWinners at Bogside\n\nEarlier Winners\n\n* 1867 – The Elk\n* 1868 – Greenland\n* 1869 – Huntsman\n* 1870 – Snowstorm\n* 1871 – Keystone\n* 1872 – Cinna\n* 1873 – Hybla\n* 1874 – Ouragon II\n* 1875 – Solicitor\n* 1876 – Earl Marshal\n* 1877 – Solicitor\n* 1878 – no race\n* 1879 – Militant\n* 1880 – Peacock\n* 1881 – Bellman\n* 1882 – Gunboat\n* 1883 – Kerclaw\n* 1884 – The Peer\n* 1885 – Wild Meadow\n* 1886 – Crossbow\n* 1887 – Orcadian\n* 1888 – Ireland\n* 1889 – Deloraine\n* 1890 – no race\n* 1891 – see note below *\n* 1892 – Lizzie\n* 1893 – Lady Ellen II\n* 1894 – Leybourne\n* 1895 – Nepcote\n* 1896 – Cadlaw Cairn\n* 1897 – Modest Friar\n* 1898 – Trade Mark\n* 1899 – Tyrolean\n* 1900 – Dorothy Vane\n* 1901 – Big Busbie\n* 1902 – Canter Home\n* 1903 – Chit Chat\n* 1904 – Innismacsaint\n* 1905 – Theodocian\n* 1906 – Creolin\n* 1907 – Barney III\n* 1908 – Atrato\n* 1909 – Mount Prospect's Fortune\n* 1910 – The Duffrey\n* 1911 – Couvrefeu II\n* 1912 – Couvrefeu II\n* 1913 – Couvrefeu II\n* 1914 – Scrabee\n* 1915 – Templedowney\n* 1916 – no race\n* 1917 – no race\n* 1918 – no race\n* 1919 – The Turk\n* 1920 – Music Hall\n* 1921 – no race\n* 1922 – Sergeant Murphy\n* 1923 – Harrismith\n* 1924 – Royal Chancellor\n* 1925 – Gerald L.\n* 1926 – Estuna\n* 1927 – Estuna\n* 1928 – Ardeen\n* 1929 – Donzelon\n* 1930 – Drintyre\n* 1931 – Annandale\n* 1932 – Clydesdale\n* 1933 – Libourg\n* 1934 – Southern Hero\n* 1935 – Kellsboro' Jack\n* 1936 – Southern Hero\n* 1937 – Right'un\n* 1938 – Young Mischief\n* 1939 – Southern Hero\n* 1940–46 – no race\n\n* There were only two runners in 1891 – neither could clear the second fence and there was no winner.\nQuestion:\nAt which racecourse is the Scottish Grand National run each April?\nAnswer:\nAYR\n", "answers": ["Mountain of Light", "Jabal Al-Nur", "MOUNTAIN of LIGHT", "Jabal al-Nur", "Jabal al-nur", "Mount An-Nur", "Jabal An-Nur", "Jabal al-Nour", "The Mountain of Light"], "length": 3436, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b3182e843bd08825f414556b4fd067f3cf34a65785392907"}

It is the nation's second most populated place.  Matola is the capital of Maputo Province and has had its own elected municipal government since 1998. It has a port and also the biggest industrial area in Mozambique. The population of Matola is, according to the 2007 census, 675,422 inhabitants,  having increased to a 2014 projected population (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica Moçambique) of 893,000. \n\nEtymology\n\nMatola, which is also a common family name, comes from Matsolo a Ronga kingdom that existed in this region when the colonists arrived.\n\nIndustry \n\nMatola is an industrial centre with an important port for minerals (chromium and iron) and other exports from Swaziland and South Africa. It has petroleum refineries (presently inactive) and diverse industries, which manufacture products like soap, cement, and agricultural materials. The most important of these is an aluminium smelter, installed in 2002, that more than doubled Mozambique's GDP. In November 2014, South Korean car company Hyundai Motor Company opened a plant in Matola, which manufactures the Hyundai i10 and Hyundai Accent. \n\nTransport \n\nMatola is served by a station on the southern network of Mozambique Ports and Railways.  Coal is exported from here.\n\nGeography \n\nMatola is also the name of a small river (some 30 km long), that makes the northern border of the Matola municipality, and flows into Maputo Bay.\n\nDemographics\n\nTown twinning \n\n*  Loures, Portugal (since 1996)\nQuestion:\nMatola and Beira are the second and third largest cities in which African country?\nAnswer:\nMozambaquie\nPassage:\nAurora (mythology)\nAurora is the Latin word for dawn, and the goddess of dawn in Roman mythology and Latin poetry.\nLike Greek Eos and Rigvedic Ushas (and possibly Germanic Ostara), Aurora continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, Hausos.\n\nRoman mythology\n\nIn Roman mythology, Aurora renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun. Her parentage was flexible: for Ovid, she could equally be Pallantis, signifying the daughter of Pallas,  or the daughter of Hyperion.  She has two siblings, a brother (Sol, the sun) and a sister (Luna, the moon). Rarely Roman writers  imitated Hesiod and later Greek poets and named Aurora as the mother of the Anemoi (the Winds), who were the offspring of Astraeus, the father of the stars.\n\nAurora appears most often in sexual poetry with one of her mortal lovers. A myth taken from the Greek by Roman poets tells that one of her lovers was the prince of Troy, Tithonus. Tithonus was a mortal, and would therefore age and die. Wanting to be with her lover for all eternity, Aurora asked Jupiter to grant immortality to Tithonus. Jupiter granted her wish, but she failed to ask for eternal youth to accompany his immortality, and he became forever old.  Aurora turned him into a cicada.\n\nUsage in literature and music\n\nFrom Homer's Iliad:\nNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of Okeanos, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her. (19.1)\n\nBut soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then gathered the folk about the pyre of glorious Hector. (24.776)\n\nShakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (I.i), Montague says of his lovesick son Romeo\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the furthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from the light steals home my heavy son...\n\nIn traditional Irish folk songs, such as \"Lord Courtown\"\n\"One day I was a-musing down by the Courtown banks\n\"The sun shone bright and clearly, bold Neptune played a prank...\n\"There was Flora at the helm and Aurora to the stern\n\"And all their gallant fine seamen, their course for to steer on.\n\nIn \"On Imagination,\" by Phillis Wheatley\n\n\"From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise, \n\"Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,\n\"While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.\n\nIn the poem \"Tithonus\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Aurora is described thus:\nOnce more the old mysterious glimmer steals\nFrom thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,\nAnd bosom beating with a heart renewed.\nThy cheek begins to redden through the gloom,\nThy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,\nEre yet they blind the stars, and the wild team\nWhich love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,\nAnd shake the darkness from their loosened manes,\nAnd beat the twilight into flakes of a fire \n\nIn singer-songwriter Björk's Vespertine track, Aurora is described as:\nAurora\nGoddess sparkle\nA mountain shade suggests your shape\n\nI tumble down on my knees\nFill my mouth with snow\nThe way it melts\nI wish to melt into you\n\nThe post-punk rock band The Sexual Side Effects's track \"Aurora\" alludes to the goddess:\nAurora\nSave me from the fallen shadows\nPull me out of my dream\nAurora\nWade me through the phantom shallows\nShelter me from the screams\n\nIn Chapter 8 of Charlotte Brontë's Villette, Madame Beck fires her old Governess first thing in the morning and is described by the narrator, Lucy Snowe::All this, I say, was done between the moment of Madame Beck's issuing like Aurora from her chamber, and that in which she coolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.\n\nDepiction in art\n\n* Aurora by Guercino (1591–1666)\n* The Countess de Brac as Aurora by Jean-Marc Nattier (1685–1766)\n* Aurora e Titone by Francesco de Mura (1696–1782)\n* Aurora and Cephalus, by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson  (1767–1824)\n* The Gates of Dawn by Herbert James Draper (1863–1920)\n* Aurora and Cephalus by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin (1774–1833)\n* Aurora by Odilon Redon (1840 – 1916).\nQuestion:\nAurora was the Roman goddess of the dawn, who was her Greek counterpart?\nAnswer:\nEos\nPassage:\nJohn Callcott Horsley\nJohn Callcott Horsley RA (29 January 1817 – 18 October 1903), was an English Academic painter of genre and historical scenes, illustrator, and designer of the first Christmas card. He was a member of the artist's colony in Cranbrook.\n\nChildhood and education\n\nHorsley was born in London, the son of William Horsley, the musician, and grand-nephew of Sir Augustus Callcott. His sister Mary Elizabeth Horsley wed the famous British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1836. Horsley was mentored by William Mulready and Augustus Wall Callcot who sent him at age thirteen to study at Dr Henry Sass's academy where he met D.G Rossetti, J. Millais and W.P. Frith; in his biography Horsley recalls Dr Sass as being vain and untalented.  Following preparatory school Horsley studied painting at the Royal Academy schools where he met Thomas Webster. In 1836 he exhibited The Pride of the Village (Vernon Gallery) at the Royal Academy.\n\nFamily life\n\nHorsley married Elvira Walter in 1846 with whom he had three sons: Edward (1848), Frank (1849), and Harry (1850). Elvira died of consumption in 1852 followed by the deaths of Edward and Harry in 1854 and Frank in 1857 due to scarlet fever. Horsley remarried to Rosamund Haden who came from a family of distinguished surgeons—her father Charles Haden had a practice in Sloan Street and her brother Francis Seymour Haden was a surgeon and etcher who founded the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers in 1880. Rosamund gave birth to Walter (1855), Hugh (1856), Victor (1857), Emma (1858), Fanny (1859), Gerald (1862) and Rosamund (1864). Gerald grew up to be an architect, Walter an artist also studying at the RA Schools, and Victor a surgeon. Sir Victor Horsley (born 1857), became famous as a surgeon and neuropathologist, and a prominent supporter of the cause of experimental research. Horsley and Rosamund had four more children: Emma (1858), Fanny (1862), Gerald (1862) and Rosamund (1864), losing Hugh and Emma to scarlet fever.\n\nAfter his wedding to Rosamund in 1854 Horsley and his new wife toured the Midlands for five months to establish contacts with wealthy industrialists for portrait commissions. Horsley moved into 'Willesley', his house in Cranbrook in 1861, joining the Cranbrook Colony; whilst maintaining a home in London. The architect Richard Shaw adds \"...tall chimneys and cosy 'inglenooks.'\" in the Jacobean style to 'Willesley'.\n\nCareer\n\nHorsley's paintings were largely of historical subjects set in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, influenced by the Dutch masters Pieter de Hooch and Vermeer. Examples are \"Malvolio\", \"L'Allegro and il Penseroso\" (painted for the Prince Consort), \"Le Jour des Morts\" and \"A Scene from Don Quixote\".\n\nAs a young artist Horsley was patronised by the collector John Sheepshanks, who bought two of Horsley's paintings: '[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O81638/the-rival-performers-oil-painting-horsley-john-callcott/ 'The Rival Performers (1839)], and '[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O17372/the-contrast-youth-and-age-oil-painting-horsley-john-callcott/ 'Youth and Age (1839)]; both of which are now part of the V&A collection.\n\nIn 1843 his cartoon (preliminary drawing) of \"St Augustine Preaching\" won a prize in the competition to provide interior decorations for Palace of Westminster. This led to his being selected in 1844 he was as one of the six painters commissioned to execute frescoes there.  He painted \"[http://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/unknown/cartoons-in-westminster-hall-showing-the-spirit-of-religion-by-jc-horsley-/5268/ Religion]\" (1845) in the House of Lords, \"Henry V assuming the Crown\" and \"[http://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/john-callcott-horsley/satan-touched-by-ithuriels-spear-while-whispering-evil-dreams-to-eve-paradise-lost-/2885/ Satan touched by Ithuriel's Spear while whispering evil dreams to Eve]\". In 1864 he became a Royal Academician (RA).  Horsley had much to do with organizing the winter exhibitions of \"Old Masters\" at Burlington House after 1870.\n\nHorsley was rector and treasurer of the Royal Academy from 1875 to 1890 and 1882 to 1897 respectively. He earned the nickname 'Clothes-Horsley' for his opposition to the use of nude life models.  When, during the 1880s, the example of the French Salon began to affect the Academy exhibitors, and paintings of the nude became the fashion, he protested against the innovation, and his attitude caused Punch to give him the sobriquet of \"Mr J. C(lothes) Horsley\" (a pun on clothes horse). \n\nHe resigned from the academy in 1897, and became a \"retired Academician\".\n\nHorsley designed the first ever Christmas card, commissioned by Henry Cole. It caused some controversy because it depicted a small child drinking wine. He also designed the Horsley envelope, a pre-paid envelope that was the precursor to the postage stamp.\n\nIn 1856 Horsley was photographed at \"The Photographed Institute\" by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of \"fine artists\". The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. \n\nHorsley was a member of the London-based Etching Club contributing illustrations to editions of \"The Deserted Village\" (Oliver Goldsmith and \"Songs of Shakespeare\". He also illustrated a number of other books including \"[https://archive.org/details/littleprincesan00slatgoog Little Princes]\" by Eliza Slater (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1890).\nQuestion:\nJohn Callcott Horsley designed what first commercial Christmas item in 1843?\nAnswer:\nCharity Christmas card\nPassage:\nLes Casquets\nLes Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13 km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;\n*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;\n*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).\n\nA map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nHistory\n\nWrecks \n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6–7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. \n\nIt was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThe island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  \n\nThe Casquets in literature\n\nSwinburne's Les Casquets\n\nA. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.\n\nVictor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):\n\n\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nGallery \n\nFile:The Casquets Lighthouses off Alderney 1868.jpg|Les Casquets with lighthouses in 1868\nFile:The Race of Alderney, from the Caskets (about 1868).jpg|Les Casquets looking east (towards Alderney)\nQuestion:\nOff which island is there a group of rocks with a lighthouse called the Casquets?\nAnswer:\nCoat of arms of Alderney\nPassage:\nAi Weiwei | Article about Ai Weiwei by The Free Dictionary\nAi Weiwei | Article about Ai Weiwei by The Free Dictionary\nAi Weiwei | Article about Ai Weiwei by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ai+Weiwei\nAlso found in: Dictionary .\nAi Weiwei\n(ī` wāwā), 1957–, Chinese artist, architect, filmmaker, and political activist.

Ai subsequently studied at the Beijing Film Institute, began to make avant-garde art, and became politically active. From 1981 to 1993 he lived in New York City and studied at the Parsons Inst. of Design. In the mid-1990s he and two other artists published an influential trilogy of books on avant-garde Chinese artists. Ai began to attract international attention with such works as the photo tryptich Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn (1995) and his reassembled Ming and Ch'ing artifacts, which embody his recurring themes of destruction and recreation. He opened an art atelier and architectural practice and helped design the Beijing Olympics \"Bird's Nest\" stadium (2008), but soon disassociated himself from the games. His best-known works include the backpacks and text installations (2009) commemorating the children who died in poorly built schools in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the Tate Modern's installation (2010) of millions of porcelain sunflower seeds.\nAi began writing a blog in 2005, which by 2008 had become a venue for political satire and dissidence. In 2009 a severe police beating required emergency surgery; the next year he was placed under house arrest. In 2011 the government razed his Shanghai studio and he was arrested, ostensibly for tax evasion, detained secretly and interrogated for 81 days, then had his travel restricted; he was not permitted to travel abroad until 2015. His design firm was also fined $2.4 million for tax evasion. In 2012 the government revoked his business license, forcing his architectural firm to close. Ai created six half-scale fiberglass dioramas depicting his detention; smuggled out of China, they were exhibited in Venice in 2013. A multimedia exhibition made for Alcatraz Alcatraz\n[Sp.

They brought Bassey back one more time in 1979 to sing the Moonraker theme, but she couldn't quite recapture the magic. Decades later, \"Diamonds Are Forever\" returned to pop culture when Kanye West sampled the song for \"Diamonds From Sierra Leone.\"\nQuestion:\nCan you name the singer of the title track for '1971 - Diamonds Are Forever'?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nAstraphobia\nAstraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, or nicaduranaphobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia derives from the Greek words ἀστραπή (astrape; lightning) and φόβος (phobos; fear). \n\nSymptoms\n\nA person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, the sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, the feeling of dread, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm.  They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows.\n\nA sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. An astraphobic person will be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. In very extreme cases, astraphobia can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home.\n\nChildren\n\nA 2007 study found astraphobia the third most prevalent phobia in the US.  It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child's phobia should be addressed, for it may become a serious problem in adulthood.\n\nTo lessen a child's fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment; a fearless adult is an excellent role model for children. Sometimes children cannot be attracted to video games and activities while a thunderstorm is happening. Some children usually go to basements and other places that are quiet or places that have no windows.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also often used to treat astraphobia.  The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to himself or herself in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort.\n\nDogs and cats\n\nDogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol - a hormone associated with stress - affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and Dog Appeasing Pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers. \n\nStudies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is very rare, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm. \n\nGenerally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals. Showing fearlessness is, arguably, the best method to \"cure\" the anxiety.\nQuestion:\nOf what does someone suffering from brontophobia have an irrational fear?\nAnswer:\nThundering\nPassage:\nTreaty of Troyes\nThe Treaty of Troyes was an agreement that King Henry V of England and his heirs would inherit the throne of France upon the death of King Charles VI of France. It was signed in the French city of Troyes on 21 May 1420 in the aftermath of Henry's successful military campaign in France. It forms a part of the backdrop of the latter phase of the Hundred Years' War finally won by the French at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, and in which various English kings tried to establish their claims to the French throne.\n\nTerms\n\nThe treaty arranged for the marriage of Charles VI's daughter Catherine of Valois to Henry V, who was made regent of France and acknowledged (along with his future sons) as successor to the French throne. The Dauphin Charles VII of France was disinherited from the succession. The Estates-General of France ratified the agreement later that year after Henry V entered Paris. (See main article:The Dual-Monarchy of England and France)\n\nBackground\n\nThe French king Charles VI suffered bouts of insanity through much of his reign. Henry V had invaded France in 1415 and delivered a crushing defeat to the French at Agincourt. In 1418, John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, whose political and economic interests favoured an agreement with the English, occupied Paris. One year later he was murdered by his Armagnac opponents on the bridge at Montereau. His son Philip the Good formed an alliance with the English and negotiated the treaty with the English King.\n\nIsabeau of Bavaria, Charles VI's queen, whose participation in the negotiations was merely formal, agreed to the treaty disinheriting her son, hoping that if the dynasties were joined through Henry V the war could be ended and leave France in the hands of a vigorous and able king.\n\nThere had been earlier rumours that the Queen had an affair with her brother-in-law Louis, Duke of Orléans. These rumours were gladly taken up by Louis' main rival, John the Fearless, who had had the Duke of Orléans assassinated in 1407. The Burgundians promoted the rumor that Charles was a bastard. However, such a statement could not possibly be registered in a treaty without offending the honor of the King of France. Thus, the disinheritance of the dauphin, with respect to the French throne, was based on his \"enormous crimes,\" as he was accused of having ordered the assassination of John the Fearless.\n\nCharles' disinheritance received further legal sanction after he declared himself regent for Charles VI in rivalry to the regency declared by Henry V. The Dauphin was summoned to a lit-de justice (legal hearing) in 1420 on charges of lèse-majesté.  When he failed to appear, a Parisian court in 1421 found Charles the Dauphin guilty of treason and sentenced him to disinheritance and banishment from the Kingdom of France, losing all privileges to land and titles.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe treaty was undermined by the deaths of both Charles VI and Henry V within two months of each other in 1422. The infant Henry VI of England became King of both England and France, but the Dauphin Charles also claimed the throne of France upon the death of his father. Crowned King of France, Charles VII, on 17 July 1429 in Reims Cathedral, he ruled only a region of France centred on Bourges and was derisively referred to as the \"King of Bourges\" by his opponents.\n\nThe terms of the Treaty of Troyes were later confirmed once again at the Treaty of Amiens (1423), when Burgundy and Brittany confirmed the recognition of Henry VI as King of France and agreed to form a triple-defensive alliance against the Dauphin Charles. However, in 1435, Charles signed the Treaty of Arras with the Burgundians, in which they recognized and endorsed his claims to the throne.\n\nThe military victory of Charles VII over both the French and English supporters of the claims of Henry VI to be king of France rendered the treaty moot. The kings of England continued to claim the crown of France until the Acts of Union in 1800/1801 merged the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland.\nQuestion:\nFollowing the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, which king became Regent of France and successor to the French throne?\nAnswer:\nHENRY the FIFTH\nPassage:\nTommy and Tuppence\nTommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives, recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie. Their full names are Thomas Beresford and Prudence Beresford (née Cowley).\nThe first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary (1922). They started out their career as accidental blackmailers  (all in search of adventure and money), but the detecting life soon proved more profitable and much more exciting.\n\nNovels\n\nTommy and Tuppence appear together in four full-length novels and one collection of short stories    The collection of short stories is Partners in Crime, (1929, each story reminiscent of another writer's work); the four novels are The Secret Adversary (1922),  N or M? (1941), By the Pricking of My Thumbs (1968); and Postern of Fate (1973).  Postern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote, although not the last to be published.\n\nDetectives\n\nTuppence appears as a charismatic, impulsive and intuitive person, while Tommy is less imaginative, and less likely to be diverted from the truth (as their first adversary sums him up \"he is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts\"). They therefore make a good team. It is in this first book The Secret Adversary that they meet up after the war, and come to realise that, although they have been friends for most of their lives, they have now fallen in love with each other.\n\nUnlike many other recurring detective characters, including the better known Christie detectives, Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical upper middle class \"bright young things\" of the 1920s,  and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavour than the stories featuring the better known Christie characters. As they age, they're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in The Secret Adversary; and subsequently, as a now married pub owner, renders vital assistance to the pair in N or M?. In Partners in Crime, Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency; by Postern of Fate he's their butler and has now been widowed. In Postern of Fate they also have a small dog named Hannibal.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1953 the BBC adapted Partners in Crime as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim.\n\nThe Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis, first in the feature-length The Secret Adversary (1982), and then in the 10 episode series Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime (1983).\n\nThe novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit.... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. The action is transposed to Savoie in France. A second movie, Le crime est notre affaire, came out in 2008. Le crime est notre affaire is named after Partners in Crime and stars the Beresfords, but its story is based on 4.50 From Paddington, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film Associés contre le crime is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in Partners in Crime.\n\nAn adaptation of By the Pricking of My Thumbs appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series Marple even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. In this version, Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively, but, unlike in the book, Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence (MI6) business.\n\nBBC television began broadcasting two adaptations, comprising six episodes in 2015. Set in the 1950s and titled Partners in Crime, it starred David Walliams as Tommy  and Jessica Raine as Tuppence.\nQuestion:\n\"Who plays the part of Tommy Beresford in the BBC series \"\"Partners in Crime\"\", based on an Agatha Christie novel?\"\nAnswer:\nDavid Walliams\nPassage:\n7 Drinks From The '90s That We Totally Miss - Gurl.com\n'90s Things: 7 Drinks From The Nineties That We Totally Miss | Gurl.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nTANG\nI don't care what Buzz Aldrin says.

When sites are available, beavers burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes. But they also transform less suitable habitats by building dams. Felling and gnawing trees with their strong teeth and powerful jaws, they create massive log, branch, and mud structures to block streams and turn fields and forests into the large ponds that beavers love.\nDomelike beaver homes, called lodges, are also constructed of branches and mud. They are often strategically located in the middle of ponds and can only be reached by underwater entrances. These dwellings are home to extended families of monogamous parents, young kits, and the yearlings born the previous spring.\nBeavers are among the largest of rodents. They are herbivores and prefer to eat leaves, bark, twigs, roots, and aquatic plants.\nThese large rodents move with an ungainly waddle on land but are graceful in the water, where they use their large, webbed rear feet like swimming fins, and their paddle-shaped tails like rudders. These attributes allow beavers to swim at speeds of up to five miles (eight kilometers) an hour. They can remain underwater for 15 minutes without surfacing, and have a set of transparent eyelids that function much like goggles. Their fur is naturally oily and waterproof.\nThere are two species of beavers, which are found in the forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. These animals are active all winter, swimming and foraging in their ponds even when a layer of ice covers the surface.\nQuestion:\n\"What name is given to the \"\"house\"\" constructed by beavers?\"\nAnswer:\nLodge\n", "answers": ["Dame Shirley Bassey DBE", "The Love Album (Shirley Bassey album)", "Dame Shirley Bassey", "Shirley Bassey", "Shirley Veronica Bassey", "Shirley Bassett", "Dame Shirley Veronica Bassey", "Shirley Bassie", "Burly Chassis"], "length": 2838, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "db616c3e69c66cbc24ecf7b5b88799cee02ef2083f97dfad"}

Though the trio of legends brought Anna, Maria, and Eliza to the big screen, it was Nixon’s voice who brought them to life—and and into our hearts.  \nIt’s a story that would be fodder for its own Hollywood film…if it already wasn’t essentially the plot for Singin’ in the Rain. Just as studios started to rely on the star power of its greatest actresses to topline its movie musicals, Nixon, who had perfect pitch and a remarkable ability to sing any piece of music handed to her, was brought in to make their vocal performances more palatable. \nIn a way, Marni Nixon was the original autotune. Not that she would ever need it—listen to her indelible versions of “I Could Have Danced All Night” or “Somewhere” for proof of that. One of her first big jobs was singing the high notes that Marilyn Monroe couldn’t reach for Gentleman Prefer Blondes, landing the assignment to dub Kerr’s voice in The King and I soon after. \nThat Nixon did this was, of course, a secret. She received no screen credit for her work on those legendary films. She signed the scary contracts and kept mum in order to ensure that word never got out. Of course, it did eventually. TIME magazine caught wind of her work and unveiled her as the industry’s “ghostess with the mostest” in a 1964 article. \nDespite the fact that the movies she sang for became blockbuster hits and instant classics, with West Wide Story and My Fair Lady even earning Best Picture Oscars, Nixon was so anonymous that she even appeared as a contestant on a 1964 episode of To Tell the Truth , the game show in which the contestant is joined by two imposters and celebrity panelists attempt to discern who is the real deal. Two of the four panelists correctly identified Nixon; perhaps her lying skills weren’t as prolific as her singing voice. \nIn a recent Washington Post article , Nixon graciously referred to her uncredited contributions as “just part of the working singer’s job in Hollywood,” saying that “you just worked any way you can.” \nShe told WNYC in 2009 that “they thought of course that if you did some ghost work that probably you weren’t really appearing on stage and that meant something was probably wrong with you, like you were too fat or ugly or cross-eyed or something.” That To Tell the Truth clip from 1964 suggests that certainly is not true. She was just as beautiful as she was talented. She just didn’t boast the name recognition of an Audrey Hepburn or a Deborah Kerr.\nHilariously, Nixon spilled that often the actresses for which she was doing dubbing work didn’t know their voices were being dubbed until their films came out, or at least not to what extent. Wood and Hepburn, for example, were under the impression that only some of their singing would be replaced by Nixon—the high notes too lofty to hit—not the entire musical performance. \n“In the case of Audrey Hepburn, she was very smart and could say, ‘I know this is not good enough, I want to keep trying myself,’ but she had to accept that it wasn’t quite what it should be,” Nixon told The Washington Post . “But I don’t think that Natalie Wood’s ego could take that. Frankly, I think they used to create that kind of attitude too much—allowing them to have the illusion when they knew all along that she wasn’t good enough.”\nShe and Kerr had a wonderful working relationship, though. Kerr knew from the get-go that she would be dubbed, and worked side by side with Nixon to make sure that her acting performance matched Nixon’s vocal one. In an article titled “Deborah Kerr Tells Secret,” the actress even happily divulged that it was Nixon who did the singing.\nWhen Nixon told her after the interview was published that people weren’t supposed to know, Nixon recalls that Kerr winkingly told her, “I don’t have to know that’s in your contract.” Recalling the memory, Nixon said about Kerr, “She was that gracious. She was wonderful.” \nIn the end, the fact that these movie musicals featured dubbed singing didn’t harm their legacies at all. Though, as NPR’s Linda Holmes noted Monday on Twitter , it says a lot about the industry and our culture that “Hollywood thought a young Puerto Rican, a poor English girl, and a prim schoolteacher should all sound like the same person.” \nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!\nDaily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.\nCheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).\nQuestion:\n\"Who dubbed the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in the film version of \"\"My Fair Lady\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nMy Wife Next Door\nMy Wife Next Door is a British sitcom created by Brian Clemens and written by Richard Waring. It was shown on BBC1 in 1972, and only ran for 13 episodes.\n\nThe programme is about a couple, George Basset (John Alderton) and Suzie Basset (Hannah Gordon). Each tries to start afresh after their divorce. They move to the country, only to find that they have moved into adjoining cottages. \n\nOne episode of the series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy in 1973. When the series was repeated in 1979 it gained more viewers than during its original run, and topped the BBC1 weekly ratings several times. This was in part due to the ITV strike that limited British viewing to BBC1 and BBC2 for several weeks. \n\nIn the 1980s, a three-episode VHS video was released.\nQuestion:\nIn the sitcom My Wife Next Door which actress played Suzy Bassett\nAnswer:\nHannah Gordon\nPassage:\nSterlet\nThe sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is a relatively small species of sturgeon from Eurasia native to large rivers that flow into the Black Sea, Azov Sea, and Caspian Sea, as well as rivers in Siberia as far east as Yenisei. Populations migrating between fresh and salt water (anadromous) have been extirpated.\n\nDue to overfishing (for its flesh, caviar, and isinglass), pollution, and dams, the sterlet has declined throughout its native range and is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. Restocking projects are ongoing, and it has been introduced to some regions outside its native range, but the latter have generally not become self-sustaining. Today, the majority of the international trade involves sterlets from aquaculture. \n\nPhysical appearance\n\n*The sterlet may reach 16 kg in weight and 100 to 125 cm in length, rarely exceeding a length of 3 ft.\n*It is quite variable in coloration, but usually has a yellowish ventral side. \n*It is distinguishable from other European species of sturgeons by the presence of a great number of whitish lateral scutes, fringed barbels, and an elongated and narrow snout, highly variable in length.\n\nFeeding habits\n\nThe sterlet's main source of food is benthic organisms; they commonly feed on crustaceans, worms, and insect larvae.\n\nLife history\n\nThe sterlet commonly reaches the age of 22 to 25 years. Males reach sexual maturity at 3–7 years old and females at 4–12 years old. Spawning occurs from the middle of April to the beginning of June. Females may lay from 15,000–44,000 eggs, at water temperatures preferably 12–17°C (54–63°F).\n\nAs pond fish\n\nSterlets require relatively large ponds with good water conditions, and may get entangled in plants such as blanketweed. They may require special food such as sterlet sticks, as they are unable to digest the vegetable proteins usually found in commercial fish foods.\n\nAs food\n\nIn Russia, it is held in high esteem on account of its excellent flesh, contributing also to the best kinds of caviar and isinglass.\n\nSturgeon hybrids\n\n*Sterlet x Beluga (Huso huso) = (Bester) \n*Sterlet x Siberian [Russian] Sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii)]\n*Sterlet x Diamondback \n*Hybrids are hardier than their parents.\nQuestion:\nSterlet, Ossetra, Sevruga and Beluga are main types of what?\nAnswer:\nIkra\nPassage:\nDīs Pater\nDīs Pater was a Roman god of the underworld, later subsumed by Pluto or Hades (Hades was Greek). Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.\n\nDīs Pater was commonly shortened to simply Dīs. This name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld, such as the City of Dis of The Divine Comedy.\n\nIt is often thought that Dīs Pater was also a Celtic god. This confusion arises from the second-hand citation of one of Julius Caesar's comments in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars VI:18, where he says that the Gauls all claimed descent from Dīs Pater. However, Caesar's remark is a clear example of interpretatio Romana: what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that reminded him of the Roman Dīs Pater, that is, a chthonic deity associated with prosperity and fertility. Different possible candidates exist for this role in Celtic religion, such as Gaulish Sucellus, Irish Donn and Welsh Beli Mawr, among others.\n\nEtymology\n\nCicero in his De Natura Deorum derives the name of Dīs Pater from dives, suggesting a meaning of \"father of riches\", directly corresponding to the name  Pluto (from Greek Πλούτων, Ploutōn, meaning \"wealthy\"). According to some 19th century authors many of Cicero's etymological derivations are not to be taken seriously, and may indeed have been intended ironicall,  however, this particular derivation of Cicero's has been accepted by some contemporary authors, some even suggesting that Dīs Pater is a direct loan translation of Ploutōn. \n\nAlternatively, he may be  a secondary reflex of the same god as Jupiter (Proto-Indo-European Dyeus Ph₂ter).\n\nMythology\n\nLike Pluto, Dīs Pater eventually became associated with death and the underworld because the wealth of the earth—gems and precious metals—was considered in the domain of the Greco-Roman underworld. As a result, Dīs Pater was over time conflated with the Greek god Hades.\n\nIn being conflated with Pluto, Dīs Pater took on some of the Greek mythological attributes of Pluto/Hades, being one of the three sons of Saturn (Greek: Cronus) and Ops (Greek: Rhea), along with Jupiter and Neptune. He ruled the underworld and the dead beside his wife, Proserpina (Greek: Persephone).  In literature, Dīs Pater was commonly used as a symbolic and poetic way of referring to death itself.\n\nWorship\n\nIn 249 BC and 207 BC, the Roman Senate under Senator Lucius Catelli ordained special festivals to appease Dīs Pater and Proserpina. Every hundred years, a festival was celebrated in his name. According to legend, a round marble altar, Altar of Dīs Pater and Proserpina (), was miraculously discovered by the servants of a Sabine called Valesius, the ancestor of the first consul. The servants were digging in the Tarentum on the edge of the Campus Martius to lay foundations following instructions given to Valesius's children in dreams, when they found the altar 20 ft underground. Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the Ludi Saeculares or Ludi Tarentini. It may have been uncovered for each occasion of the games, to be reburied afterwards, a clearly chthonic tradition of worship. It was rediscovered in 1886–87 beneath the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome.  \n\nIn addition to being considered the ancestor of the Gauls, Dīs Pater was sometimes identified with the Sabine god Soranus. In southern Germany and the Balkans, Dīs Pater had a Celtic goddess, Aericura, as a consort. Dīs Pater was rarely associated with foreign deities in the shortened form of his name, Dis.\nQuestion:\n\"In classical Rome the use of \"\"Dis\"\" referred to what?\"\nAnswer:\nGod of the Underworld\nPassage:\nFrasch process\nThe Frasch process is a method to extract sulfur from underground deposits. It is the only economic method of recovering sulfur from elemental deposits. Most of the world's sulfur was obtained this way until the late 20th century, when sulfur recovered from petroleum and gas sources (recovered sulfur) became more commonplace (see Claus process).\n\nIn the Frasch process, superheated water is pumped into the sulfur deposit; the sulfur melts and is extracted. The Frasch process is able to produce high purity sulfur. \n\nHistory\n\nIn 1867, miners discovered sulfur in the caprock of a salt dome in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, but it was beneath quicksand, which prevented mining. In 1894 the German-born American chemist, Herman Frasch (1852–1914), devised his Frasch method of sulfur removal using pipes to bypass the quicksand.   The process proved successful, on December 24, 1894, when the first molten sulfur was brought to the surface.  However, the high cost of fuel needed to heat the water made the process uneconomic until the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop oil field in Texas provided cheap fuel oil to the region.   The Frasch process began economic production at Sulphur Mines, Louisiana in 1903.\n\nWhen Frasch's patent expired, the process was widely applied to similar salt-dome sulfur deposits along the US Gulf Coast.  The second Frasch-process mine opened in 1912 in Brazoria County, Texas.  The US Gulf Coast came to dominate world sulfur production in the early and middle 20th century.   However, starting in the 1970s, byproduct sulfur recovery from oil and natural gas lowered the price of sulfur and drove many Frasch-process mines out of business.  The last US Frasch sulfur mine closed in 2000.  A Frasch mine in Iraq closed in 2003 due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Frasch process is still used to work sulfur deposits in Mexico and Poland.\n\nProcess\n\nIn the Frasch process, three concentric tubes are introduced into the sulfur deposit. Superheated water (165 °C, 2.5-3 MPa) is injected into the deposit via the outermost tube. Sulfur (m.p. 115 °C) melts and flows into the middle tube. Water pressure alone is unable to force the sulfur into the surface due to the molten sulfur's greater density, so hot air is introduced via the innermost tube to froth the sulfur, making it less dense, and pushing it to the surface.\n\nThe sulfur obtained can be very pure (99.7 - 99.8%). In this form, it is light yellow in color. If contaminated by organic compounds, it can be dark-colored; further purification is not economic, and usually unnecessary. Using this method, the United States produced 3.89 million tons of sulfur in 1989, and Mexico produced 1.02 million tons of sulfur in 1991.\n\nThe Frasch process can be used for deposits 50–800 meters deep. 3-38 cubic meters of superheated water are required to produce every tonne of sulfur, and the associated energy cost is significant. A working demonstration model of the Frasch process suitable for the classroom has been described.\nQuestion:\nThe Frasch process is used to extract what chemical element from underground deposits?\nAnswer:\nSulpher\nPassage:\nNicolai Poliakoff\nNicolai Poliakoff OBE (2 October 1900 – 25 September 1974) () () was the creator of Coco the Clown, arguably the most famous clown in the UK during the middle decades of the 20th century. Technically, Coco is an  Auguste, the foolish character who is always on the receiving end of buckets of water and custard pies. The auguste often works with the more clever white-faced clown, who always gets the better of him.\n\nBiography\n\nPoliakoff was born in 1900 to a Jewish family in Dvinsk (today Daugavpils), Latvia which was then part of the Russian Empire. His parents worked in the theatre when Nicolai was born, but both lost their jobs a few years later, and to survive, Nicolai started busking from the age of five.\n* in 1908, he “ran away and joined the circus,” as the saying goes. He travelled 300 miles by train to Vitebsk, in Belorussia (today Belarus), where he persuaded a circus owner to give him a job, telling him that he was an orphan with no one to look after him. The director bought his story and placed him under the charge of Vitaly  Lazarenko,a clown and acrobat who would become a major circus star in the Soviet Union after the Communist revolution.\n* Nicholai eventually persuaded his father to allow him to follow a circus career, and he was apprenticed for four years to Rudolfo Truzzi (1860-1936)—son of Massimiliano Truzzi, the founder of the great Russian circus dynasty of Italian descent. With Truzzi, Nicholai studied the fundamentals of acrobatics, trapeze, horse riding, and an array of circus disciplines. Russians are particularly fond of nicknames, and Nicholai was called Kokishka by Truzzi, a diminutive of “koshka” (cat in Russian), which in time became abbreviated to Koko—and rendered as Coco when Nicholai arrived in the UK.\n* In 1915 Nicholai Polakovs was enlisted in the Imperial Army. During the ensuing Civil War, he was conscripted by the Red Army, escaped—only to be conscripted again by the White Army and escape again, disguised as a girl in a troupe of Mongolian travelling entertainers. Finally, when the political situation began to settle down, he returned to work in the circus.\n* 1919— Nicholai was performing in Riga, when he met Valentina Novikova (1901–1983),  whom he married in June of that year, and with whom he would have six children: Helen, Michael (1923–2009), Nadia, Sascha, Olga, and Tamara.\n*1920— He worked for the newly created (in 1919) Soviet state circus organization, and travelled in the Soviet Union from one circus building to another.\n* 1926— He had his own circus collective, a small but lively troupe of twenty based in Lithuania.\n* 1929— Nicholai performed at Circus Busch (Before WWII, Soviet performers were still allowed to work in Western Europe.) in Berlin (and took the time to do a cameo in Karl Grune’s film version of Carl Zuckmayer’s play, Katharina Knie). He served with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps of the British Army in WW2. He appeared with the Bertram Mills Circus for many years. His clown persona had two distinctive visual features that endeared him to television audiences: his boots, described as being size 58, and his trick hair with hinges in the centre parting, which allowed it to lift when he was surprised. He is a member of the Clown Hall of Fame.\n* 21 December 1929 to 18 January 1930—Nicholai first appeared for Bertram Mills in Manchester.\n*1933–34—Coco’s contract with Mills was extended, and following the Olympia Christmas season.\n* During the Second World War Poliakoff entertained troops as a member of ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association).\n* In 1942 Coco and Michael were engaged at the Blackpool Tower Circus, for the Easter and summer programmes .\n*  1946— Bertram Mills Circus reopened and Coco returned. He appeared on tour for every summer season until the closure of the touring show in October 1964.\n*1947–48 & 1966–67—He performed with Mills at the Olympia in London(Christmas show)\n*21 October 1949—Nicholai and Valentina eventually became naturalized British citizens.\n* April 1957— During a performance at Chelmsford, Nicholai was knocked over and injured by a vehicle driven by Kam, \"the only motoring elephant in the world\"—one of Mills’s four elephants trained by Joan and Gösta Kruse.\n* In 1959 he was involved in a serious road accident prompting him to devote himself to the promotion of road safety awareness in children.  He was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for this work by Queen Elizabeth II, one of the few foreigners ever to receive this honour. However, at the same time he continued to work in the circus in the mid-1960s, seated ringside while selling programmes dressed in his full auguste's costume.\n\n* He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1962 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Olympia (London).\n* 1963— He was honoured with the OBE \"for services to road safety among children.\"\n* He returned briefly to the circus world in 1974, when he toured with the Roberts Brothers Circus.\n\nPoliakoff died in Peterborough Hospital on 25 September 1974, after a short illness, and was buried in Woodnewton, in Northamptonshire, England.  His eldest son, Michael, a longtime circus \"Producing Clown\", creator of a much imitated \"soap gag\" entree, and the Clown who designed the post 1960's Ronald McDonald, was by then already using the \"Coco\" moniker. Michael had made his debut in the ring at 17, as \"Coconut\" and his sister Helen as \"Cocotina\" ('cocos' being the Spanish word for grinning face and applied to the coconut because of the three marks on its shell).  Michael's Coco the Clown was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nAs well as Michael, Poliakoff had five other children with wife Valentina: Helen, Nadia, Sascha, Olga, and Tamara. Tamara was the founder, along with her husband Ali Hassani, of the first circus in the UK not to use performing animals.\nQuestion:\nHow was the entertainer Nicolai Poliakoff better known?\nAnswer:\nCoco the Clown\n", "answers": ["Marnie Nixon", "Marni Nixon"], "length": 3652, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "23b7ccb5590eb11ee3d48ccc517d217bf7505280d57b96f1"}

It was made into a film of the same name in 1990. \n\nPlot\n\nThe novel is a fictionalised biography of the Godolphin Arabian, an ancestor of the modern Thoroughbred. The story starts with Man o' War's victory over Sir Barton in a race. The fans expect Man o' War to race at Newmarket, but his owner, Samuel Riddle, chooses to end his racing career early. When questioned about his decision, he tells the story of the Godolphin Arabian.\n\nThe story starts in Morocco, as the fast of Ramadan is ending with the setting sun. The boys in the Sultan's stables begin to hungrily feast, but Agba, a mute orphan, ignores the end of the fast and continues to tend to his favorite Arabian mare. She refuses to eat, even though all the horses were forced to participate in the Ramadan fast along with the humans, and Agba worries for her. The Chief Groom realizes this, and that tonight is her birthing hour.\n\nAgba, sleeping in the mare's stall, wakes to find a new foal in the stable. He notices a white spot on the colt's hind heel, considered the emblem of swiftness and good luck. The Chief Groom, upon entering the stall spots a wheat ear on the foal's chest: a sign of bad luck. He attempts to kill the colt, but Agba intervenes and points out the white spot. The Chief Groom considers this, then leaves, prophesying that the mare will die. Agba, undaunted, names the colt Sham because of his golden coat.\n\nWithin a few days, the prophecy is fulfilled when the mare dies. Agba attempts to run away from the stables, but is knocked into a camel. This gives him an idea, and he feeds Sham on camel's milk and wild honey, promising that someday he will be King of The Wind.\n\nSham matures into a promising racehorse, beating all of the other horses in the stable. He sees Agba as a mother, and they develop a close bond. One day, the Sultan summons six horseboys to his palace, including Agba, and charges them to accompany six horses that are to be given as gifts to the French king. One horse is to be chestnut, one yellow dun, one dark gray, one white, one black, and one bay touched with gold. Sham fits the requirements for the bay horse and accompanies Agba to France. The horseboy is to remain with that horse until death, then return to Morocco.\n\nHowever, the supposedly great racehorses are frowned upon by the French, who believe that they are not 'lusty' enough to be racehorses. Five of the horses are sent back to Morocco, but Sham remains behind to be a kitchen horse. He does not take to this work well, and when Agba is gone one afternoon, Sham causes such a mess that the cook sells him.\n\nAgba searches desperately for Sham, finally finding him pulling water in the streets of Paris. He becomes a slave to Sham's owner  and meets Grimalkin the cat along the way.\n\nSham is bought by a Quaker man and taken to England. He refuses to have the Quaker's nephew ride him and is sold to an inn. When Agba is caught sneaking in to see the horse, he goes to jail. The jailer destroys Sham's pedigree. Fortunately, Agba is bailed out by the Quaker's housekeeper, who is quite fond of him, and Sham is released from his cruel treatment at the inn. The housekeeper finds him a job with the Earl of Godolphin.\n\nThe Earl treats Sham as a workhorse, albeit kindly. The true celebrity in the Godolphin stables is the stallion Hobgoblin, whom Sham detests. Lady Roxana, a mate meant for Hobgoblin, arrives, and Sham successfully fights Hobgoblin for her. Lady Roxana enjoys Sham's company, but the Earl is embarrassed by the incident. He sentences Sham, Agba, and Grimalkin to life in Wicken Fen, and they depart.\n\nTwo years later, the Earl's Chief Groom comes to see Agba and reveals that Lady Roxana gave birth to Sham's son Lath, who was left alone and untrained due to his skinniness. Lath, however, one day jumped a fence and outran some of the colts that the Earl was training, proving his worth.\n\nThe trio come back to Godolphin, and Sham is named the Godolphin Arabian. He has two more foals with Lady Roxana: Cade and Regulus. After the Earl reveals that he is near bankruptcy, they race Sham's sons at Newmarket. They win the races and the Queen's purse, and Agba contemplates his life with Sham.\n\nAs a footnote, it is revealed the Godolphin Arabian lived long and had many successful descendants. The Earl left his grave blank, and Agba returned to Morocco. After the Earl's death, the dates and name of the Godolphin Arabian are put on the grave, but time is slowly erasing the words.\n\nReception \n\n[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?resF50C16F63E59157A93C6A8178AD95F4C8485F9&scp\n5&sqking%20of%20the%20wind&st\ncse Reviewed by the New York Times].\nQuestion:\nIn the children’s book ‘King of the Wind’ by Marguerite henry, what is the name of the little golden Arabian stallion?\nAnswer:\nSham (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nJules Léotard\nJules Léotard (; 1 March 1838 - 17 August 1870) was a French acrobatic performer and aerialist who developed the art of trapeze.

Mojang's company headquarters is in Stockholm.  Microsoft acquired Mojang in 2014 at valuation of $2.5 billion. \n\n History \n\nIndependent era (2009-2014)\n\nFollowing a paid trip and employment offer from Valve Corporation in early September 2010, Markus Persson founded Mojang alongside his best friend Jakob Porsér, with Carl Manneh later brought in as a CEO, as Persson desired to run a self-made independent studio for the continued development of Minecraft.  Within a year, the company grew to a size of twelve employees, with their second video game, Scrolls, in development, as well as serving as the publisher of Cobalt.  In 2011, Napster founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker offered to invest in Mojang, but was declined.  By March 2012, the company had accumulated revenues of over $80 million. \n\nIn September 2012, Mojang began a partnership with United Nations Human Settlements Programme called \"Block by Block\", which entails having Minecraft players constructing sites in-game to use as a basis for assisted development of the village of Kibera in the Nairobi area of Kenya. \n\nMicrosoft subsidiary (2014-present) \n\nOn 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Mojang for $2.5 billion in a deal made official on 6 November 2014.  With their stakes in the company bought out, the three founders, Markus Persson, Carl Manneh and Jakob Porsér left the company. \n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that a major reason for acquiring Mojang was HoloLens. \n\nGames \n\nMini-games \n\nMojang began its tradition of developing smaller projects for the Humble Bundle Mojam with a shoot 'em up strategy game with steampunk and Ancient Egypt themes called Catacomb Snatch. 81,575 bundles were sold, raising US$458,248.99,  of which all proceeds were given to four charities and non-profit organizations, including  , Child's Play, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and American Red Cross. Both the genre and theme were picked by a survey on Mojang's website (combination of the highest and lowest voted of each).  The following year, three mini-games were simultaneously developed for the Humble Bundle Mojam 2. \n\nUnreleased games \n\nUntil July 2012, Mojang was co-developing a video game codenamed Rex Kwon Do alongside an undisclosed developer. Before the title had reached a significant stage of development, Mojang cancelled the collaboration, due to their lack of involvement and influence on the project. \n\nIn March 2012, Persson revealed that he would be designing a space sandbox game. Although Mojang teased with an April Fools' Day website based around Mars Effect (citing the Bethesda lawsuit), it was confirmed that the game was indeed in development, albeit with a different name.  On 4 April, Mojang revealed the game's title to be 0x10c, set in the year 281,474,976,712,644 AD of a parallel universe.  In April 2013, Persson announced that the game was shelved, due to a creative block. In August of that year, he claimed that the game was indefinitely postponed, with the incentive that other Mojang staff members could continue its production should they desire.\n\nBlock by Block project \n\nIn September 2012, Mojang began the Block by Block charity project in cooperation with UN-Habitat to create and design real-world environments in Minecraft.  The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see and involve them in urban planning. Using Minecraft, the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding that \"the three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat’s Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016\". Mojang signed Minecraft building community, FyreUK, to help render the environments into Minecraft. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi’s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The Block By Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, Mina Kvarter (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.  By 2016, 300 of the areas UN-Habitat plans to remodel will be recreated in Minecraft. \n\nLawsuits \n\nZeniMax Media v. Mojang AB \n\nZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, filed a lawsuit against Mojang on 27 September 2011, claiming that Mojang's planned trademark of the title, Scrolls, infringed upon Bethesda's trademark of The Elder Scrolls series.  On 18 October, Markus Persson announced that Mojang had won the interim injunction, but that Bethesda still had the option to file an appeal.  In March 2012, Mojang and Bethesda reached a settlement, in which Mojang would not trademark Scrolls, but Bethesda would not contest Mojang's naming of Scrolls, so long as it would not be a direct competitor against The Elder Scrolls.  During this time, Persson jokingly asked if Bethesda was willing to play a game of Quake 3 to settle the dispute. \n\nUniloc USA v. Mojang AB \n\nOn 20 July 2012, Uniloc filed a lawsuit against Mojang, citing the Minecraft - Pocket Edition as an infringement upon patents that give Uniloc exclusive rights to license checks on Android devices.  In response to an overwhelming amount of hate mail, Uniloc inventor Ric Richardson denied his own personal involvement, claiming to have only filed the patent and that the lawsuit against Mojang was not by his doing, although endorsed the security of the patent. \n\nAwards \n\n*March Developers' Showdown 2011\nQuestion:\nDeveloped by Swedish company Mojang, Minecraft is a popular?\nAnswer:\nBenefits of video games\n", "answers": ["Al-Istiwāʾīyah", "Istiwāʾīyyah", "Al-Istiwāʼīyah", "Nilotic Republic", "Al-Istiwaiyah", "Nile Republic", "Administrative divisions of South Sudan", "Janub as-Sudan", "Mark Nypoaj", "Equatorian Republic", "S.

This prevented him from playing wind instruments. It was also his excuse for giving up his priestly duties, although it did not prevent him from conducting and teaching.\n- The official cause of death was 'internal inflammation' which is rather vague and could mean any of a number of causes but was probably asthmatic bronchitis.\nLove life\n- Antonio was ordained as a catholic priest at the age of 26. This involves taking the vow of chastity. Although he gave up celebrating the Mass soon after ordination, he never renounced the priesthood, never married and remained a priest all his life.\n- Very little is known about his private life and people love to speculate. Most of his working life was involved with the girls of the Pietà orphanage for girls. There is no evidence of anything but a dedicated hard working highly productive and creative output.\n- The only 'scandal' was his attachment to the soprano Anna Giro who sang in his operas. She was 17 and he was 48 when they met. She and her sister Paolina accompanied him on his travels around Europe and they lived in his house. He insisted that they provided necessary care for him in his poor health and that there was no romantic involvement. The gossips obviously thought otherwise.\nGloria by 'Vivaldi's Women' in the Pietà church, Venice\nOne of the highlights of a stay in Venice when doing the 18th century Grand Tour was to go to the Pietà church and hear the girls singing in the choir.

The first book, The Bornless Keeper, appeared in 1974, quickly followed by Hazell plays Solomon the same year.\n\n\"Hazell plays Solomon\" was the first episode of the TV series. The wise-cracking private detective was played by Nicholas Ball. Hazell was a smart parody of earlier film-noir detectives such as Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade, the casting of Ball in the title role made for a younger TV Hazell than the printed Hazell.\n\nA Thames Television Network Production, Hazell ran for 22 one-hour-long episodes (50 minutes without adverts). Its theme music was composed by Andy Mackay; the end credits incorporated the theme music with added lyrics, written by Judy Forrest and sung by Maggie Bell. An academic work, Hazell: The Making of a TV Series by Manuel Alvarado and Edward Buscombe (BFI Publishing) appeared in March 1978.\n\nCast\n\nThe main and most frequent cast members were:\n*Nicholas Ball as James 'Jim' Hazell\n*Roddy McMillan as Detective Inspector 'Choc' Minty\n*Desmond McNamara as Cousin Tel\n*Peter Bourke as Graham Morris\n*Barbara Young as Dot Wilmington (Series 1 only)\n*Maggie Riley as Maureen (Series 1 only)\n\nEpisodes (by series) \n\n*Series 1\n**1. \"Hazell Plays Solomon\" (16 January 1978)\n**2. \"Hazell Pays a Debt\" (23 January 1978)\n**3. \"Hazell and the Walking Blur\" (30 January 1978)\n**4. \"Hazell Settles the Accounts\" (6 February 1978)\n**5. \"Hazell Meets the First Eleven\" (13 February 1978)\n**6. \"Hazell and the Rubber-Heel Brigade\" (20 February 1978)\n**7. \"Hazell Goes to the Dogs\" (27 February 1978)\n**8. \"Hazell and the Weekend Man\" (6 March 1978)\n**9. \"Hazell Works for Nothing\" (13 March 1978)\n**10. \"Hazell and the Maltese Vulture\" (20 March 1978)\n*Series 2\n**1. \"Hazell and the Baker Street Sleuth\" (19 April 1979)\n**2. \"Hazell and the Deptford Virgin\" (26 April 1979)\n**3. \"Hazell Bangs the Drum\" (3 May 1979)\n**4. \"Hazell Gets the Boot\" (10 May 1979)\n**5. \"Hazell Gets the Bird\" (17 May 1979)\n**6. \"Hazell and the Big Sleep\" (24 May 1979)\n**7.(*) \"Hazell and the Suffolk Ghost\" (31 May 1979)\n**8. \"Hazell and Hyde\" (7 June 1979)\n**9. \"Hazell and the Happy Couple\" (14 June 1979)\n**10. \"Hazell Gets the Part\" (21 June 1979)\n**11. \"Hazell and the Greasy Gunners\" (28 June 1979)\n**12.(*) \"Hazell and the Public Enemy\" (5 July 1979)\n\n(*) = Although broadcast as listed, continuity involving the destruction of Hazell's original Triumph Stag car and its replacement with a Jaguar Mark 2, indicates that episode 7 should have been twelfth, and episode 12 should have been ninth (after \"Hazell and the Happy Couple\", when the Stag is attacked by an angry client).\nQuestion:\nWhich former footballer and manager co-wrote the UK television series ‘Hazell’?\nAnswer:\nEl Tel\nPassage:\nChesterfield (cigarette)\nChesterfield is a brand of cigarette made by Altria. It was named for Chesterfield County, Virginia. It was one of the most recognized brands of the early and mid 20th century, but sales have declined steadily over the years. Chesterfields were originally produced by the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company. In 1999, Liggett sold the L&M, Lark and Chesterfield brands to Philip Morris Companies Inc. The brand is still being made today; it is still popular in Europe, but has been absent from U.S. advertising for many years.\n\nRadio & TV sponsorships\n\nIn the 1930s through the 1950s, Chesterfield sponsored popular radio programs. An early one was the radio series Music That Satisfies which was broadcast in 1932-1933. The Chesterfield Hour (1939–1944) featured big bands such as those of Paul Whiteman and Glenn Miller  and Fred Waring.  It was followed briefly by Johnny Mercer's Chesterfield Music Shop (1944) and then the Chesterfield Supper Club (1944-1949) which featured Perry Como and Jo Stafford with Peggy Lee replacing Stafford on some episodes beginning in 1948. Johnny Mercer originally wrote the pop standard song \"Dream (When You're Feeling Blue)\" as the theme song for his Chesterfield radio program; the theme for Como's Chesterfield Supper Club was the basis for \"Smoke Dreams\", covered by Jo Stafford, k.d. lang, and other artists.\n\nLiggett & Myers sponsored Dragnet, both on radio and on TV, during the 1950s. The 1954 theatrical version of Dragnet also had Chesterfield product placements, such as advertisements in scenes taking place at drug stores and news counters, or cigarette vending machines. Jack Webb as Sgt. Joe Friday was seen smoking Chesterfields in the movie and TV series. Also in the 1950s, Gunsmoke on both radio and TV was similarly sponsored primarily by Chesterfields and L&Ms. At the end of The Twilight Zone, for several seasons Rod Serling frequently smoked and promoted Chesterfields.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s Ronald Reagan, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, and Arthur Godfrey were among Chesterfield's official spokesmen, Chesterfield being one of the primary sponsors of the radio and TV programs of these stars during that time.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIan Fleming frequently makes references to different smoking products in his famous James Bond novels. The Chesterfield brand of cigarette are portrayed as one of Bond's favorites as seen in the 1959 book Goldfinger. In this novel, James Bond demands of Goldfinger's servant, \"Oddjob, I want a lot of food, quickly. And a bottle of bourbon, soda and ice. Also a carton of Chesterfields, king-size...\" \n\nLongtime college football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant smoked unfiltered Chesterfields, often two to three packs per day. The habit was the main contributing factor to his fatal heart attack in 1983 at age 69.\n\nIn Quentin Tarantino's 1992 movie Reservoir Dogs, Mr. White offers Mr. Pink a Chesterfield cigarette in an attempt to calm him. In another Tarantino-penned movie, 1993's True Romance, Clarence Worley's father, Clifford, smokes a Chesterfield before his execution at the hands of Blue Lou Boyle's consigliere,  Vincenzo Coccotti.\n\nIn Donald Fagen's 1982 title track of The Nightfly; \"I've got plenty of java and Chesterfield Kings\"\n\nIn Jack Clayton's 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby, Gatsby (Robert Redford) splits the last Chesterfield in his pack with Nick Carraway (Sam Waterston) while the two chat on Carraway's porch.\n\nIn the popular HBO TV series Boardwalk Empire, Agent Knox is seen giving three packs of Chesterfield cigarettes to Clayton.\n\nIn Jim Jarmusch's 1984 film Stranger Than Paradise the main characters smoke Chesterfields, at times discussing where they can purchase them.\n\nIn the Coen brothers 2001 The Man Who Wasn't There, a black and white neo-noir film set in 1949, the main character is an unfiltered Chesterfield chain smoker.\n\nHumphrey Bogart frequently appeared in Chesterfield advertisements. A scene from the movie To Have and Have Not (film) shows him with a pack of Chesterfields.\n\nIn the 2005 film Memoirs of a Geisha, after Pumpkin has immersed herself in World War II American soldier culture, she tells Sayuri that she only smokes Chesterfields anymore.\n\nThe 1992 Jawbreaker song \"Chesterfield King\" is named for the king-sized chesterfield. The song refers to the cigarette twice. First, the singer shares a chesterfield with a woman he meets in a parking lot. Later, at the end of the song, the singer gives a chesterfield king to the woman he has been singing about.\n\nJake Blues (John Belushi) smoked Chesterfield cigarettes in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers.  Near the end of the scene at Bob's Country Bunker, Jake is seen briefly flashing a flattened and nearly empty pack of Chesterfield cigarettes, pretending it is his musician's union ID card.\n\nThe Chesterfield Kings are a rock band named after the cigarette.\nQuestion:\nWhich brand of cigarettes did former US president Ronald Reagan advertise in the fifties?\nAnswer:\nChesterfields\nPassage:\nMycology\nMycology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans  as a source for tinder, medicine, food, and entheogens, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. A biologist specializing in mycology is called a mycologist.\n \nFrom mycology arose the field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, and the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of \"plant\" pathogens are fungi.\n\nHistorically, mycology was a branch of botany because, although fungi are evolutionarily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not recognized until a few decades ago. Pioneer mycologists included Elias Magnus Fries, Christian Hendrik Persoon, Anton de Bary, and Lewis David von Schweinitz.\n\nMany fungi produce toxins, antibiotics, and other secondary metabolites. For example, the cosmopolitan (worldwide) genus Fusarium and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by Abraham Joffe.\n\nFungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts, e.g. in the form of mycorrhizae, insect symbionts, and lichens.  Many fungi are able to break down complex organic biomolecules such as lignin, the more durable component of wood, and pollutants such as xenobiotics, petroleum, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global carbon cycle.\n\nFungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as oomycetes and myxomycetes (slime molds), often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals (such as histoplasmosis) as well as plants (such as Dutch elm disease and Rice blast).\n\nField meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as 'forays', after the first such meeting organized by the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club in 1868 and entitled \"A foray among the funguses\"[sic]. \n\nSome fungi can cause disease in humans or other organisms. The study of pathogenic fungi is referred to as medical mycology.\n\nHistory\n\nIt is presumed that humans started collecting mushrooms as food in Prehistoric times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of Euripides (480-406 B.C.). The Greek philosopher Theophrastos of Eressos (371-288 B.C.) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later Pliny the elder (23–79 A.D.), who wrote about truffles in his encyclopedia Naturalis historia. The word mycology comes  from the Greek: μύκης (mukēs), meaning \"fungus\" and the suffix  (-logia), meaning \"study\".\n\nThe Middle Ages saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. Rather, the invention of the printing press allowed some authors to disseminate superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors. \n\nThe start of the modern age of mycology begins with Pier Antonio Micheli's 1737 publication of Nova plantarum genera.  Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term mycology and the complementary mycologist were first used in 1836 by M.J. Berkeley. \n\nMedical mycology\n\nFor centuries, certain mushrooms have been documented as a folk medicine in China, Japan, and Russia.   Although the use of mushrooms in folk medicine is centered largely on the Asian continent, people in other parts of the world like the Middle East, Poland, and Belarus have been documented using mushrooms for medicinal purposes.    Certain mushrooms, especially polypores like Reishi were thought to be able to benefit a wide variety of health ailments.  Medicinal mushroom research in the United States is currently active, with studies taking place at City of Hope National Medical Center,   as well as the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center. \n\nCurrent research focuses on mushrooms that may have hypoglycemic activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-pathogenic activity, and immune system-enhancing activity.  Recent research has found that the oyster mushroom naturally contains the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, mushrooms produce large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light,  and that certain fungi may be a future source of taxol.  To date, penicillin, lovastatin, ciclosporin, griseofulvin, cephalosporin, ergometrine, and statins are the most famous pharmaceuticals that have been isolated from the fungi kingdom.\nQuestion:\nWhat does a mycologist study?\nAnswer:\nFungus kingdom\nPassage:\nAd libitum\nAd libitum is Latin for \"at one's pleasure\"; it is often shortened to \"ad lib\" (as an adjective or adverb) or \"ad-lib\" (as a verb or noun). The roughly synonymous phrase a bene placito (\"in accordance with [one's] good pleasure\") is less common but, in its Italian form a piacere, entered the musical lingua franca (see below).\n\nThe phrase \"at liberty\" is often associated mnemonically (because of the alliteration of the lib- syllable), although it is not the translation (there is no cognation between libitum and liber).  Libido is the etymologically closer cognate known in English.\n\n Music or rhythm\n\nAs a direction in sheet music, ad libitum indicates that the performer or conductor has one of a variety of types of discretion with respect to a given passage:\n*to play the passage in free time rather than in strict or \"metronomic\" tempo (a practice known as rubato when not expressly indicated by the composer);\n*to improvise a melodic line fitting the general structure prescribed by the passage's written notes or chords;\n*to omit an instrument part, such as a nonessential accompaniment, for the duration of the passage; or\n*in the phrase \"repeat ad libitum,\" to play the passage an arbitrary number of times (cf. vamp).\n\nNote that the direction a piacere (see above) has a more restricted meaning, generally referring to only the first two types of discretion. Baroque music, especially, has a written or implied ad libitum, with most composers intimating the freedom the performer and conductor have.\n\nFor post-Baroque classical music and jazz, see cadenza.\n\nBiology \n\nAd libitum is also used in psychology and biology to refer to the \"free-feeding\" weight of an animal, as opposed, for example, to the weight after a restricted diet or pair feeding. For example, \"The rat's ad libitum weight was about 320 g.\" In nutritional studies, this phrase denotes providing an animal free access to feed or water, thereby allowing the animal to self-regulate intake according to its biological needs. For example, \"Rats were given ad libitum access to food and water.\"\n\nIn biological field studies, it can also mean that information or data were obtained spontaneously without a specific method.\n\nMedical prescriptions may use the abbreviation ad lib. to indicate \"freely\" or that as much as one desires should be used. More common is pro re nata dosing, in which a drug is used only if needed and only up to some maximum amount.\n\nDrama\n\nAd-lib is used to describe individual moments during live theatre when an actor speaks through their character using words not found in the play's text. When the entire performance is predicated on spontaneous creation, the process is called improvisational theatre.\n\nIn film, the term ad-lib usually refers to the interpolation of unscripted material in an otherwise scripted performance. For example, in interviews, Dustin Hoffman says he ad-libbed the now famous line, \"I'm walking here! I'm walking here!\" as \"Ratso\" Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy.\n\nLive performers such as television talk-show hosts sometimes deliver material that sounds ad-libbed but is actually scripted. They may employ ad-lib writers to prepare such material.   Some actors are also known for their ability or tendency to ad-lib, such as Peter Falk (of the series Columbo), who would ad-lib such mannerisms as absent-mindedness while in character.\n\nThe HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm by Seinfeld co-creator Larry David primarily uses retroscripting and ad lib instead of scripted dialogue.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the Latin phrase ‘ad lib’ short for?\nAnswer:\nPause ad libitum\nPassage:\nCloud Club\nThe Cloud Club was a lunch club that occupied the 66th, 67th, and 68th floors of the Chrysler Building in New York City.

The club was only for men for several decades. In the 1950s and 1960s newer clubs opened, causing the attendance at the Cloud Club to decrease. In 1971 180 corporations supplied 300 members of the club. The club declined more as competition from other clubs increased and as companies moved offices to suburban areas. Texaco moved its employees to Westchester, New York in 1977, and the club closed in 1979.\n\nTishman Speyer, which took over the Chrysler Building in 1998 and refurbished it, leased the top two floors of the Cloud Club space to tenants.\n\nDesign\n\nWilliam Van Alen and Walter Chrysler had differing ideas of what the Cloud Club should be. The former had preferences for the modernist style while Chrysler had a preference for faux medieval and baronial styles. Charles McGrath of The New York Times wrote that the final design \"reflected a somewhat uneasy compromise\" between the men. Christopher Gray of The New York Times stated that the \"Cloud Club was a curious mix of historic and modern.\"\n\nComposition\n\nCharles McGrath of The New York Times stated that the space overall \"seems almost preposterously small by today's standards\" and because of all of the facilities inside it, its \"backstage\" areas \"must have felt like a submarine - or, rather, like a very cramped airship.\"\n\nThe 66th floor was the point of entry into the club. Cloud motifs were used in the entry area. The pilasters and friezes were in a neo-Classical style. The bathrooms and elevator surrounds used an Art Deco style. The flooring was made of pegged planks. This floor had a bar and grill room, done in an \"olde English\" style, which used leaded glass doors, wood beams, chandeliers of wrought-iron, and floors in pegged planks. It also had a Tudor-style lounge decorated in oak paneling in a mortise-and-tenon style.\n\nThe main dining room, on the 67th floor, was located on the club's south side and had a capacity of 30 people. The north wall had a mural of Manhattan. The room was decorated with etched glass sconces and granite columns. The room had a view of New York City. The vaulted ceiling, in a Cathedral style, had a cloud mural. McGrath described it as having \"a futuristic, Fritz Lang sort of look\". A Renaissance-style staircase in marble and bronze connected the dining room with the 66th floor.\n\nThe private dining room for Walter Chrysler was located on the 67th floor. It used black etched paneling, and included an etched frieze of automobile workers. This room had a view of Central Park. There was another private dining room that was for Texaco. It included a mural of an oil refinery, the Texaco logo, and a truck.McDowell, Edwin. \"Reviving High Life, 67 Floors Up; Chrysler Building Redoes the Cloud Club's Old Space.\" The New York Times.

The building was completely restored in order to house the Bargello National Museum, opened in 1865.\nCollections\nThe earlier museum was dedicated to Medieval applied arts: bronzes, majolicas, statues, coins, seals and medals. Donatello's year (1887-88) was the occasion to open the Hall of Renaissance Sculpture (today called \"of Donatello\") and between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the collection was further enlarged thanks to private donations and legacies (Carrand, Ressmann, Franchetti), with new ivories, enamels, arms and armours.\nToday, on the ground floor of the museum, the Hall of the 16th century Sculpture displays important works by Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Jacopo Sansovino and Giambologna.\nOn the first floor, a balcony (\"Verone\"), adorned with bronze animals by Giambologna, leads to the vast Audience Hall, which houses many masterpieces by Donatello, his assistants and Luca Della Robbia, along with the famous bronze reliefs cast by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi in competition for the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery. On the same floor are the Islamic Room, the Carrand Room, the Chapel of Mary Magdalene, the Room of Ivories, the Medieval Room and the Majolicas Room.\nOn the second floor are the rooms dedicated to Giovanni and Andrea della Robbia, displaying the well-known glazed terracotta works, the Room of the Arms, the Room of Small Bronzes, the Verrocchio Room (sculptures by Andrea del Verrocchio, Mino da Fiesole, Antonio Rossellino, Benedetto da Maiano) and the Room of Medals.\nMasterpieces\nBenvenuto Cellini, Mercurio, Danae with the child Perseus, Zeus, Athena, 1545-53\nBenvenuto Cellini, Bust of Cosimo I, 1545-47\nGiambologna, Flying Mercury, 1580\nDonatello, Bust of Niccolò da Uzzano, 1425-30\nDonatello, Atys-Amor\nFilippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti, Sacrifice of Isaac, 1401\nAndrea del Verrocchio , David, 1470 approx.\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Lady with posy, 1575-80\nQuestion:\nThe Uffizi and the Bargello are among the museums of art in which European city ?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nSargassum\nSargassum is a genus of brown (class Phaeophyceae) macroalgae (seaweed) in the order Fucales. Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. While most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, genus Sargassum appears to be an exception to this general rule.  Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic—reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycle. The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of sargassum. \n\nHistory\n\nSargassum was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea after a species of rock rose (Helianthemum) that grew in their water wells at home and that was called sargaço in Portuguese. \n\nThe Florida Keys and its smaller islands are well known for their high levels of Sargassum covering their shores. Gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although it was formerly thought to cover the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible, it has since been found to occur only in drifts. \n\nSargassum is also cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered Sargassum, either the species S. pallidum, or more rarely, hijiki, S. fusiforme, in doses of 0.5 gram, to be dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called \"hai zao\" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, where it is used to resolve \"heat phlegm.\" \n\nDescription \n\nSpecies of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches.  Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders which help keep the fronds afloat to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough sticky texture, which together with a robust but flexible body, helps it to withstand strong water currents.\n\nEcology \n\nThe thick masses of Sargassum provide an environment for a distinctive and specialised group of marine animals and plants, many of which are not found elsewhere.\n\nSargassum is commonly found in the beach drift near Sargassum beds where they are also known as gulfweed, a term also used to include all seaweed species washed up on shore.\n\nSargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.   In some cases (e.g., the Sargasso Sea) there are floating populations of Sargassum.\n\nIn tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins. \n\nSargassum muticum\n\nSargassum muticum is a large brown seaweed of the class Phaeophyceae.  It grows attached to rocks by a perennial holdfast up to 5 cm in diameter. From this holdfast the main axis grows to a maximum  of 5 cm high. The leaf-like laminae and primary lateral branches grow from this stipe. In warm waters it can grow to 12 m long, however in British waters it gives rise to a single main axis with secondary and tertiary branches which are shed annually. Numerous small 2–6 mm stalked air vesicles provide buoyancy. The reproductive receptacles are also stalked and develop in the axils of leafy laminae. It is self-fertile.\n\nDistribution\n\nSouth coast of England and several sites in the south of Ireland.\n\nSargassum adrift in Gulf Stream\n\n \n\nSargassum crisis in the Caribbean Sea\n\nIn the summer of 2015, large quantities of different species of Sargassum accumulated along the shores of many of the countries bathed by the Caribbean Sea. Some of the affected islands and regions include the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Barbados and Tobago  The aquatic plant washes ashore, piles up on beaches, and decays, often causing a foul odor. The affected countries and territories are discussing causes of the outbreak, potential solutions, and the negative affects on tourism.  Researchers say that the Sargassum outbreak started in 2011, but it has become worse over the years. There are several factors that could explain the proliferation of Sargassum in the area in recent years. These include the rise of sea temperature and the change of sea currents due to climate change. Also, nutriments from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater from the cities, that end up in the sea, could also make the algae bloom.\nQuestion:\nSargassum is what type of plant?\nAnswer:\nMacroalgal\nPassage:\nGaribaldi (Paris Métro)\nGaribaldi  is a station on line 13 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Saint-Ouen.\n\nThe station opened on 30 June 1952 when the line was extended from Porte de Saint-Ouen to Carrefour Pleyel. It is named after Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), Italian nationalist and leader of Italian unification.\n\nStation layout\nQuestion:\nA station on line 13 of the Paris Metro is named after which Italian nationalist (1807-1882)?\nAnswer:\nGaribaldi\nPassage:\nBéchamel sauce\nBéchamel sauce ( or;  ), also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk. Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nBéchamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by  François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier's Répertoire presents one recipe as: \"White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes.\" \n\nPreparation\n\nBéchamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nBéchamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Crème sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term \"white sauce\" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with béchamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman's Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of sauce is created by combining Bechamel sauce with grated cheese?\nAnswer:\nMornaysauce\n", "answers": ["UN/LOCODE:ITFLR", "Folrenz", "Firenze, Italy", "פירנצה", "Montughi", "Firenze", "Gualfonda", "FLORENCE", "Florentine", "Frorence", "Florence (Italy)", "Florence", "Florence, Italy"], "length": 1859, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bb1b9a7e2f3d5939ac44a1a69b414e4001c63b8c3d01f026"}

IU's measure the potency of a          drug, not its mass or weight.\nWhat countries besides the U.S. have not adopted the          metric system?\nMany U.S. teachers think the answer is \"Liberia and          Burma\" (make that Myanmar). Let's give Liberia and Myanmar a          break! All countries have adopted the metric system,          including the U.S., and most countries (but not the U.S.)          have taken steps to eliminate most uses of traditional          measurements. However, in nearly all countries people still          use traditional units sometimes, at least in colloquial          expressions. Becoming metric is not a one-time event that          has either happened or not. It is a process that happens          over time. Every country is somewhere in this process of          going metric, some much further along than others.\nCommentary and Explanation\nWire gauge table             (U.S./U.K.)\nIntroduction\nAmericans probably use a greater variety of units of measurement than anyone else in the world. Caught in a slow-moving transition from customary to metric units, we employ a fascinating and sometimes frustrating mixture of units in talking about the same things. We measure the length of a race in meters, but the length of the long jump event in feet and inches. We speak of an engine's power in horsepower and its displacement in liters. In the same dispatch, we describe a hurricane's wind speed in knots and its central pressure in millibars.\nFurthermore, our English customary units do not form a consistent system. Reflecting their diverse roots in Celtic, Roman, Saxon, and Norse cultures, they are often confusing and contradictory. There are two systems for land measurement (one based on the yard and the other on the rod) and a third system for distances at sea. There are two systems (avoirdupois and troy) for small weights and two more (based on the long and short tons) for large weights. Americans use two systems for volumes (one for dry commodities and one for liquids) and the British use a third (British Imperial Measure).\nMeanwhile, only a few Americans know that the legal definitions of the English customary units are actually based on metric units. The U. S. and British governments have agreed that a yard equals exactly 0.9144 meter and an avoirdupois pound equals exactly 0.453 592 37 kilograms. In this way, all the units of measurement Americans use every day are based on the standards of the metric system . Since 1875, in fact, the United States has subscribed to the International System of Weights and Measures , the official version of the metric system.\nThis dictionary began as a collection of notes describing the relationship between various English and metric units. It gradually grew until it finally became too large a word-processing document; I couldn't find my way around in it any more. So I turned it into a folder of html documents and added it to my Internet site. For many months, no one looked at the site except me and my students. Then, gradually, the dictionary began to attract users from around the world. Many users were kind enough to point out errors; others suggested additions and improvements. Questions about units began to appear in my email inbox. Sometimes I could answer the questions, sometimes not.\nToday the dictionary has become a kind of interactive resource. It grows slowly and steadily, mostly through suggestions from readers and my efforts to answer questions posed by readers. You can participate in this process! Please let me know if you find any errors on the site, or if you can't find what you wanted to know, or if you know of units used in your field of study or in your part of the world that aren't included.\nI hope you find the dictionary useful and informative.\nFormalities\nUniversity of North Carolina at    Chapel Hill .\nYou are welcome to email the author (rowlett@email.unc.edu) with comments and suggestions.\nAll material in this folder is copyright &COPY; 2005 by Russ Rowlett and the    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Cream is sometimes used as well. It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and sauces (notably, beef Wellington) or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savory tart. \n\nDuxelles is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild porcini mushrooms will be much stronger flavored than that made with white or brown mushrooms.\n\nDuxelles is said to have been created by the 17th-century French chef François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678) and to have been named after his employer, Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles, maréchal de France.\n\nMany classical cookbooks define duxelles as dehydrated fungi, used as stuffings and pastry fillings. According to Auguste Escoffier (1847–1935), a world-renowned French chef regarded as the father of classical cuisine, the mushrooms were dehydrated in order to enhance flavor and minimize water content.  When fresh mushrooms are cooked, they let off enormous amounts of vapor in relation to their size.  Fresh mushrooms used as stuffings or pastry fillings could therefore build up pressure inside the dish or pastry, causing it to crack or even explode.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient of Duxelles sauce or Duxelles stuffing?\nAnswer:\nPsychoactive mushroom\nPassage:\nRear of the Year\nRear of the Year is a light-hearted British award for celebrities who are considered to have a notable posterior. It was created by publicity consultant Anthony Edwards  and is organised by Rear of the Year Limited. It was for several years awarded to women only; now it is usually awarded to one woman and one man. Bookmakers are never supplied with a list of contenders, so their suppositions about the outcome are pure conjecture.\n\nHistory\n\nBarbara Windsor won the first award in 1976, presented as a one-off accolade. Five years later it became an annual event with Felicity Kendal taking away the honours. In 1986 the award was presented to a man for the first time (Michael Barrymore) and 1991 saw Marina Ogilvy, the daughter of Princess Alexandra, became the first royal recipient. From 1997 the awards have been presented annually to both sexes.\n\nThe event, staged for the past few years at London's Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, attracts major national and international press publicity valued at circa £4.5 million. In 2012, Organiser Tony Edwards declared that female rears were starting to slim down as more women took to the gym, jogging, and keeping in trim in this Olympic year.\n\nIn 2014, Carol Vorderman became the first person to receive the award for a second time.\n\nWinners\n\n*1976 — Barbara Windsor\n*1981 — Felicity Kendal\n*1982 — Suzi Quatro\n*1983 — Lulu\n*1984 — Elaine Paige\n*1985 — Lynsey De Paul\n*1986 — Anneka Rice and Michael Barrymore\n*1987 — Anita Dobson\n*1988 — Su Pollard\n*1989 — No competition\n*1990 — No competition\n*1991 — Marina Ogilvy\n*1992 — Ulrika Jonsson\n*1993 — Sarah Lancashire\n*1994 — Mandy Smith and Richard Fairbrass\n*1995 — No competition\n*1996 — Tracy Shaw\n*1997 — Melinda Messenger and Gary Barlow\n*1998 — Carol Smillie and Frank Skinner\n*1999 — Denise van Outen and Robbie Williams\n*2000 — Jane Danson and Graham Norton\n*2001 — Claire Sweeney and John Altman\n*2002 — Charlotte Church and Scott Wright\n*2003 — Natasha Hamilton and Ronan Keating\n*2004 — Alex Best and Aled Haydn Jones\n*2005 — Nell McAndrew and Will Young\n*2006 — Javine Hylton and Ian Wright\n*2007 — Siân Lloyd and Lee Mead\n*2008 — Jennifer Ellison and Ryan Thomas\n*2009 — Rachel Stevens and Russell Watson\n*2010 — Fiona Bruce and Ricky Whittle\n*2011 — Carol Vorderman and Anton Du Beke\n*2012 — Shobna Gulati and John Barrowman\n*2013 — Flavia Cacace and Vincent Simone\n*2014 — Carol Vorderman and Olly Murs\n*2015 — Kym Marsh and Daniel Radcliffe\n*2016 — Jennifer Metcalfe and Tom Hiddleston\nQuestion:\n\"Which TV presenter was the first to win the coveted \"\"Rear of the Year\"\" for a second time in 2014\"\nAnswer:\nCarol Vorderman\n", "answers": ["English inch", "Inch (unit)", "International inch", "Decimal inch", "U.S. survey inch", "Inches", "Ynch", "㏌", "Scottish inch", "Decimal Inch", "Inch (Scottish length)", "Inch", "Inch (length)", "Inch (Scots)", "Scots inch", "In (unit)"], "length": 1606, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ee44b5deec1b77320d472c5592779c5910f5c6ab1d53de0e"}

Kim Wilde has earned her net worth with her recordings, song compositions and as the author of two books on landscaping entitled \"Gardening with Children\" and \"The First-Time Gardner\" as well as her advertising jobs for health food shop \"Holland and Barrett\" and green kitchens for \"Magnet.\" Wilde's first single was released in the UK and hit the number 2 best singles list. The song was written by her father Marty Wilde and her brother Ricky Wilde. In 1980 Kim Wilde signed a contract with RAK Record Company and in 1981 released her first album \"Kim Wilde\" which was also successful. After that she preceded to have several hit singles and albums. Her first big hit in the U.S. was \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" which was originally recorded by the Motown group The Supremes.  Wilde left RAK and signed with MCA in 1984. In 1986 Wilde wrote and co-wrote most of the songs on her album \"Another Step\" and with her rendition of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" (the second single on the album) she gained recognition in the United States with the song hitting number one in 1987. Wilde has had several hit singles and albums in Belgium, UK, France, Germany, Australia, the U.S. and other countries as well. She has also made a name for herself in the landscaping business with offers to design for the program \"Better Gardens\" and had a two year contract with \"Garden Invaders,\" a BBC series. Wilde was given the birth name of Kim Smith and was born in Chiswick, Middlesex, England in 1960. Her parents were Marty Wilde (a 50's rock and roll singer whose given name was Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker (belonged to singing and dance group The Vernons.) Kim Wilde attended Oakfield Preparatory School in Dulwich, Tewin in Hertfordshire and Presdales School in Ware. She also went to St. Albans College of Art and Design.  She has two brothers, Ricky and Marty Jr. and one sister, Roxanne.  Ricky and Roxanne are involved in the music industry and brother, Marty Jr. is a landscape gardener. Kim Wilde married Hal Fowler and has two children together, Harry Tristan and Rose Elisabeth.\nKim Wilde (born Kim Smith, 18 November 1960) is an English pop singer, author and television presenter who burst onto the music scene in 1981 with the number 2 UK Singles Chart New Wave classic \"Kids in America\". In 1983, Wilde received the Brit Award for Best British Female. In 1987 she had a major hit in the US when her version of The Supremes' classic \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" topped the charts. Starting in 1998, while still active in music, she has branched into an alternative career as a landscape gardener.\nThe eldest child of 1950s rock 'n' roller Marty Wilde (birth name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, who was earlier a member of the singing and dancing group The Vernons Girls, Kim Smith was born in the West London suburb of Chiswick and attended Oakfield Preparatory School, in the Southeast London area of Dulwich. When she was nine, the family moved to Hertfordshire, where she was educated at Tewin and later Presdales School in Ware. In 1980, at age 20, she completed a foundation course at St Albans College of Art & Design and, as Kim Wilde, was signed to RAK Records by Mickie Most.\nWilde released her debut single \"Kids in America\" in January 1981. An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia. Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde's signature song. Her debut album Kim Wilde repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in \"Chequered Love\" (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single \"Water on Glass\".

A normal person or animal of similar size takes in roughly 1 to 2 liters of dietary fluid every day.  On top of that, another 6 to 7 liters of fluid is received by the small intestine daily as secretions from salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, liver and the small intestine itself.\nBy the time the ingesta enters the large intestine, approximately 80% of this fluid has been absorbed. Net movement of water across cell membranes always occurs by osmosis , and the fundamental concept needed to understand absorption in the small gut is that there is a tight coupling between water and solute absorption. Another way of saying this is that absorption of water is absolutely dependent on absorption of solutes, particularly sodium:\nSodium is absorbed into the cell by several mechanisms, but chief among them is by cotransport with glucose and amino acids - this means that efficient sodium absorption is dependent on absorption of these organic solutes.\nAbsorbed sodium is rapidly exported from the cell via sodium pumps - when a lot of sodium is entering the cell, a lot of sodium is pumped out of the cell, which establishes a high osmolarity in the small intercellular spaces between adjacent enterocytes.\nWater diffuses in response to the osmotic gradient established by sodium - in this case into the intercellular space.  It seems that the bulk of the water absorption is transcellular, but some also diffuses through the tight junctions.\nWater, as well as sodium, then diffuses into capillary blood within the villus.\nExamine the animation above and consider the osmotic gradient between the lumen and the intercellular space (inside the villus).  As sodium (green balls) is rapidly pumped out of the cell, it achieves very high concentration in the narrow space between enterocytes.  The osmotic gradient is thus formed across apical cell membranes and their connecting junctional complexes.  The arrow that appears denotes movement of water across the epithelium.\nWater is thus absorbed into the intercellular space by diffusion down an osmotic gradient.  However, looking at the process as a whole, transport of water from lumen to blood is often against an osmotic gradient - this is important because it means that the intestine can absorb water into blood even when the osmolarity in the lumen is higher than osmolarity of blood.\nThis ability is best explained by the \" three compartment model \" for absorption of water and, like many aspects of gut permeability, varies along the length of the gut.  The proximal small intestine functions as a highly permeable mixing segment, and absorption of water is basically isotonic.  That is, water is not absorbed until the ingesta has been diluted out to just above the osmolarity of blood.  The ileum and especially the colon are able to absorb water against an osmotic gradient of several hundred milliosmols.\nQuestion:\nWhich part of the gut absorbs water from thje food?\nAnswer:\nColon (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nWilkins Micawber\nWilkins Micawber is a fictional character from Charles Dickens's 1850 novel, David Copperfield.  He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands.\n\nMicawber's long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms.  She lives by the maxims, \"I will never desert Mr. Micawber!\" and \"Experientia does it!\" (from Experientia docet, \"One learns by experience.\")\n \nMicawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber's debts arise from dishonesty.  But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.\n\nIn Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.\n\nPopular culture\n\nMicawber is known for asserting his faith that \"something will turn up\".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:\n\n\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery.\" - (Chapter 12)\n\n[The amounts quoted are equivalent to £20, £19 97½p and £20 2½p, in the United Kingdom's present, decimal, currency.]\n\nThe character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.\n\nKeith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) \"Micawber\". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, \"There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.\"\n\nIn addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that \"would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough.\" (quotations and citations omitted).\n\nEntry into general English\n\nThe character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun \"Micawber\" and the adjectives \"Micawberish\" and \"Micawberesque\". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as \"one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune\".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as \"pure Micawberism\". \n\nQuotations\n\nBesides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:\n* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)\n* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)\n* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)\n* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, \"FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY.\" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.\n* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary!

In the 14th century King Edward III (1327–1377) commanded that his Lord Chancellor whilst in council should sit on a wool bale, now known as \"The Woolsack\", in order to symbolise the central nature and huge importance of the wool trade to the economy of England in the Middle Ages.  Indeed, it was largely to protect the vital English wool trade routes with continental Europe that the Battle of Crécy was fought with the French in 1346. From the Middle Ages until 2006, the presiding officer in the House of Lords was the Lord Chancellor and the Woolsack was usually mentioned in  association with the office of Lord Chancellor. In July 2006, the function of Lord Speaker was split from that of Lord Chancellor pursuant to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.\n\nThe Woolsack is a large, wool-stuffed cushion or seat covered with red cloth; it has neither a back nor arms, though in the centre of the Woolsack there is a back-rest. The Lords' Mace is placed on the rear part of the Woolsack.\n\nIn 1938, it was discovered that the Woolsack was, in fact, stuffed with horsehair. When the Woolsack was remade  it was re-stuffed with wool from all over the Commonwealth as a symbol of unity.\n\nThe Lord Speaker may speak from the Woolsack when speaking in his or her capacity as Speaker of the House, but must, if he or she seeks to debate, deliver his or her remarks either from the left side of the Woolsack, or from the normal seats of the Lords.\n\nIf a Deputy Speaker presides in the absence of the Lord Speaker, then that individual uses the Woolsack. However, when the House meets in the \"Committee of the Whole\", the Woolsack remains unoccupied, and the presiding officer, the Chairman or Deputy Chairman, occupies a Chair at the front of the table of the House.\n\nIn front of the Woolsack is an even larger cushion known as the Judges' Woolsack. - Plan of the chamber including  location of Judges Woolsack During the State Opening of Parliament, the Judges' Woolsack was historically occupied by the Law Lords. Now the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Family Division, the Vice-Chancellor, Justices of the Supreme Court, the Lords Justices of Appeal and the Justices of the High Court only attend Parliament for the State Opening.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nThe person holding what office sits on the Woolsack in the House of Lords?\nAnswer:\nThe Lord Speaker\nPassage:\nIrish Grand National\n|}\n\nThe Irish Grand National is a National Hunt steeplechase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Fairyhouse over a distance of about 3 miles and 5 furlongs (5,834 metres), and during its running there are twenty-four fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year on Easter Monday.\n\nIt is the Irish equivalent of the Grand National, and it is held during Fairyhouse's Easter Festival meeting.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1870, and the inaugural running was won by a horse called Sir Robert Peel. The race took place at its present venue, and the winner's prize money was 167 sovereigns. In the early part of its history it was often won by horses trained at the Curragh, and there were ten such winners by 1882. The Easter Monday fixture regularly attracted racegoers from Dublin, and it became known as the Dubs' Day Out. \n\nSeveral winners of the Irish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at Aintree, but none in the same year. The first to complete the double was Ascetic's Silver, the winner of the latter version in 1906. The feat has been achieved more recently by Rhyme 'n' Reason, Bobbyjo and Numbersixvalverde. The most successful horse in the event's history is Brown Lad, a three-time winner in the 1970s.\n\nSince 1991, the distance of the race has been 3 miles and 5 furlongs; previously it had been 3 miles and 4 furlongs.\n\nThe Irish Grand National was sponsored by Irish Distillers under various titles for many years up to 2010.  Ladbrokes sponsored the race from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, Boylesports took over as Irish Grand National sponsor and appointed the jockey Barry Geraghty as the first ever ambassador for the race, promoting the race through various channels, including social media.  \n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse (3 wins):\n* Brown Lad – 1975, 1976, 1978\n\nLeading jockey (6 wins):\n* Pat Taaffe – Royal Approach (1954), Umm (1955), Zonda (1959), Fortria (1961), Arkle (1964), Flyingbolt (1966)\n\nLeading trainer (10 wins):\n* Tom Dreaper – Prince Regent (1942), Shagreen (1949), Royal Approach (1954), Olympia (1960), Fortria (1961), Kerforo (1962), Last Link (1963), Arkle (1964), Splash (1965), Flyingbolt (1966)\n\nA Unique Racing Record - Only Owner to complete the Derby and Grand National Double\n \n* William Brophy, Herbertstown House, Two-Mile-House, Naas, Co.

{"input": "Passage:\nSaint George and the Dragon (Raphael)\nSt. George and the Dragon is a small cabinet painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, painted between 1504 and 1506, and now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter, reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, by King Henry VII of England. The first word of the order's motto, \"HONI\" can be made out.  The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot, or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.\n\nThe traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon, combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero, or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre, and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London.\n\nProvenance\n\nBy 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire. Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England.  After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in  London on 19 December 1651.  Soon after it was in France. The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772. For a century and a half, the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum. It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars. In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, and bought by Andrew Mellon, as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. This and other foundational artworks, including paintings by Jan van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, and Titian, helped place the National Gallery among the most significant collections of Renaissance art.\nQuestion:\nThe paintings entitled 'St. George and the Dragon' and 'Madonna with the Fish' are works by which Florentine master?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCategory:Flags with three vertical stripes, one white, two red\nCategory:Flags with three vertical stripes, one white, two red - Wikimedia Commons\nCategory:Flags with three vertical stripes, one white, two red\nFrom Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository\nThis category has the following 2 subcategories, out of 2 total.\nN\n► National flag of Canada ‎ (3 C,  34 F)\nP\n► National flag of Peru ‎ (2 C,  12 F)\nMedia in category \"Flags with three vertical stripes, one white, two red\"\nThe following 75 files are in this category, out of 75 total.\nQuestion:\nWhich country's flag consists of 3 vertical stripes of red, white and red?\nAnswer:\nLower Peru\nPassage:\nRoad to Emmaus appearance\nThe Road to Emmaus appearance is one of the early resurrection appearances of Jesus after his crucifixion and the discovery of the empty tomb.    Both the Meeting on the road to Emmaus and the subsequent Supper at Emmaus, depicting the meal that Jesus had with two disciples after the encounter on the road, have been popular subjects in art.\n\nBiblical accounts\n\nThe Gospel of  describes the encounter on the road and the supper at Emmaus, and states that a disciple named Cleopas was walking towards Emmaus with another disciple when they met Jesus. They did not recognize him, and discussed their sadness at recent events with him. They persuaded him to come and eat with them, and in the course of the meal they recognized him.\n\nThe Gospel of  has a similar account that describes the appearance of Jesus to two disciples while they were walking in the country, at about the same time in the Gospel narrative,  although it does not name the disciples or the destination as Emmaus:\n\nAfterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country. These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either. \n\nThe Gospel of Luke states that Jesus stayed and had supper with the two disciples after the encounter on the road:\n\nAs they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them.\n \n\nThe detailed narration of this episode is considered by some as one of the best sketches of a biblical scene in the Gospel of Luke.  In this account, Jesus appears to Cleopas and one other disciple, but \"their eyes were holden\" at first so that they could not recognize him. Later \"in the breaking of bread\", \"their eyes were opened\" and they recognized him. B. P. Robinson argues that this means that the recognition occurred in the course of the meal,  but Raymond Blacketer notes that \"many, perhaps even most, commentators, ancient and modern and in-between, have seen the revelation of Jesus' identity in the breaking of bread as having some kind of eucharistic referent or implication.\" \n\nIn art\n\nBoth the encounter on the road and the ensuing supper have been depicted in art, but the supper has received more attention.  Medieval art tends to show a moment before Jesus is recognized; Christ wears a large floppy hat to help explain the initial lack of recognition by the disciples. This is often a large pilgrim's hat with badges or, rarely, a Jewish hat.  However, the depiction of the supper has been a more popular theme, at least since the Renaissance, showing Jesus eating with the disciples.  Often the moment of recognition is shown.\n\nRembrandt's 1648 depiction of the Supper builds on the etching that he did six years earlier, in which the disciple on the left had risen, hands clasped in prayer. In both depictions, the disciples are startled and in awe but not in fear. The servant is oblivious to the theophanic moment taking place during the supper. \n\nCaravaggio's painting in London and his painting in Milan were six years apart, and both imitate natural color very well, but both were criticized for lack of decorum. Caravaggio depicted Jesus without a beard, and the London painting shows fruits on the table that are out of season. Moreover, the inn keeper is shown serving with a hat. \n\nSome other artists who have portrayed the Supper are Jacopo Bassano, Pontormo, Vittore Carpaccio, Philippe de Champaigne, Albrecht Dürer, Benedetto Gennari, Jacob Jordaens, Marco Marziale, Pedro Orrente, Tintoretto, Titian, Velázquez, and Paolo Veronese. The supper was also the subject of one of Han van Meegeren's most successful Vermeer forgeries.\n\nIn literary art, the Emmaus theme is treated as early as the 12th century by Durham poet Laurentius in a semidramatic Latin poem. \n\nGallery of art\n\nFile:Momo Chiesa SS Trinità Discepoli Emmaus.jpg|Oratory in Novara, 15th century\nFile:Momo Chiesa SS Trinità Cena in Emmaus.jpg|Supper at Emmaus, 15th century\nFile:Vincenzo Catena 014.jpg|Vincenzo Catena\nFile:Salon de Mercure-LE SOUPER A EMMAUS.jpg|Titian, 1535, Louvre\nFile:Lelio Orsi Camino de Emaús.jpg|The Meeting, by Lelio Orsi, 1560–65\nFile:Bruegel Jesus and the Disciples on the Road to Emmaus 1571.jpg|after Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 1571\nFile:Caravaggio - Cena in Emmaus.jpg|Caravaggio, 1601, London\nFile:CaravaggioEmmaus.jpg|Caravaggio, 1606, Milan\nFile:La cena de Emaús, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|Diego Velázquez, 1620, New York\nFile:Apparition du Christ aux pélerins d’Emmaüs by Laurent de La Hyre.jpg|Laurent de La Hyre, 1656\nFile:Bloemaert Emmaus.jpg|Abraham Bloemaert\nFile:Joseph von Führich 001.jpg|Joseph von Führich, 1837\nFile:Jungshoved Kirke - altertavlen.jpg|Bertel Thorvaldsen, 1840s\nFile:Zünd Gang nach Emmaus 1877.jpg|Robert Zünd, 1877\n\nJungian Perspective\n\nCarl Jung regarded the road to Emmaus appearance as an instance of the mythological theme of the magical traveling companion that still appears spontaneously in dreams today.\nQuestion:\nOn view in London's National Gallery, the work The Supper at Emmaus is the work of which painter?\nAnswer:\nMorigi, Michaelangelo (Caravaggio)\nPassage:\ngeometry - How to find the parametric equation of a ...\ngeometry - How to find the parametric equation of a cycloid? - Mathematics Stack Exchange\nHow to find the parametric equation of a cycloid?\nup vote 11 down vote favorite\n1\n\"A cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as the wheel rolls along a straight line.\" - Wikipedia\nIn many calculus books I have, the cycloid, in parametric form, is used in examples to find arc length of parametric equations.

Since the wheel is rolling, the distance it has rolled is the distance along the circumference of the wheel from your point to the \"down\" position, which (since the wheel has radius $r$) is $rt$.  So the centre of the wheel, which was initially at $(0,r)$, is now at $(rt,r)$.  Your point is displaced from this by $-r\\sin(t)$ horizontally and $-r\\cos(t)$ vertically, so it is at $(rt - r\\sin(t), r - r\\cos(t))$.\nup vote 2 down vote\nThe center of the circle moves along a horizontal line at constant velocity.  If we want the cusps to be at $y=0$, that means the center should be $(x_c,y_c)=(rt,r)$.  Then  we add on the location of the point on the rim relative to the center.  This will be something like $(r\\cos t, r\\sin t)$ but we still need to get the phase right.  If we start with the point on the rim at $(0,0)$ at $t=0$ the rim point is at an angle of $\\frac {-\\pi}2$ at $t=0$, that is, pointing straight down.  A little fiddling with the phases gets the expression you quote.  The scale between the center motion and rotation is set by the requirement that there be no slippage, which means the velocity of the point on the road must be $0$.\nhttp://www.marystarhigh.com/apps/download/7vb7ETI4n4RtLFWDnZw0xNfQRUSB1swoBHQpP7i1l9pXZS1Y.pdf/Precalculus%20Book.pdf\nYou should go to the page before reading on and while reading the rest of the post.\nIn it, it explains everything very coherently and breaks down the derivation into 4 steps: finding an equation for the location of the center of the circle (x and y coordinates), and then finding the equation for the point P in in reference to the center.\nWe will start off by trying to find where the center of the circle is at angle $\\theta$. The x coordinate is going to be equal to the distance traveled, which is the same thing as the length of the sector of the circle we have already covered. The sector is equal to the radius times the central angle, so the center will be at $x = a \\theta$\nThe y coordinate of the center at any time is really easy because the center is always the height of the radius, which is $a$. Therefore, the center is at coordinates $(a\\theta, a)$ at angle $\\theta$.\nNow, let's try and find the location of point P in reference to the center. We will start with the x coordinate.\nAt angle $\\theta$, P will start by lagging behind, then jumping ahead, then going back to where it started. Therefore, we want to start by subtracting $0a$, then $1a$, then $0a$, then -$1a$, then going back to $0$ again. This behavior is exhibited by $a \\sin \\theta$, so our x coordinate is now complete: $x = a\\theta - a \\sin \\theta = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta)$\nNow for the y coordinate. To get the height of point P at angle $\\theta$, we notice that it starts out below the center, then goes above the center, then back below. Therefore, we want to subtract $1a$, then $0a$, then $-1a$ (add $1a$), then go back to $0a$ again. The pattern of $(1, 0, -1, 0, 1)$ is exhibited by $a \\cos \\theta$, so we want to subtract this from the center, giving us $y = a - a \\cos \\theta$ , or $y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$.\nNow, we are done. Our two equations are $$x = a(\\theta - \\sin \\theta)$$ $$y = a(1 - \\cos \\theta)$$.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the type of curve traced by a point on a rolling wheel?\nAnswer:\nCycloidal\nPassage:\nNuits-Saint-Georges\nNuits-Saint-Georges is a commune in the arrondissement of Beaune of the Côte-d'Or department in eastern France.

It is a festival that celebrates the wine of a different Burgundian village each year.[http://www.saint-vincent-nuits.fr/ Saint-Vincent tournante des Nuits-Saint-Georges 2007]\n\nStone\n\nThe local marble is a sedimentary rock, a limestone, that is not susceptible to frost damage. It is fine-grained and capable of accepting a polish. There is a vein of this stone, called popularly \"the Comblanchien\" and extending from Nuits-Saint-Georges to Nevers, which has made the reputations of the quarries of the region. The stone will harmonize with any style by virtue of the variety of its shades of colour, the pink of bindweed (Convolvulus) and beige, and its grain.\n\nHistory\n\nThe town owes much to the economic development arising from Cistercian enterprise.

{"input": "Passage:\nFlemington Racecourse\nFlemington Racecourse is a major horse racing venue located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  It is most notable for hosting the Melbourne Cup, which is Australia's richest horse race.  The racecourse is situated on low alluvial flats, next to the Maribyrnong River.  The area was first used for horse racing in March 1840.\n\nOverview \n\nThe Flemington Racecourse site comprises 1.27 square kilometres of Crown land.  The course was originally leased to the Victoria Turf Club in 1848, which  merged with the Victoria Jockey Club in 1864 to form the Victoria Racing Club.  The first Melbourne Cup was run in 1861.  In 1871 the Victoria Racing Club Act was passed, giving the VRC legal control over Flemington Racecourse.\n\nThe racecourse is shaped not unlike a pear, and boasts a six-furlong (1,200 m) straight known as 'the Straight Six.'  The track has a circumference of 2,312 metres and a final straight of 450 metres for race distances over 1,200 metres.  Races are run in an anti-clockwise direction.\n\nThe course has a crowd capacity of over 120,000 and contains three grandstands.  The biggest ever attendance was on VRC Derby Day in 2006 when 129,089 people saw Efficient win the VRC Derby.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/100000-and-more-8212-but-nobodys-counting/2006/11/06/1162661617906.html 100,000 and more — but nobody's counting] The racecourse has undergone a facelift in recent years, with the opening of a new $45 million grandstand in 2000.  It also contains a bronze statue of the famous racehorse Phar Lap, which was donated to the Club as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations in 1988.  The Hill Stand, built in 1977, houses the artist Harold Freedman's seven panel mural which traces the History of Racing.  The work was commissioned to mark the Australian bicentenary in 1988.\n\nFlemington Racecourse was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 7 November 2006,  announced during the 2006 Melbourne Cup. \n\nThe site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\nFlemington Racecourse today hosts many of Australia's top races, including the Melbourne Cup, VRC Derby, VRC Oaks, MacKinnon Stakes, Newmarket Handicap, Australian Cup and Lightning Stakes.\n\nTransport \n\nThe site has its own railway branch line, which operates on race days, bringing visitors to the adjacent railway station.  Originally, it was serviced by Salt Water River station, before that was demolished in the 1860s and replaced with a station on the present site.  Trains depart from platforms 8 and 9 at Flinders Street Station.\nThe No. 57 tram from the City (Elizabeth and Flinders Streets) stops at the Epsom Road entrance.\n\nCar spaces for the disabled are available and taxi ranks are located adjacent to the main entrances.\nShuttle buses run from Epsom Road to the main turnstiles of the racecourse.\nLift access is available in the Prince of Wales Stand and to the first floor of the Members Stand.\n\nRaces \n\nThe following is a list of Group races which are run at Flemington Racecourse. \n\nKey\n\n* hcp - handicap\n* qlty - quality handicap\n* sw - set weights\n* sw+p - set weights with penalties\n* wfa - Weight for Age\n\nGallery\nQuestion:\nFlemington, Greyville, and Longchamp are associated with what, respectively in Australia, South Africa, and France?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nWhat a Year\nWhat a Year was an Australian television documentary series, hosted by former ACA host Mike Munro and supermodel Megan Gale in 2006 and Bert Newton and Julia Zemiro in 2007. What a Year looked at the news, events, sporting achievements, entertainment and fads of a selected year in each episode. The hosts spoke to people who witnessed and experienced the particular events first-hand.\n\nHistory\n\nMike Munro and Megan Gale presented the 2006 series. They successfully hosted nine episodes and it attracted a lot of viewers. In 2007, Gale and Munro's show contracts expired, so Newton and Zemiro replaced them as presenters. However, it was cancelled by the Nine Network after coming last place in the nightly ratings on 6 August 2007 due to the big win for Channel Seven..\n\nIn a November issue of a TV Week magazine in 2007, Munro claimed he and Gale left the show because the programmers wanted to lighten up the show and make it more fun. Munro explained that he disliked wearing fashionable clothes for that era. But Newton loved wearing them, so he was hired instead of Munro.\n\nThe episodes that remained unaired after the show's axing were broadcast by Channel Nine over the summer non-ratings period, beginning the unaired episodes on 27 December 2007.

He appeared in more than 90 films over 20 years with his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and a pair of six-shooters.\n\nBiography\n\nMaynard was born in Vevay, Indiana, one of five children, another of whom, his lookalike younger brother, Kermit, would also become an actor; most audience members assumed that Kermit was his brother's identical twin. Ken Maynard began working at carnivals and circuses, where he became an accomplished horseman. As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.\n\nMaynard served in the United States Army during World War I. After the war, Maynard returned to show business as a circus rider with Ringling Brothers. When the circus was playing in Los Angeles, California, actor Buck Jones encouraged Maynard to try working in the movies. Maynard soon had a contract with Fox Studios.Phillips, Robert W. Singing Cowboy Stars. Salt Lake City: Gibbs-Smith, 1994. pp 14-16.\n\nHe first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 as a stuntman or supporting actor. In 1924 he began working in western features, where his horsemanship and rugged good looks made him a cowboy star. Maynard's silent features showcased his daredevil riding, photographed fairly close so audiences could see that Maynard was doing his own stunts with his white stallion \"Tarzan.\" The action scenes were so spectacular that they were often reused in films of the 1930s, starring either Maynard himself or John Wayne, or Dick Foran. (Wayne, and later Foran, starred in westerns for Warner Bros. and were costumed like Maynard to match the old footage.)\n\nMaynard made a successful transition to talking pictures and became the movies' first singing cowboy (a 1929 \"Voice of Hollywood\" short has Maynard singing \"Drunken Hiccoughs\" in a wailing tenor). He recorded two songs for Columbia Records, \"The Lone Star Trail\" and \"The Cowboy's Lament.\"\n\nMaynard's first talkies were made for Universal Pictures. His reckless screen personality spilled over into his private life, with alcoholism and high living resulting in production delays and temper tantrums on the set. This made Maynard a problem employee, and he was released from Universal after one year. Other independent producers took a chance on the hotheaded star -- among them Tiffany Productions and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures  -- before he returned to Universal in 1933. Maynard played several musical instruments, and was featured that year on the violin in The Fiddlin' Buckaroo,  and on the banjo in The Trail Drive.  Author James Horwitz has recounted the end of Maynard's tenure at Universal: when studio head Carl Laemmle asked Maynard why his latest production was such a very bad picture, the frustrated Maynard retorted, \"Mr. Laemmle, I have made you eight very bad pictures,\" and walked out on Laemmle and Universal. \n\nIn 1934 producer Nat Levine hired Ken Maynard for a serial, Mystery Mountain, and planned to make a series of western features with Maynard, beginning with In Old Santa Fe. Maynard's unprofessionalism cost him the job; after In Old Santa Fe Levine replaced Maynard with a singer in his supporting cast, Gene Autry. Maynard kept working in Hollywood, but in smaller productions, until 1940.\n\nHe returned to the screen in 1943 for low-budget Monogram Pictures in a new series called \"The Trail Blazers.\" He was teamed with fellow veteran stars Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele, and the trio offered action for the kids and nostalgia for their elders. It wasn't long before Maynard's raging temperament again cost him the job; he liked Gibson but didn't like Steele, and left the series after seven films. One final film, Harmony Trail, was made by independent producer Walt Mattox in 1944; just as one of Maynard's films had introduced cowboy star Gene Autry, this final Maynard film introduced the new singing cowboy Eddie Dean.\n\nMaynard turned his back on the movies and made appearances at state fairs and rodeos. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors. His substantial wealth had vanished, and he lived a desolate life in a rundown trailer. During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown benefactor, long thought to be Gene Autry.  More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to the screen in two small roles in Bigfoot (1970) and  The Marshal of Windy Hollow (filmed in 1972 but never released).\n\nDeath\n\nMaynard died of stomach cancer in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?pagegr&GRid\n3056] in Cypress, California.

It is currently a ruin under the care of Historic Scotland and an important tourist attraction in Dunfermline. \n\nDunfermline was a favourite residence of many Scottish monarchs. Documented history of royal residence there begins in the 11th century with Malcolm III who made it his capital. His seat was the nearby Malcolm's Tower, a few hundred yards to the west of the later palace. In the medieval period David II and James I of Scotland were both born at Dunfermline. \n\nDunfermline Palace is attached to the historic Dunfermline Abbey, occupying a site between the abbey and deep gorge to the south. It is connected to the former monastic residential quarters of the abbey via a gatehouse above a pend (or yett), one of Dunfermline's medieval gates. The building therefore occupies what was originally the guest house of the abbey. However, its remains largely reflect the form in which the building was developed by James IV in a refabrication around 1500. Throughout the sixteenth century, Scotland's monarchs and royal family members were frequently in residence. \n\nIn 1589 the palace was given as a wedding present by the king, James VI, to Anne of Denmark after their marriage. She gave birth to three of their children there; Elizabeth (1596), Charles (1600) and Robert (1602). \n\nAfter the Union of Crowns in 1603, the removal of the Scottish court to London meant that the building came to be rarely visited by a monarch. Ten tapestries from the royal tapestry collection were still there in 1616, left from the time the infant Prince Charles resided at the Palace.  When Charles I returned in 1633 for his Scottish coronation he only made a brief visit to his place of birth. The last monarch to occupy the palace was Charles II who stayed at Dunfermline in 1650 just before the Battle of Pitreavie. Soon afterwards, during the Cromwellian occupation of Scotland, the building was abandoned and by 1708 it had been unroofed. \n\nAll that remains of the palace today is the kitchen, its cellars, and the impressive south wall with a commanding prospect over the Firth of Forth to the south.\nQuestion:\nWhich King was born at Dunfermline Palace in November 1600?\nAnswer:\nCharles the First\nPassage:\nMountain pass\nA mountain pass is a route through a mountain range or over a ridge. Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel, passes have been important since before recorded history, and have played a key role in trade, war, and migration. At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass. The highest pass is Mana Pass, located in the Himalayas on the border between India and China.\n\nOverview\n\nMountain passes make use of a gap, saddle or col (also sometimes a notch, the low point in a ridge). A topographic saddle is analogous to the mathematical concept of a saddle surface, with a saddle point marking the highest point between two valleys and the lowest point along a ridge.   On a topographic map, passes are characterized by contour lines with an hourglass shape, which indicates a low spot between two higher points. \n\nPasses are often found just above the source of a river, constituting a drainage divide. A pass may be very short, consisting of steep slopes to the top of the pass, or may be a valley many kilometres long, whose highest point might only be identifiable by surveying.\n\nRoads have long been built – and more recently railways – through passes. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels bored underneath to allow faster traffic flow throughout the year.\n\nThe top of a pass is frequently the only flat ground in the area, a high vantage point, so it is sometimes a preferred site for buildings. If a national border follows a mountain range, a pass over the mountains is typically on the border, and there may be a border control or customs station, and possibly a military post as well. For instance Argentina and Chile share the world's third-longest international border, 5300 km long. The border runs north-south along the Andes mountains, with a total of 42 mountain passes. On a road over a pass, it is customary to have a small roadside sign giving the name of the pass and its elevation above mean sea level.\n\nAs well as offering relatively easy travel between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops with a minimum of descent. As a result, it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them convenient routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor. Passes traditionally were places for trade routes, communications, cultural exchange, military expeditions etc. A typical example is the Brenner pass in the Alps.\n\nSome mountain passes above the tree line have problems with snow drift in the winter. This might be alleviated by building the road a few meters above the ground, which will make snow blow off the road.\n\nSynonyms\n\nThere are many words for pass in the English-speaking world. In the United States, pass is very common in the West, the word gap is common in the southern Appalachians, notch in parts of New England, and saddle in northern Idaho.  Scotland has the Gaelic term bealach (anglicised \"balloch\"), while Wales has the similar bwlch (both being British Celtic languages). In the Lake District of north-west England, the term hause is often used, although the term pass is also common—one distinction is that a pass can refer to a route, as well as the highest part thereof, while a hause is simply that highest part, often flattened somewhat into a high-level plateau.\n\nAround the world\n\nThere are thousands of named passes around the world, some of which are well-known, such as the Great St. Bernard Pass at 2473 m in the Alps, the Khyber Pass at 1027 m between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Khardung La at 5359 m in Jammu and Kashmir, India. The roads at Mana Pass at 5610 m and Marsimik La at 5582 m, on and near the China-India border respectively, appear to be world's two highest motorable passes.\n\nGallery\n\nAgua_negra_argentina.JPG|Agua Negra Pass (Argentina/Chile).\nOrnak a14.jpg|Pass in Tatras (Ornak, Poland).\nSani Pass heading into Lesotho.jpg|Sani Pass in Lesotho.\nZadielska tiesnava.jpg|Zádieľska tiesňava Pass in Slovak Karst (Slovakia).\nQuestion:\nWhat famous mountain pass connects Pakistan and Afghanistan?\nAnswer:\nKyber pass\nPassage:\nGeorge Williams (YMCA)\nSir George Williams (11 October 1821 - 6 November 1905) was the founder of the YMCA.\n\nWilliams was born on a farm in Dulverton, Somerset, England.   As a young man, he described himself as a \"careless, thoughtless, godless, swearing young fellow\".  After an accident, his family sent him to Bridgwater to be an apprentice at a draper's shop.  In 1837, Williams was converted. He went to the Zion Congregational Church and became an involved member. \n\nIn 1841, he went to London and worked again in a draper's shop. After three years, in 1844, was promoted to department manager.  He married the boss’s daughter, Helen Jane Maunder Hitchcock in 1853.  Williams became a member of the Weigh House Congregational Church and used his time for evangelization.\n\nAppalled by the terrible conditions in London for young working men, he gathered a group of his fellow drapers together to create a place that would not tempt young men into sin.  That place was the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), which he founded on June 6, 1844.  One of the earliest converts and contributors to the new association was George's employer, George Hitchcock.\n\nWilliams was knighted by Queen Victoria in her 1894 Birthday Honours. After his death in 1905, he was commemorated by a stained-glass window in the nave of Westminster Abbey. Sir George Williams is buried in St Paul's Cathedral.\nQuestion:\nGeorge Williams founded what in London in 1844?\nAnswer:\nIndian Princesses\nPassage:\nGradgrind\nMr Thomas Gradgrind is the notorious school board Superintendent  in Dickens's novel Hard Times who is dedicated to the pursuit of profitable enterprise.   His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers. \n\nIn the story\n\nIn the story, he was the father of five children, naming them after prominent utilitarians such as Robert Malthus.  He also ran a model school where young pupils were treated as pitchers which were to be filled to the brim with facts.  This satirised Scottish philosopher James Mill who attempted to develop his sons into perfect utilitarians.\n\nHis physical description personified this characterisation of the rigid and insistent pedagogue:\n\nIn a famous passage, a visiting official asks Gradgrind's students \"Suppose you were going to carpet a room.  Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it?\" The character Sissy Jupe replies, ingenuously, that she would because, \"If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers.\"\nGradgrind is the most dynamic character in Hard Times since he comes to recognize that emotions are important when his daughter Louisa has an emotional breakdown.\nQuestion:\nSchool Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in which Charles Dickens novel?\nAnswer:\nJosiah Bounderby\nPassage:\nBrambling\nThe brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae.   It has also been called the cock o' the north and the mountain finch.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nIn 1758 Linnaeus included the species in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under its current binomial name, Fringilla montifringilla.   Montifringilla is from Latin mons, montis mountain and fringilla finch. \n\nThe common English name is probably derived from Common West Germanic *brâma, meaning bramble or a thorny bush. (Compare Standard German Brämling with the same meaning.) \n\nDescription \n\nThe brambling is similar in size and shape to a common chaffinch. Breeding-plumaged male bramblings are very distinctive, with a black head, dark upperparts, orange breast and white belly. Females and younger birds are less distinct, and more similar in appearance to some chaffinches. In all plumages, however, bramblings differs from chaffinches in a number of features:\n* brambling has a white rump whereas that of chaffinch is grey-green;\n* the breast is orange, contrasting with a white belly on brambling, whereas on chaffinch the underparts of more uniformly coloured (pink or buff);\n* brambling's scapular feathers are orange, whereas chaffinch's are grey or grey-brown;\n* the flanks are dark-spotted on brambling, plain on chaffinch;\n* bramblings lack the white outer tail feathers of chaffinch.\n\nAn additional difference for all plumages except breeding-plumaged males is the bill colour - yellow in brambling, dull pinkish in chaffinch (breeding-plumaged male bramblings have black bills, chaffinches in the corresponding plumage have grey bills). \n\nDistribution and habitat \n\nThis bird is widespread, in the breeding season, throughout the forests of northern Europe and Asia. It is migratory, wintering in southern Europe, north Africa, north India, northern Pakistan, China, and Japan.  It regularly strays into Alaska during migration and may continue as far south as the western United States. The global population of bramblings consists in about 100 - 200 millions birds, with a decreasing trend.\n\nOpen coniferous or birch woodland is favoured for breeding.\n\nBehaviour and ecology \n\nThis species is almost entirely migratory. In Europe, it forms large flocks in the winter, sometimes with thousands or even millions of birds in a single flock. Such large gatherings occur especially if beech mast is abundant. Bramblings do not require beech mast in the winter, but winter flocks of bramblings will move until they find it. This may be an adaptation to avoid competition with the Chaffinch.  Bramblings mostly eat seeds, but unlike most finches, their young are fed largely on insects. It builds its nest in a tree fork, and decorates the exterior with moss or lichen to make it less conspicuous. It lays 4–9 eggs.\nQuestion:\nTo which family of birds does the brambling belong?\nAnswer:\nFringillidae\n", "answers": ["Scratch sheet", "Race horse", "Pony racing", "Horse Racing", "Racing horse", "Racing industry", "Horse racing in Japan", "Horse-racing", "Keiba", "🏇", "Horse racing", "Horse racing venue", "Racing on horseback", "Quarter-Horse Racing", "Horse race", "Horse races", "Racehorses", "Horse-race", "Racehorse", "Turf patron", "Horserace", "Horseracing"], "length": 3817, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6359409f0e33c469d4e8dde9944bb31533a42c8371f2c086"}

In British use, the term comprises two genera: Uria and Cepphus. In North America the Uria species are called \"murres\" and only the Cepphus species are called \"guillemots\". This word of French origin apparently derives from a form of the name William, cf. . \n\nThe two living species of Uria, together with the razorbill, dovekie and the extinct great auk, make up the tribe Alcini.  They have distinctly white bellies, thicker and longer bills than Cepphus, and form very dense colonies on cliffs during the reproductive season. \n\nThe three living species of Cepphus form a tribe of their own: Cepphini.   They are smaller than the Uria species and have black bellies, rounder heads and bright red feet.\n\nIn July 2013, Dr Steven Portugal from the Royal Veterinary College demonstrated that when water touches the eggs, it forms into droplets rather than running off; in other words, guillemot eggs are water-repellant and self-cleaning.\n\nSystematics\n\nUria\n\n*Common murre or common guillemot, Uria aalge\n*Thick-billed murre or Brünnich's guillemot, Uria lomvia\n\nSome prehistoric species are also known:\n\n* Uria bordkorbi (Monterey or Sisquoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)\n* Uria affinis (Late Pleistocene of E USA)—possibly a subspecies of U. lomvia\n* Uria paleohesperis\n\nU. brodkorbi is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific, except for the very fringe of the range of U. aalge.\n\nCepphus\n\n* Black guillemot or tystie,  Cepphus grylle\n* Pigeon guillemot,  Cepphus columba\n* Spectacled guillemot,  Cepphus carbo\n\nAs in other genera of auks, fossils of prehistoric forms of Cepphus have been found:\n\n* Cepphus olsoni (San Luis Rey River Late Miocene—Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. columba (Lawrence Canyon Early Pliocene of W USA)\n* Cepphus cf. grylle (San Diego Late Pliocene, W USA)\n\nThe latter two resemble the extant species, but because of the considerable distance in time or space from their current occurrence, they may represent distinct species.\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird is a guillemot?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nSpinning frame\nThe spinning frame is an Industrial Revolution invention for spinning thread or yarn from fibres such as wool or cotton in a mechanized way.  It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay.\n\nHistorical context\n\nIn 1760 England, yarn production from wool, flax and cotton was still a cottage industry in which fibres were carded and spun by hand using a spinning wheel.  As the textile industry expanded its markets and adopted faster machines, yarn supplies became scarce especially due to innovations such as the doubling of the loom speed after the invention of the flying shuttle.  High demand for yarn spurred invention of the spinning jenny in 1764, followed closely by the invention of the spinning frame, later developed into the water frame (patented in 1769).  Mechanisms had increased production of yarn so dramatically that by 1830 the yarn cottage industry in England could no longer compete and all spinning was carried out in factories. \n\nDevelopment\n\nRichard Arkwright employed John Kay to produce a new spinning machine that Kay had worked on with (or possibly stolen from) another inventor called Thomas Highs.   With the help of other local craftsmen the team produced the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny produced by James Hargreaves.  The frame employed the draw rollers invented by Lewis Paul to stretch, or attenuate, the yarn.  \n\nThe roller spinning process starts with a thick 'string' of lose fibers called a roving, which is passed between three pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous one. In this way it is reduced in thickness and increased in length before a strengthening twist is added by a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism.  The spacing of the rollers has to be slightly greater than the fiber length to prevent breakage. The nip of the roller pairs prevent the twist from backing up to the roving.\n\nToo large to be operated by hand, the spinning frame needed a new source of power.  Arkwright at first experimented with horses, but decided to employ the power of the water wheel, which gave the invention the name 'water frame'.  \n\nFor some time, the stronger yarn produced by the spinning frame was used in looms for the lengthwise \"warp\" threads that bound cloth together, while hand powered jennies provided the weaker yarn used for the horizontal filler \"weft\" threads.  The jennies required skill but was inexpensive and could be used in a home.  The spinning frames required significant capital but required little skill.\nQuestion:\nWhich English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764?\nAnswer:\nJAMES HARGREAVES\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n'The Ride of the Valkyries' was composed by who?\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nChicago-style pizza\nChicago-style pizza refers to several different styles of pizza developed in Chicago. Arguably, the most famous of these is known as deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge and a deep surface for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.  \n\nStyles\n\nDeep-dish pizza\n\nAccording to Tim Samuelson, Chicago's official cultural historian, there is not enough documentation to determine with certainty who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.  It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, in 1943,[http://members.cox.net/jjschnebel/ddishpiz.html Who Cooked That Up?] by Uno's founder Ike Sewell, a former University of Texas football star. However, a 1956 article from the Chicago Daily News asserts that Uno's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe. \n\nThe primary difference between deep-dish pizza and most other forms of pizza is that, as the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flatbread. Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.\n\nDeep-dish pizza is baked in a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.\n\nThe thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time, which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled \"upside-down\" from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced mozzarella), followed by various meat options such as pepperoni or sausage, the latter of which is sometimes in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as onions, mushrooms and bell peppers are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer; though sometimes, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese is added for extra flavor. It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents the oils from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.\n\nSome Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their partially baked pizzas within the continental U.S. \n\nFile:Pizzeria Uno Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from the original Pizzeria Uno location\nFile:Chicago-style-pizza-03.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from Lou Malnati's\nFile:Kitchen 17 Vegan Sausage Deep Dish.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from vegan restaurant Kitchen 17 in Chicago\n\nStuffed pizza\n\nBy the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, Nancy's Pizza, founded by Rocco Palese, and Giordano's Pizzeria, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza.  Palese based his creation on his mother's recipe for scarciedda, an Italian Easter pie from his hometown of Potenza.  Chicago Magazine articles featuring Nancy's Pizza and Giordano's stuffed pizza popularized the dish.\n\nStuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into. A stuffed pizza generally has much deeper topping density than any other type of pizza. As with deep-dish pizza, a deep layer of dough forms a bowl in a high-sided pan and the toppings and cheese are added. Then, an additional layer of dough goes on top and is pressed to the sides of the crust.\n\nAt this stage, the thin dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke a small hole in the top of the \"lid\" to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the top crust before the pizza is baked.\n\nThin-crust pizza\n\nThere is also a style of thin-crust pizza found in Chicago and throughout the rest of the Midwest. The crust is thin and firm enough to have a noticeable crunch, unlike a New York-style pizza. This pizza is cut into squares, also known as party cut or tavern cut,  as opposed to a pie cut into wedges. Aurelios is a chain which specializes in this kind of pizza. Casa Bianca,  located in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, is also well known for this style of thin-crusted Chicago bar pizza.[http://www.laweekly.com/2009-07-02/eat-drink/first-date-italian-style/ Celestino: First Date, Italian-Style - Page 1 - Eat+Drink - Los Angeles - LA Weekly][http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/11/baracks_favorite_pizzeria_head.php Where's Obama's Favorite Pizza? | ExtraTV.com][http://casabiancapizza.com/history.html Casa Bianaca Pizza (history)]\nQuestion:\nWhat type of pizza is Chicago known for?\nAnswer:\nDeep Dish (disambiguation)\n", "answers": ["Sea bird", "Marine birds", "Sea-bird", "Marine bird", "Seabirds", "Sea birds", "Sea-birds", "Sea-fowl", "Seabird", "Seafowl"], "length": 2181, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "38db404cb50c0735836a42f1711352ea46eaa21c62cabc3f"}
{"input": "Passage:\nTerry Jacks\nTerrence Ross \"Terry\" Jacks (born March 29, 1944, Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, record producer and environmentalist, best known for his 1974 hit song \"Seasons in the Sun\".\n\nEarly life\n\nTerry Jacks was born and raised in Winnipeg. His family relocated to Vancouver in the early 1960s. Jacks took up guitar in his teens and at 18 formed a band called The Chessmen with guitarist Guy Sobell. The group had four top-ten hits in Vancouver between 1964 and 1966.\n\nFollowing The Chessmen, Terry and Susan Pesklevits (Susan Jacks), whom he later married, formed The Poppy Family along with Craig McCaw and Satwant Singh. They had several hits in Canada and internationally, their biggest being \"Which Way You Goin' Billy?\", which went to #1 in Canada and #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. The song was written and produced by Terry Jacks which earned him a Gold Leaf (Juno) award in 1970 for his production.\n\n\"Seasons in the Sun\"\n\nThe song \"Seasons in the Sun\", released in late 1973 on his own record label, Goldfish Records, became the largest-selling international single by a Canadian artist at that time, eventually selling 14 million copies worldwide. It earned Jacks two Juno Awards and became one of the biggest selling Canadian Singles of all time. \n\nThe song was based on Rod McKuen's 1965 re-write of \"Le moribond\", originally by Belgian singer Jacques Brel from 1962. For his version, Jacks made some modifications to the lyrics, which along with McKuen's, resulted in a work that bears little resemblance to Brel's original in tone, substance or poetry. In the United States,  in Great Britain  and in Germany,  it was released on Bell Records, and the song nonetheless went to #1 on the charts. In Canada it was released on his own label, Goldfish Records, distributed by London Records Canada. \n\nJacks later released \"If You Go Away\" (another McKuen adaptation of a Jacques Brel song entitled \"Ne Me Quitte Pas\"), which reached #8 in Great Britain and #24 in Germany, and a cover of Kevin Johnson's \"Rock 'N' Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)\", both of which had more success in Canada but also made the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. He wrote and recorded a number of other songs and went on to produce many artists including The Beach Boys with a version of \"Seasons in the Sun\" shortly before his own, but that was never released. He also produced the singles  \"Crazy Talk\"   and \"There's Something I Like About That\"   for Chilliwack from their album Riding High.\n\nJacks produced two songs for Nana Mouskouri: \"Scarborough Fair\" and \"Loving Arms\" in 1976. He produced the Vancouver top 10 hit \"Country Boy Named Willy\" for \"SPRING\" on London Records (#38 Canada); And Valdy's original version of \"Rock and Roll Song\" (b/w sometime \"Sunday Morning\"). The record was scheduled for release on London Records but was re-recorded in L.A. with another producer when Valdy signed a recording contract.  He also spent a lot of time with Buddy Knox in the 1970s and produced a single for him with two songs: \"Me and You\" (written by Jacks) and the George Jones song \"White Lightnin'\". The single remains unreleased.  Jacks also went on to produce a number of other artists in the 1980s and 1990s including DOA who recorded a punk rock version of \"Where Evil Grows\". \n\nRecently\n\nIn 2011, Jacks' friend Al Jardine released a new version of \"Don't Fight The Sea\", recorded along with fellow Beach Boys Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston and the late Carl Wilson, who sang part of the lead vocal. A limited edition white vinyl 45 was made and sold to benefit Japanese Tsunami victims.  His brand new album release, \"Starfish on the beach\" is a double CD of 40 of his favorite tracks, from the last 40 years, and features some of his biggest hits of the 70s and 80s. The package contains a 32-page booklet with never before seen photos and Terry's recollections of his musical journey. It is now available from www.regeneratorrecords.com and in select stores throughout Canada.\n\nFilm\n\nJacks has worked in documentary film and video, producing several shorts on environmental themes including The Faceless Ones, The Tragedy of Clearcutting, The Southern Chilcotin Mountains and The Warmth of Love (The Four Seasons of Sophie Thomas) with cinematographer Ian Hinkle.  The video production The Faceless Ones earned an Environmental Gold Award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. \n\nPersonal life\n\nIn the late 1970s, Jacks gradually withdrew from the music world. He had a daughter, born in 1985. In the 1980s Jacks became involved in the environmental movement, focusing on pulp mill pollution issues in Canada. His environmental work has earned him several awards including one from the United Nations Association of Canada and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. He was awarded a lifetime achievement award  in 1997 for his work, as well as the Eugene Rogers Environmental Award. \n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n* Seasons in the Sun (1974)\n* Y' Don't Fight the Sea (1975)\n* Pulse (1983)\n* Just Like That (1987)\n\nSingles\nQuestion:\nWhich song was a UK number one for Terry Jacks in 1974 and for Westlife in 1999?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nHeelflip\nThe heelflip (aka heel), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis.\n\nA heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the Ollie has become a defining trick of \"New School\" skateboarding.\n\nExecution\n\nA heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, the board spins toe-side (towards the toes). For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.\n\nWhile the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder: \n*Places his or her front foot behind or on the front bolts of the board and towards the heel-side edge of the board.\n*The skater pushes the ball of the back foot on the tail of the board slightly angled initiating the \"pop\" and a slight spin. \n*The rider's front foot is slid out diagonally in order to start the board rotating while the shoulders are centered over the board.\n*His or her feet are lifted out of the way so that their board can spin completely.\n*The rider catches their board and roll away. Skateboarders considered it good execution of the trick to stop the board's rotation with the feet in midair rather than to allow contact with the ground to stop the board.\n\nVariations\n\nVariations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:\n\n*Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.\n*Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.\n*Heelflip Body Varial,(not to be confused with the disco flip, in which a riders performs a sex change 180 while executing a Kickflip), where the skater does a backside 180 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.\n*Varial Heelflip, where the board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees frontside (frontside pop shove-it) at the same time.\n*Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.\n*Late Front-Foot Heelflip, in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.\n*Late Heelflip, in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.\n*The Heelflip Grab, a variation on grabs where the rider flips the board and catches it with his hand rather than the feet. It was first done on a vertical ramp but now is very commonly seen done on launch ramps or other surfaces which can generate sufficient air time.\n*Inward Heelflip, a combination of the backside pop shove-it and the Heelflip, this trick is usually executed with the crossing of the skater's legs. The opposite of a Hardflip.\n*Bigspin Heel, the skaters body does a frontside 180 while their board does a laser flip.\nQuestion:\nHeel flip, kick flip, and ollie are tricks in which action sport?\nAnswer:\nTAK Skateboarding\nPassage:\nRacing Demon (play)\nRacing Demon is a 1990 play by English playwright David Hare.

The tractor had already established itself a good Antarctic reputation in 1954 when one tractor worked for 565 hours without the need for a single repair after arriving on the continent on February 13 in temperatures of minus 10° C.\nWhen faced with unloading and transporting 500 tonnes of stores across 16 km from the ship to his base camp, it is not surprising Hillary turned again to the ‘Fergie’ “For unloading the ship it was necessary, of course, to have vehicles. Our problem was overcome by the generosity of Massey-Harris-Ferguson in the UK and their agents in C.B. Norwood in New Zealand. These firms lent us five Ferguson tractors modified to operate in snow conditions,” he wrote.\nThe tractors were fitted with full tracks and an extra wheel on each side. The tracks were easily removed so that wheels could be used when conditions allowed. In addition, the tractors were painted red (as opposed to the normal Ferguson grey) to make them easier to spot in the snow.\nHillary’s journey across Antarctica traversed deep crevasses in the snow and ice. Eventually the team reached Depot 700 on 15 December 1957 – despite nearly losing a tractor down a crevasse. It (and its driver) was only saved by the roll-bar jamming against the wall of the ice and holding the vehicle up.\nIn reaching this destination, Hillary’s primary role was complete. He had left behind him fully-stocked supply depots stretching all the way back to Scott base – ready for Fuchs and his team. However, he resolved to go south-west to get clear of the crevasses and find a safer route to Depot 700 for Fuchs. Then “fuel and vehicles permitting and if the Trans-polar party required no more assistance,” he would set off for the Pole or meet Fuchs if time allowed.\nOn December 20 1957, he left Depot 700. By skirting around the crevasses he cut a new route for Fuchs. The team carried on for a further ten days – at times struggling through crevasses and thick snow at a crawl. By January Hillary was on his way to the Pole. Just after midday on January 4, the team drove the last few kilometres though soft snow to arrive at the American South Pole Station.\nOn reaching his destination, Hillary commented: “Our Ferguson's had brought us over 1250 miles (2000 km) of snow, ice, crevasses and blizzard to be the first vehicles to drive to the South Pole.”\n“It is a measure of the intrinsic reliability of the tractors and the ingenuity of the Ferguson engineers that the tractors operated without fault throughout the journey,” remarks Campbell Scott, Massey Ferguson Director Sales Engineering and Brand Development. “This approach is locked into Massey Ferguson’s engineering DNA and we continue to focus on producing straightforward dependable machines which can work anywhere in the world.”\nOne of the actual Ferguson TE20s (named ‘Sue’ by the team) used on Hillary’s remarkable expedition now resides in the Massey Ferguson Technology Centre in Beauvais, France.\nLeading industry partners supporting Antarctica2 include Massey Ferguson, Trelleborg, Castrol, AGCO Finance, AGCO Parts, Fuse Technologies and MechaTrac. The expedition will attempt a 5000 km round trip to the South Pole November 2014-January 2015.\nwww.AntarcticaTwo.com\n#BELIEVEINIT\n“It is a measure of the intrinsic reliability of the tractors and the ingenuity of the Ferguson engineers that the tractors operated without fault throughout the journey”\nQuestion:\nWho led the expedition which, in 1958, was the first to traverse Antarctica (with tractors)?\nAnswer:\nVivian Fuchs\nPassage:\nTyphoo\nTyphoo is a brand of tea in the United Kingdom.  It was launched in 1903 by John Sumner Jr. of Birmingham, England.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1863, William Sumner published A Popular Treatise on Tea as a by-product of the first trade missions to China from London.\n\nIn 1870, William and his son John founded a pharmacy/grocery business in Birmingham. William's grandson, John Sumner Jr. (born in 1856), took over the running of the business in the 1900s.  Following comments from his sister on the calming effects of tea fannings, in 1903, John Jr. decided to create a new tea that he could sell in his shop.\n\nSumner set his own criteria for the new brand:\n\n* The name had to be distinctive and unlike others.\n* It had to be a name that would trip off the tongue.\n* It had to be one that would be protected by registration.\n\nThe name Typhoo comes from the Chinese word for \"doctor\" (traditional Chinese: 大夫, hanyu pinyin: dài fū).\n\nSlogans\n\nThe Typhoo brand is well known in Britain for its long-running television commercial campaign jingles, such as :\n* Putting 'T' back into Britain\n* There's only one 'T' in Typhoo\n* You only get an 'OO' with Typhoo\n* For the tea that picks you up, pick up Typhoo\n* Making Good tea since 1903 \n* Typhoo Tea - Two Thumbs Fresh\n\nRecent history\n\nIn 1968, Typhoo merged with Schweppes. The following year this company in turn merged with Cadbury to form Cadbury Schweppes. In 1986, in an effort to focus on their core brands, Cadbury Schweppes sold Typhoo, along with Kenco coffee and Jeyes Fluid. Typhoo was subject to management buy out forming a new company, Premier Brands, which  acquired, in rapid succession, Melrose's, the Glengettie Tea Company, Ridgeways, and the Jersey Trading Corporation. In 1990, the company was itself acquired by Premier Foods, then trading as Hillsdown Holdings.\n\nIn October 2005, the Indian company Apeejay Surrendra Group purchased the brands for £80 million from Premier Foods and created The Typhoo Tea Company. The brand is still manufactured at Moreton on the Wirral.\n\nApeejay Typhoo Tea is the Indian arm of Typhoo, manufacturing and selling products in India.\n\nIn 2012, Typhoo became the main jersey sponsor for St Helens Rugby League club who compete in the Super League.\n\nUse of imperial measures\n\nTyphoo is notable for its continued use of imperial measures on most of its packaging. Metric units are also shown, as required by law. The imperial unit is shown first on the front of the packaging, however the font size is the same as the metric unit, meaning that the imperial unit, officially permitted as a supplementary indicator, is no more prominent than the metric unit.\n\nExecutives\n\n* Somnath Saha: CEO\n* Andy Knight: UK - Sales Director\n* Chris Hall: Head of Marketing\n* Rahul Kale: Director of International Business and UK sales director (health food)\nQuestion:\nThe famous tea brandname Typhoo, created c.1903 by the Sumner pharmacy/grocers in Birmingham UK, is from the Chinese word for?\nAnswer:\nThe doctor (film)\n", "answers": ["Hoverbarge", "Hovercrafts", "Air-cushion vehicle", "Ground-effect machine", "Ground effect machines", "Air cushion vehicle", "Air Cushion Vehicles", "Hovercraft", "Hover barge", "Ground effect machine", "Air-Cushion Machine", "Air-Cushion Vehicle"], "length": 2432, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6f68ee22e2693924e0fc951e6be951c6853baf4f5d84833a"}

Other? and was released on February 28, 2005. It was the first Stereophonics single to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart or to chart on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the UK singles chart, and it also topped the download chart, remaining on the chart for 22 weeks, half of which were spent in the top 10. The single received good reviews, James Masterton calling it the single of the year.\n\"Dakota\" was the first Stereophonics single to achieve success on alternative rock radio stations in the United States, and as such represents their American breakthrough single.[citation needed] Before \"Dakota\", no Stereophonics single had charted on any rock charts in the U.S. After its release in February, the single steadily gained ground on U.S. alternative rock radio. However, since the Stereophonics lacked a fanbase or previous popular success in America, the single was at a great disadvantage and was initially added to very few station playlists. Nevertheless, the popularity of the song and its championing by such stations as WBCN led \"Dakota\" slowly to gain airplay and playlist adds across the country over a period of many months. It became one of the 50 most-played songs in the US by mid-May 2005. However, the song lingered just within the top 50 for months and seemed destined to just miss the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a compilation of just the top 40 most-played alternative rock songs in the US.\nBut \"Dakota\" continued to gain support across the U.S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release. The song reached #34 on the chart; it was their first and so-far only single to make the chart.\nCategory\nQuestion:\nWhat was the UK #1 single released by the band Stereophonics in 2005?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCassiopeia Constellation on Top Astronomer\nCassiopeia Constellation on Top Astronomer\nCassiopeia\nPlease hover over any star to get more information\nCassiopeia is a constellation in the northern hemisphere, first charted by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. It is taken to represent the queen Cassiopeia of the mythical kingdom Ethiopia. In Greek mythology, Cassiopeia offended the Nereids (sea nymphs) by boasting about being more beautiful than them. As punishment for her vanity, she had to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to appease the sea monster Cetus sent by Poseidon. It is said that, once placed in the sky, Cassiopeia was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever, sometimes hanging upside down, as additional punishment. The constellation is quite easy to spot in the sky because five of its bright stars form a distinctive 'W' shape.\nThe constellation Cassiopeia occupies an area of 598 square degrees and contains three stars with known planets. It can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -20° and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of November.\n[1959] beta Cassiopeiae or Caph (\"palm\") is a yellow-white giant with a magnitude of 2.28, classified as a Delta Scuti type variable. It is twice the size of the Sun and 28 times brighter.\n[1878] alpha Cassiopeiae, Shedir or Shedar (\"the breast\") has a magnitude of 2.25 and is the second brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant more than 500 times brighter than the Sun.\n[1880] gamma Cassiopeiae is the central star of the constellation. It is an eruptive variable star. It does not have a traditional Latin or Arabic name, but the Chinesse call it Tsih (\"the whip\"). At maximum intensity (currently 2.15), the star outshines both alpha and beta Cassiopeiae. Gamma Cassiopeiae spins very rapidly and bulges along the equator, which causes it to lose mass. As a result, a disk forms around the star which is responsible for the variations in brightness and emissions.\n[1881] delta Cassiopeiae, also known as Ksora or Ruchbah (\"knee\") is an eclipsing binary star about 99 light-years distant. It has an apparent visual magnitude that varies between 2.68 and 2.71.\n[1882] epsilon Cassiopeiae, also called Segin, is a blue-white giant about 442 light-years away from Earth. Its luminosity is 720 times that of the Sun.\n[1891] rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae are among the most luminous stars visible to the naked eye in the galaxy. [1883] eta Cassiopeiae is a binary star consisting of a yellow dwarf similar to our Sun and an orange dwarf.\nCassiopeia also has two notable Messier objects, both open star clusters. Messier 52 or NGC 7654 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774 and can be seen with binoculars. In stronger telescopes, it appears as a rich, V-shaped cluster of faint stars with a bright yellow star on the edge.\nMessier 103 or NGC 581 was the last Messier object to be catalogued by Charles Messier himself. At about 8,000 light-years away, it is one of the more remote open clusters to be catalogued. It contains between 40 and 50 stars, the brightest one of which is Struve 131 or HD 9311. The cluster is faint, but once found, it has the appearance of curving star chains streaming outward from the centre.\nTycho's Star or CN 1572, observed as a supernova in 1572 and documented by the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe, is also located in Cassiopeia. The star named Tycho G is being studied as a possible companion to the star that created the supernova. The other supernova remnant in the constellation is Cassiopeia A, the strongest radio source outside our solar system that can be observed. The cloud of material left over from the supernova is now about 10 light-years across.\nFinally, the constellation contains an irregular galaxy, IC 10, first discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887. It is somewhat difficult to study because, located near the Milky Way plane, it is obscured by interstellar matter. With an exceptionally high rate of star formation, however, IC 10 is known as the only starburst galaxy in the Local Group.\nQuestion:\nIn which constellation do the five main stars form a 'W' shape?\nAnswer:\nCassiepeia\nPassage:\nHysteria\nHysteria, in the colloquial use of the term, means ungovernable emotional excess. Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term \"hysteria\" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as somatization disorder. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially changed the diagnosis of \"hysterical neurosis, conversion type\" (the most extreme and effective type) to \"conversion disorder\".\n\nHistory\n\nFor at least 2,000 years of European history until the late 19th century, the term \"hysteria\" referred to a medical condition thought to be particular to women and caused by disturbances of the uterus (from the Greek ὑστέρα hystera \"uterus\"), such as when a newborn child emerges from the birth canal. The origin of the term is commonly attributed to Hippocrates, even though it is not used in the writings that are collectively known as the Hippocratic corpus.  The Hippocratic corpus refers to a variety of illness symptoms – such as suffocation and Heracles' disease – which were supposedly caused by the movement of a woman's uterus to various locations within her body as it became light and dry due to a lack of bodily fluids. One passage recommends pregnancy to cure such symptoms, ostensibly because intercourse will \"moisten\" the womb and facilitate blood circulation within the body. The \"wandering womb\" theory persisted in European medicine for centuries.\n\nBy the mid- to late 19th century, hysteria (sometimes called female hysteria) had come to refer to what is today generally considered to be sexual dysfunction. Typical treatment was massage of the patient's genitalia by the physician and, later, by vibrators or water sprays to cause orgasm. A male counterpart of the diagnosis of hysteria, which then almost exclusively applied to women, was associated with symptoms now mostly considered to be signs of PTSD.\n\nA more modern understanding of hysteria as a psychological disorder was advanced by the work of Jean-Martin Charcot, a French neurologist. In his 1893 obituary of Charcot, Sigmund Freud attributed the rehabilitation of hysteria as a topic for scientific study to the positive attention generated by Charcot’s neuropathological investigations of hysteria during the last ten years of his life., first published in  Freud questioned Charcot’s claim that heredity is the unique cause of hysteria, but he lauded his innovative clinical use of hypnosis to demonstrate how hysterical paralysis could result from psychological factors produced by non-organic traumas (psychological factors that Charcot believed could be simulated using hypnosis). According to Freud, this discovery allowed subsequent investigators such as Pierre Janet and Josef Breuer to develop new theories of hysteria that were essentially similar to the medieval conception of split consciousness, but with the non-scientific terminology of demonic possession replaced with modern psychological concepts.\n\nIn the early 1890s Freud published a series of articles on hysteria which popularized Charcot's earlier work, and began the development of his own views on hysteria. By the 1920s Freud's theory on hysteria was influential in the UK and the US. Freudian psychoanalytic theory attributed hysterical symptoms to the unconscious mind's attempt to protect the patient from psychic stress. Unconscious motives include primary gain, in which the symptom directly relieves the stress (as when a patient coughs to release energy pent up from keeping a secret), and secondary gain, in which the symptom provides an independent advantage, such as staying at home away from a hated job. More recent critics have noted the possibility of tertiary gain, as when a patient is induced unconsciously to display a symptom because of the desires of others (for instance when a controlling spouse enjoys the docility of his or her sick partner).  \n\nJudith Herman suggests, in Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence: From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror,  that hysteria was a label given to a form of PTSD arising from routine domestic abuse of women, including physical abuse, rape, and emotional abuse. She describes the work of Charcot and Freud, which had resulted in Freud's finding in \"The Aetiology of Hysteria\" in 1896 (which he later repudiated):\n\n\"I therefore put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria there are  one or more occurrences of premature sexual experience ... \". \n\nCurrent theories and practices\n\nCurrent psychiatric terminology distinguishes two types of disorder that were previously labelled \"hysteria\": somatoform disorder and dissociative disorder. There are many cases of these disorders where nothing else can be diagnosed in the sufferers. The dissociative disorders in DSM-IV-TR include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified. Somatoform disorders include conversion disorder, somatization disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. In somatoform disorders, the patient exhibits physical symptoms, such as low back pain or limb paralysis, which have no  apparent physical cause. Additionally, certain culture-bound syndromes – such as \"ataques de nervios\" (\"attacks of nerves\") identified in Hispanic populations, and popularized by Pedro Almodóvar's film Women on the Verge of a Nervous  Breakdown – exemplify psychiatric phenomena which encompass both somatoform and dissociative symptoms, and have been linked to psychological trauma.  Recent neuroscientific research is now beginning to show that there are characteristic patterns of brain activity associated with these states.  All these disorders are thought to be unconscious, not feigned and not intentional malingering.\n\nJungian psychologist Laurie Layton Schapira has explored the \"Cassandra Complex\" suffered by those traditionally diagnosed with hysteria.   Basing her findings on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra Complex in hysterics: (a) dysfunctional relationships, with social manifestations of rationality, order and reason, leading to (b) emotional or physical suffering, particularly in the form of somatic, often gynaecological complaints, and\n(c) sufferers being disbelieved or dismissed when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.\n\nMass hysteria\n\nThe term also occurs in the phrase \"mass hysteria\" to describe mass public near-panic reactions. Hysteria was often associated with events such as the Salem witch trials, or slave revolt.\nQuestion:\nWhose Selected Papers on Hysteria, translated in 1909 by Abraham Brill, introduced the word libido into English?\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\n", "answers": ["Dakota", "Dakota (disambiguation)", "DakotaS"], "length": 2114, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "58c8ffdb48c5c214f8afe8869a0df52eb59dda0992f229ba"}

It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dalí, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.\n\nTitle\n\nThe painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ's arms; the circle is formed by Christ's head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the \"three\" but in the four, merry they be. \n\nInspiration\n\nOn the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dalí explained its inspiration: \"In the first place, in 1950, I had a 'cosmic dream' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the 'nucleus of the atom.'  This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it 'the very unity of the universe,' the Christ!\" \n\nIn order to create the figure of Christ, Dalí had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle  and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dalí's residence at the time of the painting. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in the early 1950s by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman got the painting for £8,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the £12,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over.\n\nThe purchase was controversial. A petition against the purchase, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art.  The controversy caused Honeyman and Dalí to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original events.\n\nThe painting first went on display at the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961, a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display.  In 1993, the painting was moved to the city's St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland's favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote. \n\nCritical reception\n\nThis painting has continued to generate controversy. At the time of its purchase by Honeyman, the verdict by Modern Art critics was that producing such a traditional painting was a stunt by an artist already famous for his surrealist art. In 2009 the Guardian art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as \"kitsch and lurid,\" but noted that the painting was \"for better or worse, probably the most enduring vision of the crucifixion painted in the 20th century.\"\n\nIn May 2013, in BBC Radio 4's Great Lives, British poet John Cooper Clarke described this image as being utterly different from any other image of the crucifixion, as the angle of view conveys the hanging pain of this method of execution, whilst hiding the ordinarily clichéd facial expressions normally seen in such depictions. \n\nSpanish offer\n\nThe Spanish government is said to have offered £80 million ($127 million USD) for the painting, but the offer was turned down.\nQuestion:\nWhich 20th century artist's works include 'Christ Of St. John Of The Cross' and 'Metamorphosis Of Narcissus'?\nAnswer:\nSalvador Felipe Jacinto DalA\nPassage:\nGreen Mountains\nThe Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately 250 mi from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the range that is in Massachusetts is known as The Berkshires,  and the part in Quebec is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton. \n\nAll mountains in Vermont are often referred to as the \"Green Mountains\". However, other ranges within Vermont, including the Taconics — in southwestern Vermont's extremity — and Northeastern Highlands, are not geologically part of the Green Mountains.\n\nPeaks\n\nThe best-known mountains – for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail), or with ski resorts or towns nearby – in the range include: \n*Mount Mansfield, 4393 ft, the highest point in Vermont\n*Killington Peak, 4235 ft\n*Mount Ellen, 4083 ft\n*Camel's Hump, 4083 ft\n*Mount Abraham, 4017 ft\n*Pico Peak, 3957 ft\n*Stratton Mountain, 3940 ft, the mountain at which the initial ideas of both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail were born\n*Jay Peak, 3862 ft, receives the most amount of snowfall on average in the eastern United States  \n*Bread Loaf Mountain, 3835 ft\n*Mount Wilson, 3780 ft\n*Glastenbury Mountain, 3748 ft\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south.\n\nThe Green Mountains are part of the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion.\n\nThree peaks, Mount Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and Mount Abraham, support alpine vegetation.\n\nTourism\n\nSome of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer.  Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and is overlapped by the Appalachian Trail for roughly  of its length.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Vermont Republic, also known as the Green Mountain Republic,  existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state.\n\nVermont not only takes its state nickname (\"The Green Mountain State\") from the mountains, it is named after them. The French Verts Monts is literally translated as \"Green Mountains\". This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant.  The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM, after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis (University of the Green Mountains). \n\nGeology and physiography\n\nThe Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. \n\nLemon Fair runs through the towns of Orwell, Sudbury, Shoreham, Bridport, and Cornwall, Vermont, before flowing into Otter Creek. The story is that its name derives from early English-speaking settlers' phonetic approximation of 'Les Monts Vert'.\nQuestion:\nWhich American state has the nickname the Green Mountain state?\nAnswer:\nSports in Vermont\n", "answers": ["Synthetic emerald", "Emerald", "Emeralds", "Trapiche emerald", "Smaragdos", "The Emerald Streak"], "length": 1341, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "56b097737d08613d78232a2a58730e833a7d1d66957a6c73"}

This kind of bird can be predominantly found in Europe and some parts of Western Asia. However,  flocks of birds migrate to the south as far to the coast when its breeding season. The Linnet is rather thin and small, but the feathers of its tail are long. The bird has shades of brown on its upper body, the chest area is white and its beak has a gray color to it.\nThere are different characteristics which set male from female are primarily that the males nape is gray, its head has a red spot and its breast is colour red while females do not have red, but rather have a white color in the area of the breast.\nSome of the more experienced bird enthusiast in Malta & Gozo cross the linnet to the canary resulting in robust mules and their song is so beautiful that it can be compared to no other. They are best bred in cages approximately 4 x 3 x 1.2 feet. Breeding usually commences at the beginning of March and a feed of wild seed should be used in the build up program. It is not suggested to use any eggfood at this time. Nest can be made of wire baskets and placed in hiding place as the Linnet can be distracted very easily. There is no better nesting material then the one produced by Quiko ( see X-tras ).

It is based on the play It Depends What You Mean by James Bridie.  The film follows the efforts of a British Army Chaplain attempting to recruit entertainment acts to perform for the troops and the complications that ensue when he does.  The title is taken from the line by Thomas Gray \"where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise\".\n\nPlot\n\t\nHaving recently taken over the role of entertainments officer at an army camp the Padre Captain William Paris is disheartened so few of the troops turn out for an evening of classical music. He visits a local pub and finds the place packed with soldiers, including his own driver. He then resolves to try and secure something more entertaining for the troops and comes up with the idea of bringing in a Brain Trust to answer questions from the audience.\n\nWith the help of Lady Dodds, the Captain manages to gather together a group of local notables, who all swiftly prove to be mildly eccentric. The group includes the opinionated Professor Mutch, who is a popular radio personality with the BBC, and his friend the oil painter George Prout and his wife Angela. While arriving at their house, the Captain interrupts Mutch and Mrs Prout who are about to embrace. Upon meeting Mr Prout he soon finds him a cold man who verbally abuses his wife. The Trust is rounded out by the wandering Doctor McAdam and the chippy local Labour MP Joseph Byres.\n\nWith the help of his secretary, Private Jessie Killigrew, the Captain manages to organise the event. The hall is relatively well filled. Trying to avoid anything controversial, the Captain forbids any discussion of politics and begins with some innocuous questions about cows chasing after trains and if the Moon is inhabited? Things soon become heated when the MP takes offence at comments directed at him and threatens to start a fight. Having only just averted this, a question about marriage reveals the fragility of the Prouts' marriage. Fearing any controversy, the Captain quickly announces that it is time for the interval.\n\nAs word spreads around the camp of the goings-on, the second half begins with the room completely packed. The Captain tries to steer the debate back to harmless questions about bluebottles, but the audience demands an answer to the earlier question about marriage. As the Prouts begin arguing once again, Mrs Prout admits that the Professor is her lover. At this the whole event threatens to descend into anarchy despite the attempts of the Captain to maintain order. Desperate to restore a sense of propriety, he draws the proceedings to a close, and announces that next week they will return to classical music by inviting a string quartet. A soldier stands up and thanks the Captain for providing such entertainment and asking if the Brain Trust can be made a regular feature.\n\nWorried about Mr Prout, who has disappeared and has been drinking heavily, the others follow him back to his house where they mistakenly believe that he is going to throw himself over the cliffs. Instead, he is planning a bit of quiet painting. Meanwhile, the Professor has revealed himself to be an inherently selfish man, while Mr Prout is suddenly far more reasonable. He and Mrs Prout soon resolve their differences, and he tries to be a little more considerate to her.\n\nThe film ends with the string quartet playing once more and the Captain sitting almost entirely alone in the theatre.\n\nCast\n\n* Alastair Sim - Captain William Paris\n* Elizabeth Allan - Angela Prout\n* Roland Culver - George Prout\n* Colin Gordon - Professor James Mutch\n* Martita Hunt - Lady Dodds\n* Janet Brown - Jessie Killegrew\n* Peter Martyn - Walter\n* Miles Malleson - Doctor Hector McAdam\n* Edward Chapman - Joseph Byres MP\n* Cyril Chamberlain - Drill Sergeant\n* Michael Ripper - Drill Corporal\n* Robin Bailey - Intellectual Corporal\n* Michael Kelly - Staff Sergeant\n* George Cole - Soldier in audience\n* Maria Charles - WRAC Corp soldier\n* Martin Boddey - Brigadier\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot at Shepperton Studios and made by the British Lion Film Corporation. James Bridie wrote the screenplay, adapting it from his own play. Alastair Sim had previously produced the play in a 1944 run at the Westminster Theatre and was a driving force behind bringing it to the screen.  Launder was encouraged to make the film by Alexander Korda. \n\nReception\n\nA contemporary New York Times review described the film as a \"cheerful British import\". While noting that the film did not \"succeed in building into towering proportions the fragile theme of what makes a marriage tick\" the cast had made it \"all worth while\". The review praised the performance by Alastair Sim in particular. \n\nSim was nominated for a Best Actor BAFTA for his role as Captain Paris, but lost to Ralph Richardson for his performance in The Sound Barrier.\nQuestion:\nWhat is bliss when it is folly to be wise\nAnswer:\nIgnorance\nPassage:\nHomepage - Northampton Saints\nHomepage - Northampton Saints\n© 2016 Northampton Saints.

He’s drunk, brutal, selfishly bullish and possesses a consuming desire for revenge and control that is further blinkered by his inability to be reasoned with – all made all the more fearsome by his realism.\nMen much like him existed then and men much like him exist now. He is the one man on the streets of London who never showed a scrap of kindness – apparent or otherwise – to young orphan Oliver and remains probably Charles Dickens’s darkest character. He manages his career as a criminal and those who work with him with a harsh iron fist. He beats those closest to him – his girlfriend Nancy and his dog Bulls Eye – without remorse and when he discovers that Nancy plans to return Oliver to his wealthy guardians he murders her in a fit of anger.\nOliver Twist has been adapted many times for stage and screen but it is probably Oliver Reed’s portrayal of Sikes in Carol Reed’s 1968 musical film that is best remembered.

The first run was in 1896, and it has taken place most years since its initial revival in 1927. To qualify, the cars must have been built before 1905. It is also the world's largest gathering of veteran cars – 443 started in 2005, 484 in 2009,  compared to 37 starters in 1927, 51 starters in 1930 and 131 in 1938. \n\nIt takes place, currently, on the first Sunday in November and starts at sunrise from Hyde Park, London and mostly follows the old A23 road to finish at Brighton – a distance of 54 mi. There are two official stops along the way: Crawley (for coffee) and Preston Park (in a suburb of Brighton). Preston Park is the official finishing point; the cars then proceed to Madeira Drive on the seafront, also the venue for Brighton's other big motoring event, the Brighton Speed Trials.\n\nThe organisers emphasise that the event is not a race – they do not even publish the order in which cars finish, and participants are not permitted to exceed an average speed of 20 mph. Any that finish (many do not) before 4:30 pm are awarded a medal.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first run took place on 14 November 1896, a wet Saturday. Organised by Harry J. Lawson,  and named \"The Emancipation Run\", it was a celebration of the recently passed Locomotives on Highways Act 1896, which had replaced the restrictive Locomotive Acts of 1861, 1865 and 1878 and increased the speed limit to 14 mph. Since 1878 the speed limit had been 4 mph in the country and 2 mph in the town and an escort had been required to walk 20 yd ahead of the vehicle. The 1865 act had required the escort to carry a red flag at a distance of 60 yd.\n\nThe event started with a breakfast at the Charing Cross Hotel, which included the symbolic tearing in two by Lord Winchelsea of a red flag. The competitors gathered outside the Metropole Hotel,  with the cars accompanied by a \"flying escort\" – estimated by one witness as \"probably 10,000\" – of pedal cyclists, recreational cycling having become popular with the English in the final decades of the 19th century. A total of 33 motorists set off from London for the coast and 17 arrived in Brighton. The first of the cars set off from London at 10:30 am and the first arrival in Brighton, by a Duryea Motor Wagon, beating the next closest Brighton arrivals by more than an hour. Two Duryea cars participated in the run, marking the first appearance of American motor vehicles in Europe. \n\nThe run was not staged again until 1927, and then annually run from 1927 until the onset of the Second World War. Owing to petrol rationing, the event was cancelled until 1947. With all this considered, it is the world's longest running motoring event. Since 1930, the event has been controlled by the Royal Automobile Club.\n\nThe 1953 comedy movie Genevieve is set during one of these runs.\n\nParticipants\n\nMany racing drivers and celebrities have taken part in the event, including Richard Shuttleworth (1928–1934; 1936–1938),  S. C. H. \"Sammy\" Davis, Sir Malcolm Campbell,  Prince Bira,  George Eyston, Richard Seaman, Kaye Don,  George Formby, Stirling Moss and Jochen Mass. \n\nThe 72nd anniversary run took place in 1968 and was joined by celebrity participants Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco, in a 1903 De Dion-Bouton. That year Stirling Moss also participated, driving a 1903 four-cylinder Mercedes.imp petrol equivalent) and the largely diesel powered internal combustion engine vehicles (1.68 MJ/km average, 52 mpgimp petrol equivalent). \n\n1896 results\n\nThe event was not organised as a race, but the General classification of the fastest finishers was : \n\nThe event in popular culture\n\n*Genevieve\nQuestion:\nIn which year was the first London to Brighton veteran car run in the UK?\nAnswer:\none thousand, eight hundred and ninety-six\nPassage:\nSmelly Durian Fruit Banned in Hotel, Metro! | The Travel ...\nSmelly Durian Fruit Banned in Hotel, Metro! | The Travel Tart Blog\nJune 29, 2012 6 Comments Written by Anthony The Travel Tart\nSTOP! No Durian Fruit!\nThis is a silly guest post. Note, I can relate to the Durian Fruit smell, which is pretty feral when you start burping up the flavour if you have one with a beer!\nOne of the most popular fruits in Singapore is also one of the smelliest! Durian fruit is so popular amongst the locals that officials and professionals have had to implement the use of signage, prohibiting the fruit in public places.\nDurian I Spotted in Indonesia\n‘No Durian’ signs have become somewhat of a tourist attraction, in their own right, as visitors often cannot believe that a piece of fruit is banned in most public places! While many people are insistent that durian fruit is the most delicious fruit in the world, just the smell is enough to put others off completely. The smell of the durian fruit is commonly described as something between incredibly bad foot odour, a dirty nappy – and vomit. Sounds inviting, right?\nBanned from public!\nWhile it may be a delicacy to many locals and visitors to Singapore , the government and private business have been forced to implement the banning of the durian fruit, simply because of the disgusting odour that it produces. When visiting Singapore, don’t expect to see durian fruit on public transport or in major public places, due to the ‘No Durian’ signs that can be seen nearly everywhere. Hotels, resorts, restaurants, subways, airports and taxis all commonly ban the fruit on their premises, so make sure you keep yours concealed when travelling around Singapore.\nSo, do people actually eat this smelly fruit?\nIn comparison to the pungent smell of the fruit, the taste is described as somewhat bland, however durian fruit is still often utilised in many different dishes to create a unique flavour. Most commonly, the fruit is used to compliment sweet foods, such as ice cream, popcorn, sticky rice and milkshakes. Most countries that are home to the smelly fruit, also use it as an ingredient mixed with spices, which is then added to many common dishes. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia , durian honey is a delicacy, enjoyed by many locals – be sure to get your hands on this to experience durian at its best.\nThe best time for your durian fruit\nIf you are planning on tasting the ”delight” of the durian fruit when in Singapore, be sure to travel between June and August, when the fruit is in season and at its prime quality. Although the fruit can sometimes be found outside of these months, if you’re tasting durian for the first time, you’re best to try it when it’s most fresh; producing not only the more repulsive smell, but also the most delicious flavour.\nWith the fruit being used in so many common foods and virtually idolised by countless locals, it’s easy to see that the fruit is banned from public places, purely because of the unbearable smell that it produces.\nIf you’d like to have the full durian experience, book flights to Singapore today and see if you can accept the challenge of possibly the smelliest fruit in the world!\nAre you tough enough for durian?\n \nAbout Anthony The Travel Tart\nThe Travel Tart writes about the funny, offbeat and weird aspects of world travel today.

Triple sec or orange liqueur (or Grand Marnier or Cointreau, both orange liqueurs) is widely used in many classics, so we made own special version.\nWhat does triple sec taste like? Triple sec is a sweet orange citrus liqueur. Our homemade triple sec tastes heavily of oranges and orange peel, like orange hard candy. Some triple secs are not as potently orange tasting.\nThis recipe comes from Charlie Hodges at the Ace Hotel, Palm Springs, via Imbibe Magazine‘s Fall 2009 issue. Read through the steps and you’ll see that you can multitask to speed up the process.\nHere’s what you need to make triple sec:\n4 small navel oranges\n12 oz. Everclear grain alcohol\n12 oz. vodka\n12 oz. can of Mandarin orange slices\n5 cups cane sugar\nOrange blossom water\nGet all your triple sec ingredients together, then:\nHeat oven to lowest temperature setting, generally around 180ºF – 200ºF. Slice the oranges into 1/8″ thick wheels and lay out on a baking tray. Bake oranges until sticky and gummy but not dried, about 1-2 hours.\nDrain the can of Mandarin oranges and place in a jar with the vodka to infuse for about 24 hours or until it tastes strongly of the oranges.\nCombine the baked orange slices with the Everclear and infuse for 8 hours, stirring occasionally.\nMake the simple syrup combining the sugar and water and stirring over medium heat until dissolved.\nFinally, strain all liquid ingredients through a fine sieve and combine with the syrup. Stir and add a few dashes of orange blossom water to taste. Bottle it up and it keeps refrigerated for about a month.\nReady to mix?

Black Canyon gets its name from the black volcanic rocks that are found throughout the area.\n\nJust south of the Hoover Dam on the Nevada side of the canyon is the Sauna Cave. This cave was drilled by miners working on Hoover Dam while it was being constructed. It is a deep cave with calcium carbonate crystals on the walls. At the end of the cave is a hot spring, which causes temperatures in the cave to reach 120 F.\n\nOne prominent canyon that splits from this canyon south of the Hoover Dam is Boy Scout Canyon.

He is empowered on matters of Catholic Faith and for the settlement of ecclesiastical matters.\n\nThe legate is appointed directly by the pope (the bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church and head of state of the papal states). Hence a legate is usually sent to a government, a sovereign or to a large body of believers (such as a national church) or to take charge of a major religious effort, such as an (ecumenical) council, a crusade to the Holy Land, or even against a heresy such as the Cathars.\n\nThe term legation is applied both to a legate's mandate and to the territory concerned (such as a state, or an ecclesiastical province). The relevant adjective is legatine.\n\nHistory \n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey, papal legate to England during the reign of Henry VIII\nIn the High Middle Ages, papal legates were often used to strengthen the links between Rome and the many parts of Christendom. More often than not, legates were learned men and skilled diplomats who were not from the country they were accredited to. The Italian-born Guala Bicchieri served as papal legate to England in the early 13th century and played a major role in both the English government and church at the time. By the Late Middle Ages it had become more common to appoint native clerics to the position of legate within their own country, such as Cardinal Wolsey acting as legate to the court of Henry VIII of England. The reason for this switch in policy could be attributed to a change in attitude on the eve of The Reformation; by this point, foreign men representing the papacy would be more likely to reinforce dissent than bring Christendom closer together. \n\nPapal legates often summoned legatine councils, which dealt with church government and other ecclesiastical issues.  According to Pope Gregory VII, writing in the Dictatus papae, a papal legate \"presides over all bishops in a council, even if he is inferior in rank, and he can pronounce sentence of deposition against them\". During the Middle Ages, a legatine council was the usual means that a papal legate imposed his directives. \n\nDiplomatic Ranks \n\nThere are several ranks of papal legates in diplomacy, some of which are no longer used.\n\nApostolic nuncio\n\nCardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone, sometime papal nuncio to Urbino, Ferrara, Venice, Parma, and England.\n\nThe most common form of papal legate today is the apostolic nuncio, whose task it is to strengthen relations between the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church in a particular country and at the same time to act as the diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the government of that country.  An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the deanship of that country's diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority. \n\nPro-nuncio\n\nPro-nuncio was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and de jure deanship of the diplomatic corps. In those countries, the papal representative's precedence within the corps is exactly on a par with that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps. \n\nApostolic delegate\n\nFor countries with which the Holy See has no diplomatic relations, an apostolic delegate is sent to serve as a liaison with the Catholic Church in that country, though not accredited to its government.\n\nLegati\n\nLegatus a latere\n\nThis highest rank (literally \"from the (Pope's) side\", i.e. \"intimately\" trusted) is normally awarded to a priest of cardinal rank. It is an exceptional investiture and can either be focused or broad in scope. The legate a latere is the alter ego of the Pope, and as such, possesses full plenipotentiary powers. \n\nLegatus natus\n\nLiterally \"born legate\", i.e. not nominated individually but ex officio, namely a bishop holding this rank as a privilege of his see, e.g. archbishops of Canterbury (pre-Reformation), Prague, Esztergom, Udine, Salzburg, Poznan and Cologne. The legatus natus would act as the pope's representative in his province, with a legatus a latere only being sent in extraordinary circumstances. Although limited in their jurisdiction compared to legati a latere, a legatus natus were not subordinate to them. \n\nLegatus missus\n\nLiterally \"sent legate\", possessing limited powers for the purpose of completing a specific mission. This commission is normally focused in scope and of short duration.\n\nGubernatorial legates \n\nSome administrative (temporal) provinces of the Papal states in (mostly central) Italy were governed by a Papal Legate. This has been the case in Benevento, in Pontecorvo (of Campagna e Marittima/ of Frosinone) and in Viterbo.\nIn four cases, including Bologna, this post was awarded exclusively to Cardinals; the Velletri post was created for Bartolommeo cardinal Pacca.\n\nThe title could be changed to Apostolic Delegate, as happened in Frosinone (for Pontecorvo) in 1827.\n\nCitations\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to a Papal legate or ambassador to a civil government?\nAnswer:\nApostolic nuncio\nPassage:\nMark Selby, snooker's so-called Jester from Leicester, is ...\nMark Selby, snooker's so-called Jester from Leicester, is having a laugh with his nickname - Telegraph\nSnooker\nMark Selby, snooker's so-called Jester from Leicester, is having a laugh with his nickname\nNicknames are mandatory in many sports but snooker world champion Mark Selby    lives up to only half of his\nDeadly serious: Snooker world champion Mark Selby's nickmame has nothing to do with jesterly wit Photo: AFP\nBy Matthew Norman\n8:41PM BST 08 May 2014\nSome years ago, when the Texas Hold Em craze was at its peak, I wrote a poker column and played in several televised tournaments. In one, despite being supernaturally useless, I blundered into the chip lead with two players remaining. I was dealt a pair of jacks, and joyously called my opponent when he went all in. He was bluffing, and turned over an unsuited three and a six. A miraculous flop came two, four and five, making him a straight. I smiled the nauseous false smile of the bad beat victim, went on tilt, and hurriedly blew the remaining chips.\nOn leaving the table, meaning to race home to raid the medicine chest for the strychnine, I was intercepted by an interviewer. “What nickname do you want on the caption?” she asked. “Anything,” I replied, “other than ‘Matt The Hat’.” Anyone with my first name was automatically nicknamed that. “Oh,” she said, crestfallen, “what’s wrong with that?” No one calls me Matt,” I said, tersely, “and I do not own a hat.” I will not insult you by relating the caption that later appeared.\nAnd so to the new world snooker champion, and the sobriquet that hoists the nickname incongruity bar to new heights. Mark Selby, who on Monday prevented “Rocket Ronnie” O’Sullivan from achieving escape velocity in Sheffield, is “The Jester from Leicester”.\nWith the second half of this designation, no one could quibble. Selby indisputably comes from the East Midlands town where Richard III’s remains were found in a car park last year. It is the first half that seems equivalent to nicknaming that late monarch “Old Straight Back”.\nSince losing his first world final in 2007 to John Higgins (“The Wizard of Wishaw”), Selby has been my favourite player. I cannot entirely fathom why, though it must have something to do with the ferocity of his concentration, the doggedness in fighting to the death, the beguiling modesty, and – perhaps above all – his gravity.\nRelated Articles\nA game designed to multitaskers\n05 May 2014\nWhat it has nothing to do with is any alleged jesterly wit. Admittedly, he will now and again make an aside that causes a crowd to explode with such violent mirth that you fear a mass failure of bodily function control will have play suspended pending the application of mops and Dettol.\nUnderstandably, given the urge to release the tension built over hours of sitting still and silent, a snooker audience is easily amused. If a player who has been horribly snookered mutters “Looks tricky”, the crowd will respond as if the compendium of Algonquin Round Table one-liners has been released into the arena within a cloud of nitrous oxide.\nHaving a nickname is now mandatory in snooker, as in darts. The supremo of these games is the boxing promoter Barry Hearn, and it is after the big fight game that he has cannily sought to restyle both. Some are simple derivatives (reticent arrowsman Dave Chisnall is “Chizzy”), and others echo an accomplishment, as in Essex cueist Ali Carter’s “The Captain” (he has a pilot’s licence). Some refer to a perceived mental trait (snooker’s Peter Ebdon is “Psycho”), and others, like Jimmy “The Whirlwind” White, to a playing style.\nOccasionally, you meet a genuinely clever pun. Darting journeyman Mark Frost is “Frosty the Throwman”, and snooker has “The Outlaw” Joe Swail (one for the Clint Eastwood buff). These are the exceptions, however, and attempts to raise the standard can fall on deaf ears. When the Russian Anastasia Dobromyslova was bridging the gender divide to bring a dash of blonde glamour to men’s darts, I lobbied for her to adopt “Aphrodarty”. She stuck with “From Russia With Love”.\nThe almost limitless range of nicknames plays a useful part in enlivening these games, without necessarily imbuing them with the aura of gangland brutality lent boxing by Thomas “Hitman” Hearns and Larry “The Easton Assassin” Holmes. Yet when one acquires a heavy ironic twang, and however exquisite the rhyme, it must be time to consider a change.\nI love Selby to bits, and hope he wins more world titles with that Jose Mourinho-esque genius for frustrating and defeating more naturally gifted opponents. Nonetheless, I offer him this alternative, as suggested by a despairing O’Sullivan fan while Selby was shackling the Rocket to his launch pad and boring some observers close to unconsciousness on Monday afternoon with the languid, remorseless brilliance of his safety play. The Siesta from Leicester.\nQuestion:\n\"Which snooker player has the nickname \"\"The Jester from Leicester\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nMark Selby\nPassage:\nConstruction set\nA construction set is a set of standardized pieces that allow for the construction of a variety of different models. The pieces avoid the lead-time of manufacturing custom pieces, and of requiring special training or design time to construct complex systems. This makes them suitable for temporary structures, or for use as children's toys.\n\nCategories\n\nConstruction sets can be categorized according to their connection method and geometry:\n\n* Struts of varying length that are connected by nodes are good for building space frames, and often have components that allow full rotational freedom.\n**D8h (*228) nodes are used for K'Nex, Tinkertoys, Playskool Pipeworks, Cleversticks\n**Ih (*532) nodes are used for Zometool\nSpherical magnets\n\n* Panels of varying sizes and shapes\n** Panels of varying sizes and shapes are connected by pins or screws perpendicular to the panels, which are good for building linkages such as an Erector Set, Meccano, Merkur, Steel Tec, Lego Technic, Trix, FAC-System and Überstix\n** Panels of varying sizes and shapes with flexible panels or hinges between panels such as Tog'l, Jovo Click 'N Construct, Zaks, and Polydron.\n* Struts and panels\n**Synestructics (does not make pentagonal structures).\n**Geomag (components are magnetic).\n* Building components with various methods of connection include:\n** No connection: toy blocks, Anchor Stone Blocks, KEVA planks, Kapla and [http://unitbricks.com Unit Bricks]\n** Studs: Rokenbok, Lego,  Coco, Rasti, Tente, Mega Bloks,  Fischertechnik, Playmobil, Loc Blocs, Cobi blocks, Betta Builda and Oxford, Kre-O\n** Notches: Lincoln Logs, GIK, and Stickle bricks\n** Sleeves: Capsela\n\nPsychological benefits\n\nConstruction toy play is beneficial for building social skills and building trust in others because it acts as a collaborative task where individuals have to cooperate in order to finish the task — building an object out of Lego, for example. The effect was found in high school students. \n\nFor children specifically, children who complete models using toy building blocks have much better spatial ability than children who do not complete such models. Spatial ability also predicts completion of models. \n\nConstruction toy play is also beneficial for autistic children when both individual and group play with building blocks is incorporated. Autistic children who played with building blocks were motivated to initiate social contact with children their age, they were able to maintain and endure contact with those children, and autistic children were also able to surpass the barriers of being withdrawn and being highly structured. \n\nInfluence on Architecture \n\nRenowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright credited his childhood building blocks designed by Friedrich Fröbel as a major influence, and his son John Lloyd Wright created the widely known Lincoln Logs building set. In addition to teaching architectural concepts such as modularity and load-bearing construction, many architects credit construction set play as influencing their later design.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of a construction toy made of interlocking plastic blocks?\nAnswer:\nLego AT-AP\nPassage:\nThe Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything\nThe Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything is a political memoir by Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). It is published by Biteback Publishing, and released on 17 March 2015.\n\nContent\n\nNear the start of the book, Farage declares that he rarely scripts or practises his speeches, and how he does not regret any of them, saying \"The more risk you take, the more likely it is that things will go really well, or really badly\".\n\nIn one chapter, Farage writes of his being hit by a car in 1985, his suffering from testicular cancer the year after, and his plane crash while campaigning in the 2010 general election. He uses these three near-death experiences to state his opinions on the National Health Service, saying that he has seen \"the best and worst\" of it.\n\nFarage declares his support for Rand Paul, whom he calls his \"political Doppelgänger\". He also praises the late trade union leader Bob Crow, whom he claims was the only trade unionist who did not support big government and mass immigration.\n\nHe also goes on to allege that the Conservative Party is intercepting communications by UKIP politicians. Farage stated in the book that if not elected as MP for South Thanet in the 2015 general election, he would quit as UKIP leader. The book ends by saying \"So over to you, dear voter. It is all down to you now\".\n\nReception\n\nThe Western Gazette noted that as the book had sold out on pre-orders, \"despite divided public opinion, plenty of people are keen to hear what the controversial politician has to say\".\n\nWriting for The Guardian, Nick Cohen said that the book revealed \"a small-minded man living in a bubble of self-aggrandisement\". He pointed out that Farage regularly pointed out individuals' ethnicity or nationality in a variety of situations, including surgeons and bar staff. In his opinion, Farage had \"relentless\" self-pity, exemplified by his claim that he could have become wealthier had he stayed in commodity trading rather than entering politics. However, he pointed out that left-wing criticism of Farage and UKIP was becoming counter-productive, with too-frequent accusations of prejudice leading to the left being seen as having a \"hectoring and joyless culture\". \n\nThe Independents John Rentoul criticised how Farage spelt the word \"Revolution\" with the word \"Love\" reversed, likening it to the \"mindless anti-politics\" of anti-voting activist Russell Brand, who had also used it on his own book. He was not impressed by Farage saying that he had not changed his political views since leaving Dulwich College in 1982, \"not something of which a self-aware person would be proud\". Rentoul however stated that he supports Farage's Euroscepticism from a left-wing perspective, and saw it as a reason why UKIP were gaining support in Labour-dominated areas. \n\nAnn Treneman of the New Statesman criticised how Farage made his statements on the National Health Service off his own personal experiences. She said that the book \"would be an absolute hoot, if only it were parody\".\nQuestion:\nThe Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything is a memoir by which current politician\nAnswer:\nNigel Faraje\n", "answers": ["K249DR", "KENT", "KAZZ (AM)"], "length": 2979, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a5719ddf7c824e782242b1b5e36d837ec83d36095f4d54b8"}

Hosted by comedian Marcus Brigstocke, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out experiences that are new to them, but common to many others. The title comes from the show's producer and creator, Bill Dare, having never seen the Star Wars films.  The series has been the subject of controversy due to the questionable taste of some of the experiences.  \n\nThe show has been adapted for television and was first broadcast on BBC Four in early 2009. \n\nFormat\n\nEach episode features a guest presenting a list of things to Brigstocke that, until coming on the show, they had never done before but many others have. Generally the show is structured around one each of certain types of experiences; reading a new book, listening to some new music, watching a new film or television programme (for all of these, the guest is often given an example of a genre they've never sampled before), eating a new food and taking part in a new leisure activity. Examples of the latter include comedian Phill Jupitus having his first colonic irrigation, magician Paul Daniels learning how to swim and Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor buying his first pornographic magazine. \n\nReception\n\nThe series has a mixed reception. Critics have praised the format. Chris Campling said I've Never Seen Star Wars is, \"one of the most invigorating new comedy series of the 21st century.\" \n\nElisabeth Mahoney in The Guardian wrote about Jupitus' appearance saying: \"He also tried colonic irrigation, and the recording of that was one of the funniest bits of radio this year. The therapist explained the process in a deadpan manner that was quite majestic, especially when she let her \"tubing clamps\" make their worrying sound effect. Jupitus fretted that she'd find \"some hidden G-spot of delight\" and that he'd become \"sexually addicted to having my arse pumped out\". Rather worryingly, then, he has already booked his next appointment.\" \n\nHowever, the series has been attacked because of some of the experiences which have appeared. Jupitus' colonic irrigation and eating foie gras, and Brooke-Taylor buying pornography are amongst the moments which have been cause for complaint. Dare appeared on BBC Radio 4's listener complaints show Feedback to defend I've Never Seen Star Wars. Dare stated the choices were all made by the guests and were not designed to offend listeners. During the interview with host Roger Bolton, Dare was asked, \"if he could reassure listeners that there'd be no heavy breathing in future.\" Dare mocked  both Feedback and Bolton saying: \"Only if we get an asthmatic on, I suppose.

This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the hurricane which hit the East Coast of America in August 2011?\nAnswer:\nEirene\nPassage:\nLambert Simnel\nLambert Simnel (ca. 1477 – ca. 1525) was a pretender to the throne of England. His claim to be the Earl of Warwick in 1487 threatened the newly established reign of King Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509). Simnel became the figurehead of a Yorkist rebellion organised by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln. The rebellion was crushed in 1487. Simnel was pardoned, and was thereafter employed in the Royal kitchens as a servant. \n\nEarly life\n\nSimnel was born around 1477. His real name is not known – contemporary records call him John, not Lambert, and even his surname is suspect.  Different sources have different claims of his parentage, from a baker and tradesman to organ builder. Most definitely, he was of humble origin. At the age of about ten, he was taken as a pupil by an Oxford-trained priest named Richard Simon (or Richard Symonds / Richard Simons / William Symonds) who apparently decided to become a kingmaker. He tutored the boy in courtly manners and contemporaries described the boy as handsome. He was taught the necessary etiquette and was well educated by Simon.James A. Williamson, The Tudor Age, D. McKay Co., New York, 1961, p.25  One contemporary described him as \"a boy so learned, that, had he ruled, he would have as a learned man.\"\n\nPretender\n\nSimon noticed a striking resemblance between Lambert and the sons of Edward IV, so he initially intended to present Simnel as Richard, Duke of York, son of King Edward IV, the younger of the vanished Princes in the Tower.  However, when he heard rumours that the Earl of Warwick had died during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, he changed his mind. The real Warwick was a boy of about the same age and had a claim to the throne as the son of the Duke of Clarence, King Edward IV's brother.\n\nAccording to James A. Williamson, Simnel was merely a figurehead for a rebellion that was already being planned by the Yorkists:\n \nHe was merely a commonplace tool to be used for important ends, and the attempt to overthrow Henry VII would have taken place had Simnel never existed. The Yorkist leaders were determined on a serious push, rising of their party in England supported by as great a force as possible from overseas. \n\nSimon spread a rumour that Warwick had actually escaped from the Tower and was under his guardianship. He gained some support from Yorkists.  He took Simnel to Ireland where there was still support for the Yorkist cause, and presented him to the head of the Irish government, the Earl of Kildare. Kildare was willing to support the story and invade England to overthrow King Henry. Simnel was paraded through the streets, carried on the shoulders of \"the tallest man of the time\", an individual called D'Arcy of Platten.  On 24 May 1487, Simnel was crowned in Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin as \"King Edward VI\".  He was about ten years old.  Lord Kildare collected an army of Irish soldiers under the command of his younger brother, Thomas FitzGerald of Laccagh.\n\nThe Earl of Lincoln, formerly the designated successor of the late King Richard III, joined the conspiracy against Henry VII. He fled to Burgundy, where Warwick's aunt Margaret of York, the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy, kept her court. Lincoln claimed that he had taken part in young Warwick's supposed escape. He also met Viscount Lovell, who had supported a failed Yorkist uprising in 1486. Margaret collected 2,000 Flemish mercenaries and shipped them to Ireland under the command of Martin Schwartz, a noted military leader of the time. They arrived in Ireland on 5 May. King Henry was informed of this and began to gather troops.\n\nSimnel's army — mainly Flemish and Irish troops — landed on Piel Island in the Furness area of Lancashire on 5 June 1487 and were joined by some English supporters. However, most local nobles, with the exception of Sir Thomas Broughton, did not join them. They clashed with the King's army on 16 June at the Battle of Stoke Field and were defeated. Lincoln, Thomas FitzGerald and Sir Thomas Broughton were killed. Lovell went missing; there were rumours that he had escaped and hidden to avoid retribution. Simons avoided execution due to his priestly status, but was imprisoned for life. Kildare, who had remained in Ireland, was pardoned.\n\nLater life\n\nKing Henry pardoned young Simnel (probably because he had mostly been a puppet in the hands of adults) and gave him a job in the royal kitchen as a spit-turner. When he grew older, he became a falconer. Almost no information about his later life is known. He died some time between 1525 and 1535. He seems to have married, as he is probably the father of Richard Simnel, a canon of St Osyth's Priory in Essex during the reign of Henry VIII.Weir, Alison, The Princes in the Tower, Vintage, 2008, p.234.\n\nCultural depictions\n\nIn the 1972 BBC serial The Shadow of the Tower Simnel was portrayed by Gary Warren.\nQuestion:\nLambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck were pretenders to the English throne during the reign of which King?\nAnswer:\nSolomon of England\nPassage:\nmeaning - What does c/o stand for in a postal address ...\nmeaning - What does c/o stand for in a postal address? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange\nup vote 3 down vote\nIn the UK, \"Co.\" would normally stand for \"Company\", at the end of a company name.\nDespite the non-capitalisation of \"co.\" in the title, my first thought was \"Joe Black Company\".

{"input": "Passage:\nList of FA Cup finals\nThe Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is a knockout competition in English football, organised by and named after The Football Association (the FA). It is the oldest existing football competition in the world,  having commenced in the 1871–72 season. The tournament is open to all clubs in the top 10 levels of the English football league system, although a club's home stadium must meet certain requirements prior to entering the tournament.  The competition culminates at the end of the league season usually in May with the FA Cup Final, officially named The Football Association Challenge Cup Final Tie, which has traditionally been regarded as the showpiece finale of the English football season. \n\nAll of the final venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played at the original Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The new stadium of the same name has been the permanent venue of the final since 2007. Other venues used for the final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001–2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took place if the initial match ended in a draw.\n\nAs of 2016, the record for the most wins is held by Arsenal and Manchester United with 12 victories. The cup has been won by the same team in two or more consecutive years on ten occasions, and four teams have won consecutive finals more than once: Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The cup has been won by a non-English team once. The cup is currently held by Manchester United, who defeated Crystal Palace in the 2016 final.\n\nHistory\n\nThe winners of the first tournament were Wanderers, a team of former public schoolboys based in London, who went on to win the competition five times in its first seven seasons. The early winners of the competition were all teams of wealthy amateurs from the south of England,  but in 1883, Blackburn Olympic became the first team from the north to win the cup, defeating Old Etonians. Upon his team's return to Blackburn, Olympic captain Albert Warburton proclaimed: \"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London.\" \n\nWith the advent of professionalism at around the same time, the amateur teams quickly faded from prominence in the competition. The leading professional clubs formed The Football League in 1888.  Since then, one non-league team has won the cup. Tottenham Hotspur, then of the Southern League, defeated Sheffield United of The Football League to win the 1901 final.  A year later Sheffield United returned to the final and won the cup, which then remained in the hands of Northern and Midland clubs until Tottenham won it again in 1921. In 1927, Cardiff City, a team which plays in the English football league system despite being based in Wales, won the cup, the only non-English club to do so.  Scottish club Queens Park reached the final twice in the early years of the competition.\n\nNewcastle United enjoyed a brief spell of FA Cup dominance in the 1950s, winning the trophy three times in five years, and in the 1960s, Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed a similar spell of success, with three wins in seven seasons. This marked the start of a successful period for London-based clubs, with 11 wins in 22 seasons.  Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980. Sunderland won the cup in 1973, Southampton repeated the feat in 1976, and West Ham United won in 1980, the most recent victory by a team from outside the top division. Since Wimbledon's win in 1988,  the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs of English football,  Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, have between them won the cup 22 times in 27 seasons.\n\nFinals\n\nUntil 1999, a draw in the final would result in the match being replayed at a later date;  since then the final has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout as required.  As of 2015 a penalty shoot-out has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.\n\nKey\n\nAll teams are English, except where marked  (Scottish) or  (Welsh).\n\nResults\n\nA.  The official attendance for the 1923 final was reported as 126,047, but the actual figure is believed to be anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000.  \n\nResults by team\n\nTeams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887. \n\nA.  Sheffield Wednesday's total includes two wins and one defeat under the earlier name of The Wednesday.\nB.  Wimbledon relocated in 2004 from south London to Milton Keynes rebranding the club as Milton Keynes Dons, but the current incarnation of the club contends that it was founded in 2004 and does not lay claim to the history or honours (including the FA Cup win) of Wimbledon.\nQuestion:\nWho were the first ever winners of the FA Cup, in 1872?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTagus\nThe Tagus (; ; ; Ancient Greek: Τάγος Tagos) is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula.  It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.\n\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank.  The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nCourse\n\nIn Spain\n\nThe first notable city on the Tagus is Sacedón. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama,  Henares, Algodor and Tajuña.  Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River.  Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche.  At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdecañas, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Tiétar, and the lower reservoir, the Alcántara Dam into which flows the Alagón at the lower end.\n\nThere is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.\n\nIn Portugal\n\nAfter forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de Ródão, Abrantes, Constância, Entroncamento, Santarém and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.\n\nThe Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from além Tejo \"Beyond the Tagus\" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying \"Upper Tagus\".\n\nGeology\n\nThe lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. \n\nHistory\n\nThe Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. \n\nPopular culture\n\nA major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: \n\"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village...\" \n\nRichard Crashaw's poem \"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\" refers to the \"Golden\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).\nQuestion:\nThrough which European capital city does the River Tagus flow?\nAnswer:\nCapital of Portugal\nPassage:\nDear John (U.S. TV series)\nDear John is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from 1988 to 1992. The series was originally based on the British sitcom of the same name. Dear John was retitled Dear John USA when it was shown in the UK. During its four-season run, the series was bounced to and from various time periods on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. The series moved from its post-Cheers slot on Thursdays to a post-Night Court slot on Wednesdays in 1990.\n\nReruns were syndicated to various local stations shortly after Dear John ended its run in 1992, which continued until 2004.  The series also aired on E! for a brief period in the late-1990s. As of December 2015, it is shown on digital TV network Antenna TV.\n\nSynopsis\n\nDear John starred Judd Hirsch as easygoing Drake Prep high school teacher John Lacey who is dumped by his wife, Wendy, via a Dear John letter. Wendy ends up with everything in the divorce settlement, including custody of the couple's son, forcing John to move into an apartment in Rego Park, Queens.\n\nJohn soon joins the One-2-One Club, a self-help group for divorced, widowed or lonely people. The group is led by Louise (Jane Carr), a sex-obsessed British woman. Other members of the group include Kate McCarron (Isabella Hofmann), a sweet divorcée; Kirk Morris (Jere Burns), a cocky ladies' man; Ralph Drang (Harry Groener), a shy and neurotic tollbooth collector; Bonnie Philbert (Billie Bird), a feisty senior citizen; Tom, Mrs. Philbert's quiet boyfriend (Tom Willett); and young Southern transplant Mary Beth Sutton (Susan Walters).\n\nAwards\n\nIn 1989, Cleavon Little won an Emmy Award for his role in the episode \"Stand By Your Man\". \n\nRatings\n\n*1988-89: #11\n*1989-90: #18\n*1990-91: #50\n*1991-92: #77\nQuestion:\nIn the TV series Dear John what was John’s job\nAnswer:\nTeachings\nPassage:\nHerpetology\nHerpetology (from Greek \"herpien\" meaning \"to creep\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras).  Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.\n\nHerpetology is concerned with poikilothermic, ectothermic tetrapods. Under this definition \"herps\" (or sometimes \"herptiles\" or \"herpetofauna\") exclude fish, but it is not uncommon for herpetological and ichthyological scientific societies to \"team up\", publishing joint journals and holding conferences in order to foster the exchange of ideas between the fields. One of the most prestigious organizations, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, is an example of this. Many herpetological societies exist today, having been formed to promote interest in reptiles and amphibians both captive and wild.\n\nHerpetology offers benefits to humanity in the study of the role of amphibians and reptiles in global ecology, especially because amphibians are often very sensitive to environmental changes, offering a visible warning to humans that significant changes are taking place. Some toxins and venoms produced by reptiles and amphibians are useful in human medicine. Currently, some snake venom has been used to create anti-coagulants that work to treat stroke victims and heart-attack cases.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word \"herpetology\" is from Greek: ἑρπετόν, herpeton, \"creeping animal\" and , -logia, \"knowledge\". People with an avid interest in herpetology and who keep different reptiles or amphibians often refer to themselves as \"herpers\". \n\n\"Herp\" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term \"herpetile\", with roots back to Linnaeus's classification of animals, in which he grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class. There are over 6700 species of amphibians  and over 9000 species of reptiles.  In spite of its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians.\n\nCareers\n\nCareer options in the field of herpetology include, but are not limited to lab research, field studies and survey, zoological staff, museum staff and college teaching.\n\nIn modern academic science, it is rare for individuals to consider themselves a herpetologist first and foremost. Most individuals focus on a particular field such as ecology, evolution, taxonomy, physiology, or molecular biology, and within that field ask questions pertaining to or best answered by examining reptiles and amphibians. For example, an evolutionary biologist who is also a herpetologist may choose to work on an issue such as evolution of warning coloration in coral snakes.\n\nModern herpetological writers of note include Mark O'Shea and Philip Purser. Modern herpetological showmen of note include Jeff Corwin, Steve Irwin, popularly known as the \"Crocodile Hunter\", and the star Austin Stevens, popularly known as 'AustinSnakeman' in the TV series Austin Stevens: Snakemaster.\n\nStudy\n\nMost colleges or universities do not offer a major in herpetology at the undergraduate or even the graduate level. Instead, persons interested in herpetology select a major in the biological sciences. The knowledge learned about all aspects of the biology of animals is then applied to an individual study of herpetology.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the study of reptiles called?\nAnswer:\nHerp\nPassage:\nNautical mile\nA nautical mile is a unit of measurement defined as 1852 meters (6,076.12 feet or 1.2 statute miles). Historically, it was defined as one sixtieth of the distance between two parallels of latitude separated by one degree. Today it is an SI derived unit, being rounded to an even number of meters  and remains in use for both air and marine  navigation  and for the definition of territorial waters. \n\nThe derived unit of speed is the knot, defined as one nautical mile per hour. The geographical mile is the length of one minute of longitude along the Equator, about 1,855.325 m on the WGS 84 ellipsoid.\n\nUnit symbol \n\nThere is no internationally agreed symbol.\n* M is used as the abbreviation for the nautical mile by the International Hydrographic Organization  and by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures \n* NM is used by the International Civil Aviation Organization. \n* nmi is used by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  and the United States Government Publishing Office. \n* nm is used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n\nHistory \n\nThe word mile is from the Latin word for a thousand paces: mīlia. Navigation at sea was done by eye  until around 1500 when navigational instruments were developed and cartographers began using a coordinate system with parallels of latitude and meridians of Longitude. In 1617 the Dutch scientist Snell assessed the circumference at 24,630 Roman miles (24,024 statute miles). Around that time British mathematician Edmund Gunter improved navigational tools including a new quadrant to determine latitude at sea. He reasoned that the lines of latitude could be used as the basis for a unit of measurement for distance and proposed the nautical mile as one minute or one-sixtieth () of one degree of latitude. As one degree is  of a circle, one minute of arc is  of a circle (or, in radians, ). These sexagesimal (base 60) units originated in Babylonian astronomy. Gunter used Snell's circumference to define a nautical mile as 6,080 feet, the length of one minute of arc at 48 degrees latitude. Since the earth is not a perfect sphere but is an oblate spheroid with slightly flattened poles, a minute of latitude is not constant, but about  at the poles and  at the Equator, with a mean value of . Other countries measure the minute of arc at 45 degrees latitude, giving the nautical mile a length of 6,076 feet.\n\nIn 1929, the international nautical mile was defined by the First International Extraordinary Hydrographic Conference, Monaco (1929) as 1,852 meters.\n\nImperial units and United States customary units used a definition of the nautical mile based on the Clarke (1866) Spheroid. The United States nautical mile was defined as  based in the Mendenhall Order foot of 1893. It was abandoned in favour of the international nautical mile in 1954. \n\nThe Imperial nautical mile, often called an Admiralty mile, or more correctly, an Admiralty measured mile, was defined by its relation to the Admiralty knot, 6,080 imperial feet per hour, so 1 imperial nautical mile is about 1,853.181 meters.  It was abandoned in 1970 and, legally, references to the obsolete unit are now converted to 1,853 meters.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the nautical measurement of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour?\nAnswer:\nKnots\n", "answers": ["The Wanderer", "Wanderer (disambiguation)", "The Wanderer (album)", "Wanderer", "Wanderer (album)", "The Wanderer (song)", "Wanderers", "The Wanderer (disambiguation)", "WANDERERS", "The wanderers", "The Wanderers", "The Wanderer (novel)", "The Wanderers (novel)"], "length": 2967, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d3f8c92fa9344b00c0a12320fa42bc986a3049e38e067906"}

On Oct. 29, 1998, at the age of 77, he became the oldest person ever to fly in space, a hero of the Cold War stepping forward this time as a role model for the geriatric generation -- and to satisfy an unending yearning.\nQuestion:\nIn 1998 at the age of 77 who became the oldest person to fly in space?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nGland\nA gland is an organ in an animal's body that synthesizes substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland).\n\nStructure\n\nDevelopment\n\nEvery gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface. This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.\n\nAs growth proceeds, the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another, but in one instance, the liver, this does occur when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.\n\nGlands are classified according to their shape.\n* If the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland.\n* In the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar or saccular glands.\n\nFunction\n\nGlands are divided based on their function into two groups:\n\nEndocrine glands\n\nEndocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the blood stream. These glands that secrete their products through the basal lamina into the blood stream and lack a duct system. These glands often secrete hormones, and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.\n\nExocrine glands\n \n\nExocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer surface of the body, such as the skin or the human gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:\n* Apocrine glands a portion of the secreting cell's body is lost during secretion. Apocrine gland is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands, however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion. e.g. mammery gland, sweat gland of arm pit, pubic region, skin around anus, lips, nipples.\n* Holocrine glands the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances (e.g., sebaceous glands)sebaceous, meibomiun & zeis gland.\n* Merocrine glands cells secrete their substances by exocytosis (e.g., mucous and serous glands). Also called \"eccrine\". e.g. max sweat gland of humans, goblet cells, salivary gland, tear gland, intestinal glands.\n\nThe type of secretory product of exocrine glands may also be one of three categories:\n* Serous glands secrete a watery, often protein-rich, fluid-like product, e.g. sweat glands.\n* Mucous glands secrete a viscous product, rich in carbohydrates (such as glycoproteins), e.g. goblet cells.\n* Sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian glands.\n\nClinical significance\n\nOther animals\n\nAdditional images\n\n Image:Gray1025.png|Section of submaxillary gland of kitten.

In English-speaking countries it is generally known as \"Here Comes the Bride\" or \"Wedding March\", though \"wedding march\" refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\". The piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858. \n\nThe chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to the bridal chamber.\n\nText\n\nAlthough at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without vocal singing, in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three.\n\nEight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody.\n\nThe chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage.\n\nReligious attitudes \n\nMany pastors of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod oppose the \"Bridal Chorus\" because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner's operas.  The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the \"Bridal Chorus\"; one diocese's guidelines regarding the chorus states that the chorus is a secular piece of music, that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.

It is not unique to the modern kingdom of Cambodia: the same name (i.e. Kamboj/Kambuja) is also found in Burmese and Thai chronicles referring to regions within those kingdoms. In the Indian chronicles the Kambuja were a barbarian (in the sense of non-Indian) people in the area of modern Afghanistan. \"The application to Southeast Asia has no ethnic content and does not imply any migration of peoples from the original Kambuja; the most likely explanation is that, when Indian traders and Brahmins came into contact with local populations some two thousand years ago, they gave them the names of regions which, in their view, were similarly marginal and remote: the peoples of Southeast Asia, like the barbarian Kamboja, had no castes, did not observe proper food prohibitions and had different rules for marriage.\"  An origin-myth recorded in the Baksei Chamkrong inscription, dated AD 947, derives Kambuja from Svayambhuva Kamboj, a legendary Indian sage who reached the Indochina peninsula and married a naga princess named Mera, thus uniting the Indian and local races. In this story Kambuja derives from Kambu+ja, and means \"descendants of Kambu.\" \n\nPreah Reachanachâk Kampuchea means \"Kingdom of Cambodia\". Etymologically, its components are: Preah- (\"sacred\"); -reach- (\"king, royal, realm\", from Sanskrit); -ana- (from Pāli ', \"authority, command, power\"); -châk (from Sanskrit chakra, meaning \"wheel\", a symbol of power and rule).\n\nThe name used on formal occasions, such as political speeches and news programs, is Prâteh Kampuchea (), literally \"the Country of Cambodia\".

It is located in the central section of the Lost River Range, within the Challis National Forest in eastern Custer County.\n\nThe mountain was nameless until it was discovered to be higher than Hyndman Peak, previously regarded as the state's highest point. In February 1934, the U.S. Geological Survey named it for William Borah, the prominent senior U.S. Senator from Idaho, who had served for nearly 27 years at the time and was dean of the Senate. An outspoken isolationist, the \"Lion of Idaho\" ran for president two years later in 1936, but did not win the Republican nomination, and died in office in 1940.\n\n1983 earthquake\n\nThe 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on October 28 at 8:06:09 local time in the Lost River Range at Borah Peak in central Idaho, United States, measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale.  Mount Borah rose about 1 foot (.3 m) and the Lost River Valley in that vicinity dropped about 8 feet (2.4 m.).http://www.nps.gov/crmo/learn/nature/geologicactivity.htm  The peak was scarred on the western side, and the mark is still visible.  Two children in Challis were the only fatalities of the quake, struck by falling masonry while walking to elementary school.\n\nClimbing\n\nThe normal route involves ascending 5,262 vertical feet (1604 m) from the trailhead to the summit in just over 3.5 miles (5.6 km). This route on the southwest ridge, the most popular route, is a strenuous hike for the most part until one reaches a Class 4 arête just before the main summit crest. This point is known as Chickenout Ridge as many people will abort the attempt once they see the hazards up close. In the cooler seasons this crossing usually involves a traverse over snow, with steeply slanting slopes on either side. An ice axe, and the ability to use it, is recommended for this section when icy.\n\nBorah Peak's north face is one of Idaho's only year-round snow climbs and provides a much greater challenge than the normal route.  The face features a number of grade II class 5 routes on mixed terrain.\n\nThree climbers have died on Borah Peak.  Two climbers ascending the northwest ridge in 1977 were killed in an avalanche.  Another climber in 1987 lost his life on a glissade during descent.\n\nFile:Borah Peak ID view.webm|View from the summit\nFile:BorahPeakID.jpg|Borah Peak, looking east\nQuestion:\nBorah Peak is the highest mountain in which US state?\nAnswer:\nGovernment of Idaho\nPassage:\nEpitaph to a Dog\n\"Epitaph to a Dog\" (also sometimes referred to as \"Inscription on the Monument to a Newfoundland Dog\") is a poem by the British poet Lord Byron. It was written in 1808 in honour of his Newfoundland dog, Boatswain, who had just died of rabies.  When Boatswain contracted the disease, Byron reportedly nursed him without any fear of becoming bitten and infected.  The poem is inscribed on Boatswain's tomb, which is larger than Byron's, at Newstead Abbey,  Byron's estate. \n\nThe sections above the poem form a memorial eulogy to Boatswain, and introduce the poem. They are often assumed to form part of the poem but were written not by Byron but by his friend John Hobhouse.[https://atkinsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/epitaph-to-a-dog/ Atkins booskshelf: Epitaph to a Dog], 2012, accessed 11 May 2016 A letter of 1830 by Hobhouse suggests that Byron had planned to use the last two lines of his poem by way of an introductory inscription, but found he preferred Hobhouse's comparison of the attributes of dogs and people.\n\nEpitaph to a Dog  \n\nNear this Spot\nare deposited the Remains of one\nwho possessed Beauty without Vanity,\nStrength without Insolence,\nCourage without Ferocity,\nand all the virtues of Man without his Vices.\n\nThis praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery\nif inscribed over human Ashes,\nis but a just tribute to the Memory of\nBoatswain, a Dog\nwho was born in Newfoundland May 1803\nand died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808\n\nWhen some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,\nUnknown to Glory, but upheld by Birth,\nThe sculptor’s art exhausts the pomp of woe,\nAnd storied urns record who rests below.\nWhen all is done, upon the Tomb is seen,\nNot what he was, but what he should have been.\nBut the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,\nThe first to welcome, foremost to defend,\nWhose honest heart is still his Master’s own,\nWho labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,\nUnhonoured falls, unnoticed all his worth,\nDenied in heaven the Soul he held on earth –\nWhile man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,\nAnd claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.\n\nOh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,\nDebased by slavery, or corrupt by power –\nWho knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,\nDegraded mass of animated dust!\nThy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,\nThy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!\nBy nature vile, ennobled but by name,\nEach kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.\nYe, who behold perchance this simple urn,\nPass on – it honours none you wish to mourn.\nTo mark a friend’s remains these stones arise;\nI never knew but one -- and here he lies.\nQuestion:\nWhich poet had a dog called Boatswain?\nAnswer:\n6th Lord Byron\n", "answers": ["Islands of Spain", "España", "Reino de España", "Name of Spain", "Espagna", "Espańa", "Reino de Espana", "Espana", "Kingdom of the Spains", "The Spanish Society", "Espainia", "Mountains of Spain", "Regne d'Espanya", "The kingdom of Spain", "SPAIN", "Regne d'Espanha", "Espanya", "Espainiako Erresuma", "Etymology of Spain", "Spane", "ISO 3166-1:ES", "Spain", "Spanish Kingdom", "Kingdom of Spain", "El Reino de España", "El Reino de Espana"], "length": 1438, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "108c5fba3e6f442ee6e0a2e9495934a7e1ac483c1f4fadc2"}

She now writes health and fitness-related articles. Parr earned a diploma of adult nursing from the University of Brighton, followed by a postgraduate certificate in public health from the University of Manchester.\nCalcium plays an essential role in blood clotting. Photo Credit boiling blood image by Adrian Hillman from <a href=\"http://www.fotolia.com\">Fotolia.com</a>\nYour body uses calcium not only to keep teeth and bones strong, but also to enable muscles to contract, to assist in the transmission of neural impulses and to maintain cell membrane stability and permeability. It is also an important part of the blood clotting process and because your body is unable to generate calcium, it is important that you have adequate daily intake.\nThe Clotting Process\nWhenever your skin becomes broken, the sticky platelets contained in the blood form clots to stop blood flow. Calcium works together with vitamin K and a protein called fibrinogen in the clotting cascade. Without adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K, blood will take longer to clot, and if both nutrients are missing you might bleed to death. Most people gain enough calcium and vitamin K from their diets, but in some cases supplements may be prescribed.\nThe Clotting Cascade\nAs soon as blood from a wound is exposed to the air, the platelets disintegrate and react with fibrinogen to create fibrin: a mass of tiny threads. This triggers a whole series of reactions that rely on adequate levels of calcium and vitamin K to work. The fibrin hardens very quickly to form a scab over the wound.\nFoods that Contain Calcium\nSpinach and other dark green vegetables contain high levels of calcium. Photo Credit Blattspinat image by Yvonne Bogdanski from Fotolia.com\nLow-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese contain a lot of calcium, and you will also find calcium in dried beans, tofu, spinach, broccoli and dark green vegetables. Certain cereals, vegan dairy substitutes and juices may be fortified with it. You must get an adequate daily intake of vitamin D to assist your body's absorption of calcium, so make sure that if you take calcium supplements, they contain vitamin D as well.\nRecommended Intake\nAdults under the age of 50 need around 1,000 mg calcium each day while older adults need around 1,200 mg each day. Children and adolescents need a higher intake of calcium because they grow rapidly. Those under 10 should get around 400 to 800 mg each day and those aged 11 to 24 need around 1,200 to 1,500 mg every day.\nDo I Need Extra Calcium?\nMost people gain enough calcium from their diet, but if you don't you could be prescribed dietary supplements. Photo Credit Fallen brown bottle of last yellow pills isolated on white image by Olga Sapegina from Fotolia.com\nMost people gain enough calcium by eating a healthy and varied diet, but those at risk include menopausal women who may be at risk of rapid bone loss, vegetarians and those who are lactose intolerant because they may not be getting enough calcium from their diets. If you feel that you may be at risk contact your family physician.\nMeeting Your Calcium Needs\nSome cereals are fortified with calcium. Photo Credit rural life(cereals) image by Aleksandr Popov from Fotolia.com\nIf you have been told that you need to increase your calcium intake, try using low-fat or fat-free milk to make mashed potatoes, puddings and smoothies. Add low-fat or fat-free cheese to meals or try calcium-fortified tofu with fried vegetables or meat. Include other calcium-fortified foods such as cereals and drinks in your diet.\nRelated Searches\nLose Weight.

It involved forcing a patient to watch, through the use of specula to hold the eyes open, violent images for long periods, while under the effect of a nausea-, paralysis-, and fear-inducing drug. The aim of the therapy was to condition the patient to experience severe nausea when experiencing or even thinking about violence, thus creating an aversion to violent behaviour. \n\nThe therapy renders the protagonist of the novel, Alex, incapable of violence even in self-defense, and unable to touch a naked woman or think about having sexual intercourse.  In the original novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all classical music due to the background score of the films. In the 1971 film, he is conditioned only against Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. \"Ludovico\" is the Italian equivalent of the German name \"Ludwig\"; it is possible the name was selected for this reason.\n\nFilm critic Thomas Nelson has compared this brainwashing technique with the recruit training in Kubrick's later film Full Metal Jacket. He notes that the latter produces a contrasting effect when one of the recruits (Leonard Lawrence) becomes conditioned, during boot camp training, to become a violent killing machine who associates his sexuality with his rifle.  \n\nIn popular culture \n\nThe reference from A Clockwork Orange is shown in the Simpsons episode, \"Dog of Death\", when the family dog Santa's Little Helper runs away from home and is soon trained by Mr. Burns to become a vicious guard dog by being forced to watch a film featuring abuse to dogs while listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nA second reference to the Ludovico technique in The Simpsons appears in the \"Treehouse of Horror XXV\" episode, where Moe's eyes are forced open with specula so he could watch Fox, part of a series of jokes about the Fox network. Yet another parodies Alex`s attempt to fondle a naked woman`s breasts after the treatment, where Bart reaches for two cupcakes, and proceeds to faint in the same manner as Alex in the season 4 episode, ``Duffless``.\n\nIn the \"Phineas and Ferb\" episode \"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\", the 2 namesake characters are shown experiencing the technique, this version forcing them to ignore their natural creativity. Their friend Baljeet is also seen going through this, but doesn't seem to care, as he is seen eating popcorn and claiming \"the book was so much better.\"\n\nIn the opening intro to Robot Chicken, the mad scientists uses this technique on the robotic chicken, forcing it to watch a wall of television sets showing various clips of the cartoon show.\n\nAnother reference was in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Once Bitten\", Brian is seen experiencing this, showing things dogs would fear (including a picture of Michael Vick) to successfully force him into being more submissive.\n\nAnother reference from A Clockwork Orange is shown in the Archer episode, \"A Going Concern\" when Dr. Krieger, at Archer's request, uses a Modified Ludovico to brainwash Len Trexler as a measure to prevent Mallory from selling ISIS to ODIN.\n\nYet another reference exists in the video game The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which contains an item called The Ludovico Technique and depicts Isaac as wearing a specula similar to the one used in the film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange. \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nAn aversion therapy called the 'Ludovico technique' from the 1971 classic A Clockwork Orange features which composer's music? Kudos if you can name the piece too.\nAnswer:\nBeethoven symphony 9\nPassage:\nDendrophilia (paraphilia)\nDendrophilia (or less often arborphilia or dendrophily) literally means \"love of trees\".

This may involve sexual contact or veneration as phallic symbols or both.\nQuestion:\nDendrophilia is the love of what?\nAnswer:\nSapling\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.  This is illustrated in the photo below by the yellow line.\nAbove: The height of a horse is properly measured, in inches,  from the ground to the highest point of the withers.\nFor the most accurate measurement the horse should be on firm, level  ground with its front feet even, or close to even.\nCalculating The Results\nAfter you have measured your horse you will need to  convert the results from inches to \"hands.\" Horse height is correctly referred  to by a unit of measurement  known as a \"hand.\" One hand is equal to four inches.\nThe gray mare in the photo above is 58 inches from the ground  to the top of her withers. When 58 is divided by 4, you have 14.5. The 14 is the  number of hands, and the .5 means another half of a hand, or another 2 inches. This means  she is 14 and one-half hands tall.\nCorrectly Writing And Speaking The Results\nThe correct way of writing \"14 and one-half hands\" is to write \"14.2\". It is not correct to write it as \"14.5\". When  correctly written, the number before the period is the  number of hands, and the number after the period is the remaining number of   inches. The number after the period should NOT stand for a fraction. Horseman  usually say a measurement like this one out loud as \"fourteen two\" or \"fourteen  and a half.\"\nA Few Examples\nBelow are a few examples of how to correctly   write down a horse's height. Remember, the number in front of the period is for  hands and the number after the period is the remaining inches.\n15 - This is a correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.0 - Another correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands tall\n15.1 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 1  inch tall\n15.2 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 2  inches tall\n15.3 - This is the correct way of writing that a horse is 15 hands, 3  inches tall\n15.4 - Wrong! This means that a horse is 15 hands, 4 inches tall. Since  a hand is equal to four inches, this horse is actually 16 hands tall.\n15.5 - Wrong again! Some people incorrectly use the number after the  period to stand for fractions of a hand, but it should stand for inches. So,  some people write \"15.5\" to mean 15 and a half hands, but this should  correctly be written as \"15.2\".\nIf you like, you can add \"hh\" to a measurement, as in \"15.1hh\".  The \"hh\" stands for \"hands high.\"\nHorse Measuring Devices\nThere are measuring devices on the market for horses  that have hand and inches measurements marked on them. Some devices are rigid  poles with short cross bars toward the top that can be raised or lowered to rest on a  horse's withers. These are very handy and give accurate measurements easily.\nAnother common device is a horse height/weight tape , which is a special tape measure  with hands and inches marked on it. These are inexpensive and are accurate if the person doing the measuring  makes sure to run the tape straight up  and down, and to read the measurement at a level angle.\nWhere Did \"Hands\" Come From?\nAs stated above, a horse's height is measured in  hands. The origin of measuring a horse this way is very old, but easy to  understand. In days long ago people did not have the common measuring devices  (like tape measures, etc.) that we do today. To measure a horse, they used what  was handy (no pun intended): Their hands. At various times in history and in  different locales a \"hand\" was defined as the with of a person's hand  using the fingers only, the width of a person's hand using the fingers and the thumb, the  height of a clenched fist, and possibly others. Somewhere along the way, the  measuring unit of a hand was standardized to mean four inches. Though the  origins are ancient, a hand is still the unit of measurement for horses that  modern horse owners use today.\nQuestion:\nHow many inches are there in a Hand, the unit used to measure the height of a horse?\nAnswer:\nFOUR (New Zealand TV Channel)\nPassage:\nMillport, Cumbrae\nMillport (Scottish Gaelic: Port a' Mhuilinn) is the only town on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of North Ayrshire. The town is 4 mi south from the  Caledonian MacBrayne ferry slipway.\n\nTourism is an important aspect of the economy. Due to its small size, the island and its town are often linked in the minds of visitors and residents. Millport has the smallest extant cathedral in the British Isles. \n\nHistory\n\nThe [http://garrisonhousecumbrae.com Garrison House] in the centre of town, constructed in 1745, was formerly the barracks/Captain's mansion, then the home of the Earl of Glasgow, and is now in community ownership (see \"Current Developments\" below).\n\nDuring the development of the River Clyde as a main thoroughfare for goods, shipbuilding and smuggling, Millport was a strategic base for Customs and Excise. Several of the streets in Millport are named after crew members of the Revenue cutter Royal George.\n\nThe Victorian era was a period of rapid growth, both in terms of population, governance, amenities and property. To the west and east of the old harbour, many fine Victorian and Edwardian villas were built, along with new tenements. These still form the backbone of the housing stock.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Isles of the Scottish Episcopal Church, completed in 1851 and which seats only 100 people, is the smallest cathedral in Great Britain.   There are also claims that it is the smallest cathedral in Europe. \n\nCurrent developments\n\nThe Garrison House was badly damaged after an arson attack in 2001. Cumbrae Community Development Company, the local development trust, made a successful bid to the National Lottery and other funders to enable the building to be re-constructed for community benefit. After several years of work renovation of the property, including a partly glass roof, was completed in 2008 at a total cost of £5 million. It now houses the Museum of the Cumbraes, a library, council offices, a GP surgery and the Garrison Cafe.    The Garrison Model Rail Club, located in cabins on the grounds at Garrison House, welcomes visits to its model railway layouts each week. \n\nCurrently a large development of around 40 family sized homes is underway between the [http://millportbowlingclub.com Millport Bowling Club] and Penmachrie Farm. It is notable that the houses are being built primarily by private individuals - with the land having been sold off in the form of single plots.\n\nRetail facilities\n\nMillport has several independently owned shops. Amongst the shops available are newsagents, grocers, craft and gift shops, clothes shops, electrical and hardware stores. There are three cycle hire shops, with several hundred bicycles between them.\n\nThere is a Chinese restaurant,a chip shop and several other restaurants making eating out easy to come by.\n\nTourism\n\nMillport, along with Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, is famous with generations of daytrippers from Glasgow as one of the resorts visited going \"doon the watter\" (down the water), meaning taking a trip aboard a River Clyde paddle steamer. At one time it was common for visitors to stay for several weeks over the summer, however nowadays the primary tourist trade comes in the form of daytrippers. This is mostly due to the growth of package holidays to Spain and the Balearics in the 1960s. It is still possible to experience a traditional day out courtesy of  which calls at Millport twice a week during the summer, once originating at Ayr and once at Glasgow. One of the best known landmarks in Millport is the Crocodile Rock on the foreshore. It has been a feature since at least 1913, as it was that year that Robert Brown was acknowledged by the council for the work. \n\nThe town hosts the annual [http://millportcountryandwestern.co.uk Millport Country and Western Festival] during the first week in September, and a fireworks display is held during September Weekend. Millport has the world's narrowest house, The Wedge which at its front, measures just 47 inches or 1.19 metres. The house is 22 feet long by 11 feet wide at its widest point. \n\nMillport Bay contains a number of free-to-use visitor moorings, and is a popular destination for sailors in the summer. There is a small boat yard at the western end of the town.\n\nRecreation\n\nMillport has an 18-hole golf course, with spectacular views over the Arran hills. Other recreational facilities include a crazy golf course and two football pitches, one at either end of the town. For fishing, there are two fresh water reservoirs beside the golf course where fly fishing is available and excellent sea fishing, primarily for mackerel, is available. The best place for this is from the rocks at Farland Point, just inside the town limits.\n\nEducation\n\nFollowing closure of the University Marine Biological Station Millport run by the University of London (UoL) in 2013, Field Studies Council (FSC) began operation of FSC Millport field centre at the start of 2014.\n\nLocated on the eastern shore of the Isle of Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde, it is situated for marine biological teaching and research, sheltered and within easy reach of a variety of marine habitats, such as rocky, sandy and muddy shores, salt marshes, a large estuary, and deep water with soft mud, gravel and rocky bottoms. Despite this natural setting, Millport is only one hour's travel from major transport hubs.\nQuestion:\nMillport, home to the smallest cathedral in the British Isles, is the main community on which island, in the Firth of Clyde?\nAnswer:\nIsle of Cumbrae\nPassage:\nThe Persistence of Memory\nThe Persistence of Memory (; ) is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dalí, and is one of his most recognizable works.\n\nFirst shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture,  and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as 'The Soft Watches' or 'The Melting Watches'.\n\nDescription\n\nThe well-known \n piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch.  It epitomizes Dalí's theory of \"softness\" and \"hardness\", which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Ades wrote, \"The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order\".  This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert melting in the sun. \n\nIt is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange \"monster\" that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a \"fading\" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.\n\nThe orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.  \n\nThe Persistence of Memory employs \"the exactitude of realist painting techniques\"  to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.\n\nLandscape\n\nThe craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani. \n\nVersions\n\nDalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original Persistence of Memory remains at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the Persistence of Memory, the Nobility of Time, the Profile of Time and the Three Dancing Watches.\nQuestion:\nWhich everyday objects are featured in the painting 'The Persistence Of Memory'?\nAnswer:\nAnalog Clocks\nPassage:\nBrougham (carriage)\nA brougham (pronounced \"broom\" or \"brohm\") was a light, four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage built in the 19th century.The OED gives a first usage in 1851, but the original design dates from about 1838, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Brougham died in 1868.  It was named after Scottish jurist Lord Brougham, who had this type of carriage built to his specification by London coachbuilder Robinson & Cook in 1838 or 1839.  It had an enclosed body with two doors, like the rear section of a coach; it sat two, sometimes with an extra pair of fold-away seats in the front corners, and with a box seat in front for the driver and a footman or passenger. Unlike a coach, the carriage had a glazed front window, so that the occupants could see forward. The forewheels were capable of turning sharply. A variant, called a brougham-landaulet, had a top collapsible from the rear doors backward.Compare the landau.\n\nThree features specific to the Brougham were:\n# the sharply squared end of the roof at the back,\n# the body line curving forward at the base of the enclosure, and\n# low entry to the enclosure, using only one outside step below the door.\nQuestion:\nBrougham, Hackney, Buckboard, and Phaeton are horse-drawn vehicles with how many wheels each?\nAnswer:\nFour\n", "answers": ["Vitamin k 2", "Vitamin-K", "Vitamin K4", "Vitamin k", "Vit K", "Vitamin K", "List of foods containing Vitamin K"], "length": 3872, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "35d5132c126a2bef8991410216b5980a9c20273a9ff1ab1a"}

The airport is  west of Keflavík and 50 km southwest of Reykjavík. The airport has three runways, two of which are in use, and the airport area is about 25 km2. Most international journeys to or from Iceland pass through this airport.\n\nThe main carriers at Keflavík are Icelandair and WOW air, each of which has the airport as its main hub. The airport is almost exclusively used for international flights; most domestic flights use Reykjavík Airport, which lies 3 km from Reykjavík's city centre, although seasonal flights from Akureyri fly to Keflavík. Keflavík Airport is operated by Isavia, a government enterprise.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\n\nOriginally, the airport was built by the United States military during World War II and opened on March 23, 1943. The U.S. named it Meeks Field after a young pilot, George Meeks, who died on the Reykjavík airfield. After the war, the airport and the base were returned to Iceland's control and were renamed for the nearby town of Keflavik. In 1951, the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defense agreement between Iceland and the U.S. Later, Iceland joined NATO.\n\nDevelopment since the 1950s\n\nWith the reestablishment of the military air base at Keflavík during the 1950s, the air terminal found itself in the middle of a secure military zone.  Travelers had to pass through military check points to reach their flights, until 1987, when the civilian terminal was relocated...\n\nThe presence of foreign military forces in Iceland under the NATO sponsored Iceland–U.S. Defense Agreement of 1951 was controversial in Iceland, which had no indigenous military forces other than the Icelandic Coast Guard.  During the 1960s and 1970s, rallies were held to protest the U.S. military presence in Iceland (and in particular at Keflavík), and every year protesters walked the 50 km road from Reykjavík to Keflavík and chanted \"Ísland úr NATO, herinn burt\" (literally: Iceland out of NATO, the military away). The protests were not effective. One of the participants was Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, who later became the first female President of Iceland.\n\nThe former Agreed Military Area at Keflavík was re-designated \"Airport, Security and Development Area\" under the supervision of the Keflavík International Airport Ltd. (established 1 January 2009) , the Icelandic Coast Guard and the Keflavík Airport Development Corporation (Kadeco), respectively. The Coast Guard maintains hangars for military aircraft as well as ammunition depots, air defence radars and other military equipment for national defence. The former military encampment area (U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik) being developed by Kadeco has been named Ásbrú to reflect its new role. The airport is in the little village named Sandgerði, but the runway leads to Keflavík.\n\nThe 10000 ft and 200 ft runways are long enough to support NASA's Space Shuttle and also the Antonov An-225. On 29 June 1999, Concorde G-BOAA flew from Heathrow Airport to Reykjavík (Keflavík airport). The Concorde had been there. \n\nFacilities\n\nThe Airport is named after Leifur Eiríksson who was the first European to discover North America. Air Terminal (), named for Leif Ericson. It was opened 6 April 1987  and separated the airport's civil traffic from the military base. It was later extended with the opening of the South Building in 2001 (not a separate terminal) to comply with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement. The North Building was later enlarged and finished in 2007. The terminal has duty-free stores in the departure and arrival lounges.\n\nIn 2016, the current terminal was expanded. \nThe expansion added 7 gates.  There are also plans to add a third runway. \n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nAlthough the population of Iceland is only about 300,000, there are scheduled flights to and from numerous locations across North America and Europe. The largest carrier operating out of Keflavík is Icelandair. On 23 October 2012 WOW air acquired Iceland Express  making it the second largest Icelandic carrier and the second largest at Keflavík. The airport only handles international flights (except for flights to Akureyri in connection with certain Air Iceland flights to Greenland); domestic flights and flights to Greenland and the Faroe Islands are operated from Reykjavík's domestic airport.\n\nPassenger\n\nCargo\n\nStatistics\n\nPassenger numbers\n\nTop destinations\n\nGround transport\n\nTransport between the airport and Reykjavik city is by road only. The distance is 50 km. A new dual carriageway road (route 41) was opened in 2008.\nBuses are operated by Airport Express, Flybus and straeto (Reykjavik's transit company) to Reykjavik.  Taxis are available outside the terminal. Rental cars are available from various companies. \n\nAccidents and incidents\n\n* On 21 July 2013, a Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner, prototype aircraft 97005, made a belly landing during a test flight. The cause was a crew mistake due to fatigue.

It is named after Despoina, a nymph who was a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter.\n\nDespina was discovered in late July 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 3. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4824) on August 2, 1989, but the text only talks of \"10 frames taken over 5 days\", giving a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991.\n\nDespina is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.\n\nDespina's orbit lies close to but outside of the orbit of Thalassa and just inside the Le Verrier ring. As it is also below Neptune's synchronous orbit radius, it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nDespina and Thalassa are two satellites of which planet?\nAnswer:\n8th planet\nPassage:\nOn Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring\nOn Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring is a tone poem composed in 1912 by Frederick Delius; it was first performed in Leipzig on 23 October 1913.  It is the first of Two Pieces for Small Orchestra, the second piece being Summer Night on the River, although these have for many years existed separately on recordings and in the concert hall. \n\nThe piece opens with a slow three-bar sequence; its first theme is an exchange of cuckoo calls, first for oboe, then for divided strings. The second theme is scored for first violins, and is taken from a Norwegian folk song, \"In Ola Valley\", which was brought to his attention by the Australian composer and folk-song arranger Percy Grainger. (The theme was also quoted by Edvard Grieg in his 19 Norwegian Folksongs, Op. 66.) The clarinet returns with the cuckoo calls before the piece ends in pastoral fashion.\nQuestion:\nWho composed 'On Hearing The First Cuckoo In Spring'?\nAnswer:\nFREDERICK DELIUS\nPassage:\nGandhi cap\nThe Gandhi cap () is a white coloured sidecap, pointed in front and back and having a wide band. It is made out of khadi. It takes its name after the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who first popularised its use during the Indian independence movement. Worn commonly by Indian independence activists, it became a symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear it in independent India.\n\nGenesis\n\nThe Gandhi cap emerged in India during the First Non-cooperation movement during 1918-1921.  when it became the standard Congress dress as popularized by Gandhi. In 1921, the British government tried to ban the use of the Gandhi cap. \nGandhi himself wore the cap only for 1–2 years during 1920-21.  \n\nGandhi's homespun khadi attire of traditional Indian clothes were symbolic of his message of cultural pride, the use of Swadeshi goods (as opposed to those manufactured in Europe), self-reliance and solidarity with India's rural masses. The cap became common to most followers of Gandhi and members of the Indian National Congress. A connection to the independence movement was implied when any individual wore the cap in those times.\n\nPrisoners in South African prisons classified as \"negroes\" (a category into which Indians fell while Gandhi was in South Africa) also were required to wear similar caps in prison during 1907 to 1914. Gandhi's close friend Henry Polak cites Gandhi's time in South African jail, where he was classified as a \"negro\" and thus required to wear such a cap, as the genesis of the Gandhi Cap. \n However Gandhi, in a letter to Kaka Kalelkar, described in detail how he based his white cap on the Kashmiri cap. \n\nAfter independence\n\nThe first generation of post-independence Indian politicians were almost universally members of the freedom struggle. Gandhi's death in 1948 gave an emotional importance to the Gandhi cap, which was regularly worn by Indian leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Succeeding prime minister such as Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai would continue the tradition. Most members of the Indian Parliament (especially politicians and activists of the Congress party) wore khadi clothing and the Gandhi cap. Large numbers of people donned the cap when celebrating India's independence on August 15 or the promulgation of a republic on January 26.\n\nJawarharlal Nehru was always remembered as having worn the cap. In 1964 a coin showing Nehru in profile was released which was widely criticized for lacking the cap. Another Nehru coin was later released in 1989 on his birth centenary, which showed him wearing a cap.\n\nIn later times, the cap had lost its popular and political appeal. Although many members of the Congress party continued the tradition, rival political parties preferred to dissociate themselves from the tradition linked with the Congress. The mass acceptance of Western-style clothing had also diminished the importance of wearing Indian-style clothes for politicians.\n\nThe cap remains the most popular everyday headgear worn by men in rural parts of Maharashtra. \n\nIn the \"I Have a Dream\" speech of Martin Luther King, Jr in 1963, one can see people standing behind him on stage wearing Gandhi caps. \n\nRe-emergence of the Gandhi cap\n\nIn 2011, the Gandhi cap once again rose in popularity in India after Anna Hazare, an eminent Gandhian from Maharashtra, started an anti-corruption movement in India. The epicenter of this movement was in Delhi. In August 2011, thousands of people wearing Gandhi caps accumulated at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to support Anna Hazare on his fast-unto-death. This movement spilled over to many other parts of the country and stadiums, community centers and grounds were booked for assimilation of a similar nature. The mass movement witnessed people of all age groups, religions and social standings (mainly the Middle Class) as participants, many among them shouting slogans and wearing Gandhi caps.\n\nIn the 2014 election, the workers of Aam Aadmi Party widely wore the Gandhi cap with text printed on it.  BJP supporters wore a similar saffron colored cap.\nQuestion:\nWhat item of clothing, known as a 'topi', was popularised by Indian leaders Mahatma Gandhi, Jaraharlal Nehru, and later by anti-corruption campaigner Anna Hazare?\nAnswer:\nCap\nPassage:\nTommy Atkins\nTommy Atkins (often just Tommy) is slang for a common soldier in the British Army.  It was certainly well established during the nineteenth century, but is particularly associated with World War I. It can be used as a term of reference, or as a form of address. German soldiers would call out to \"Tommy\" across no man's land if they wished to speak to a British soldier. French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers \"Tommies\". In more recent times, the term Tommy Atkins has been used less frequently, although the name \"Tom\" is occasionally still heard, especially with regard to paratroopers.\n\nHistory \n\nTommy Atkins or Thomas Atkins has been used as a generic name for a common British soldier for many years. The origin of the term is a subject of debate, but it is known to have been used as early as 1743. A letter sent from Jamaica about a mutiny amongst the troops says \"except for those from N. America ye Marines and Tommy Atkins behaved splendidly\".  \n\nA common belief is that the name was chosen by the Duke of Wellington after having been inspired by the bravery of a soldier at the Battle of Boxtel in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign. After a fierce engagement, the Duke, in command of the 33rd Regiment of Foot, spotted the best man-at-arms in the regiment, Private Thomas Atkins, terribly wounded. The private said \"It's all right, sir. It's all in a day's work\" and died shortly after.[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-British-Tommy-Tommy-Atkins/ Johnson, Ben. \"The British Tommy, Tommy Atkins\", Historic UK] According to the Imperial War Museum, this theory has Wellington choosing the name in 1843.\n\nAccording to J. H. Leslie, writing in Notes and Queries in 1912, \"Tommy Atkins\" was chosen as a generic name by the War Office in 1815, in every sample infantry form in the Soldiers Account Book, signing with a mark.  The Cavalry form had Trumpeter William Jones and Sergeant John Thomas, though they did not use a mark.  Leslie observes the same name in the 1837 Kings Regulations, pages 204 and 210, and later editions.  Leslie comments that this disproves the anecdote about the Duke of Wellington selecting the name in 1843. \n\nRichard Holmes, in the prologue to his 2005 book, Tommy, states that:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary states its origin as \"arising out of the casual use of this name in the specimen forms given in the official regulations from 1815 onward\"; the citation references Collection of Orders, Regulations, etc., pp. 75–87, published by the War Office, 31 August 1815. The name is used for an exemplary cavalry and infantry soldier; other names used included William Jones and John Thomas.  Thomas Atkins continued to be used in the \"Soldier's Account Book\" until the early 20th century. \n\nA further suggestion was given in 1900 by an army chaplain named Reverend E. J. Hardy. He wrote of an incident during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857. When most of the Europeans in Lucknow were fleeing to the British Residency for protection, a private of the 32nd Regiment of Foot remained on duty at an outpost. Despite the pleas of his comrades, he insisted that he must remain at his post. He was killed at his post, and the Reverend Hardy wrote that \"His name happened to be Tommy Atkins and so, throughout the Mutiny Campaign, when a daring deed was done, the doer was said to be 'a regular Tommy Atkins'\".\n\nFollowing the British defeat by the Boers at the Battle of Magersfontein in December 1899, Private Smith of the Black Watch wrote the following poem: \n\nRobert Graves, in his autobiography Goodbye to All That (1929), states that: \"The original 'Thomas Atkins' was a Royal Welch Fusilier in the American Revolutionary War. Graves, an officer in the Royal Welch in 1915, mentions this among other regimental history but does not cite his reference.  In the same volume, Graves quotes a German soldier addressing the British: \"Ach, Tommee, hast du den deutsch gelernt?\"\n\nRudyard Kipling published the poem Tommy (part of the Barrack-Room Ballads, which were dedicated \"To T.A.\") in 1892, and in 1893 the music hall song Private Tommy Atkins was published with words by Henry Hamilton and music by S. Potter.  In 1898 William McGonagall wrote Lines in Praise of Tommy Atkins, which was an attack on what McGonagall saw as the disparaging portrayal of Tommy in Kipling's poem.\n\nIt is also said that the name \"Tommy Atkins\" was the example name on conscription sheets during the First World War, and that teenagers who were underage often signed up as \"Tommy Atkins\".\n\n\"Tommy cooker\" was a nickname for a British soldier's portable stove, which was fuelled by something referred to as solidified alcohol, making it smokeless but very inefficient.  \nToday's soldier is nicknamed (within the Army) \"Tom\", and the British Army magazine Soldier features a cartoon strip character called Tom.\n\nThe last Tommy \n\nOn 25 July 2009, the death of the last \"Tommy\" from World War I, Harry Patch (at 111 the oldest man in the United Kingdom and also in Europe), left Claude Choules as the last serviceman of the British forces in World War I.\n\nThere was a growing opinion that the passing of the last of them should be marked in an appropriate manner. This was the subject of a cross party campaign led by the politician Iain Duncan Smith. It was originally proposed that the last veteran to die should be given a state funeral. However, this met with opposition from the veterans themselves, few of whom wanted to be singled out in this way.   As of 28 June 2006, it was decided that a service at Westminster Abbey would be held upon the death of the last veteran.\nQuestion:\nWorld War I soldiers were called Tommies from which longer name did it originate?\nAnswer:\nLast Tommy\n", "answers": ["four", "4"], "length": 2660, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d62a5ab5a527adac732059daec61d725d3af4393ef7d4eaa"}
{"input": "Passage:\nTybalt\nTybalt is the main antagonist in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. He is the son of Lady Capulet's brother, Juliet's short-tempered first cousin, and Romeo's rival.  Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert/Tybalt the \"Prince of Cats\" in Reynard the Fox, a point of mockery in the play. Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt \"Prince of Cats\" (perhaps referring not only to Reynard but to the Italian word cazzo  as well). Luigi da Porto adapted the story as Giulietta e Romeo and included it in his Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti published in 1530.  Da Porto drew on Pyramus and Thisbe and Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron. He gave it much of its modern form, including the lovers' names, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona.  He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare's Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of Bartolomeo II della Scala (a century earlier than Salernitano). Montague and Capulet were actual 13th-century political factions, but the only connection between them is a mention in Dante's Purgatorio as an example of civil dissension. \n\nRole in the play\n\nIn Act I, Scene I, Tybalt enters and helps his servants, Sampson and Gregory, who are fighting in the streets with servants of the Montagues, Abraham and Balthasar. Seeing Benvolio (Romeo's cousin) trying to stop the fight, Tybalt draws his sword to fight Benvolio, saying:\n\nWhat, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\nHave at thee, coward!\n\nLater, at the Capulets' ball, Tybalt is the first to recognize Romeo through his disguise, and would kill him if not forbidden by his uncle, Lord Capulet. His lust for revenge unsated, Tybalt sends a challenge letter to Romeo for a duel to the death. He enters looking for Romeo at the beginning of Act III, only to create tensions with Mercutio, who was mocking Tybalt even before he entered the scene. Tybalt initially ignores Mercutio and confronts Romeo, who refuses to fight because of his marriage to Juliet. Tybalt becomes even angrier; he does not know Romeo cannot fight him because they are now relatives.\n\nMercutio loses his temper and begins fighting Tybalt himself. Romeo tries to stop the combat by rushing between them, and Tybalt then stabs Mercutio under Romeo's arm. Mercutio dies. Enraged, Romeo duels and kills Tybalt in return, leading to his own exile by the prince.\n\nTybalt is revealed to be Juliet's maternal first cousin, when Lady Capulet arrives at the scene where Tybalt lies dead, and cries \"Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child!\" (III.I)\n\nPerformers\n\n* Orson Welles performed the role in the 1934–35 production presented by Katharine Cornell, in which he made his Broadway debut. \n*Basil Rathbone performed the role in the 1936 Hollywood film Romeo and Juliet. He was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.\n*George Chakiris performed the role of Bernardo Nunez, the Tybalt character in the 1961 film West Side Story, the musical modernized version of Romeo and Juliet.\n*Michael York in the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli film version\n*Armand Assante in the 1977 Broadway revival\n*Alan Rickman in the 1978 television adaptation within the BBC Television Shakespeare series\n*John Leguizamo in Baz Luhrmann's 1996 modernized film adaption, Romeo + Juliet\n*Tom Ross in the 2001 French musical Roméo et Juliette\n*Corey Hawkins in the 2013 Broadway revival\n*Ed Westwick in the 2013 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet\n*Matthew Rigby in the 2015 SPCC Shakespeare Cafè\n\nAnalysis\n\nJohn W. Draper points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in the four humors and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt is a choleric).

The Weights and Measures Act of 1835 formally established the present imperial hundredweight of 112 lb. The use in trade of measures by \"cental\", \"hundredweight\", or \"quintal\"  have now been banned in the United Kingdom under the Weights and Measures Act of 1985.\n\nThe United States and Canada came to use the term \"hundredweight\" to refer to a unit of 100 lb. This measure was specifically banned from British use—upon risk of being sued for fraud—by the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 but, in 1879, the measure was legalized under the name \"cental\" in response to legislative pressure from British merchants importing wheat and tobacco from the United States. \n\nUse\n\nThe short hundredweight is commonly used in the US in the sale of livestock and some cereal grains  and oilseeds, paper, and concrete additives and on some commodities in futures exchanges \n\nA few decades ago, commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle, cattle fodder, fertilizers, coal, some industrial chemicals, other industrial materials, and so on. However, since increasing metrication in most English-speaking countries, it is now less used. Church bell ringers use the unit commonly,  although church bell manufacturers are increasingly moving over to the metric system. \n\nOlder blacksmiths' anvils are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight, quarter-hundredweight (28 lb), and pounds. Thus, an anvil stamped \"1.1.8\" will weigh 148 lb (112 lb + 28 lb + 8 lb).\nQuestion:\nHow many pounds are there in one hundredweight?\nAnswer:\none hundred and twelve\nPassage:\nLibreville\nLibreville is the capital and largest city of Gabon, in west central Africa. The city is a port on the Komo River, near the Gulf of Guinea, and a trade center for a timber region.  its population was estimated at 797,003. \n\nHistory \n\nThe area was inhabited by the Mpongwé tribe long before the French acquired the land in 1839. In 1846, the slave ship Elizia was captured by the French navy near Loango, and fifty-two of the freed slaves were resettled on the site of Libreville (French for \"Freetown\") in 1849.  It was the chief port of French Equatorial Africa from 1934 to 1946 and was the central focus of the Battle of Gabon in 1940.\n\nIn 1910, French Equatorial Africa (Afrique équatoriale française, AEF) was created, and French companies were allowed to exploit the Middle Congo (modern-day Congo Brazzaville). It soon became necessary to build a railroad that would connect Brazzaville, the terminus of the river navigation on the Congo River and the Ubangui River, with the Atlantic coast. As rapids make it impossible to navigate on the Congo River past Brazzaville, and the coastal railroad terminus site had to allow for the construction of a deep-sea port, authorities chose the site of Ponta Negra instead of Libreville as originally envisaged. Construction of the Congo-Ocean Railway began in 1921, and Libreville was surpassed by the rapid growth of Pointe-Noire, farther down the coast.\n\nLibreville was named in imitation of Freetown and grew only slowly as a trading post and a minor administrative centre to a population of 32,000 on independence in 1960.  It only received its first bank branch when Bank of West Africa (BAO) opened a branch in 1930.  Since independence, the city has grown rapidly and now houses nearly half the national population\n\nGeography \n\nFrom north to south, major districts of the city are the residential area Batterie IV, Quartier Louis (known for its nightlife), Mont-Bouët and Nombakélé (busy commercial areas), Glass (the first European settlement in Gabon), Oloumi (a major industrial area) and Lalala, a residential area.  The city's port and train station on the Trans-Gabon Railway line to Franceville lie in Owendo, south of the main built-up area. Inland from these districts lie poorer residential areas.\n\nClimate \n\nLibreville features a tropical monsoon climate with a lengthy wet season and a short dry season. Libreville's wet season spans about nine months (September through May), with a heavy amount of rain falling during these months. The city's dry season lasts from June through August and is caused by the cold Benguela Current reaching its northernmost extent and suppressing rainfall. Despite the lack of rain, Libreville remains very cloudy during this time of year.\n\nAs common with many cities with this climate, average temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures at around 30 °C.\n\nTransport\n\nLibreville International Airport is the largest airport in Gabon and is located around 11 km north of the city.\n\nNational Taxis operate around the city. Each district has a colour for its taxis and Libreville's is red.\n\nThe National Society of Transport (SOGATRA) just launched the new taxis that operate on a counter system. \n\nCulture and education\n\nSights in Libreville include:\n* the National Museum of Arts and Traditions\n* the French cultural centre\n* St Marie's Cathedral, seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Libreville\n* the carved wood church of St Michael, Nkembo\n* the Arboretum de Sibang\n* two cultural villages.\nLibreville's main market lies in Mont-Bouët. Gabon's school of administration and school of law are in Libreville. Libreville also hosts the Omar Bongo University (est. 1970), various research institutes and a library. Alongside the Komo estuary is the Pongara National Park of 929 km2. Behind Cap Esterias is Akanda National Park, famed for its large congregations of migrating waterbirds.\n\nThe city is served by Libreville Hospital.\n\nThere are several high-end international schools in Libreville, including:\n* American International School of Libreville - American curriculum\n* Lycée Blaise Pascal de Libreville - French curriculum\n* International School of Gabon Ruban Vert - IB curriculum\n\nLanguages \n\nLibreville is one of the few African cities where French is truly becoming a native language,  with some local features.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe city is home to a shipbuilding industry, brewing industry and sawmills. The city exports raw materials such as wood, rubber and cocoa from the city's main port, and the deepwater port at Owendo. \n\nGabon Airlines has its headquarters in Libreville.  Prior to their dissolutions, both Air Gabon and Gabon Express were headquartered on the grounds of Libreville International Airport.  \n\nNotable residents\n\n*Daniel Cousin, footballer who played for Larissa FC and the Gabon National Team\n*Anthony Obame, Olympic silver medalist in the men's Taekwondo 80+ kg at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n*Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, footballer who plays for Borussia Dortmund and the Gabon  Team \n*Charles Tchen, Honorary consul for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Gabon\n*Marcel Lefebvre, traditionalist Roman Catholic bishop, served as a missionary in Libreville\n\nGallery\n\nFile:081 Gabon. - Libreville.jpg|Libreville, 1899\nFile:082 Gabon. - L'entrée de Libreville.jpg|The entrance to Libreville, 1899\nQuestion:\nLibreville is the capital of which West African country?\nAnswer:\nBDG\nPassage:\nMilsons Point, New South Wales\nMilsons Point is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. North Sydney is located 3 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of North Sydney Council.\n\nMilsons Point is also the geographical feature that juts into Sydney Harbour from the northern side, directly opposite Sydney Cove, the spot where the first European settlement was established in 1788.\n\nMilsons Point was named after James Milson (1783–1872), one of the earliest settlers.\n\nHistory\n\nMilsons Point was named after James Milson (1783–1872), a free settler originally from Lincolnshire.\n\nMilson settled in the area near Milsons Point and established a profitable business supplying ships with stone ballast, fresh water, and the produce of his dairy, orchard, and vegetable gardens.\n\n* In the early 1820s  Milson settled in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street, Kirribilli, on 120 acres of land he leased from Robert Campbell (1769–1846). \n* In 1824 Milson received a 50-acre grant of his own adjoining Campbell's land  (which is marked on the 1840s map above).\n* In 1826 a bushfire raged through the area destroying Milson's home, orchard and dairy and farm  which he subsequently rebuilt (refer to 1840s map above).\n* In 1831 Campbell was involved with Milson in a court action over Milson's non-payment of the lease of the 120 acres.\n* Milson lived in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street until 1831 when he built a new home, \"Brisbane House\", on his 50 acres facing Lavender Bay. The next home he built, also on his 50 acres, was called \"Grantham\".  \n* By the 1840s Milson was leasing only the portion Campbell's 120 acres that contained Milson's orchard in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street.\n* In 1872 Milson died at home at \"Gratham\" in the modern suburb of Milsons Point in what was then called the Municipality of East St Leonards. \n\nThe last of the family's holdings in the lower North Shore area were resumed in the early 1920s for the construction of the Harbour Bridge and associated roadways. \n\nTransport\n\nMilsons Point supports the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Milsons Point is well connected with the CBD of Sydney by the bridge, ferries and trains. The Warringah Freeway provides a link south to the Sydney CBD and north to Chatswood.\n\nMilsons Point railway station is on the northern approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Milsons Point ferry wharf, serviced by the Balmain, Pyrmont Bay and Rydalmere ferry lines, is located to the west of the bridge in the south-west part of the suburb. In addition to rail services, Milson's Point is serviced by buses that run to the Lower North Shore and Northern Beaches.  School Buses leave from Bradfield Park to transport students to schools in North Sydney.\n\nCommercial area\n\nMilsons Point has a mixture of residential and commercial development.\n\nNotable Residents\n\n* Michael Stutchbury*\n* Mike Gibson*\n\nSport and recreation\n\nMilsons Point has the entertainment centre Luna Park and the North Sydney Olympic Pool.\n\nSchools\n\nSchools in the area include the Catholic schools Loreto Kirribilli for girls and St Aloysius' College for boys.\n\nChurches\n\n* [http://www.cccmilsonspoint.org/new/ Chinese Christian Church]\nQuestion:\nWhat bridge, between Millers Point and Milsons Point, opened on 19 March 1932?\nAnswer:\nBridgeClimb\nPassage:\nVerse drama and dramatic verse\nVerse drama is any drama written as verse to be spoken; another possible general term is poetic drama.  For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in Europe (and was also important in non-European cultures).  Greek tragedy and Racine's plays are written in verse, as is almost all of Shakespeare's drama, Ben Jonson, John Fletcher and others like Goethe's Faust.\n\nVerse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of tragedy, providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of Christopher Fry and T. S. Eliot being possibly the end of a long tradition). \n\nDramatic verse\n\nDramatic verse occurs in a dramatic work, such as a play, composed in poetic form.  The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as ancient Greece.\n\nThe English Renaissance saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form.  Though a few plays, such as A Midsummer Night's Dream, feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as blank verse; there are also passages of prose.\n\nDramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by George Bernard Shaw. Verse drama did have a role in the development of Irish theatre.\n\nCloset drama\n\nAn important trend from around 1800 was the closet drama: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. Lord Byron and Shelley, as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.\n\nInstead, opera would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse libretto can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. \n\nAccording to Robertson Davies in A Voice From the Attic, closet drama is \"Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!\". But indeed a great deal of it was written in Victorian times, and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded epic. Prolific in the form were, for example, Michael Field and Gordon Bottomley.\n\nDramatic poetry in general\n\nDramatic poetry is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. \n\nThe major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and libretti. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include dramatic monologues, such as those written by Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson and William Shakespeare.\n\nCollaborative play writing\n\nCollaborative play writing for verse drama is available at Wikiversity (see below).\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the poetic drama 'Murder in the Cathedral' in 1939?\nAnswer:\nTS Elliot\nPassage:\nList of most expensive association football transfers\nThe following is a list of most expensive association football transfers, which details the highest transfer fees ever paid for players as of the end of the winter transfer window of 2016.\n\nThe list contains eight transfers which broke the world transfer record: those of Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaká, Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Hernán Crespo and Christian Vieri, with the first five signing for Spanish clubs and the latter two signing for Italian clubs. Two of the listed players became the most expensive teenagers in history upon their transfer: Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial; both signed for English club Manchester United.\n\nSpanish team Real Madrid have held the record for purchasing the most expensive player since 2000, when Luís Figo made a controversial £37 million move from Barcelona.   Since then, the only player purchases to break the record have been Zinedine Zidane in 2001, when he was signed for £46 million from Juventus, the £80 million transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United in 2009, and Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013.\n\nHighest fees\n\nMost of the highest-value transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most involve clubs in the Eurozone and/or the United Kingdom. The default order in this table is based on the transfer amount in euros. Due to exchange rate fluctuations the order is different in pound sterling, which are also shown in the table.

The building was completely restored in order to house the Bargello National Museum, opened in 1865.\nCollections\nThe earlier museum was dedicated to Medieval applied arts: bronzes, majolicas, statues, coins, seals and medals. Donatello's year (1887-88) was the occasion to open the Hall of Renaissance Sculpture (today called \"of Donatello\") and between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the collection was further enlarged thanks to private donations and legacies (Carrand, Ressmann, Franchetti), with new ivories, enamels, arms and armours.\nToday, on the ground floor of the museum, the Hall of the 16th century Sculpture displays important works by Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Jacopo Sansovino and Giambologna.\nOn the first floor, a balcony (\"Verone\"), adorned with bronze animals by Giambologna, leads to the vast Audience Hall, which houses many masterpieces by Donatello, his assistants and Luca Della Robbia, along with the famous bronze reliefs cast by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi in competition for the second doors of the Florentine Baptistery. On the same floor are the Islamic Room, the Carrand Room, the Chapel of Mary Magdalene, the Room of Ivories, the Medieval Room and the Majolicas Room.\nOn the second floor are the rooms dedicated to Giovanni and Andrea della Robbia, displaying the well-known glazed terracotta works, the Room of the Arms, the Room of Small Bronzes, the Verrocchio Room (sculptures by Andrea del Verrocchio, Mino da Fiesole, Antonio Rossellino, Benedetto da Maiano) and the Room of Medals.\nMasterpieces\nBenvenuto Cellini, Mercurio, Danae with the child Perseus, Zeus, Athena, 1545-53\nBenvenuto Cellini, Bust of Cosimo I, 1545-47\nGiambologna, Flying Mercury, 1580\nDonatello, Bust of Niccolò da Uzzano, 1425-30\nDonatello, Atys-Amor\nFilippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti, Sacrifice of Isaac, 1401\nAndrea del Verrocchio , David, 1470 approx.\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Lady with posy, 1575-80\nQuestion:\nThe Uffizi and the Bargello are among the museums of art in which European city ?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nSea snail\nSea snail is a common name for snails that normally live in saltwater, in other words marine gastropods. The taxonomic class Gastropoda also includes snails that live in other habitats, such as land snails and freshwater snails. Many species of sea snails are edible and exploited as food sources by humans.\n\nSea snails are marine gastropods with shells. Those marine gastropods with no shells, or only internal shells, are variously known by other common names, including sea slug, sea hare, nudibranch, etc. The diversity within sea snails is enormous. Many very different clades of gastropods are either dominated by, or consist exclusively of, sea snails. Because of this great variability, generalization about the feeding, reproduction, habitat, or other traits of sea snails is not possible. Instead, individual clades, families, genera, or species must be assessed.\n\nShells\n\nThe shells of most species of sea snails are spirally coiled. Some, though, have conical shells, and these are often referred to by the common name of limpets. In one unusual family (Juliidae), the shell of the snail has become two hinged plates closely resembling those of a bivalve; this family is sometimes called the \"bivalved gastropods\".\n\nTheir shells are found in a variety of shapes and sizes, but are normally very small. Those of living species of sea snails range in size from Syrinx aruanus, the largest living shelled gastropod species at 91 cm, to minute species whose shells are less than 1 mm at adult size. Because the shells of sea snails are strong and durable in many cases, as a group they are well represented in the fossil record.\n\nAnatomy\n\nSea snails are a very large group of animals and a very diverse one. Most snails that live in saltwater respire using a gill or gills, a few species, though, have a lung, are intertidal, and are active only at low tide when they can move around in the air. These air-breathing species include false limpets in the family Siphonariidae and another group of false limpets in the family Trimusculidae.\n\nMany, but not all sea snails have an operculum.\n\nHuman uses\n\nA number of species of sea snails are used by humans for food, including abalone, conch, limpets, whelks (such as the North American Busycon species and the North Atlantic Buccinum undatum) and periwinkles including Littorina littorea.\n\nThe shells of sea snails are often found by humans as seashells commonly wash up on beaches. Because the shells of many sea snails are attractive and durable, they have been used by humans to make necklaces and other jewelry from prehistoric times to the current day.\n\nThe shells of a few species of large sea snails within the Vetigastropoda have a thick layer of nacre and have been used as a source of mother of pearl. Historically, the button industry relied on these species for a number of years.\n\nUse by other animals\n\nThe shells of sea snails are used for protection by many kinds of hermit crabs. A hermit crab carries the shell by grasping the central columella of the shell using claspers on the tip of its abdomen.\n\nDefinition\n\nDetermining whether some gastropods should be called sea snails is not always easy. Some species that live in brackish water (such as certain neritids) can be listed as either freshwater snails or marine snails, and some species that live at or just above the high tide level (for example species in the genus Truncatella) are sometimes considered to be sea snails and sometimes listed as land snails.\n\nTaxonomy\n\n2005 taxonomy \n\nThe following cladogram is an overview of the main clades of living gastropods based on the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005),  with taxa that contain saltwater or brackish water species marked in boldface (some of the highlighted taxa consist entirely of marine species, but some of them also contain freshwater or land species.)\n\n* Clade Patellogastropoda\n* Clade Vetigastropoda\n* Clade Cocculiniformia\n* Clade Neritimorpha\n**Clade Cycloneritimorpha\n* Clade Caenogastropoda\n**Informal group Architaenioglossa\n**Clade Sorbeoconcha\n**Clade Hypsogastropoda\n***Clade Littorinimorpha\n***Informal group Ptenoglossa\n***Clade Neogastropoda\n*Clade Heterobranchia\n**Informal group Lower Heterobranchia\n**Informal group Opisthobranchia\n***Clade Cephalaspidea\n***Clade Thecosomata\n***Clade Gymnosomata\n***Clade Aplysiomorpha\n***Group Acochlidiacea\n***Clade Sacoglossa\n***Group Cylindrobullida\n***Clade Umbraculida\n***Clade Nudipleura\n****Clade Pleurobranchomorpha\n****Clade Nudibranchia\n*****Clade Euctenidiacea\n*****Clade Dexiarchia\n******Clade Pseudoeuctenidiacea\n******Clade Cladobranchia\n*******Clade Euarminida\n*******Clade Dendronotida\n*******Clade Aeolidida\n**Informal group Pulmonata\n***Informal group Basommatophora\n***Clade Eupulmonata\n****Clade Systellommatophora\n****Clade Stylommatophora\n*****Clade Elasmognatha\n*****Clade Orthurethra\n*****Informal group Sigmurethra\nQuestion:\nWhat is the edible sea snail of the genus Haliotis, which has an ear-shaped shell with a pearly interior?\nAnswer:\nVenus's ears\nPassage:\nMrs de Winter\nMrs de Winter is a novel by Susan Hill published in 1993. It is the sequel to the novel Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier. \n\nSummary\n\nWhen Manderley burned, tormented Maxim de Winter and his demure second wife fled the ghosts of a dark, unspoken yesterday and now have come home to England, to bury what was and start anew. But the sensual warmth of a golden autumn cannot mask the chill of a lingering evil. For October's gentle breeze whispers that Rebecca -beautiful, mysterious, malevolent Rebecca- is haunting their lives once more. \n\nReviews\n\nCritical reviews have been generally bad, stating that this sequel is not really up to the standard set by the original author, du Maurier. The plot has been regarded as quite dull, without any evolution of the character of Mrs.  de Winter in spite of the time lapse. Also, it casts the same characters all over again without the narration being intense and engaging enough. \"Throughout the media jamboree attending this sequel, Rebecca's remaining lovers will feel like Mrs Danvers - dour, uncomprehending, and dismissive of the newcomer's ineffective attempts to please\".\nQuestion:\nThe 1993 novel 'Mrs. de Winter' by Susan Hill was a sequel towhich classic 20th century novel?\nAnswer:\nRifkah\nPassage:\nBrighstone Forest\nBrighstone Forest is located in the southwest of the Isle of Wight.

The name English and species name \"skua\" is believed to originate from the Faroese skúvur or skúgvur and is the only known bird name to originate from the Faroes that has come into regular use elsewhere. In Britain, it is sometimes known by the name bonxie, a Shetland name of Norse origin. The genus name Stercorarius is Latin and means \"of dung\"; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement.\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a large skua, measuring 50 – long with a 125 – wingspan. One study found that 112 males weighed an average of  and that 125 females weighed an average of . The adult is streaked greyish brown, with a black cap, while the juvenile is a warmer brown and unstreaked below. Its tail is short and blunt. The flight is direct and powerful. The great skua's call is a harsh hah-hah-hah-hah; quacking and croaking noises have also been heard. Distinguishing this skua from the other North Atlantic skuas (parasitic jaeger, pomarine skua and long-tailed jaeger) is relatively straightforward. The herring gull size, massive barrel chest and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. It is sometimes said to give the impression of a common buzzard. Identification of this skua is only complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related large southern-hemisphere skuas. Despite its name, the great skua is marginally smaller on average than the other 3 large southern-hemisphere skuas, although not by enough to distinguish them by size in the field. Some authorities still regard the great skua as conspecific with some of these southern skuas, and as a group they have sometimes been separated in the genus Catharacta, although currently this taxonomy is not commonly followed.\n\nOrigins\n\nGenetic studies have found surprising similarities between the great skua and the pomarine skua, despite their dissimilar appearance. Many ornithologists now believe either that the great skua originated as a hybrid between the pomarine skua and one of the southern-hemisphere species, presumably as a result of vagrancy or migration across the equator by the southern species, or that the pomarine skua evolved from hybridization of the great skua and one of the small Arctic species (see pomarine skua for details).\n\nBreeding\n\nThe great skua breeds in Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and the Scottish islands, with a few on mainland Scotland and in the northwest of Ireland. It breeds on coastal moorland and rocky islands, usually laying two spotted olive-brown eggs in grass-lined nests. Like other skuas, it will fly at the head of a human or other intruder approaching its nest. Although it cannot inflict serious damage, such an experience with a bird of this size is frightening. It is a migrant, wintering at sea in the Atlantic Ocean and regularly reaching North American waters. Vagrant to Mediterranean countries (e.g. Turkey).\n\nDiet\n\nThis bird eats mainly fish, birds, eggs, carrion, offal, rodents, rabbits, and occasionally berries.\n\nIt will often obtain fish by robbing gulls, terns and even northern gannets of their catches. It will also directly attack and kill other seabirds, up to the size of great black-backed gulls. Like most other skua species, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing less agility and more brute force than the smaller skuas when it harasses its victims. A common technique is to fly up to a gannet in mid-air and grab it by the wing, so that it stalls and falls into the sea, where the great skua then physically attacks it until it surrenders its catch. Due to its size, aggressive nature and fierce defence of its nest, the great skua has little to fear from other predators. While fledglings can fall prey to rats, cats or the Arctic fox, healthy adults are threatened only by greater raptors such as the golden eagle, the white-tailed eagle, and more rarely by the orca.\n\nPredation account\n\nUnusual behaviour by St Kilda's skuas was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's storm petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas preying on the petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:GreatSkuaInWater.jpg|Great skua in water\nFile:Skua_Runde.jpg|At the Norwegian bird-island Runde\nFile:Skua_Runde2.jpg|At Runde\nFile:Skua.jpg|In flight.\nFile:Große Raubmöwe (Stercorarius skua) auf Handa Island.JPG|At Handa Island / Scotland\nQuestion:\nA bonxie is what type of creature?\nAnswer:\nAvians\nPassage:\nJanet Horne\nJanet Horne (died 1727) was an alleged witch from Scotland, and the last person to be executed for witchcraft in the British Isles. \n\nJanet Horne and her daughter were arrested in Dornoch in Sutherland and imprisoned on the accusations of her neighbours. Horne was showing signs of senility, and her daughter had a deformity of her hands and feet. The neighbours accused Horne of having used her daughter as a pony to ride to the Devil, where she had her shod by him. The trial was conducted very quickly; the sheriff had judged both guilty and sentenced them to be burned at the stake. The daughter managed to escape, but Janet was stripped, smeared with tar, paraded through the town on a barrel and burned alive. Nine years after her death the witchcraft acts were repealed in Scotland.\n\nJanet (or Jenny) Horne was also a generic name for witches in the north of Scotland at the time and this makes it difficult to determine what the real name of this woman may have been. Contemporary writers may have called her 'Janet Horne' simply because her real name was unknown or because the name was reported as 'Janet Horne' and they were unaware that this was a generic name. Some sources give the date of the Dornoch execution as June 1722. \n\nLegacy\n\nShe is the subject of the play The Last Witch by Rona Munro, which premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh International Festival. \n\nAlso, the events of the story are the subject of the song \"Am I Evil?\" by heavy metal band Diamond Head.\nQuestion:\nIn 1727, Janet Horne became the last British person to be executed for what crime?\nAnswer:\nBewitcher\nPassage:\nBaby Love by The Supremes Songfacts\nBaby Love by The Supremes Songfacts\nBaby Love by The Supremes Songfacts\nSongfacts\nThe Motown songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote this innocent song about teenage love. They wrote 14 US Top-10 hits for The Supremes.\nExplaining how the trio wrote to NME in 1984, Lamont Dozier said: \"I would collaborate with Eddie on lyrics and with Brian on melodies. Then Brian and I would go into the studio and produce the actual record although Eddie should have been put down as one of the producers because he helped teach the artists the tune when the lyric was finished.\"\nA musician named Lorenzo Pack filed a lawsuit against Motown in 1966, claiming the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting team based \"Baby Love\" on his 1962 song \"I'm Afraid.\" Pack had little evidence to support his assertion, and Motown won the lawsuit. The testimony, however, revealed some insights on this song, as Brian Holland told the court: \"When we write a song, we try to express real feelings about a real situation. In writing the song for The Supremes it was obvious that we were writing for pretty young girls, of whom one is the so-called lead singer. Therefore, in writing 'Baby Love,' we pictured a simple story about a girl whose boyfriend has left her and who loves him very dearly and who would like the boy to come back.  The music fits this simple story.\"\nThis was The Supremes' first and only song to reach #1 in the UK. The Supremes were the first girl-group to have a #1 hit in Britain. It turned out to be The Supremes' only UK #1, though they had many more in the US.\nIn August of 1974, this song was reissued in Britain, where it reached UK #12. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nJerro - New Alexandria, PA, for above 2\nAccording to Rolling Stone magazine, when this song was finished, Berry Gordy thought it wasn't catchy enough and sent the group back into the studio, which is when they came up with the \"Oooooh\" at the beginning.\nThis song, \" Where Did Our Love Go \" and \" Come See About Me \" were written by Holland-Dozier-Holland in one session and were all recorded within two weeks. Berry Gordy required the songwriters to punch a clock when they came in and left for work at Motown, which is something he learned working for Ford. The H-D-H team was especially proficient, often completing 2 or 3 songs a day.\nThis song received a Grammy nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording in 1965; it lost to Nancy Wilson's \"How Glad I Am.\"\nThis was the second US #1 hit for The Supremes, following \" Where Did Our Love Go .\" They were the first Motown act with two #1 hits. >>\nSuggestion credit:\nQuestion:\nWhich group had a hit with ‘Baby Love’ in 1964?\nAnswer:\nDiana Ross and the Supremes\nPassage:\nSouthfork Ranch\nSouthfork Ranch is a conference and event center in Parker, Texas, in the United States, about 25 mi north of Dallas, The ranch includes the Ewing Mansion, which was the setting for both Dallas television series: the original, which first aired on CBS from 1978 to 1991 (except for the first five episodes which were at Cloyce Box Ranch), and its continuation, first transmitted on TNT from 2012 to 2014.\n\nHistory\n\nThe house was built in 1970 by Joe Duncan and was known as Duncan Acres, named after his family. The property was originally 200 acre in size. The \"Mansion\" at Southfork Ranch is a 5900 sqft house with a 957 sqft enclosed garage that was turned into a den/card room.\n\nThe ranch appears in the television series Dallas. Exterior shots were filmed on location from 1978 until 1989, though Lorimar Productions also made a studio mock-up of the ranch's exterior (complete with swimming pool) in California in 1978 for use when the weather made it impractical to film on location in Texas. From 1989, the series's production shifted entirely to the studio set in California. The reunion movies J.R. Returns (1996) and War of the Ewings (1998) returned to the ranch, as did the non-fiction special The Return to Southfork (2004). War of the Ewings, in 1998, was the only time filming was done inside the real ranch for dramatic purposes (Return to Southfork in 2004 was a non-fiction retrospective, not an episode of the series). From 2012, Southfork was once again used as a filming location, for the new Dallas series.\n\nIn 1993–1994, the ranch was featured in the Little Texas music video \"God Blessed Texas\".\n\nThe ranch is now an event and conference center, owned by Forever Resorts. It is home to the KLTY-FM radio Christian concert Celebrate Freedom, held annually during the Independence Day celebration, and hosted the July 4, 2009, \"America's Tea Party\", which an organizer said drew an estimated crowd of 25,000 to 35,000 attendees. \n\nIn December 2012, a memorial service was held at the Southfork Ranch after the death of actor Larry Hagman, who starred as J.R. Ewing in the series. A memorial book for fans to sign was set up in the \"J.R. Ewing room\". \n\nGallery\n\nImage:SF27.JPG|Southfork Ranch Main Gate\nImage:SF23.JPG|Rear view of mansion\nImage:SF12.JPG|Swimming pool at Southfork\nQuestion:\nThe Southfork Ranch featured in which TV series?\nAnswer:\nDallas Fire-Rescue\nPassage:\nAlana Stewart\nAlana Hamilton Stewart (; born May 18, 1945) is an American actress and former model.

It won two Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 1976. In Simon's acceptance speech for the Album of the Year award, on February 28, he jokingly thanked Stevie Wonder, who had won the award the two previous years for Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale, for not releasing an album that year.

Huck is the thirteen-year-old son of the local drunk of St. Petersburg, Missouri, a town on the Mississippi River. Frequently forced to survive on his own wits and always a bit of an outcast, Huck is thoughtful, intelligent (though formally uneducated), and willing to come to his own conclusions about important matters, even if these conclusions contradict society’s norms. Nevertheless, Huck is still a boy, and is influenced by others, particularly by his imaginative friend, Tom.\nTom Sawyer -  Huck’s friend, and the protagonist of Tom Sawyer, the novel to which Huckleberry Finn is ostensibly the sequel. In Huckleberry Finn, Tom serves as a foil to Huck: imaginative, dominating, and given to wild plans taken from the plots of adventure novels, Tom is everything that Huck is not. Tom’s stubborn reliance on the “authorities” of romance novels leads him to acts of incredible stupidity and startling cruelty. His rigid adherence to society’s conventions aligns Tom with the “sivilizing” forces that Huck learns to see through and gradually abandons.\nRead an in-depth analysis of Tom Sawyer.\nWidow Douglas and Miss Watson -  Two wealthy sisters who live together in a large house in St. Petersburg and who adopt Huck. The gaunt and severe Miss Watson is the most prominent representative of the hypocritical religious and ethical values Twain criticizes in the novel. The Widow Douglas is somewhat gentler in her beliefs and has more patience with the mischievous Huck. When Huck acts in a manner contrary to societal expectations, it is the Widow Douglas whom he fears disappointing.\nJim -  One of Miss Watson’s household slaves. Jim is superstitious and occasionally sentimental, but he is also intelligent, practical, and ultimately more of an adult than anyone else in the novel. Jim’s frequent acts of selflessness, his longing for his family, and his friendship with both Huck and Tom demonstrate to Huck that humanity has nothing to do with race. Because Jim is a black man and a runaway slave, he is at the mercy of almost all the other characters in the novel and is often forced into ridiculous and degrading situations.\nRead an in-depth analysis of Jim.\nPap -  Huck’s father, the town drunk and ne’er-do-well. Pap is a wreck when he appears at the beginning of the novel, with disgusting, ghostlike white skin and tattered clothes. The illiterate Pap disapproves of Huck’s education and beats him frequently. Pap represents both the general debasement of white society and the failure of family structures in the novel.\nThe duke and the dauphin  -  A pair of con men whom Huck and Jim rescue as they are being run out of a river town. The older man, who appears to be about seventy, claims to be the “dauphin,” the son of King Louis XVI and heir to the French throne. The younger man, who is about thirty, claims to be the usurped Duke of Bridgewater. Although Huck quickly realizes the men are frauds, he and Jim remain at their mercy, as Huck is only a child and Jim is a runaway slave. The duke and the dauphin carry out a number of increasingly disturbing swindles as they travel down the river on the raft.\nJudge Thatcher  -  The local judge who shares responsibility for Huck with the Widow Douglas and is in charge of safeguarding the money that Huck and Tom found at the end of Tom Sawyer. When Huck discovers that Pap has returned to town, he wisely signs his fortune over to the Judge, who doesn’t really accept the money, but tries to comfort Huck. Judge Thatcher has a daughter, Becky, who was Tom’s girlfriend in Tom Sawyer and whom Huck calls “Bessie” in this novel.\nThe Grangerfords -  A family that takes Huck in after a steamboat hits his raft, separating him from Jim. The kindhearted Grangerfords, who offer Huck a place to stay in their tacky country home, are locked in a long-standing feud with another local family, the Shepherdsons. Twain uses the two families to engage in some rollicking humor and to mock a overly romanticizes ideas about family honor. Ultimately, the families’ sensationalized feud gets many of them killed.\nThe Wilks family  -  At one point during their travels, the duke and the dauphin encounter a man who tells them of the death of a local named Peter Wilks, who has left behind a rich estate. The man inadvertently gives the con men enough information to allow them to pretend to be Wilks’s two brothers from England, who are the recipients of much of the inheritance. The duke and the dauphin’s subsequent conning of the good-hearted and vulnerable Wilks sisters is the first step in the con men’s increasingly cruel series of scams, which culminate in the sale of Jim.\nSilas and Sally Phelps -  Tom Sawyer’s aunt and uncle, whom Huck coincidentally encounters in his search for Jim after the con men have sold him. Sally is the sister of Tom’s aunt, Polly. Essentially good people, the Phelpses nevertheless hold Jim in custody and try to return him to his rightful owner. Silas and Sally are the unknowing victims of many of Tom and Huck’s “preparations” as they try to free Jim. The Phelpses are the only intact and functional family in this novel, yet they are too much for Huck, who longs to escape their “sivilizing” influence.\nAunt Polly -  Tom Sawyer’s aunt and guardian and Sally Phelps’s sister. Aunt Polly appears at the end of the novel and properly identifies Huck, who has pretended to be Tom, and Tom, who has pretended to be his own younger brother, Sid.\nQuestion:\n'The duke and the king' are characters that accompany the runaway lead pair in which classic American novel?\nAnswer:\nHuckleberry Fin\nPassage:\nCarbuncle Cup\nThe Carbuncle Cup is an architecture prize, given annually by the magazine Building Design to \"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months\". It is intended to be a humorous response to the prestigious Stirling Prize, given by the Royal Institute of British Architects. \n\nThe Carbuncle Cup award was launched in 2006, with the first winner being Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth by Chapman Taylor.  A shortlist is announced by Building Design each year, based on nominations from the public, and usually timed to coincide with the Stirling Prize shortlist. Public voting via the magazine's website was used to select past winners, giving the award a sense of democratic involvement. Since 2009 a small group of critics has selected the final winners.\n\nThe award was inspired by the Carbuncle Awards, which the Scottish architecture magazine Urban Realm, formerly Prospect, had been presenting to buildings and areas in Scotland since 2000.  \n\nThe names of both awards are derived from a comment by Charles, Prince of Wales, an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described Ahrends, Burton and Koralek's proposed extension of London's National Gallery as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\".  \n\nAnnual shortlists\n\n2006\n\nThe first shortlist was announced in October 2006, and featured ten buildings. \n\n2007\n\nSeven buildings were shortlisted in 2007. Opal Court, a student housing complex in Leicester, was voted the winner in October. \n\n2008\n\nThe 2008 shortlist of seven buildings was announced in early October. Stuart Lowther of EPR Architects said he was \"extremely disappointed\" at the award for the Radisson SAS Waterfront Hotel being given to his firm, as the project was inherited from another architect and EPR had not designed the building's exterior. \n\n2009\n\nA longlist of ten buildings was announced in August 2009.  Grosvenor Group, the developer of One Park West, organised a \"group hug\" of the building, following its nomination.  The prize, judged by critics Owen Hatherley and Ellis Woodman, and architect Sean Griffith, was awarded to Liverpool Ferry Terminal, with the University of Nottingham Amenity building and Queen Margaret University placed second and third. \n\n2010\n\nThe jury in 2010 comprised Jonathan Glancey, Owen Hatherley, Amanda Baillieu and Ellis Woodman. The shortlist of six was announced in July, and the Strata building was announced as the winner in August. The article described the tower as: \"Decked out with Philishave stylings, this is a building that appears to be auditioning for a supporting role in a James Bond title sequence.\"\n\n2011\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in July.  In August, a jury consisting of national newspaper architecture critics: Rowan Moore of the Observer, Hugh Pearman of the Sunday Times and the Guardian’s Jonathan Glancey voted MediaCityUK the 2011 winner. \n\n2012\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in July,  In August, a jury including Owen Hatherley, Gillian Darley and Ellis Woodman voted Cutty Sark Renovation the 2012 winner. \n\n2013\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2013.  The winner was announced later that same month as 465 Caledonian Road, student accommodation in London. \n\n2014\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2014.  The winner was announced in September 2014 as Woolwich Central, a Sheppard Robson-designed mixed-use scheme in south east London. \n\n2015\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2015, selected by a panel of judges including Building Design editor Thomas Lane, architectural critic Ike Ijeh, writer, broadcaster and historian Gillian Darley and architectural designer Eleanor Jolliffe, both columnists for the magazine.  The winner was announced in September 2015 as 20 Fenchurch Street, designed by Rafael Viñoly. \n\n2016\n\nThe nomination process for 2016 will run until the end of August when the shortlist will be announced. The winner will be declared in early September.  \n\nNominated buildings will be listed below and the table subsequently refined.\nQuestion:\nA 2010 publicity-driven competition called the Carbuncle Cup focused on unpopular British what?\nAnswer:\nArchitecturally\nPassage:\nDueling Banjos\n\"Dueling Banjos\" is an instrumental composition by Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith. The song was composed in 1955 by Smith as a banjo instrumental he called \"Feudin' Banjos,\" which contained riffs from \"Yankee Doodle.\" Smith recorded it playing a four-string plectrum banjo and accompanied by five-string bluegrass banjo player Don Reno. The composition's first wide scale airing was on a 1963 television episode of The Andy Griffith Show called \"Briscoe Declares for Aunt Bee,\" in which it is played by visiting musical family the Darlings (played by The Dillards, a bluegrass group).\n\nThe song was made famous by the 1972 film Deliverance, which also led to a successful lawsuit by the song's composer, as it was used in the film without Smith's permission. The film version, arranged and recorded by Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell and subsequently issued as a single, went to #2 for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973, all four weeks behind Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" and topped the adult contemporary chart for two weeks the same year.  It reached #1 for one week on both the Cashbox and Record World pop charts. The song also reached No. 5 on the Hot Country Singles chart at the same time it was on the Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary Singles charts. It was also nominated for the 30th Golden Globe Awards in the Best Original Song category. \n\nA cover of the song by Steve Ouimette (using electric guitars, bass, and drums) was released as downloadable content for the video game Guitar Hero World Tour, The Toy Dolls also covered the song on their album Absurd-Ditties.\n\nUse in Deliverance\n\nIn Deliverance, a scene depicts Billy Redden playing it opposite Ronny Cox, who joins him on guitar. Redden plays \"Lonnie,\" a mentally challenged and inbred, but extremely gifted, banjo player. Redden could not actually play the banjo and the director thought his hand movements looked unconvincing. A local musician, Mike Addis, was brought in to depict the movement of the boy's left hand. Addis hid behind Redden, with his left arm in Redden's shirt sleeve. Careful camera angles kept Addis out of frame and completed the illusion. The music itself was dubbed in from the recording made by Weissberg and Mandell and was not played by the actors themselves. \nTwo young musicians, Ron Brentano and Mike Russo, had originally been signed to play their adaptation for the film, but instead it was performed by the others. \n\n\"Dueling Banjos\" was arranged and performed for the film by Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell, and was included on its soundtrack.  When Arthur \"Boogie\" Smith was not acknowledged as the composer by the filmmakers, he sued and eventually won, receiving songwriting credit as well as royalties. \n\nChart performance\nQuestion:\nThe tune Duelling Banjos features in which 1972 film?\nAnswer:\nBobby Trippe\nPassage:\nCanoeing\nCanoeing is a sport or recreational activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed paddle. In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with a canoe being called a Canadian canoe.\n\nAn ancient mode of transportation, modern canoeing was established in the late 19th century. In 1924, canoeing associations from Austria, Germany, Denmark and Sweden founded the Internationalen Representation for Kanusport, forerunner of the International Canoe Federation. Canoeing became part of the Olympic Games at the 1936 Summer Olympics. \n\nThe main form of competitive sport was sprint canoe. Others include canoe polo, whitewater canoeing, canoe marathon, ICF canoe marathon, and playboating. National canoe associations include the American, Canadian, British, Scottish, and Welsh.\n\nA recreational form of canoeing is canoe camping.\nQuestion:\nWhen was canoeing accepted as an Olympic sport?\nAnswer:\none thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six\nPassage:\nCondiment\nA condiment is a spice, sauce, or, preparation that is added to food to impart a particular flavor, to enhance its flavor,  or in some cultures, to complement the dish. The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but has shifted meaning over time. \n\nMany condiments are available packaged in single-serving packets, like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals. They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce,  compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples.\n\nThe term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin condere, meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". \n\nDefinition\n\nThe exact definition of what is and is not a condiment varies. Some definitions include spice and herbs, including salt and pepper,  using the term interchangeably with seasoning.  Others restrict the definition to including only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce. Cheese is also considered a condiment in some European countries.\n\nHistory\n\nCondiments were known in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China, and were often used to improve the taste of spoiling food; before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable.  The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by , leading to a flourishing condiment industry. Apicius, a cookbook based on 4th and 5th century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.\n\nList of condiments\n\nCondiment market in the United States \n\nThe condiment market refers to the marketing and consumer purchase of condiments.\n\nIn the United States, condiment market was valued at USD 5.6 billion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to USD 7 billion by 2015. The condiment market is the second largest in specialty foods behind that of cheese.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Dijon mustard on a spoon - 20051218.jpg|Dijon mustard\nImage:Chrain3.jpg|Chrain (horseradish sauce)\nImage:Oeufsmayo.JPG|Mayonnaise\nImage:Ketchup-01.jpg|Tomato Ketchup\nImage:BasilkumPesto.jpg|Pesto genovese\nImage:Chutneys.jpg|Chutneys\nImage:HAT YAI MARKET 2.jpg|Curry powder or paste\nImage:Megrelian ajika.jpg|Ajika, spicy sauce in Caucasian cuisine\nImage:Tkemali.JPG|Tkemali (Georgian sauce made of sour cherry plums)\nImage:Chinese condiments at the restaurant by bhollar in Nerima, Tokyo.jpg|Common Chinese condiments: soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, white pepper\nImage:Duck sauce packets.jpg|Packets of duck sauce\nImage:Carrburritos salsas and chips.jpg|Salsa\nImage:Worcester Sauce 001.jpg|Worcestershire sauce\nImage:Marmite thick spread toasted bread.jpg|Marmite\nImage:Relish.jpg|Gentleman's Relish\nImage:Flying goose sriracha th.jpg|Sriracha (type of Hot sauce)\nImage:Shichimi tougarashi.JPG|Shichimi\nImage:HK 北角 North Point 和田 Wada Japanese Restaurant 放題 Buffet dinner 山葵 green Wasabi Mar-2013.JPG|Wasabi\nQuestion:\nWhat condiment is made of boiled beans, roasted grain and brine?\nAnswer:\nKancang\n", "answers": ["Kerepakupai-Merú", "Kerepakupai Merú", "Salto Ángel", "Kerepakupai-merú", "Kerepakupai-Meru", "Churun Merú", "Highest Waterfall", "Kerepakupai Meru", "Kerepakupai merú", "Parakupa-vena", "Kerepakupai meru", "Devil's mouth", "Kerepakupai-meru", "The Angel Falls", "Angel falls", "Salto Angel", "Angel Falls"], "length": 3961, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cd2940418f466c436556186454ba4b530a05629dfce2da7f"}

It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. \n\nGeorge J. Folsey received a 1953 Oscar nomination for  Best Cinematography, Color. \n\nThe film stars Esther Williams, Victor Mature, and Walter Pidgeon, with David Brian and Donna Corcoran.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the late 19th Century, a polio-stricken Australian girl, Annette Kellerman (Esther Williams), swims as a means to improve her health. Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.\n\nAboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sydney with them to London.\n\nThe teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.\n\nJimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in a water ballet at the Hippodrome.   Manager Alfred Harper (David Brian) does not offer them a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.\n\nShe and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. After the death of her father, she travels to Montauk at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.\n\nAs time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.\n\nA water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma. With her future in doubt, Harper steps aside when he sees for himself how much Annette and Jimmy are in love.\n\nCast \n\n* Esther Williams as Annette Kellerman \n* Victor Mature as James Sullivan \n* Walter Pidgeon as Frederick Kellerman \n* David Brian as Alfred Harper \n* Donna Corcoran as Annette Kellerman at age 10 \n* Jesse White as Doc Cronnol \n* Maria Tallchief as Pavlova \n* Howard Freeman as Aldrich, Lecture Bureau \n* Charles Watts as Policeman on Revere Beach \n* Wilton Graff as Garvey the Producer \n* Frank Ferguson as Boston Prosecutor \n* James Bell as Boston Judge \n* James Flavin as Train conductor \n* Willis Bouchey as Movie director\n\nProduction\n\nMGM signed a deal with Kellerman to make a film based on her life in 1951. It was originally called The One Piece Suit. \n\nKellerman thought Williams was \"too beautiful\" to play her and thought Victor Mature's depiction of Jimmy Sullivan was \"the antithesis\" of the character in real life (\"he never did anything cheap\"). \n\nThe title\n\nMillion Dollar Mermaid not only became Esther Williams' nickname around Hollywood, but it became the title of her autobiography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), co-written with Digby Diehl. Williams has often called this her favorite film. \n\nRelease\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,851,000 in the US and Canada and $2,096,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $243,000.\n\nHome media\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Turner Entertainment released Million Dollar Mermaid on DVD as part of the Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 2. The 6 disc set was a follow up to the company's Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 1, and contains digitally remastered versions of several of Williams's films including Thrill of a Romance (1945), Fiesta (1947), This Time for Keeps (1947), Pagan Love Song (1950) and Easy to Love (1953). \n\nPopular culture\n\nThe movie and its star are referenced in Hail Caesar.\nQuestion:\nWhich film star was known as the million dollar mermaid?\nAnswer:\nEsther Williams\nPassage:\nWeather vane\nA weather vane, wind vane, or weathercock is an instrument for showing the direction of the wind. They are typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building.\n\nAlthough partly functional, weather vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional cockerel design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows and horses. Not all weather vanes have pointers.\n\nThe word 'vane' comes from the Old English word fana meaning 'flag'.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Tower of the Winds on the ancient Greek agora in Athens once bore on its roof a wind vane in the form of a bronze Triton holding a rod in his outstretched hand, rotating as the wind changed direction. Below, the frieze was adorned with the eight wind deities. The eight metre high structure also featured sundials, and a water clock inside dates from around 50 BC. \n\nPope Gregory I said that the cock (rooster) \"was the most suitable emblem of Christianity\", being \"the emblem of St Peter\".[http://www.google.com/search?tbm\nbks&hlen&q\nForlong+%22emblem+of+St+Peter%22 John G. R. Forlong, Encyclopedia of Religions: A-d - Page 471]The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by Edward Walford, John Charles Cox, George Latimer Apperson - page 202 [http://books.google.com/books?id\njeAmWNkmpHUC&pgPA202&lpg\nPA202&dqsixth+century+Pope+Gregory+the+cock+the+emblem+of+Christianity&source\nbl&otsbGRh9hE0Vl&sig\nM4VfpbZnY_ojmvNlvRkL7dV6T8g&hlen&sa\nX&eiCAK5T4-VB4LA8ATU8cGnBA&ved\n0CFMQ6AEwAQ#vonepage&q\nsixth%20century%20Pope%20Gregory%20the%20cock%20the%20emblem%20of%20Christianity&ffalse] Some say that it was as a result of this that the cock began gradually to be used as a weather vane on church steeples, and some add that in the 9th century Pope Nicholas I  ordered the figure to be placed on every church steeple.  and it is known that Pope Leo IV did have it placed on the Old St. Peter's Basilica or old Constantinian basilica  even before Nicholas I was Pope.  Alternative theories about the origin of weathercocks on church steeples are that it was an emblem of the vigilance of the clergy calling the people to prayer,  that it was derived from the Goths  and is only possibly a Christian symbol,  and that it is an emblem of the sun. \n\nIn fact, Pope Nicholas I decreed in the 9th century that all churches must show the symbol of a cock on its dome or steeple, as a symbol of Jesus' prophecy of Peter's betrayal (Luke 22:34), that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the morning following the Last Supper. Many churches started using this symbol on its weathervanes. The weathervanes has North, East, South, West, Or Opposite. In the Bayeux Tapestry of the 1070s, originally of the Bayeux Cathedral (Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Bayeux) and now exhibited at Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, there is a depiction of a man installing a cock on Westminster Abbey. Other sources cited above say the custom had begun more than two centuries earlier. In fact, the oldest weather vane with the shape of a rooster existing at the world is the Gallo di Ramperto, made in 820 and now preserved in the Museo di Santa Giulia in Brescia, Lombardy.  \n\nA few churches used weather vanes in the shape of the emblems of their patron saints. The City of London has two surviving examples. The weather vane of St Peter upon Cornhill is not in the shape of a rooster, but a key;  while St Lawrence Jewry's weather vane is in the form of a gridiron. \n\nEarly weather vanes had very ornamental pointers, but modern wind vanes are usually simple arrows that dispense with the directionals because the instrument is connected to a remote reading station. An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy's Admiralty building in London - the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met.\n\nModern aerovanes combine the directional vane with an anemometer (a device for measuring wind speed). Co-locating both instruments allows them to use the same axis (a vertical rod) and provides a coordinated readout.\n\nWorld's largest weather vane\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, the world's largest weather vane is a Tío Pepe sherry advertisement located in Jerez, Spain. The city of Montague, Michigan also claims to have the largest standard-design weather vane, being a ship and arrow which measures 48 feet tall, with an arrow 26 feet long. \n\nA challenger for the title of world's largest weather vane is located in Whitehorse, Yukon. The weather vane is a retired Douglas DC-3 CF-CPY atop a swiveling support. Located at the Yukon Transportation Museum  beside Whitehorse International Airport, the weather vane is used by pilots to determine wind direction, used as a landmark by tourists and enjoyed by locals. The weather vane only requires a 5 knot wind to rotate. \n\nSlang term\n\nThe term \"weathervane\" is also a slang word for a politician who has frequent changes of opinion. The National Assembly of Quebec has banned use of this slang term as a slur after its use by members of the legislature.\nQuestion:\nWhat does a weathervane measure?\nAnswer:\nWind direction\nPassage:\nHoly city\nHoly city is a term applied to many cities, all of them central to the history or faith of specific religions. Such cities may also contain at least one headquarters complex (often containing a religious edifice, seminary, shrine, residence of the leading cleric of the religion and/or chambers of the religious leadership's offices) which constitutes a major destination of human traffic, or pilgrimage to the city, especially for major ceremonies and observances. A holy city is a symbolic city, representing attributes beyond its natural characteristics.

Hall learnt about the group from a Guardian article by Martin Wainwright.   This encouraged him to buy the book \"Pitmen Painters: The Ashington Group 1934-1984\" by William Feaver about the group, on which the play is loosely based.  Following a sellout run at both the Live Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 2007  and its transfer to the Royal National Theatre,  it returned to the National for a limited season before heading out on a UK Tour.  A Broadway production opened on 30 September 2010 following previews from 14 September 2010 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and played a limited run until 12 December 2010. It featured the original cast. \n\nThe Pitmen Painters opened in London's West End in October 2011 at the Duchess Theatre.

Canadian Grand Prix, Rd 16, Montreal, Canada, 8 October 1978.\nIn the 1960s the rivalry between French and English speaking Canada meant that the country's Grand Prix had two homes: Mosport Park one year and Mont-Tremblant the next. By 1970, however, Mont-Tremblant was deemed too dangerous and the race moved full time to Mosport Park.\nIn 1977 the French Canadians, motivated by the incredible success of Gilles Villeneuve, decided it was about time they built a race track. Building a new circuit simply wasn't feasible, however, as time and money were against them.\nTheir solution was simple and effective. Taking the Ile Notre-Dame, they connected all the island's roads and made a circuit. The island had been the home of the 1967 World Fair (Expo'67) and was full of futuristic looking buildings. It was, everyone agreed, a perfect venue for a Grand Prix.\nAfter $2m was spent on upgrading the circuit to Formula One standards, the first race was held there in October 1978. Gilles Villeneuve, in his first season with Ferrari, was yet to win a Formula One race, but at his home Grand Prix he took a memorable debut victory. Following his tragic death in 1982, the track was renamed in his honour.\nHis son, Jacques, never won at the track but some of the great drivers of the sport have taken the spoils here. Michael Schumacher holds the record of having won seven times in Canada. It is also the scene of Jean Alesi's single Grand Prix victory in 1995, driving the number 27 Ferrari, the same car number which carried Gilles Villeneuve into the hearts of the Canadian Formula One fans.\nQuestion:\nThe Gilles Villeneuve Formula One racing circuit is in which country?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nWitching hour\nWitching hour is a term in occult belief that refers to the time at which creatures such as witches, demons, and ghosts are thought to appear and to be at their most powerful, and at which black magic is thought to be at its most effective because the period from 3AM to 4 AM is the span where there are no Catholic church services and prayers which are marked by the Canonical hours which are also three regular hours in length, but in modern times that fact is mostly forgotten so the terms is usually used to refer to midnight and 2 AM recognized as the witching hour by some neopagans.. \n\nAdversely, the terms Devil's hour applies to the hour of 3 AM or 3:15, the suggestion being that this is an inversion of the time at which Christ died at Calvary.\n\nThe terms may be used to refer to any arbitrary time of bad luck, or in which something bad has a greater likelihood to occur (e.g., a baby crying,  a computer crashing,  stock market volatility,  crimes, etc.). \n\nIn medieval times, midnight was when it was believed that witches emerged to practice the occult.

The nose is a part of the body that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a result, any trauma to the face can cause bleeding, which may be profuse. Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from household heaters. People are more susceptible if they are taking medications which prevent normal blood clotting ( warfarin [Coumadin], clopidogrel bisulfate [Plavix], aspirin, or any anti-inflammatory medication). Other predisposing factors include infection, trauma, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and inherited bleeding problems. \"Epistaxis\" is a Greek word meaning \"a dripping,\" especially of blood from the nose.\nLast Editorial Review: 5/13/2016\nQuestion:\nWhat is the technical term for a nose bleed?\nAnswer:\nNosebleeding\nPassage:\nMarinara sauce\nMarinara (English: \"mariner's\") sauce is an Italian sauce that originated in Naples, usually made with tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and onions.   Its many variations can include the addition of capers, olives, spices, and a dash of wine.  \n\nThis sauce is widely used in Italian-American cuisine, which has greatly diverged from its Old World origins.\n\nItalians refer to marinara sauce only in association with other recipes. For instance, spaghetti alla marinara literally translates to \"spaghetti mariner's style\" (from the adjective marinara with the feminine suffix -a pertaining to salsa, Italian for \"sauce\"), but tomato sauce alone in Italy is called sugo/salsa al/di pomodoro or pummarola (the latter being Neapolitan language).\n\nOrigin\n\nSeveral folk theories exist as to the origin of this sauce: One version states that cooks aboard Neapolitan ships returning from the Americas invented marinara sauce in the mid-16th century after Spaniards introduced the tomato (a central Mexican \"New World\" fruit) to Europe.  Another theory states this was a sauce prepared by the wives of Neapolitan sailors upon their return from sea.  \n\nHistorically, however, the first Italian cookbook to include tomato sauce,  Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward), was written by Italian chef Antonio Latini and was published in two volumes in 1692 and 1694. Latini served as the Steward of the First Minister to the Spanish Viceroy of Naples.   This early tomato sauce was more like a modern tomato salsa.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient in marinara sauce?\nAnswer:\nTomato\nPassage:\nCrooner\nCrooner is an American epithet given to male singers of jazz standards, mostly from the Great American Songbook, either backed by a full orchestra, a big band or by a piano. Originally it was an ironic term denoting an emphatically sentimental, often emotional singing style made possible by the use of microphones. Some performers, such as Russ Columbo, did not accept the term:  Frank Sinatra once said that he did not consider himself or Bing Crosby \"crooners\". \nHistory\n\nThis dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and electrical recording. Before the advent of the microphone, popular singers like Al Jolson had to project to the rear seats of a theater, as did opera singers, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made possible the more personal style.  Al Bowlly, Gene Austin and Art Gillham are often credited as inventors of the crooning style but Rudy Vallée became far more popular, beginning from 1928.  He could be heard by anyone with a phonograph or a radio.  \n\n\"In his popular radio program, which began with his floating greeting, 'Heigh ho, everybody,' beamed in from a New York City night club, he stood like a statue, surrounded by clean-cut collegiate band musicians and cradling a saxophone in his arms.\"\n\nHis first film, The Vagabond Lover, was promoted with the line, \"Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!\" while his success brought press warnings of the \"Vallee Peril\": this \"punk from Maine\" with the \"dripping voice\" required mounted police to beat back screaming, swooning females at his vaudeville shows. \n\nBy the early 1930s the term \"crooner\" had taken on a pejorative connotation, both Cardinal O'Connell of Boston and the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) publicly denouncing the vocal form, O'Connell calling it \"base\", \"degenerate\", \"defiling\" and un-American and NYSTA adding \"corrupt\".  Even The New York Times predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper printed, \"They sing like that because they can’t help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion…. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf.\" Voice range shifted from tenor (Vallée) to baritone (Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby). Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robinson, Crosby, Columbo & Vallee, called upon men to fight \"these public enemies\" brought into homes via radio.\n\nThere were female crooners, including Annette Hanshaw, Mildred Bailey (at the beginning of her career) and Helen Rowland.\n\nThe genre enjoyed popularity within the former Soviet Union with Mark Reizen, Leonid Utyosov, Sergey Lemeshev, Ivan Kozlovsky, Pyotr Leshchenko, Pavel Lisitsian, Georg Ots, Oleg Anofriyev, Muslim Magomayev, and Joseph Kobzon leading the way. Their performances had a variety of influences including ballads and swing and was included in popular film soundtracks.\n\nDecline \n\nAfter 1954 popular music became dominated by other styles, especially rock 'n' roll, while the music of latter-day crooners such as Perry Como and Matt Monro was recategorized by radio stations as easy listening or adult contemporary. Crooners have remained popular among fans of traditional pop music, with contemporary performers such as Tony Bennett, Barry Manilow, Brian Evans, Richard Hawley, Harry Connick, Jr., Michael Bublé, Neil Hannon, Peter Cincotti, Matteo Brancaleoni and Engelbert Humperdinck keeping the form alive. The term is rarely used to describe a female singer, although Mildred Bailey's pre-swing records as well as Helen Rowland are often considered part of the \"crooning\" style. Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dick Powell, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, Bobby Darin and Jimmy Durante incorporated other popular styles into their music, such as blues, dixieland and even native Hawaiian music.\n\nCountry crooners\n\nDue to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became a remaining part of country music.  Bing Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song  San Antonio Rose, originally recorded by Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys. In 1942 Perry Como had a smash hit with Deep in the Heart of Texas; Bing Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Perry Como, covered this song and took it to the #3 position in the US chart that same year. Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves and Ray Price are especially well known for their country crooner standards.    Also Dean Martin is rather famous for the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records. Fellow Italian-American crooner Perry Como recorded several albums with country producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners scored hits with pop versions of country-songs: Tony Bennett had a Billboard #1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams' Cold, Cold Heart, which was also performed by Louis Armstrong; Perry Como had a Billboard #1 hit in 1953 with his version of Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes, a #1 country hit for its author Slim Willet and a #4 country hit forRay Price; Guy Mitchell scored a Billboard #1 in 1959 with Heartaches by the Number, a country-hit for Ray Price; Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK #1 hit with Release Me, another song already made famous by Ray Price in 1954. In 1970 Ray Price had a #1 U.S. country hit and a #11 Billboard Hot 100 hit with the song For the Good Times written by Kris Kristofferson; subsequently Perry Como's rendition reached #7 in 1973 U.K. singles chart.\n\nList of famous crooners\n\nRay Eberle\nQuestion:\nWhich crooner’s only UK No.1 was Memories Are Made Of This in 1956?\nAnswer:\nDino Paul Crocetti\nPassage:\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) - IMDb\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) - IMDb\nIMDb\n18 January 2017 6:08 PM, UTC\nNEWS\nThere was an error trying to load your rating for this title.\nSome parts of this page won't work property.

(Incidently, all three of these movies share a choreographer) The sheer imagination of this film is akin to that of Peter Pan. It is a tremendous celebration of childhood and fantasy. Sadly, this movie is often overlooked. As a college student, few of my friends know about this film. The few that do know of it treasure it. Every child should be so lucky as to be raised with Chitty. The dancing, the songs, the genius and humor showcase the best of musicals and childhood alike. Enjoy and share this unsung classic. We can hope that the new live musical in London will rekindle the public's appreciation for movies like this\nP.S the \"Old Bamboo\" dance looks very much like the \"Step in time,\" from Mary Poppins.\n28 of 41 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nQuestion:\nThe Potts children are from which film?\nAnswer:\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang\nPassage:\nTrevi Fountain\nThe Trevi Fountain () is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Pietro Bracci. Standing  high and  wide,  it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita.\n\nHistory before 1629\n\nThe fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie)  marks the terminal point  of the \"modern\" Acqua Vergine, the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22 km. This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years. \n\nLegends\n\nLegend holds that in 19 BC thirsty Roman soldiers were guided by a young girl to a source of pure water 13 km from the city of Rome. The discovery of the source led Augustus to commission the construction of a 22 km aqueduct leading into the city, which was named Aqua Virgo, or Virgin Waters, in honour of the legendary young girl. The aqueduct served the hot Baths of Agrippa, and Rome, for over four hundred years.\n\nCommission, construction, and design\n\nIn 1629 Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti  one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga  and a French design by Edme Bouchardon. \n\nCompetitions had become the rage during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains and even the Spanish Steps. In 1730 Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei – but due to the outcry in Rome over the fact that a Florentine won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway. Work began in 1732 and the fountain was completed in 1762, long after Salvi's death, when \nPietro Bracci's Oceanus (god of all water) was set in the central niche.\n\nSalvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a stubborn barber's unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase, called by Romans the asso di coppe, the \"Ace of Cups\".\n\nThe Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Giuseppe Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and \"Trivia\", the Roman virgin. It was officially opened and inaugurated on May 22 by Pope Clemens XIII.\n\nThe majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about 35 km east of Rome. \n\nRestoration\n\nThe fountain was refurbished in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it will be the most thorough restoration in the fountain's history. \n\nRestoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of November 3, 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.\n \n \n \n\nIconography\n\nThe backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new façade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main stories. Taming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus' shell chariot, taming hippocamps.\n\nIn the centre a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo façade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, Abundance spills water from her urn and Salubrity holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.\n\nThe tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses (by 1730, rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany).\n\nCoin throwing\n\nCoins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.  This was the theme of 1954's Three Coins in the Fountain and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.\n\nAn estimated 3,000 Euros are thrown into the fountain each day. The money has been used to subsidise a supermarket for Rome's needy; however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain. It also is illegal to steal coins from the Trevi Fountain.  \n\nCuriosity \n\nIn 1973, Italian National Postal Service dedicated a postage stamp to Trevi Fountain.\nQuestion:\nWhat is traditionally thrown into the Trevi Fountain, Rome\nAnswer:\nCoin (money)\n", "answers": ["Canada", "Canadá", "The Dominion of Canada", "Commonwealth of Canada", "Dominion of canada", "ISO 3166-1:CA", "Etymology of Canada", "CANADA", "Canadiophile", "Canada's", "ᑲᓇᑕ", "Canada/References", "America's top hat", "Canada.", "Cnada", "Čanada", "Canadian Federation", "Kenadian", "Canadialand", "Xanada", "Dominion of Canada", "Canadaa"], "length": 3764, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e86cb93200c65d0af2aff6b84ff91f62000d839575de34a1"}

Peters)\nWhether or not you agree that the Sazerac is America’s oldest cocktail may depend on whether or not you’re from New Orleans… or work for the Sazerac Company, which has registered the Sazerac Cocktail name and trademarked the phrase “America’s Oldest Cocktail”, which you’ll find on the back of every bottle of Sazerac 6 Year Old Straight Rye Whiskey.\nBut more about that later.  What about the cocktail itself, for which the name is most commonly recognized?\nThe Sazerac calls New Orleans home, and New Orleans in turn has called the Sazerac it’s official cocktail since June 23, 2008.  The cocktail is much older than that, but is it America’s Oldest Cocktail?\nLegend favors the claim, crediting the drink’s creation in 1838 to Antoine Amadie Peychaud (of Peychaud Bitters fame), who served it in the large end of an egg cup –  a coquetier in French, Anglicized as “cocktail”.  Fact, however, may disagree: the first U.S.-printed definition of “cock-tail” as an alcohol-based beverage appeared in an 1806 edition of a Hudson, New York publication called “The Balance and Columbian Repository”.\nThe drink was originally concocted with Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils, a cognac imported by one Sewell T. Taylor.  The former owner of The Merchants Exchange Coffee House bar in New Orleans, Taylor found a home for his new import with his successor, Aaron Bird, who had rechristened The Exchange as The Sazerac House.  Here Bird served a mixture of Taylor’s imported cognac and Peychaud’s Bitters: the Sazerac Cocktail.  A new proprietor, Thomas Handy, swapped rye whiskey for the cognac around 1870, after an outbreak of phylloxeria devastated French vineyards.  The substitution stuck: the Sazerac is possibly the best known rye-based cocktail.\nLittle surprise, then, that the Buffalo Trace Distillery has produced a straight rye whiskey called “Sazerac”.  While the distillery is best-known for it’s Bourbon (particularly it’s Pappy Van Winkle expression ) and is located in Frankfort, KY, Buffalo Trace’s parent company is the Sazerac Company, which is headquartered a mere 8 miles away in Metairie, and was founded in 1870 by… Thomas Handy.\nThe Whiskey\nSazerac Straight Rye Whiskey comes in aged expressions of 6 and 18 years, of which the younger expression is reviewed here.  It’s bottled at 90 Proof (45% alcohol) in a rounded, old-timey cork-stopped bottle with a long-neck.  Tear-drop beveling just below the neck and simple arched beveling around the base add a nice touch to the bottle’s appearance.  As is frequently the case, there is no official information on the exact mashbill – but to be designated a rye, it has to consist of at least 51% rye grain.\nIn the bottle, Sazerac 6 YO has the traditional coloring of an American Rye, a coppery amber.  In the glass and held to the sunlight, it blushes slightly, as if a wee self-conscious.  This seems curious at first, because a distinct whiff of woody spice over a mild vanilla says it shouldn’t be shy about its rye content, nor embarrassed to be served neat.  Yet there’s something else traipsing around in the shadows, and a second sniff reveals it to be lilac.\nSimilarly, the first burst of flavor is one of heady spiciness with hints of white chocolate swirling around its medium body – all defining qualities of a Straight Rye’s spicy sweetness, emphasis on the spice.  But a few more swirls bring out a moderate seasoning of wildflower honey – not bad to the taste, but surprising in the amount of sweetness it imparts to the rye.  Is there, perhaps, too much corn amongst the rye?  The sweetness lingers long into the finish – too long – but eventually gives way to mild Latakia tobacco.\nOn the back of the bottle, you’ll read: “This rye whiskey is the perfect choice to make the Sazerac® Cocktail, America’s First Cocktail™.”  As I write this, I cannot vouch for that claim, as I haven’t yet tried Sazerac Rye in a Sazerac Cocktail.  Then again, I rarely drink cocktails, being so stubborn neat whiskey that I’ll drink it in midst of a sweltering Washington, D.C., summer – or, say, on a Mississippi paddleboat en route to the site of the Battle of New Orleans.  I can imagine, however, that if a common Rye like Old Overholt makes a fine, albeit properly mixed, Sazerac (it does), then a half-notch-above-plain-average Rye that happens to be named for the cocktail stands a good chance of making one that’s better.\nThe sweetness that dominates the taste and finish might lend itself well to mixing, and given what Sazerac Straight Rye says about itself on the bottle, I think that’s the main point of this Rye whiskey.  However, if you’re a Bourbon drinker who is curious about American Rye but bothered by descriptions of its characteristic spiciness, you might want to pour yourself a neat (or even on the rocks) Sazerac Straight Rye for starters.  It could change – or at least expand – your taste in American Whiskey.\nThe Price\nIn the U.S., the Sazerac 6 Year Old Rye averages between $25-27 a bottle.  And while it’s a step up from the average starter Ryes that dominate the shelves, it’s not a boutique Rye.  There’s more of it, and it’s easier to come by than most other Ryes you may read about.  Buffalo Trace earns kudos for helping to boost the presence of Rye, and keep it affordable.\nAwards\nSazerac 6-year Old Straight Rye Whiskey has been winning awards every year since 2006 , scooping four in 2012 so far.\nQuestion:\nThe oldest known American cocktail, what whiskey forms the base of the cocktail known as a Sazerac?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nFinal Sochi Winter Olympics 2014 medal count: Russia ...\nFinal Sochi Winter Olympics 2014 medal count: Russia finishes with most medals -

The Netherlands finished with 24 medals overall this year and tied for fifth in the gold count with Germany as both countries took the top spot on the podium eight times.\nIn this Storystream\nQuestion:\nPrior to Sochi which country has won the most Winter Olympic medals?\nAnswer:\nNorvège\nPassage:\nBeetroot\nThe beetroot is the taproot portion of the beet plant,  usually known in North America as the beet, also table beet, garden beet, red beet, or golden beet. It is one of several of the cultivated varieties of Beta vulgaris grown for their edible taproots and their leaves (called beet greens). These varieties have been classified as B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Conditiva Group.\n\nOther than as a food, beets have use as a food colouring and as a medicinal plant. Many beet products are made from other Beta vulgaris varieties, particularly sugar beet.\n\nUses\n\nFood\n\nUsually the deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten boiled, roasted or raw, and either alone or combined with any salad vegetable. A large proportion of the commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilized beets or into pickles. In Eastern Europe, beet soup, such as borscht, is a popular dish. In Indian cuisine, chopped, cooked, spiced beet is a common side dish. Yellow-coloured beetroots are grown on a very small scale for home consumption. \n\nThe green, leafy portion of the beet is also edible. The young leaves can be added raw to salads, whilst the adult leaves are most commonly served boiled or steamed, in which case they have a taste and texture similar to spinach. Those greens selected should be from bulbs that are unmarked, instead of those with overly limp leaves or wrinkled skins, both of which are signs of dehydration.  The domestication of beets can be traced to the emergence of an allele which enables biennial harvesting of leaves and taproot. \n\nBeetroot can be: boiled or steamed, peeled and then eaten warm with or without butter as a delicacy; cooked, pickled, and then eaten cold as a condiment; or peeled, shredded raw, and then eaten as a salad. Pickled beets are a traditional food in many countries.\n\nA traditional Pennsylvania Dutch dish is pickled beet egg. Hard-boiled eggs are refrigerated in the liquid left over from pickling beets and allowed to marinate until the eggs turn a deep pink-red colour.\n\nIn Poland and Ukraine, beet is combined with horseradish to form popular ćwikła, which is traditionally used with cold cuts and sandwiches, but often also added to a meal consisting of meat and potatoes. The same in Serbia where the popular cvekla is used as winter salad, seasoned with salt and vinegar, with meat dishes. As an addition to horseradish it is also used to produce the \"red\" variety of chrain, a popular condiment in Ashkenazi Jewish, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian cuisine.\n\nPopular in Australian hamburgers, a slice of pickled beetroot is combined with fried egg and sometimes pineapple  (as well as the usual beef patty, barbecue sauce and salad) to make an Aussie burger. \n\nWhen beet juice is used, it is most stable in foods with a low water content, such as frozen novelties and fruit fillings.  Betanins, obtained from the roots, are used industrially as red food colourants, e.g. to intensify the colour of tomato paste, sauces, desserts, jams and jellies, ice cream, sweets, and breakfast cereals.\n\nBeetroot can also be used to make wine. \n\nFood shortages in Europe following World War I caused great hardships, including cases of mangelwurzel disease, as relief workers called it.  It was symptomatic of eating only beets. \n\nFile:Borscht served.jpg|Borscht\nFile:Salad of grated beet and apple C IMG 4352.JPG|Salad of grated beet and apple\nFile:Christmas foods (5300034752).jpg|Finnish rosolli\nFile:Rote Beete - sauer eingelegt (8987-89).jpg|Sliced, pickled beetroot\nFile:Chrain3.jpg|Chrain with beet\nFile:Beet juice-01.jpg|Beetroot juice drink\n\nOther uses\n\nBetanin, obtained from the roots, is used industrially as red food colorant, to improve the color and flavor of tomato paste, sauces, desserts, jams and jellies, ice cream, sweets, breakfast cereals, etc.\n\nHistorical uses\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, beetroot was used as a treatment for a variety of conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood. Bartolomeo Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of \"garlic-breath\". \n\nPreliminary research\n\nIn preliminary research, beetroot juice reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals  and so may have an effect on mechanisms of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nBeets contain betaines which may function to reduce the concentration of homocysteine,  a homolog of the naturally occurring amino acid cysteine. High circulating levels of homocysteine may be harmful to blood vessels and thus contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.  This hypothesis is controversial as it has not yet been established whether homocysteine itself is harmful or is just an indicator of increased risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nNutrition\n\nPer 100 gram serving providing 43 calories, beetroot is an excellent source (20% of the Daily Value, DV) of folate and a good source (14% DV) of manganese, with other nutrients in low amounts (see table displayed at right). \n\nSafety\n\nThe red colour compound betanin is not broken down in the body, and in higher concentrations may temporarily cause urine and stool to assume a reddish colour; in the case of urine this is called beeturia.  This effect may cause distress and concern due to the visual similarity to what appears to be blood in the stool, hematuria (blood in the urine), or hematochezia (blood passing through the anus, usually in or with stool). These deceptive appearances are completely harmless and subside once the betanin is out of the system. In the cases of reddish feces, the bright redness from betanin is in contrast to what occurs with melena (very dark or blackish feces) which often indicates that bleeding is occurring further up the digestive system, and is more likely to be a serious problem.\n\nNitrosamine formation in beet juice can reliably be prevented by adding ascorbic acid.\n\nCultivars\n\nBelow is a list of several commonly available cultivars of beets. Generally, 55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root. All cultivars can be harvested earlier for use as greens. Unless otherwise noted, the root colours are shades of red and dark red with different degrees of zoning noticeable in slices.\nQuestion:\nPopular among East Europeans, which beetroot soup can be served either hot or cold?\nAnswer:\nBorsht\nPassage:\nGrounation Day\nGrounation Day (April 21) is an important Rastafari holy day, and second after Coronation Day (November 2). It is celebrated in honor of Haile Selassie's 1966 visit to Jamaica.\n\nVisit of Selassie to Jamaica\n\nHaile  Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in Addis Ababa, and had allowed Rastafari and other people of African descent to settle on his personal land in Shashamane.\n\nHaile Selassie visited Jamaica on Thursday, 21 April 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston,  having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them. They waited at the airport playing drums and smoking large quantities of marijuana. Today the Rastafari celebrate that Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on April 21st.\n\nWhen Haile Selassie's Ethiopian Airlines flight landed at the airport at 1:30 PM, the crowd surrounded his plane on the tarmac. The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat calabash drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded Abeng horns of the Maroons.  All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the red carpet that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.  When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\"  After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine. [hence grounation, Iyaric equivalent of foundation, \"uplifted\" with the sound of the word ground in the sense of \"making contact with the soil\"]  He was then driven to the King's House, the residence of Governor-General Clifford Campbell.  \n\nAs a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions  attended by His Majesty,   and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably Joseph Hibbert, also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,  where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \"liberation before repatriation\". At a dinner held at the King's House, Rastas claimed that acting Jamaican Prime Minister Donald Sangster had stamped his foot at Lulu, Haile Selassie's pet chihuahua, who, they swore, had responded with the roar of a lion. \n\nDefying expectations of the Jamaican authorities,  Selassie never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the Messiah. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions bearing the Ethiopian seal – the only recipients of such an honour on this visit.  Meanwhile, he presented some of the Jamaican politicians, including Sangster, with miniature coffin-shaped cigarette boxes.\n\nImpact \n\nRita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie in his motorcade en route to the King's House.  She claimed, in interviews and in her book No Woman No Cry, that she had seen a stigma on Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd, and was instantly convinced of his divinity.   \n\nFor years afterward, Planno, who became a spiritual guru of Bob Marley, would give out enlarged photographs of himself with the Emperor on the steps of the airplane.  \n\nThe great significance of this event in the development of the Rastafari religion should not be underestimated. Having been outcasts in society, they gained a measure of respectability for the first time.    By making Rasta more acceptable, it opened the way for the commercialisation of reggae, leading in turn to the further global spread of Rastafari.\n\nHaile Selassie is thought to have encouraged the Rastafari elders to learn about the Ethiopian Orthodox faith while in Jamaica, and in 1970, he dispatched Archbishop Laike Mandefro to establish a mission in Jamaica. Mandefro was formally invited by Joseph Hibbert, one of the original founders of the Rastafari Movement, to teach the Rasta community, and in 1971 Mandefro named Hibbert as a \"Spiritual Organizer\".  During this time, Mandefro pointedly refused calls to demand that the Rastafari renounce their faith in Haile Selassie's divinity, and some 2,000 Rastas accordingly received Orthodox baptisms. \n\nBecause of Haile Selassie's visit, April 21 is celebrated as Grounation Day. The \"Abu Ye! Abu Ye Abu ye! Abu ye!\" chant is an element of Grounation Day festivities.\nQuestion:\nGrounation Day (April 21) and Coronation Day (November 2) are important holy days in which religion?\nAnswer:\nListing of noted rastafarians\n", "answers": ["Centeio", "Winter rye", "Rye", "Ryep", "Secale cereale", "Rye (botany)", "Rye (grain)", "Rye Extract", "Oralmat"], "length": 3136, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5dd94f8e7bc9f8a743374ec79d3fe48491ff21944da577f6"}

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2½ furlongs (5,331 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1957, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers. \n\nThe race's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history, and this now represents British racing's longest commercial sponsorship. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001.\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The most recent of these is Bobs Worth, the winner of the latter race in 2013.\n\nMany Clouds became the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and the Grand National, in 2014 and 2015 respectively.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse (2 wins):\n* Mandarin – 1957, 1961\n* Arkle – 1964, 1965\n* Denman – 2007, 2009\n\nLeading jockey (3 wins):\n* Willie Robinson – Mandarin (1961), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968)\n\nLeading trainer (7 wins):\n* Fulke Walwyn – Mandarin (1957, 1961), Taxidermist (1958), Mill House (1963), Man of the West (1968), Charlie Potheen (1972), Diamond Edge (1981)\n\nWinners\n\n* Weights given in stones and pounds; Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\n Be My Royal finished first in 2002, but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance.\nQuestion:\nAt which English racecourse would you see the 'Hennessy Gold Cup'?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nRoss Kemp\nRoss James Kemp (born 21 July 1964) is an English actor, author and BAFTA award-winning investigative journalist who rose to prominence in the role of Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Since 2006, Kemp has received international recognition as an investigative journalist for his critically acclaimed and award-winning documentary series.\n\nActing career\n\nEarly career\n\nAfter training at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, Kemp received his Equity card when appearing alongside John Thaw and Richard Wilson at the Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea. He went on to feature in training films for the Ministry of Defence and the ITV soap opera Emmerdale Farm (now Emmerdale) as Graham Lodsworth. Guest appearances in London's Burning and Birds of a Feather followed, before getting a minor role in the 1987 film Playing Away alongside Neil Morrissey. \n\nEastEnders\n\nKemp's best-known role to date is that of hardman Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Making his debut in February 1990, his character was often at the centre of major storylines, including abusive marriages to Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), as well as the \"Sharongate\" storyline, which saw brother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) having an affair with Grant's wife.\n\nKemp announced in April 1999 that he would be leaving the soap later that year after nearly a decade. His exit was aired in October 1999 when his character moved to Brazil after surviving a car crash. Kemp refused to rule out an eventual return to EastEnders, and various media reports over the next few years speculated that he would be returning to the series at some stage. In early 2005, the BBC confirmed that Kemp would be returning to EastEnders later that year after six years away. It was co-star Barbara Windsor who convinced him to go back for a brief period.  His first comeback lasted just a few weeks from the late autumn of 2005, but he returned for a period of three months in 2006, before departing once again in June that year. Kemp has won various awards for his portrayal of Grant. \n\nIn January 2016 it was confirmed that Kemp would make a brief return to the show for the death of Grant's on-screen mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), appearing in three episodes from 13 to 17 May.   Followed by an unannounced appearance on 4 July 2016 and later filmed a further three weeks which will air in late August.\n\nOther roles\n\nFollowing his initial departure from EastEnders, Kemp moved from the BBC to ITV for a reported £1.2 million two-year deal.  Kemp's first role for ITV was in Hero of the Hour. During its filming, on 27 October 1999, Kemp required hospital treatment after being shot in the face when a stunt went wrong. He suffered cuts to his chest and face after safety glass shattered, and was also hit in the face by the discharge from a blank round. He was treated at the scene by paramedics, but made a full recovery.\n\nHe also starred as the lead in ITV's Christmas edition of A Christmas Carol. He took the lead roles in the television series, Without Motive and In Defence in 2000, and in 2002's Ultimate Force, where he took the role of Army Staff sergeant Henry Garvie from the British Special Air Service. He continued to appear in this role until 2006. He also gained the role of \"Cirra\" in the 2004 TV film, Spartacus.\n\nIn 2005, Kemp appeared in an episode of BBC's Extras and in a two-part adaptation of the Gerald Seymour novel A Line in the Sand for ITV, and he has also presented, on The Friday Night Project and appeared as a stand in host on The Paul O'Grady Show (2007; 2008).\n\nKemp appeared in the 4th episode of Series 14 of BBC's motoring show Top Gear. He was the \"Man in Boot\" of a Renault Twingo Sport being tested by Jeremy Clarkson. The test ended with Clarkson driving the car off the quayside of Belfast Harbour, after which Clarkson joked that Kemp was killed. \n\nWriting\n\nKemp has written several books. Initially focusing on tie-ins to his various TV documentaries, 2011 saw the publication of his first fictional story, Devil to Pay. A novel, Moving Target, was released in summer 2012.\n\nPolitics\n\nIn 1999 Kemp was elected as Rector of the University of Glasgow as the candidate of the Glasgow University Labour Club, but resigned in 2000 after the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council passed a motion requesting him to do so.  Kemp was succeeded by Greg Hemphill. \n\nIn August 2014, Kemp was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHis mother Jean was a hairdresser and his father John was a Detective Chief Inspector in the police force. He has one brother, Darren, who is a filmmaker for the BBC. He attended Shenfield High School and the Webber Douglas Academy. \n\nOn 11 June 2002 Kemp married Rebekah Wade, the then editor of The Sun. In November 2005 Wade was arrested following an alleged assault on her husband.  Kemp refused medical attention for a swollen lip and no action was taken.  In March 2009 Kemp and Wade divorced, and in October 2010, Kemp became a father to a baby boy by ex-partner Nicola Coleman who was his makeup artist. \n\nRoss Kemp married Renee O'Brien in 2012.  On 9 April 2015, Kemp announced via Twitter that he had become a father for the second time to a baby boy. \n\nAwards\n\nFilmography\n\nTV\n\nFilms\nQuestion:\nRoss Kemp plays which Eastenders character?\nAnswer:\nGrant Mitchell\nPassage:\nResponses to sneezing\nIn English-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's sneeze is \"bless you\", or, less commonly in the United States, \"Gesundheit\", the German word for health (and the response to sneezing in German-speaking countries).  There are several proposed bless-you origins for use in the context of sneezing.\n\nIn non-English-speaking cultures, words referencing good health or a long life are often used instead of \"bless you,\" though some also use references to God.\n\nIn East Asian cultures such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese cultures, there is no customary response to a sneeze and it is customary to say nothing at all.\n\nList of responses in other languages\nQuestion:\n\"What is the meaning of the German word \"\"Gesundheit\"\", said after a sneeze?\"\nAnswer:\nHealth hazard\nPassage:\nPick-up sticks\nPick-up sticks or pick-a-stick is a game of physical and mental skill.  A bundle of 'sticks', between 8 and 20 centimeters long, are held in a loose bunch and released on a table top, falling in random disarray.  Each player, in turn, must remove a stick from the pile without disturbing the remaining ones. One root of the name \"pick-up sticks\" may be the line of a children's nursery rhyme, \"...five, six, pick-up sticks!\" The game has spawned several variations such as Jackstraws (or Jack Straws), Spellicans, and Spillikins.\n\nThe sticks can be made out of ivory, bone, wood, bamboo, straw, reed, rush, yarrow, or plastics.\n\nSome Haida First Nation pick-up sticks are plain maple wood; they may also be decorated with abalone shell and copper.\n\nThe today most common pick-up game is Mikado. For details, see there.\n\nPlay \n\nThe object of the game is to pick up the most sticks.\n\nTo begin the game, a bundle of sticks are somewhat randomly distributed so that they end up in a tangled pile.  The more tangled the resulting (dis)array, the more challenging the game. In some versions of the game, any isolated sticks, or sticks lying alone, are removed.\n\nThe players attempt to remove a single stick, without moving any other stick. In some versions of the game, players use a tool to move the stick away from the pile; this \"tool\" may be one of the sticks, held aside before the game begins. In other versions, players must pick up the sticks by hand. In either case, players must not move any other things while attempting to remove the said stick; if any other stick moves, his turn ends immediately and he loses a turn. Players who successfully pick up a stick can then have another turn; the player keeps removing sticks until he causes a secondary stick to move.\n\nThe game is over when the last stick is removed. The winner is the player with the highest number of sticks picked up.\n\nIn some versions of the game, different-coloured sticks are worth different numbers of points, and the winner is the person with the highest score.\n\nJackstraws or Jack Straws \n\nThe pieces in a jackstraw set are often thematically related to farmyard tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. There are typically around 45 pieces in a set and made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the jackstraws themselves, the game typically includes a helper piece with a hooked edge to help people grasp and manipulate pieces. Each piece in the game also has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points at the end of the game. At the end of play, points are tallied up and the pieces can be thrown again or stored in a container for another use.\n\nEquipment \n\n*1 hook\n*approx 45 jackstraws\n\nObject \n\nPlayers try to win points by removing jackstraws - in the shapes of various tools - from the pile, one at a time.\n\nRules \n\n#If you're the first player, hold all the jackstraws about 5 centimetres from the table. Then drop them so that they fall into a pile.\n#Using the hook, try to remove jackstraws from the pile, one at a time without moving the others at all. If any jackstraws have fallen free from the pile, you may remove them first. Each time you succeed in removing one, keep it and try to remove another. Once you've started to remove a jackstraw, you can't change your mind and decide to remove another. If, at any time, you wish to use your fingers instead of the hook, you may do so.\n#If you move one or more jackstraws while you're trying to remove another, you must end your turn. That's why players should watch each opponent's turn very closely!\n#When your turn ends, the next player picks up and drops the remaining jackstraws and plays in the same manner.\nYou can also just start playing from where you left off without dropping the jackstraws again.\n#Continue playing until all the jackstraws are gone from the pile\n\nWinning \n\nAt the end of the game, players total the point values of their jackstraws. The players with the most points wins.\n\nScoring\n\nScore 10 points each – Two-man saw, Gun, Wrench, Ladder, Key-hole saw\nScore 5 points each – Shovel, Rake, Sledge, Fork, T-Square, Paddle, Axe, Crutch, Sword\nScore 2 points each - Cane, Arrow, Tamper, Baton, Hockey Stick, Pick\nScore 2 point each - all other pieces.\n\nOther games \n\n*Jenga In this game, short blocks of wood (1.5 × 2.5 × 7.5 cm) are stacked in a tower.

The name is derived from the Ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II whose statue was erected by Nasser on the square there in 1955.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original railway station was built as the terminal of the first rail link from Alexandria to Cairo in 1856. The current building was erected in 1892 and upgraded in 1955. As of January 2001 it was undergoing a major modernisation. In early 2011, following the Egyptian Uprising, Ramses station was fully upgraded and air conditioned with new marble flooring across the station and the addition of escalators. Some critics believe that the modernisations were too modern and destroyed much of the building's original style. \n\nHuda Shaarawi, the Egyptian feminist, famously removed her veil here.\n\nStructure\n\nOutside of the station used to be the statue of Ramses II that was relocated to  Memphis, Egypt, 12 mi south of Cairo in the area of Giza on 25 August 2006.\n\nThe famous sculpture of Mahmoud Mokhtar, Nahdat Misr (Egypt's Awakening), was originally installed outside the station in 1928, but was removed to its current location near Cairo University in the 1950s.\n\nFacilities in the station include a left luggage office, a post office, ATMs, a pharmacy and a tourist information office. \n\nTrain services\n\nRamses Station is served by the vast majority of Egyptian National Railways' intercity passenger services.\n\nConnecting services\n\nThe railway station has also a connection to Cairo Metro Lines 1 and 2  via the nearby \"Al-Shohadaa/Martyrs\" Station; Cairo Trams, city buses,  microbuses, and Cairo taxis are also available.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Cairo Railway station.jpg|Station building\nFile:Cairo Railways2.JPG|Platforms\nFile:Cairo Train Station.jpg|Platforms\nFile:The Main Door-Ramses Station.JPG|Main station's door\nQuestion:\nRamses Station is the main railway station in which capital city?\nAnswer:\nCairo Hotel\nPassage:\nMap of Most Populated African Countries - Maps of World\nMap of Most Populated African Countries\nOnline Quiz\nMost Populated African Countries\nAmong the African Countries, Nigeria is the most populated.

Setting the storming of the Bastille in 1789 as an essential part of the French History. The 14th July has become a major public holiday, traditionally considered as the symbol of the French Revolution.\nThe French Bastille Day is definitely a joyous national day that causes popular celebrations in the streets as well as political events.  The best way to experience the 14 July bank holiday - widely known as Le 14 Juillet - is to go to Paris , more precisely on the Champs Elysees. Expect military parades, public speeches and fireworks, but also convivial gatherings in all cafés and restaurants!\nEvery single town in France actually commemorates the Bastille Day with excitement and pride as this national day represents the first step to the French Revolution which eventually led France to Republic. On July, 14, patriotic feelings break out throughout the country, French people wear blue, white and red, \"tricolore\" clothes or make-up and sing the typical Marseillaise (the French anthem) after one - or more! - glasses of Champagne!\nBastille Day in Paris...\nBeginning in the morning of the 14th July, on the Champs Elysées in Paris, Bastille Day is the opportunity to admire the French military. Saint Cyr and Polytechnique cadets parade, along with official troops, whilst the French Air Force, Patrouille de France, carry out flying in the sky.\nA popular custom on Basttille day in Paris is going for a friendly picnic in a public park, socialising, enjoying French food and wine, before watching the fireworks from the Place de la Concorde for example.\nIn many French villages, people traditionally get together on July, 13 to enjoy a typical Barbecue and sing and dance all night long - taking the advantage of the relaxing public holiday the day after!\nThe President of the Republic normally attends all the Parisian festivities and ends the 14th July ceremonies with a public interview from the Elysée (Predisent's official residence).\nFrench National Day\nThe well-known storming of the Bastille has become a benchmark in terms of Revolt and Liberty all over the world!\nReferring to July 14 1789, when a massive crowd of Frenchmen rose up and invaded the prison, Bastille Day is considered the beginning of the French Revolution. Capturing this prison, a symbol of the Ancient Regime, indeed marked the end of Louis XVI's absolute and arbitrary power and led France to the three ideals of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Bastille Day has been known and celebrated as the creation of the Sovereign Nation and what would be the \"First\" Republic of France (in 1792).\nBastille Day became the National Holiday in 1790, originally called Fête de la Fédération (\"federation feast\"), to celebrate the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille and the end of the French Revolution.\nQuestion:\nThe 14th of July marks what major holiday for the French?\nAnswer:\nBastille day\nPassage:\nTrade weighted index | Economics Help\nTrade weighted index | Economics  Help\nTrade weighted index\nSeptember 20, 2013\nA trade weighted index is used to measure the effective value of an exchange rate against a basket of currencies. The importance of other currencies depends on the percentage of trade done with that country.\nFor example in calculating the trade weighted index of the Pound Sterling, the most important exchange rate would be with the Euro. If the UK exports 60% of total exports to the EU, the value of £ to Euro would account for 60% of the trade weighted index.\nA trade weighted index is useful for measuring the overall performance of a currency.\nFor example, if the Pound appreciates against the dollar, that might be due to the dollars weakness.

{"input": "Passage:\nDeath to Spies\nReleased in 2007, Death to Spies () is a stealth third-person shooter PC game set in World War II and produced by 1C Company and Haggard Games. The game was released on Valve's digital distribution system, Steam, on March 12, 2008.\n\nGameplay\n\nDeath to Spies takes place from a third-person perspective. The player controls Semion Strogov, a captain in a Soviet counterintelligence agency named SMERSH. Strogov is able to run, jump, crouch, crawl and climb over obstacles, and he is also able to drive vehicles. Taking place in World War II, the player is required to complete various tasks in enemy territory, such as killing targets and stealing documents. Emphasis is placed on stealth, as the player is greatly outnumbered by enemy personnel, and some missions will be failed if the alarm is raised. \n\nThe game's missions are connected by cutscenes, taking place in 1951. After the arrest of the head of SMERSH Viktor Abakumov, Semion Strogov is questioned about his involvement in a number of special operations between 1943 through 1946, as his interrogators search for any connections between him and Abakumov.\n\nThe Heads-up display shows the level of awareness and suspicion of enemies, both of which are represented with a single bar at the top of the screen and are represented separately as different icons. A vector map can be displayed on the screen, showing characters' locations and their fields of vision, in which the player will be detected either instantly or gradually, depending on the distance. The vector map also shows the radius of noises made by the player; if someone is within the radius of the noise, they may investigate the noise or become alerted, depending on the noise.\n\nDisguises can be used to avoid alerting enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes picking the lock of a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.\n\nBefore starting a mission, the player is usually able to select equipment to bring to the mission. Strogov has a carrying capacity limited to one handgun, one long gun and 18 slots for small items such as ammunition and knives; one knife can also be stored in a dedicated slot. A backpack has space for larger items such as pliers and dynamite, and space for small items, but Strogov also has a weight limit to his inventory, and small items stored in a backpack must be moved to the 18 slots before it can be used.\nA variety of firearms (along with ammunition) and explosives are available to choose from, with the choices available depending on the mission. Other weapons include chloroform, knives, a garrote and poison. German equipment can also be chosen to avoid suspicion from enemy personnel when in disguise and/or to make use of ammunition taken from enemies' bodies.\n\nSeveral missions take place in allied areas. The player is forced to begin these missions lightly armed and they cannot select their equipment. However, weapons and ammunition can be found in the level.\n\nReception\n\nDeath to Spies mostly received above average reviews. The game has an average score of 70% on Game Rankings  and 69% on Metacritic.  GameSpot gave it a 7.0, praising its detailed level design variation and challenging missions, but at the same time noting that the game can be overly difficult at times. IGN gave it an 8.0, saying it was \"horrifically difficult at times and not without its peculiarities; Death to Spies is nevertheless always interesting and wholly addictive.\" \n\nSequel\n\nOn March 23, 2009 1C Company announced a sequel, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.  It was released on August 10, 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhich counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning ‘death to spies’ in English?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThe Stranger Beside Me\nThe Stranger Beside Me is a 1980 autobiographical and biographical true crime book written by Ann Rule about the serial killer Ted Bundy, whom she knew personally before and after his arrest for a series of murders.  Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy's birth and family describe Rule's friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy's capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she \"[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.\"  An afterword, following Rule's lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy's execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel's retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy's possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their \"near-miss\" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a \"Ted Bundy FAQ\" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\nQuestion:\nAnn Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?\nAnswer:\nMelissa Smith (murder victim)\nPassage:\nGulf of Bothnia\nThe Gulf of Bothnia (; ) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.\n\nName\n\nBothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name \"Bottenviken\" was originally just \"Botn(en)\" with botn being Old Norse for \"gulf\" or \"bay\";  which is also the meaning of the second element \"vik\".\n\nThe name botn was applied to the Gulf of Bothnia as Helsingjabotn in Old Norse, after Hälsingland, which at the time referred to the coastland west of the gulf. Later, botten was applied to the regions Västerbotten on the western side and Österbotten the eastern side (\"East Bottom\" and \"West Bottom\"). The Finnish name of Österbotten, Pohjanmaa, or \"Pohja\"-land, gives a hint as to the meaning in both languages: pohja means both \"bottom\" and \"north.\"\n\nBotn/botten is cognate with the English word bottom, and it might be part of a general north European distinction of lowlands, as opposed to highlands, such as the Netherlandic region, Samogitia (Lithuanian), and Sambia (Russia).\n\nA second possibility is that botten follows an alternative Scandinavian connotation of 'furthermost'. Thus, the Gulf of Bothnia would be the farthest extent of the Ocean.\n\nJulius Pokorny gives the extended Indo-European root as *bhudh-m(e)n with a *bhudh-no- variant, from which the Latin fundus, as in fundament, is derived. The original meaning of English north, from Indo-European *ner- \"under\", indicates an original sense of \"lowlands\" for \"bottomlands\". On the other hand, by \"north\" the classical authors usually meant \"outermost\", as the northern lands were outermost to them.\n\nThe origin of the word is indeed very ancient, belonging to a period before the world discoveries by the Portuguese. Until then, North was not seen as the magnetic top of the world, East being the normal orientation of a map. \n\nAlso, in Saami, the cardinal directions were named according to the different parts of the typical tent used by this nomadic people. The door of the tent was traditionally pointed South, in the most sunny direction, and the bottom of the tent would be aligned with the North. Thus the origin of the word 'Pohja' in its use as \"North\". Deriving as well from this logic is the affinity in the Finnish language of the words 'eteinen', meaning \"entrance room/hall\" and 'Etelä', \"South\".\n\nGeography\n\nExtent\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the Gulf of Bothnia as follows: \n\nFrom Simpnäsklubb (59°54'N) in Sweden, to Flötjan, Lagskær [sic], Fæstörne [sic], Kökarsörn, and Vænö-Kalkskær [sic] to the SW point of Hangöudde (Hangö Head, 59°49'N) in Finland, thus including the Aland islands and adjacent shoals and channels in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nGeophysical data\n\nThe gulf is 725 km (450 mi) long, 80–240 km (50-150 mi) wide and has an average depth of 60 m (200 ft, 33 fathoms). The maximum depth is 295 m (965 ft, 161 fathoms). The surface area is 117,000 km² (45,200 sq mi). The northernmost point is situated in Töre in the Bothnian Bay. its coordinates are 65° 54'07\" N 22° 39'00 E. \n\nThe depth and surface area of Gulf if Bothnia are constantly decreasing, as the land is rising after it had been pressed down by the continental ice during last ice age.  The rise is 80 cm every hundred years. \n\nInto the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south.\nIn the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low,  from 0.4% near Kvarken to 0.2% in the northernmost part,  and many freshwater fish such as the pike, whitefish and perch thrive in it.\n\nBeing nearly fresh, the gulf is frozen over five months every year. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Traffic restrictions for ice breaker assistance are typically in force for all the gulf from late January to late April and for the northernmost ports from the middle of December to the middle of May. \n\nGeological history\n\nFor the geological history of the entire region, refer to the Baltic Sea.\n\nHistory\n\nSome historians suggest that the adventurer Ottar was referring to the Gulf of Bothnia when he spoke of the Kven Sea in the 9th century. It is also possible that Claudius Clavus's usage of the term Mare Gotticus in the 15th century refers to the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe land surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia is heavily forested. Trees are logged, then transported to the coast for milling. The gulf is also important for oil transport to the coastal cities and ore transport to steel mills, for instance in Raahe.\n\nIn terms of  tonnage in international traffic,  the largest ports on the Finnish side are Rauma, Kokkola and Tornio. The main ports of the Swedish side are in Luleå, Skellefteå, Umeå, Sundsvall, Gävle and Hargshamn. In Luleå, iron ore pellets are exported and coal is imported. Gävle is Sweden's third-largest container port. It also ships forest products and oil.  The Gulf of Bothnia, ice breakers assist the ports needed in average half a year, when the Gulf of Finland, the season is only three months. \n\nThere is some fishery, mainly Baltic herring, for domestic needs. A persistent problem has been pollution, because the sea is enclosed by a large drainage basin and is poorly connected to fresher waters from the Atlantic. Mercury and PCB levels have been relatively high, although the Finnish Food Safety Authority considers the herring edible. Although the levels exceed the limits, the fatty acids have health benefits that offset this risk.\n\nRivers\n\n*Kemijoki\n*Kokemäenjoki\n*Oulujoki\n*Dalälven\n*Ljusnan\n*Ljungan\n*Indalsälven\n*Ångerman River\n*Ume River\n*Skellefte River\n*Pite River\n*Lule River\n*Kalix River\n*Torne River\n\nCities\n\n*Oulu\n*Pori\n*Rauma\n*Vaasa\n*Luleå\n*Umeå\n*Härnösand\n*Sundsvall\n*Gävle\n*Jakobstad\nQuestion:\nWhere is the Gulf of Bothnia?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n", "answers": ["Smert' Shpionam", "SMERSH", "СМЕРШ", "Smersh", "NKVD Special Section"], "length": 2084, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "536ec3a69e822e4e5c7dedc777166cd4a90647bfb1523a51"}

But as this list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs prove, the band seemed oblivious to it all. Or, more accurately, they were well aware that they were crossing lines — they just didn’t care. Blondie came out of New York City’s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-’60s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of “Rapture,” they rarely stayed in one place. So you’ll find a sample platter of sounds on our list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs.\n10\nQuestion:\nWhat was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nStudies on Hysteria\nStudies on Hysteria () is an 1895 book by Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer. It consists of a joint introductory paper (reprinted from 1893); followed by five individual studies of \"hysterics\" – Breuer's famous case of Anna O. (real name: Bertha Pappenheim), seminal for the development of psychoanalysis, and four more by Freud; and finishing with a theoretical essay by Breuer and a more practice-oriented one on therapy by Freud. \n\nSummary\n\nFreud sees symptomology as stratified in an almost geological way, with the outermost strata being easily remembered and accepted, while “the deeper one goes the more difficult it is to recognise the recollections that are surfacing”. \n\nReception and influence\n\nBreuer's work with Bertha Pappenheim provided the founding impetus for psychoanalysis, as Freud himself would acknowledge.  In their preliminary (1893) paper, both men agreed that “the hysteric suffers mainly from reminiscences”.  Freud however would come to lay more stress on the causative role of sexuality in producing hysteria, as well as gradually repudiating Breuer's use of hypnosis as a means of treatment.  Some of the theoretical scaffolding of the Studies – \"strangulated affect\", hypnoid state  – would be abandoned with the crystallisation of psychoanalysis as an independent technique.  However, many of Freud’s clinical observations – on mnenmic symbols  or deferred action  for example – would continue to be confirmed in his later work. At the same time, Breuer’s theoretical essay, with its examination of the principle of constancy, and its differentiation of bound and mobile cathexis,  would continue to inform Freud’s thinking as late as the twenties and the writing of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\n\nAt the time of its release, Studies on Hysteria tended to polarise opinion, both within and outside by the medical community.  While many were critical, Havelock Ellis offered an appreciative account, while a leading Viennese paper would characterise the work as “the kind of psychology used by poets”.  Studies on Hysteria received a positive review from psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, although Bleuler nevertheless suggested that the results Freud and Breuer reported could have been the result of suggestion. Philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and psychologist Sonu Shamdasani comment that Studies on Hysteria gave Freud, \"a certain local and international notoriety\". Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani write that, contrary to what Freud and Breuer claimed, Freud \"always knew that the treatment of Bertha Pappenheim...had not been an unmitigated success\".\nQuestion:\n\"Who wrote the book \"\"Studies in Hysteria\"\" and \"\"Interpretation of Dreams\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nZigi Frojd\nPassage:\nHablot Knight Browne\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 – 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\n\nBiography\n\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne's fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \n\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \nThomas Moxon, husband of William's sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\n\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\n\nArtistic career\n\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\n\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers' office with specimens of their work for Dickens's inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens's \"Boz.\"\n\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator's work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\n\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch's Pocket Books.\n\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever's novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist's works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\n\nMost of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\n\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque, Ladbroke Grove, London\nFile:Phiz Auriol.jpg|Scene from Auriol by Harrison Ainsworth, 1844\nFile:Pelham.jpg|Frontispiece to Pelham by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1849\nQuestion:\nWhat was the pen name of the illustrator Hablot Knight-Brown?\nAnswer:\nHablot Knight Browne\n", "answers": ["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib"], "length": 1438, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "440395c634b58504737e51777692235a4b0f49e2f1a3b12a"}

He married Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1705 an attractive and intelligent women, and they had 9 children.  In 1708 he took part in the Battle of Oudenarde in Belgium against the French.\nHis father became King George I of England in 1714 and he became Prince of Wales. However his father�s treatment of his mother whom he had imprisoned left son George with a hatred of his father and they regularly quarrelled.  He was even put under arrest by his father who excluded him from public ceremonies.  When his father died in 1727 he became King George II and set about changing his father�s policies. Walpole was expected to be dismissed but survived on the intervention of Queen Caroline.\nThe death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 led to the European War of Austrian Succession in which the British and Dutch supported Marie Theresa�s claim to the Austrian throne against the Prussians and French. George II personally led his troops at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, becoming the last British monarch to lead his troops into battle.  The Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, in which Charles Edward Stuart (�Bonnie Prince Charlie�) landed in Scotland and marched with a Highland army into England, was defeated at Culloden in 1746 and Scottish opposition brutally suppressed by George�s second son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. Like his father he quarrelled with his eldest son Frederick, Prince of Wales, over his marriage but Frederick died suddenly in 1751.\nThe final years of his reign saw George retiring from active politics; however it was a period in which British dominance overseas grew. William Pitt became Prime Minister during the Seven years war against France which spread to India and North America. Robert Clive secured the Indian continent for Britain at the Battle of Plassey, and General Wolfe captured Quebec in Canada.  George II died in 1760 of an aneurysm while seated on his water closet.

A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue. \n\nIn October 1930 Wright approached the Evening Independent newspaper and proposed it sponsor a blue lipogram writing competition, with $250 for the winner. In the letter, he boasted of the quality of Gadsby. The newspaper declined his offer. \n\nA 2007 post on the Bookride blog about rare books says Wright spent five and a half months writing Gadsby on a typewriter with the \"e\" key tied down. According to the unsigned entry at Bookride, a warehouse holding copies of Gadsby burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying \"most copies of the ill fated novel.\" The blog post says the book was never reviewed \"and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany.\" The book's scarcity and oddness has seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers.[http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/gadsby-story-of-over-50000-words_24.html   Bookride blog] February 24, 2007.\n\nWright completed a draft of Gadsby in 1936, during a nearly six month stint at the National Military Home in California. He failed to find a publisher and used a self-publishing press to bring out the book.\n\nWright previously authored three other books: The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun (1896), The Fairies That Run the World and How They Do It (1903), and Thoughts and Reveries of an American Bluejacket (1918). His humorous poem, \"When Father Carves the Duck\", can be found in some anthologies.\nQuestion:\n\"Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a novel, \"\"Gadsby\"\", which contains over 50,000 words -- none of them with which letter?\"\nAnswer:\n⒠\nPassage:\nWilliam Holman Hunt\nWilliam Holman Hunt  (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism.  These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs.  For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact.  Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career.  He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. \n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt changed his middle name from \"Hobman\" to Holman when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name after his baptism at the church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell.  After eventually entering the Royal Academy art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. He formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Along with John Everett Millais they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of medieval art, in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the Renaissance embodied by Raphael. He had many pupils including Robert Braithwaite Martineau.\n\nHunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model Annie Miller, he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of Isabella. When she died in childbirth in Italy he sculpted her tomb at Fiesole, having it brought down to the English Cemetery, beside the tomb of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He had a close connection with St. Mark's Church in Florence, and paid for a communion chalice inscribed in the memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny's sister. At this time it was illegal in Britain to marry one's deceased wife's sister, so Hunt was forced to travel abroad to marry her. This led to a serious breach with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague Thomas Woolner, who had once been in love with Fanny and had married Alice, the third sister of Fanny and Edith.\n\nHunt's works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as The Hireling Shepherd and The Awakening Conscience. However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially The Light of the World (1851–1853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to “use my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ’s history and teaching”;  there he painted The Scapegoat, The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple and The Shadow of Death, along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as Isabella and The Lady of Shalott. He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem \n\nHe eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, a large version of The Light of the World were completed with the help of his assistant Edward Robert Hughes.\n\nHunt died on 7 September 1910 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral \n\nAwards and commemoration\n\nHunt published an autobiography in 1905.  Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the end of his life he lived in Sonning-on-Thames.\n\nHis personal life was the subject of Diana Holman-Hunt's book My Grandfather, his Life and Loves. \n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two BBC period dramas. The first, The Love School, in 1975, starred Bernard Lloyd as Hunt. The second was Desperate Romantics, in which Hunt is played by Rafe Spall. \n\nFacing Mar Elias Monastery is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and English.\n\nPartial list of works\n\n*A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids (1850)\n*Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus (1851)\n*The Awakening Conscience (1853)\n*The Light of the World (1854)\n*The Scapegoat (1856)\n*The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1860)\n*The Shadow of Death (1871)\n*The Importunate Neighbour (1895)\n*The Miracle of the Holy Fire (1899)\n\nGallery\n\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Christ and the two Marys - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the two Marys (1847 & 1897)\nFile:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|The Hireling Shepherd (1851)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo - Google Art Project.jpg| The Lantern Maker's Courtship, A Street Scene in Cairo (1854–56)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt.jpg|Portrait of Fanny Holman Hunt, (1866–67)\nFile:Basilpot.jpg| Isabella and the Pot of Basil (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - The Birthday.jpg| The Birthday (1868)\nFile:William Holman Hunt - Amaryllis.jpg|Amaryllis (1884)\n\nFile:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg| The Lady of Shalott (1905)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the painting by William Holman Hunt which features an animal with a red cloth wrapped around its horns on the Day of Atonement?\nAnswer:\nThe Scapegoat (film)\n", "answers": ["Hanover", "Hannovre", "Hannover", "Hanover, Germany", "Hannover, Germany", "Hannover's Museums", "Hannover UNRRA displaced persons camp", "Hannoveraner", "Offensen", "UN/LOCODE:DEHAJ"], "length": 1913, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b8dd3e8a46f8c1af662475c0e261fe8209e2dfa6412623ea"}

It contains all or parts of five continents  (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Due to the tilt of Earth's rotation relative to the Sun and the ecliptic plane, summer is from December to March and winter is from June to September. September 22 or 23 is the vernal equinox and March 20 or 21 is the autumnal equinox.\n\nGeography \n\nClimate \n\nSouthern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, except in the Antarctic which is colder than the Arctic. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere the sun passes from east to west through the north, although north of the Tropic of Capricorn the mean sun can be directly overhead or due south at midday. The Sun rotating through the north causes an apparent right-left trajectory through the sky unlike the left-right motion of the Sun when seen from the Northern Hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky. Sun-cast shadows turn counterclockwise throughout the day and sundials have the hours increasing in the counterclockwise direction. During solar eclipses viewed from a point to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the Moon moves from left to right on the disc of the Sun (see, for example, photos with timings of the solar eclipse of November 13, 2012), while viewed from a point to the north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), the Moon moves from right to left during a solar eclipses.\n\nCyclones and tropical storms spin clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (as opposed to counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect. \n\nThe southern temperate zone, a subsection of the Southern Hemisphere, is nearly all oceanic. This zone includes all of Uruguay, Lesotho, Swaziland, and New Zealand; most of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and Australia; and parts of Paraguay, Brazil, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, and Madagascar.\n\nThe Sagittarius constellation that includes the galactic centre is a southern constellation and this, combined with clearer skies, makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the Southern Hemisphere with brighter and more numerous stars.\n\nForests in the Southern Hemisphere have special features which set them apart from those in the Northern Hemisphere. Both Chile and Australia share, for example, unique beech species or Nothofagus, and New Zealand has members of the closely related genera Lophozonia and Fuscospora.  The eucalyptus is native to Australia but is now also planted in Southern Africa and Latin America for pulp production and, increasingly, biofuel uses.\n\nDemographics\n\nApproximately 800,000,000 people reside in the Southern Hemisphere representing only 10–12% of the total global population of 7.3 billion.  \n\nList of continents and countries \n\nContinents and microcontinents \n\n* Africa (approximately one third, from south of Libreville in Gabon in the west to south of Somalia in the east)\n* Antarctica\n* Asia (the very southern island portion including East Timor, most of Indonesia and a few islets of the Maldives)\n* Australia (the entire mainland is in the Southern Hemisphere)\n* South America (mostly, south of the Amazon River mouth in the east and Quito in the west)\n* Zealandia (New Caledonia, the New Zealand landmass and associated islands are wholly within the Southern Hemisphere)\n\nCountries and territories\nQuestion:\nWhat is the Southern Hemisphere's equivalent to the Tropic of Cancer?\nAnswer:\nTropic of Capricorn\nPassage:\nThe Chinese Zodiac -

{"input": "Passage:\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage is a lengthy narrative poem in four parts written by Lord Byron. It was published between 1812 and 1818 and is dedicated to \"Ianthe\". The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through Portugal, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811.. The \"Ianthe\" of the dedication was the term of endearment he used for Lady Charlotte Harley, about 11 years old when  Childe Harold was first published. Charlotte Bacon née Harley was the second daughter of 5th Earl of Oxford and Lady Oxford, Jane Elizabeth Scott. Throughout the poem Byron, in character of Childe Harold, regretted his wasted early youth, hence re-evaluating his life choices and re-designing himself through going on the pilgrimage, during which he lamented on various historical events including the Iberian Peninsular War among others.\n\nDespite Byron's initial hesitation at having the first two cantos of the poem published because he felt it revealed too much of himself,  it was published, at the urging of friends, by John Murray in 1812, and brought both the poem and its author to immediate and unexpected public attention. Byron later wrote, \"I awoke one morning and found myself famous\".  The first two cantos in John Murray's edition were illustrated by Richard Westall, well-known painter and illustrator who was then commissioned to paint portraits of Byron.\n\nByronic hero\n\nThe work provided the first example of the Byronic hero.  The idea of the Byronic hero is one that consists of many different characteristics. The hero must have a rather high level of intelligence and perception as well as be able to easily adapt to new situations and use cunning to his own gain. It is clear from this description that this hero is well-educated and by extension is rather sophisticated in his style. Aside from the obvious charm and attractiveness that this automatically creates, he struggles with his integrity, being prone to mood swings. Generally, the hero has a disrespect for certain figures of authority, thus creating the image of the Byronic hero as an exile or an outcast. The hero also has a tendency to be arrogant and cynical, indulging in self-destructive behaviour which leads to the need to seduce women. Although his sexual attraction through being mysterious is rather helpful, it often gets the hero into trouble. Characters with the qualities of the Byronic hero have appeared in novels, films and plays ever since.\n\nStructure\n\nThe poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consist of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC.\n\nInterpretations\n\nChilde Harold became a vehicle for Byron's own beliefs and ideas, but in the preface to canto four Byron complains that his readers conflate him and Child Harold too much, so he will not speak of Harold as much in the final canto. According to Jerome McGann, by masking himself behind a literary artifice, Byron was able to express his view that \"man's greatest tragedy is that he can conceive of a perfection which he cannot attain\". \n\nCultural references\n\nThe poem's protagonist is referenced several times in description of the eponymous hero in Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin.\n\nParts of it have been quoted towards the end of Asterix in Belgium and the 2000 film Britannic.\n\nHector Berlioz drew inspiration from this poem in the creation of his second symphony, a programmatic and arguably semi-autobiographical work called Harold en Italie.\n\nIn Anthony Trollope's third book of his Palliser novels, The Eustace Diamonds, Rev. Emilius read the first half of the fourth canto of this poem to Lizzie Eustace.\nQuestion:\nWhich lengthy narrative poem by Lord Byron describes the trials and reflections of a world weary young man?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nIrish Classic Races\nThe Irish Classics are five Group One horse races run at The Curragh racecourse during the flat racing season.  They mirror the British Classic Races, the original five \"classics\", with one minor exception.

Roy's injury has generally been reported as an attack by a tiger involved in the show, although the two magicians have disputed that account – saying instead that he suffered a stroke and that any injury by the tiger was secondary and accidental. The duo staged a brief comeback performance in 2010 before leaving show business for good. They now run a menagerie at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nSiegfried \n\nSiegfried Fischbacher was born in Rosenheim, Germany on June 13, 1939 to Maria and Martin Fischbacher.  Siegfried's mother was a housewife and his father was a professional painter who was imprisoned by the Soviets during World War II. Siegfried purchased a magic book as a child and began practising tricks. Siegfried moved to Italy in 1956, and began working at a hotel.  He eventually found work performing magic on the ship the TS Bremen under the stage name Delmare. Siegfried and Roy met while Siegfried was performing aboard the ship and asked Roy to assist him during a show.  Siegfried and Roy were fired from the TS Bremen for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a New York-based cruise line and began performing together as a duo. \n\nRoy \n\nRoy Horn was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944 in Nordenham, in the midst of bomb attacks, to Johanna Horn. His biological father fought on the Russian front, and his father and mother divorced after the war ended. Roy's mother remarried a construction worker, and later began work in a factory. Roy had three brothers: Manfred, Alfred, and Werner. Roy became interested in animals at a very young age, and cared for his childhood dog, named Hexe. Roy's mother's friend's husband, Emil, was founder of the Bremen zoo, which gave Roy access to exotic animals from the age of ten.  Roy visited the United States briefly when his ship wrecked and was towed to New York City, and returned home to Bremen before returning to the sea as a waiter, where he met Siegfried and launched his performance career.\n\nCareer\n\nThe owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen, Germany saw Siegfried and Roy's act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and recruited the duo to perform at her nightclub. This launched a career on the European nightclub circuit, and the duo began to perform with tigers. They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967. They spent some time in Puerto Rico, and may have purchased property there. \n\nIn 1981, Ken Feld, of Mattel's Feld Productions started the Beyond Belief show starring Siegfried & Roy at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1982.  In late 1988, Beyond Belief Las Vegas act went on an international tour to Japan then to Radio City ending in 1989. The show returned to Las Vegas in 1990, this time at the Mirage Hotel until the October 2003 accident.\n\nIn 2004, their act became the basis for the short-lived television series Father of the Pride. Right before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Siegfried & Roy urged NBC to continue production after Roy's injury from October 2003 improved.\n\nHorn's injury\n\nOn October 3, 2003, during a show at the Mirage, Roy was apparently bitten in the neck by a 7-year-old male white tiger named Mantecore (but often referred to as Montecore ).  Crew members separated Roy from the tiger and rushed him to University Medical Center. Roy was critically injured and sustained severe blood loss.  Siegfried and Roy have strongly disagreed with the reports that said Roy was attacked by the tiger – saying instead that he had suffered a stroke while on stage and Mantecore responded by picking him up and moving him out of the way to try to protect him, accidentally severing his artery in the process. While being taken to the hospital, Roy said \"Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore.\" \n\nPartially paralyzed, by 2006, Roy was talking and walking (with assistance from Fischbacher), although he has not yet gained use of his left side. On Pat O'Brien's television news program The Insider, he commented about his daily rehabilitation, \"They are slave drivers over there. You'd think they are the KGB from Russia.\" \n\nThe injury to Roy prompted the Mirage to close the show, and 267 cast and crew members were laid off. \n\nIn February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Mantecore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute. This performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's 20/20 program. \n\nOn April 23, 2010, Siegfried & Roy retired from show business. \"The last time we closed, we didn’t have a lot of warning,\" said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. \"This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence.\" \n\nMantecore died on March 19, 2014 at the age of 17 after a short illness.\n\nFilmography\n\n* Bassie & Adriaan: De reis vol verrassingen (children's TV series; 1994)\n* Casino (1995)\n* Siegfried & Roy: Masters of the Impossible (1996)  \n* Vegas Vacation (1997)\n* Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box (1999)\n* Ocean's Eleven (2001)\n* Showboy (2002)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the last name of the performer mauled by Montacore, one of his very special white tigers, in Las Vegas on October 3, 2003?\nAnswer:\nHorn (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nNational League (1932–64)\nThe National League was the main speedway league in the United Kingdom from 1932 until 1964, after which it merged with the Provincial League to form the British League.  Prior to 1932 there were only small regional leagues competing within the sport in the UK, with the Northern League and the Southern League merging for the inaugural 1932 season.\n\nInitially a single division, in 1936 a second division was created, initially named the Provincial League, but becoming National League Division Two in 1938. When league racing resumed after World War II, there was initially a single division. Six clubs started a new grass roots Northern League that year, and with more tracks opening up, the National League expanded to three divisions in 1947. For several reasons, including the levels of Entertainment tax and competition for audiences from television, a number of teams ceased to be profitable and the league reverted to two divisions in 1954. Further withdrawals led to a reduction to a single eleven-team division in 1957.\n\nContinuing reduction in spectator numbers, and dissatisfaction with the way speedway was structured and managed led several promoters (including Mike Parker, Reg Fearman, and Johnnie Hoskins) to create the breakaway Provincial League in 1960. Working within tighter budgets, they were nevertheless more successful commercially than the National League promotions. After relations between the two leagues broke down in 1963, an RAC commission led to the two leagues merging in 1965 to form the British League.\n\nThe National League name was revived in 1975 when the British League Division Two was renamed, initially to the New National League. The name was reused again for the third tier of British speedway from 2009.\n\nChampions\nQuestion:\nBased at Poolstock Greyhound Stadium, in which sport did the 'Wigan Warriors' compete in the 1947 National League, before becoming the Fleetwood Flyers' the following year?\nAnswer:\nSpeedway Racing\nPassage:\nPeng Liyuan\nPeng Liyuan (,; born November 20, 1962) is a Chinese contemporary folk singer and performing artist. Peng is the President of the People's Liberation Army Academy of Art, and the wife of the current Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  Peng is referred to as the \"Chinese First Lady\" by the media.  \n\nIn 2014, Peng was listed as the 57th Most Powerful Woman in the World by Forbes. \n\nPeng gained popularity as a soprano singer from her regular appearances on the annual CCTV New Year's Gala, a widely viewed mainland Chinese television program that airs during the Chinese New Year. Peng has won many honors in singing competitions nationwide. Peng's most famous singles include People from Our Village (), Zhumulangma () and In the Field of Hope ().  Peng also sang the theme songs of several popular TV series, such as, The Water Margin (1998). \n\nPeng was a civilian member of China's People's Liberation Army, and held the civilian rank equivalent to Major General before she was appointed the Art Academy's dean, upon which she was given the formal rank. Peng was the first in China to obtain a Master's degree in traditional ethnic music when the degree was established in the 1980s. \n\nBiography \n\nPeng Liyuan is a native of Yuncheng County, Shandong province.  Peng joined the People's Liberation Army in 1980, when she was 18 years old, and began as an ordinary soldier.  Because of her vocal talent, Peng later performed during frontline tours to boost troop morale during the Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts.   Peng first performed nationally and came to fame during the earliest rendition of the CCTV New Year's Gala in 1982, when she performed On the Plains of Hope.\n\nPeng has been married to Xi Jinping for over 25 years, and they have a daughter named Xi Mingze () born in 1992, nicknamed as Xiao Muzi ().  \n\nFor the greater part of their relationship, Peng has enjoyed a very positive reputation within China, comparable to that of her politician husband. Since her husband became General Secretary of the Communist Party (de facto paramount leader) in November 2012, and Chinese President (de jure head of state) in March 2013, the American press refers to her as the First Lady of China.\n\nXi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques. Xi was the son of famous Chinese revolutionary Xi Zhongxun, and Peng's family obviously accepted the relationship with ease, due to his attitude.  After parental consent, the couple married on September 1, 1987 in Xiamen, Fujian.  Four days later, Peng Liyuan returned to Beijing to appear in the National Art Festival, and then immediately departed for the United States and Canada to perform. Since that time, Xi and Peng have led largely separate lives, with Peng spending most of her time in Beijing, and her husband spending his time in Fujian and later in Zhejiang.\n\nPeng is actively involved in politics, and is a member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  Peng is a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS since 2011. \n\nIn 2014, Peng was listed as the 57th Most Powerful Woman in the World by Forbes.\n\nOn November 20, 2014, Massey University in New Zealand conferred Peng an Honorary Doctorate in recognition of her international contributions to performing arts, health, and education. \n\nControversy and criticism \n\nDirectly after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in June 1989, Peng Liyuan sang for the martial-law troops. A photo showing the scene in which Peng, wearing a green military uniform, sings to helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was swiftly scrubbed from China's Internet, before it could generate discussion online. However, the image — seen and shared by outside observers — revived a memory the leadership prefers to suppress.

It is located close to the village of Niton and the point where the Back of the Wight changes to the Undercliff of Ventnor.\n\nOn nearby St. Catherine's Down is St. Catherine's Oratory, locally known as the  \"Pepperpot\", a stone lighthouse built in the 1323 by Walter De Godeton. It is Britain's oldest medieval lighthouse. \n\nReportedly, de Godeton felt guilty for having scavenged wine, destined for a monastery   from the wreck of the St. Marie of Bayonne in Chale Bay. He was ordered, on pain of excommunication, to make amends by building this lighthouse. Fires were lit in the lighthouse tower to warn ships at sea of the presence of the coast. \n\nThere was an attached chapel at one time, but it has been long demolished. There is a Bronze Age barrow nearby which was excavated in the 1920s.  \n\nA replacement lighthouse was begun in 1785. However it was never completed. Locally this half finished building is known as the \"salt pot\". \n\nSt. Catherine's point is often foggy, so it is not the best location for a lighthouse, but as a weather station the location is fairly suitable. The weather station is one of the 22 locations whose reports are included in the BBC Shipping Forecast.\nQuestion:\nSt Catherine's Point is situated in which UK county?\nAnswer:\nIsle of White\nPassage:\nCatriona (novel)\nCatriona (also known as David Balfour) is an 1893 novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson as a sequel to his earlier novel Kidnapped (1886).  It tells the further story of the central character, David Balfour.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe book begins precisely where Kidnapped ends, at 2 PM on 25 August 1751, outside the British Linen Company in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nThe first part of the book recounts the attempts of the hero, David Balfour, to gain justice for James Stewart (James of the Glens), who has been arrested and charged with complicity in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer and goes on to meet William Grant of Prestongrange, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to press the case for James' innocence. However, his attempts fail as - after being reunited with Alan Breck - he is once again kidnapped and, this time, confined on the Bass Rock, an island in the Firth of Forth, until the trial is over, and James condemned to death. David also meets and falls in love with Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the daughter of James MacGregor Drummond, known as James More (who was Rob Roy's eldest son), also held in prison, whose escape she engineers. David also receives some education in the manners and morals of polite society from Barbara Grant, Prestongrange's daughter.\n\nIn the second part, David and Catriona travel to Holland, where David studies law at the University of Leyden. David takes Catriona under his protection (she having no money) until her father finds them. James More eventually arrives and proves something of a disappointment, drinking a great deal and showing no compunction against living off David's largesse.  At this time, David learns of the death of his uncle Ebenezer, and thus gains knowledge that he has come into his full, substantial inheritance.  David and Catriona, fast friends at this point, begin a series of misunderstandings that eventually drive her and James More away, though David sends payment to James in return for news of Catriona's welfare. James and Catriona find their way to Dunkirk in northern France.  Meanwhile, Alan Breck joins David in Leyden, and he berates David for not understanding women.\n\nIt's this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them.  Either they like the man, and then a' goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your breath – ye can do naething.  There's just the two sets of them – them that would sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye're on.  That's a' that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.\n\nProdded thus, and at an invitation from James More, David and Alan journey to Dunkirk to visit with James and Catriona.  They all meet one evening at a remote inn and discover the following day that James has betrayed Alan (falsely convicted of the Appin murder) into the hands of a British warship anchored near the shore.  The British attempt to capture Alan, who flees with David and Catriona, now reconciled and shamed by James More's ignominy. The three flee to Paris, where David and Catriona are married. James More dies from an illness, and David and Catriona return to Scotland to raise a family.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe characters of Alan Breck Stewart, Lord William Grant Prestongrange, James of the Glens, James MacGregor Drummond (Rob Roy's eldest son), the 3rd duke of Argyll, Simon Fraser of Lovat, Prophet Peden and Hugh Palliser were real people and the frigate HMS Seahorse actually existed.\n\nHowever, the heroine who gives her name to the novel is a fictional character.

{"input": "Passage:\nWhere Is Cathay - Asian History from About.com\nWhere Is Cathay\nWhere Is Cathay?\nBy Kallie Szczepanski\nQuestion: Where Is Cathay?\nAround the year 1300, a book took Europe by storm. It was Marco Polo's account of his travels to a fabulous country called Cathay, and all of the wonders he had seen there. He described black stones that burned like wood (coal), saffron-robed Buddhist monks, and money made out of paper. But where was this wondrous land of Cathay?\n \nAnswer:\nOf course, Cathay was actually China , which at that time was under Mongol rule. Marco Polo served in the court of Kublai Khan , founder of the Yuan Dynasty, and grandson of Genghis Khan.\nThe name \"Cathay\" is a European variation of \"Khitai,\" which Central Asian tribes used to describe parts of northern China once dominated by the Khitan people . The Mongols had since crushed the Khitan clans and absorbed their people, erasing them as a separate ethnic identity, but their name lived on as a geographical designation.\nSince Marco Polo and his party approached China via Central Asia, along the Silk Road, they naturally heard the name Khitai used for the empire they sought.\ncontinue reading below our video\nWhat are the Seven Wonders of the World\nThe southern part of China, which had not yet capitulated to Mongol rule, was known at that time as Manzi, which is Mongol for \"the recalcitrant ones.\"\nIt would take Europe almost 300 years to put two and two together, and realize that Cathay and China were one and the same. Between about 1583 and 1598, the Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci , developed the theory that China was actually Cathay. He was well acquainted with Marco Polo's account, and noticed striking similarities between Polo's observations of Cathay and his own of China.\nFor one thing, Marco Polo had noted that Cathay was directly south of \"Tartary,\" or Mongolia , and Ricci knew that Mongolia lay on the northern border of China. Marco Polo also described the empire as being divided by the Yangtze River, with six provinces to the north of the river and nine to the south. Ricci knew that this description matched China. Ricci observed many of the same phenomena that Polo had noted, as well, such as people burning coal for fuel and using paper as money.\nThe final straw, for Ricci, was when he met Muslim traders from the west in Beijing in 1598. They assured him that he was indeed living in the fabled country of Cathay.\nAlthough the Jesuits publicized this discovery widely in Europe, some skeptical mapmakers believed that Cathay still existed somewhere, perhaps northeast of China, and drew it onto their maps in what is now southeastern Siberia. As late as 1667, John Milton refused to give up on Cathay, naming it as a separate place from China in Paradise Lost .\nQuestion:\nCathay is a poetic name for which country?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nPresident of the Confederate States of America\nThe President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. \n\nArticle II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. \n\nPowers and duties\n\nThe constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.\n\nElection and oath\n\nOn February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.\n\nBefore Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:\n\nCompensation\n\nIn 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the \"White House of the Confederacy\" or the \"Grey House,\" the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nLate on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.\n\nJefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.\nQuestion:\nWho was president of the Confederate States during the American Civil War?\nAnswer:\nJefferson Davies\nPassage:\nBig cat\nThe informal term \"big cat\" is typically used to refer to any of the four largest (living) members of the entire Panthera genus. Among the five total species within the Panthera genus, these four are the only animals that are able to roar.  In descending order of their maximum potential size, these four species are: tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards. A more liberal and expansive definition is sometimes used which may include the snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard and/or cheetah, although these added species do not roar. The clouded leopard is considered an evolutionary link between big and small cats.\n\nDespite enormous differences in size, various species of cat are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and efficient apex predators.  Their range includes the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nRoaring\n\nThe ability to roar  comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus.  When air passes through the larynx on the way from the lungs, the cartilage walls of the larynx vibrate, producing sound. The lion's larynx is longest, giving it the most robust roar. Only the four largest members of the Panthera genus contain this elongated hyoid.\n\nThreats\n\nThe principal threats to big cats vary by geographic location, but primarily are habitat destruction and poaching. In Africa many big cats are hunted by pastoralists or government 'problem animal control' officers. Over the past few months  Problem Animal Control (PAC) lion hunts in Zimbabwe have been offered to American hunters, even though according to Zimbabwe National Parks there are no such hunts currently available.  Certain protected areas exist that shelter large and exceptionally visible populations of lions, hyenas, leopards, and cheetahs, such as Botswana's Chobe, Kenya's Masai Mara, and Tanzania's Serengeti.  Rather, it is outside these conservation areas where hunting poses the dominant threat to large carnivores. \n\nIn the United States, 19 states have banned ownership of big cats and other dangerous exotic animals as pets, and the Captive Wildlife Safety Act bans the interstate sale and transportation of these animals. The initial Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA) was signed into law on December 19, 2003.  To address problems associated with the increasing trade in certain big cat species, the CSWA regulations were strengthened by a law passed on September 17, 2007.  The big cat species addressed in these regulations are the lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, cheetah, jaguar, cougar, and any hybrid combination any of these species that results from breeding of these big cats. Private ownership of these big cats is not prohibited by this law but the law does make it illegal to transport, sell, or purchase them in interstate or foreign commerce. Although these regulations seem to provide a strong legal framework for controlling the commerce involving big cats, international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have encouraged the U.S. to further strengthen these laws. The WWF is concerned that weaknesses in the existing U.S. regulations could be unintentionally helping to fuel the black market for tiger parts. \n\nConservation\n\nAn animal sanctuary provides a refuge for animals to live out their natural lives in a protected environment. Usually these animal sanctuaries are the organizations which provide a home to big cats whose private owners are no longer able or willing to care for their big cats. However, use of the word sanctuary in an organization's name is by itself no guarantee that it is a true animal sanctuary in the sense of a refuge. To be accepted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as a bona fide animal sanctuary and to be eligible for an exemption from the prohibition of interstate movement of big cats under the Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA), organizations must meet the following criteria: \n*Must be a non-profit entity that is tax exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code\n*Cannot engage in commercial trade in big cat species, including their offspring, parts, and products made from them\n*Cannot breed big cats\n*Cannot allow direct contact between big cats and the public at their facilities\n*Must keep records of transactions involving covered cats\n*Must allow the Service to inspect their facilities, records, and animals at reasonable hours\n\nSpecies\n\n*Family Felidae\n** Genus Panthera\n*** Tiger, Panthera tigris Asia\n*** Lion, Panthera leo (Sub-Saharan Africa, Gir Forest in India; extinct in former range of southeast Europe, Middle East, much of Asia, and North America)\n*** Jaguar, Panthera onca (the Americas; from the southern United States to northern Argentina)\n*** Leopard, Panthera pardus (Asia and Africa)\n*** Snow leopard, Panthera uncia (syn. Uncia uncia - mountains of central and south Asia)\n** Genus Acinonyx\n*** Cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus (Sub-Saharan Africa and Iran; extirpated in former range of India)\n** Genus Puma\n*** Puma/Cougar/Panther/Mountain lion Puma concolor (North and South America)\n\nEvolution\n\nA 2010 study published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution has given insight into the exact evolutionary relationships of the big cats. The study reveals that the snow leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and jaguar are more closely related to each other. The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats approximately 3.9 Ma. The tiger then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene epoch, approximately 3.2 Ma. The ancestor of the lion, leopard, and jaguar split from other big cats from 4.3–3.8 Ma. Between 3.6–2.5 Ma the jaguar diverged from the ancestor of lions and leopards. Lions and leopards split from one another approximately 2 Ma.  The earliest big cat fossil, Panthera blytheae, dating to 4.1−5.95 MA, was discovered in southwest Tibet. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Acinonyx jubatus walking edit.jpg|Cheetah\nFile:Mountain-lion-01623.jpg|Puma / Cougar / Panther / Mountain lion\nFile:Standing jaguar.jpg|Jaguar\nFile:Leopard by Rubert Taylor-Price.jpg|Leopard\nFile:Lion lying 2.jpg|Lion\nFile:Big cat in Afghanistan.jpg|Snow leopard\nFile:Tigerramki.jpg|Tiger\nQuestion:\nLargest member of the cat family\nAnswer:\nTigress\n", "answers": ["Chinese People's Republic", "China (Peking)", "The prc", "Socialist China", "Chinese PR", "PRoC", "PRC", "China's", "P.

On the North Shore toddlers ride this trail on a tricycle. John Gibson photo.\nThe IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System is a basic method used to categorize the relative technical difficulty of recreation trails. The IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System can:\nHelp trail users make informed decisions\nEncourage visitors to use trails that match their skill level\nManage risk and minimize injuries\nImprove the outdoor experience for a wide variety of visitors\nAid in the planning of trails and trail systems\nThis system was adapted from the International Trail Marking System used at ski areas throughout the world. Many trail networks use this type of system, most notably resort-based mountain biking trail networks. The system best applies to mountain bikers, but is also applicable to other visitors such as hikers and equestrians. These criteria should be combined with personal judgment and trail-user input to reach the final rating.\nTrail Rating Guidelines\n1. Rate Technical Challenge Only.\nThe system focuses on rating the technical challenge of trails, not the physical exertion. It is not practical to rate both types of difficulty with one system. Consider, for example, a smooth, wide trail that is 20 miles long. The technical challenge of this trail is easy, yet the distance would make the physical exertion difficult. The solution is to independently rate technical challenge, and indicate physical exertion by posting trail length, and possibly even elevation change.\n2. Collect Trail Measurements.\nUse the accompanying table and collect trail measurements for each criteria. There is no prescribed method for tallying a \"score\" for each trail. Evaluate the trail against the table and combine with judgment to reach the final rating. It is unlikely that any particular trail will measure at the same difficulty level for every criteria. For example, a certain trail may rate as a green circle in three criteria, but a blue square in two different criteria.\n3. Include Difficulty and Trail Length on Signs and Maps.\nTrail length is not a criterion of the system. Instead, trail length should be posted on signs in addition to the difficulty symbol. A sign displaying both length and difficulty provides lots of information, yet it is simple to create and easy to understand.\nLikewise, elevation change is not a criterion. The amount of climbing on a trail is more an indicator of physical exertion than technical difficulty. Mountainous regions may consider including the amount of climbing on trail signs.\n4. Evaluate Difficulty Relative to Local Trails.\nTrails should be rated relative to other trails in the region. Don't evaluate each trail in isolation. Consider all the trails in a region and how they compare to one another. This will help you rank the relative difficulty of each trail and will help trail users select an appropriate route. Trails will rate differently from region to region. A black diamond trail in one region may rate as a blue square in another region, but the ratings should be consistent locally.\n5. Use Good Judgment.\nRating a trail is not 100 percent objective. Its best to combine tangible data with subjective judgment to reach the final rating. For example, a trail may have a wide range of tread surfaces - most of the trail is easy, but some sections are more difficult. How would you rate it? Use your personal experience to consider all elements and select a rating that best matches the style of trail.\n6. Consider Other Trail Qualities.\nDon't forget to consider trail qualities beyond the objective criteria. A wide variety of features could contribute to a trail's difficulty. For example, exposure - the feeling of empty space next to and below the trail tread - provides an added psychological challenge beyond the steepness or roughness of the trail. A 3-inch rock seems like a boulder when a 50-foot drop looms on your side! Other qualities to think about are corridor clearance and turn radius.\n7. Use Common Sense and Seek Input.\nNo rating system can be totally objective or valid for every situation. This system is a tool to be combined with common sense. Look at trails with a discerning eye, and seek input from trail users before selecting the rating. Remember, a diverse trail network with a variety of trail styles is a great way to ensure happy visitors. Provide both easy and difficult trails to spread visitors and meet a range of needs. By indicating the length and difficulty of trails with a clear signage system, visitors will be able to locate their preferred type of trail easily.\nCriteria to Consider\nQuestion:\nIn skiing, what colour diamond denotes an expert trail on signs and trail maps?\nAnswer:\nBlackishly\nPassage:\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nChemical Elements.com - Phosphorus (P)\nContains an \"Introduction to Tungsten\", among other things\nIf you know of any other links for Phosphorus, please let me know\nBentor, Yinon.

It is the story of a farmhand, his family, and his community that are attacked by flocks of birds and seabirds in kamikaze missions. The story is set in du Maurier's native Cornwall shortly after the end of the Second World War. By the end of the story it has become clear that all of Britain is under aerial assault.\n\nThe story was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds, released in 1963, the same year that The Apple Tree was reprinted as The Birds and Other Stories. In 2009, Irish playwright Conor McPherson adapted the story for the stage at Dublin's Gate Theatre.\n\nBackground\n\nThe author saw a man ploughing a field while seagulls were wheeling and diving above him and composed a story of these birds growing hostile and attacking.   Inspired by her quiet, rural home town in Cornwall, the story is thought to be a metaphor for the attacks on London during World War II, or The Blitz in particular.\n\nRadio and TV dramatisations\n\nThe story has been dramatised for radio and TV on several occasions, including:\n*Episode 838 of Lux Radio Theater on 20 July 1953 with Herbert Marshall\n*Episode 217 of Escape on 10 July 1954 with Ben Wright and Virginia Gregg\n*Episode 240 (final show in the series) of CBS-TV series Danger on 31 May 1955 with Michael Strong and Betty Lou Holland\n*BBC Afternoon Theatre on 20 November 1974 with Howard Goorney, Chris Harris, and Elizabeth Boxer  \n*A three part BBC Radio 4 Extra adaptation, read by Charlie Barnecut, first broadcast 23 April 2008 \n*An adaptation by Melissa Murray, for BBC Radio 4's The Friday Play, first broadcast on 30 April 2010 \n\nPlot summary \n\nIn a small Cornish seaside town in early December, there is a sudden cold snap. A wounded war veteran on military pension, Nat Hocken, is working part-time for a farm owner when he notices a large number of birds behaving strangely along the peninsula where his family lives. He attributes this to the sudden arrival of winter. That night, he hears a tapping on his bedroom window and encounters a bird that pecks his hand, causing him to bleed. As the night progresses he encounters more birds, especially those flocking into his children's room, but the birds leave at dawn. Nat reassures his wife that they were restless because of a sudden change in the weather.\n\nThe next day, Nat tells his fellow workers about the night's events, but they give his story no importance. As Nat later walks to the beach to dispose of dead birds, he notices what appear to be whitecaps on the sea, but it is actually a great line of seagulls waiting for the tide to rise. When Nat arrives home, he and his family hear over the radio that birds are attacking all over Britain, presumably because of the unnatural weather. Nat decides to board up the windows and chimneys of his house. He notices more birds, including the gulls, above the sea waiting for the tide.\n\nNat rushes to pick up his daughter, Jill, from the school bus stop to keep her safe. On his way back Nat spots his boss, Mr. Trigg, who has a car, and persuades him to give Jill a lift home. Mr. Trigg cheerfully professes to be unfazed by the announcements and plans on shooting at the birds for fun. He invites Nat to come along, but Nat rejects Mr. Trigg's offer and continues home, believing that hunting them would be futile. Just before he reaches home, the gulls descend, attacking him with their beaks. Luckily, Nat manages to reach the cottage door with only minor injuries.\n\nSoon, massive flocks of birds attack. A national emergency is declared on BBC Radio, and people are told not to leave their homes.  Then, due to the \"unprecedented nature of the emergency\", the BBC announces that is going silent for the night and will resume broadcasting the next morning.  For safety, Nat brings the family into the kitchen for the night. During their dinner they hear what sounds like gunfire from airplanes overhead, followed by the sound of the planes crashing. The attacks die down, and Nat calculates that the birds will only attack at high tide.\n\nThe next morning, wireless broadcasts do not resume and the radio is silent.  The tide recedes, and Nat sets out to obtain supplies from his neighbours. He finds piles of dead birds around the houses; those still alive peer at him from afar. Nat walks to the farm where he is employed, only to find Mr. Trigg, Mrs. Trigg and their workman, Jim, dead. Later he finds the postman's body by the road; soon he comes to the realization that his neighbors have all been killed by the birds.\n\nNat returns home with the supplies but soon the birds attack once again. As if facing a firing squad, Nat smokes his last cigarette, then throws the empty pack into the fire and watches it burn.\nQuestion:\nThe Alfred Hitchcock films Rebecca and The Birds were based on novels by which author?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nHibernia\nHibernia is the Classical Latin name for the island of Ireland. The name Hibernia was taken from Greek geographical accounts.  During his exploration of northwest Europe (c. 320 BC), Pytheas of Massilia called the island Iérnē (written ).  In his book Geographia (c. 150 AD), Claudius Ptolemaeus (\"Ptolemy\") called the island Iouerníā (written , where \"ου\"-ou stands for w).\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his book Agricola (c. 98 AD), uses the name Hibernia.  The Romans also sometimes used Scotia, \"land of the Scoti\", as a geographical term for Ireland in general, as well as just the part inhabited by those people.\n\nΙουέρνια Iouerníā was a Greek rendering of the Q-Celtic name *Īweriū from which eventually arose the Irish names Ériu and Éire. The original meaning of the name is thought to be \"abundant land\". \n\nPost-Roman usage\n\nThe High King Brian Boru (c. 941–1014) based his title on being emperor of the Irish people, which was in Latin: \"Imperator Scottorum\", as distinct from claiming to be Emperor of the island of Ireland. From 1172 the Lordship of Ireland gave the King of England the additional title \"Dominus Hibernie\" (sic, for Hiberniae; also \"Dominus Hybernie\"), Lord of Ireland. The Kingdom of Ireland created the title Rex Hiberniae, King of Ireland, for use in Latin texts. Gerard Mercator called Ireland \"Hybernia\" on his [http://www.teachnet.ie/dhorgan/2006/firstmaps.html world map of 1541]. In 1642 the motto of the Irish Confederates, a Catholic-landlord administration that ruled much of Ireland until 1650 was: Pro Deo, Rege et Patria, Hibernia Unanimis. (In English: For God, King and Fatherland, Ireland is United).\n\nHowever, unlike many Roman geographical names, the Latin \"Hibernia\" did not become the basis for the name for Ireland in any modern languages, with even Italian using Irlanda.  Apart from the Celtic languages all modern languages use a local variant of the English \"Ireland\". This is presumably because direct medieval contacts between Ireland and continental Europe were at too low a level to embed use of the Hibernian root, or the original Irish Éire, in local vernaculars.  This contrasts with Wales, which is still \"Pays de Galles\" in French, with similar terms in other Romance languages.\n\nBy the classicising 18th century the use of Hibernia had revived in some contexts, just as had the use of Caledonia, one of the Latin terms for Scotland, and Britannia for Britain.  \"Hibernia\" was used on Irish coins and companies such as the Hibernian Insurance Company were established (later renamed the Hibernian Group). The name took on popularity with the success of the Irish Patriot Party. At a time when Palladian classical architecture and design were being adopted in northern Europe, Hibernia was a useful word to describe Ireland with overtones of classical style and civility, particularly by the prosperous Anglo-Irish Ascendancy who were taught Latin at school. \"Hibernian\" was used as a term for people, and a general adjective. The Royal Exchange in Dublin was built in 1769–79 with the carved inscription \"SPQH\" for Senatus PopulusQue Hibernicus – The senate and people of Ireland.  The Royal Hibernian Academy dates from 1823.\n\nHibernia is a word that is rarely used today with regard to Ireland, except in long-established names.  It is occasionally used for names of organisations and various other things; for instance: Hibernia National Bank, Hibernian Insurance Group, Ancient Order of Hibernians, The Hibernian magazine, Hibernia College, Hibernian Football Club, HMS Hibernia, and modern derivatives, from Latin like Respublica Hibernica (Irish Republic) and Universitas Hiberniae Nationalis (National University of Ireland).  In Canada, Hibernia lends its name to the Hibernia oil field off Newfoundland, and to a large sea oil platform there, the Hibernia.\n\nAnother occurrence is in familial Hibernian fever or TRAPS (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome), a periodic fever first described in 1982 in a family of Irish and Scottish descent, but found in all ethnic groups. \n\nThe compound form Hiberno- remains more common, as in Hiberno-Norse, Hiberno-English, Hiberno-Scottish, Hibernophile, etc.\n\nAn Edinburgh team playing in the SPFL have adopted the name.\nQuestion:\nWhat country had the Roman name Hibernia?\nAnswer:\nIrlanda\nPassage:\nMeasuring an angle using a protractor - Sunshine Maths\nSunshine Maths\nHome > Geometry > Measuring an angle\nMeasuring an angle\nMeasuring an angle involves the use an instrument called the protractor (see picture below). It has two scales marked on it – an inner scale and an outer scale. The inner scale is used to measure the angle in an ‘anti-clockwise’ direction, and the outer scale is used to measure the angle in a ‘clockwise’ direction.\nThe unit of measurement for an angle is degrees, and is represented by a small circle next to the number (like 20°).\nTo actually measure the size of an angle, we follow the following steps:\nStep 1: Place the central point of the protractor on the vertex of the angle.\nStep 2: Line up the base line of the protractor with the lower ray (first ray or arm) or the angle.\nStep 3: Measure the angle from the base line using the scale which begins at 0° until you reach the second ray/arm.\nStep 4: The position of the second ray/arm will will the size of the angle on the protractor.\nTip: If the arms are too short to read/measure the angle, make it longer with a pencil and ruler before measuring.\nQuestion:\nWhich maths instrument is used to measure an angle?\nAnswer:\nProtracters\nPassage:\nMoraine\nA moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nMoraines may be composed of debris ranging in size from silt-sized glacial flour to large boulders.\nThe debris is typically sub-angular to rounded in shape. Moraines may be on the glacier’s surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted. Moraines may also occur when glacier- or iceberg-transported rocks fall into a body of water as the ice melts.\n\nFormation \n\nDebris  could have been scraped off a valley floor as a glacier advanced or may have fallen off the valley walls as a result of frost wedging or landslide, when melting.\n\nTypes of moraines\n\nMoraines can be classified either by origin, location with respect to a glacier or former glacier, or by shape. The first approach is suitable for moraines associated with contemporary glaciers—but more difficult to apply to old moraines, which are defined by their particular morphology, since their origin is debated. Some moraine types are known only from ancient glaciers, while medial moraines of valley glaciers are poorly preserved and difficult to distinguish after the retreat or melting of the glacier.\n\nLateral moraines\n\nLateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by frost shattering of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley. The till is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts. Because lateral moraines are deposited on top of the glacier, they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore, as the glacier melts, lateral moraines are usually preserved as high ridges. \n\nLateral moraines stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements, causing it to melt or sublime less than the uncovered parts of the glacier. Multiple lateral moraines may develop as the glacier advances and retreats.\n\nGround moraines\n\nGround moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains. They are accumulated at the base of the ice as lodgment till, but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats.  In alpine glaciers, ground moraines are often found between the two lateral moraines. Ground moraines may be modified into drumlins by the overriding ice.\n\nRogen moraines\n\nRogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an ice sheet. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like tigerstripes on aerial photographs. Rogen moraines are named after Lake RogenMöller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial reshaping of preexisting landforms. Quaternary Science Reviews, 25:362-389 in Härjedalen, Sweden, the landform’s type locality.\n\nEnd or terminal moraines\n\nEnd moraines, or terminal moraines, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier.  They usually reflect the shape of the glacier's terminus.  Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines.  End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine.  There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional.  Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier.  Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat.  After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.\n\nRecessional moraine\n\nRecessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.  \n\nMedial moraine\n\nA medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Kluane National Park, Yukon, has a ridge of medial moraine 1 km wide.\n\nSupraglacial moraines\n\nSupraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the ablation zone, melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.\n\nWashboard moraines\n\nWashboard moraines, also known as minor or corrugated moraines, are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. The name \"washboard moraine\" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a washboard.\n\nVeiki moraine\n\nA Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern Sweden and parts of Canada.\nQuestion:\nA smooth hill shaped by moving ice made up of glacial drift is known as a what?\nAnswer:\nDrumlins\nPassage:\nLoudness\nLoudness is the characteristic of a sound that is primarily a psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). More formally, it is defined as \"that attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud\". \n\nLoudness, a subjective measure, is often confused with objective measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. Filters such as A-weighting attempt to adjust sound measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the typical human. However, loudness perception is a much more complex process than A-weighting.\n\nLoudness is also affected by parameters other than sound pressure, including frequency, bandwidth and duration.\n\nExplanation \n\nThe perception of loudness is related to sound pressure level (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound. The human auditory system averages the effects of SPL over a 600–1000 ms interval. A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize. For sounds of duration greater than 1 second, the moment-by-moment perception of loudness will be related to the average loudness during the preceding 600–1000 ms.\n\nFor sounds having a duration longer than 1 second, the relationship between SPL and loudness can be approximated by a power function in which SPL has an exponent of 0.6, while that between SPL and intensity can be approximated by a power function with an exponent of 0.3 (Stevens' power law). More precise measurements indicate that loudness increases with a higher exponent at low and high levels and with a lower exponent at moderate levels.\n\nUnits used to measure loudness:\n*Sone (loudness N)\n*Phon (loudness level L)\n\nThe sensitivity of the human ear changes as a function of frequency, as shown in the equal-loudness graph. Each line on this graph shows the SPL required for frequencies to be perceived as equally loud, and different curves pertain to different sound pressure levels. It also shows that humans with normal hearing are most sensitive to sounds around 2–4 kHz, with sensitivity declining to either side of this region. A complete model of the perception of loudness will include the integration of SPL by frequency.\n\nHistorically, loudness was measured using an \"ear-balance\" audiometer in which the amplitude of a sine wave was adjusted by the user to equal the perceived loudness of the sound being evaluated. Contemporary standards for measurement of loudness are based on summation of energy in critical bands as described in IEC 532, DIN 45631 and ASA/ANSI S3.4. A distinction is made between stationary loudness (sounds that remain sensibly constant) and non-stationary (sound sources that move in space or change amplitude over time.)\n\nHearing loss \n\nWhen sensorineural hearing loss (damage to the cochlea or in the brain) is present, the perception of loudness is altered.  Sounds at low levels (often perceived by those without hearing loss as relatively quiet) are no longer audible to the hearing impaired, but sounds at high levels often are perceived as having the same loudness as they would for an unimpaired listener.  This phenomenon can be explained by two theories: loudness grows more rapidly for these listeners than normal listeners with changes in level.  This theory is called \"loudness recruitment\" and has been accepted as the classical explanation.  More recently, it has been proposed that some listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may in fact exhibit a normal rate of loudness growth, but instead have an elevated loudness at their threshold.  That is, the softest sound that is audible to these listeners is louder than the softest sound audible to normal listeners.  This theory is called \"softness imperception\", a term coined by Mary Florentine. \n\nCompensation\n\nThe \"loudness\" control on some consumer stereos alters the frequency response curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness characteristic of the ear.  Loudness compensation is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.\n\nNormalization\n\nLoudness normalization equalizes perceived level such that, for instance, commercials do not sound louder than television programs. Loudness normalisation schemes exist for a number of audio applications.\n\nBroadcast\n\n*Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act\n*European Broadcasting Union R128 \n\nMovie and home theaters\n\n*Dialnorm\n\nMusic playback\n\n*Sound Check in iTunes\n*ReplayGain\n\nMeasurement\n\nRelative loudness monitoring in production is measured in accordance with ITU-R BS.1770 in units of LKFS. \n\nWork began on ITU-R BS.1770 in 2001 after 0 dBFS+ level distortion in converters and lossy codecs had become evident; and the original Leq(RLB) loudness metric was proposed by Gilbert Soloudre in 2003. \n\nBased on data from subjective listening tests, Leq(RLB) was compared against numerous other algorithms where it did remarkably well. After modification of the frequency weighting, the measurement was made multi-channel (monaural to 5.1 surround sound). CBC, Dolby and TC Electronics and numerous broadcasters contributed to the listening tests.\n\nTo make the loudness metric cross-genre friendly, a relative measurement gate was added. This work was carried out in 2008 by the EBU. The improvements were brought back into BS.1770-2. ITU subsequently updated the true-peak metric (BS.1770-3) and added provision for more audio channels, for instance 22.2 surround sound (BS.1770-4).\nQuestion:\nWhich scientific unit gives a measure of loudness?\nAnswer:\nAbsolute dB\n", "answers": ["Lady Browning", "Daphne Du Maurier", "Daphne de Maurier", "Daphne du Maurier", "Du Maurier, Daphne", "Dame Daphne du Maurier", "Daphne du maurier", "DAPHNE DU MAURIER", "Daphne Dumaurier", "Dame Daphne Du Maurier", "Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning DBE", "Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning"], "length": 3655, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "263235109504b70e68a96a6105a23f0dd07598d53ab0bfbd"}

They were the children of Aeolus , the Keeper of the Winds, and Eos , the Titan goddess of the dawn. The four gods were Boreas (North Wind), Notus (South Wind), Zephyrus (West Wind) and Eurus (East Wind).\nBoreas was often described as a bearded old man with wings, who held a conch shell. He was closely associated with winter, as he was the bringer of cold and low temperatures.\nNotus was linked to the hot wind that would blow after midsummer, causing the crops to burn and bringing the bad weather of late summer.\nEurus was considered to be an unlucky east wind, bringing rain and warm temperatures.\nZephyrus was thought to live in a cave in the region of Thrace, and was considered the gentlest wind of the four, closely linked to spring.

One day for New Year's Day, except two if it falls on Thursday (except leap years).\n2. If New Year's Day falls on a Saturday, the holiday is given as an holiday in some other part of the year -- e.g. in 2000, Christmas, which falls on a Monday, was made into a 2-day holiday when it wouldn't otherwise be.  (Don't fret; New Year's Eve was a holiday in the prior year.)\n3.

The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations.

As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip José Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964–2004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. – Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the novel 'Finnegan's Wake'?\nAnswer:\nJames Augustine Aloysius Joyce\nPassage:\nHilary Devey\nHilary Lorraine Devey CBE (born 10 March 1957) is an English businesswoman, television personality and entrepreneur, best known for her two-year role on BBC Two programme Dragons' Den until she left to present the Channel 4 series The Intern. \n\nEarly life\n\nDevey grew up in Bolton, Lancashire and, as a seven-year-old child, witnessed the results of the bankruptcy of her father, who had owned a central heating company, when bailiffs removed furniture and household goods from the family home. Her father then earned a living managing pubs and hotels. She attended Bolton School and after leaving, at the age of sixteen, served for a short while in the Women's Royal Air Force, in air traffic control and the supply accounts department, stationed at RAF Brize Norton. Devey later moved to London.  \n\nCareer\n\nBusiness\n\nDevey made her fortune launching Pall-Ex, a palletised freight network. Launched in 1996, Pall-Ex was the third palletised goods distribution network to be launched in the UK. It was based on the well-established hub and spoke express parcels distribution model - this form of pallet network was pioneered by Palletline in 1992. \nPall-Ex handles around 8,000 palletised consignments through its Leicestershire hub each day and has annual revenues of approximately £75 million.\n\nTelevision\n\nDevey has featured in several television programmes including Secret Millionaire in 2008, where she donated more than £70,000 to the Back Door Music Project and the Syke Community Centre in Rochdale. In March 2010, she was the presenter of The Business Inspector for Channel 5, a four-part documentary series which saw her use her business acumen and expertise to help transform struggling small businesses into successful profitable companies.\n\nIn February 2011, Devey joined the panel of the BBC Two programme Dragons' Den  following the departure of James Caan. Appearing on the programme, she popularised her expression \"You would make my foot itch.\" to indicate dissatisfaction or lack of interest in a venture. Devey later announced that she would be leaving the series in June 2012 as she had signed an exclusive two-year agreement with Channel 4.\n\nIn September 2012, Devey presented her final programme for BBC Two, a mini-series called Hilary Devey's Women at the Top, a joint Open University and BBC Two production. \n\nIn April 2013, after moving to Channel 4, Devey began hosting a new series called The Intern, a  business documentary in which Devey gave three young interns a week's trial in the job of their dreams. The first three episodes were aired in the Thursday 21:00 time-slot, but the final three episodes were broadcast on Wednesday nights at the later time of 23:00 due to a significant drop in ratings.\n\nOn 3 April 2014, Devey announced that she would host a new Channel 4 programme, which began filming in June 2014. The show, named Running the Shop began airing on Channel 4 on 9 June 2015. \n\nOn 18 June 2015, Devey made her debut as a guest panellist on the ITV lunchtime chat show Loose Women, and became an occasional panelist on 4 September 2015. However, she departed the show on the 9 November 2015.\n\nAwards\n\nDevey was awarded the Vitalise Woman of the Year Award in 2008,  and an Honorary Doctorate of Law by the University of Leicester in 2010 for her services to industry.  Other UK domestic awards have included the Sir Robert Lawrence Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in 2009 and the Personality of the Year in the International Freight Weekly Awards for 2010.\n\nIn July 2012, Devey was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Business Administration by the University of Bolton for services to business.\n\nDevey was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), in the 2013 Birthday Honours, for services to the transport industry and charity. \n\nOn 16 April 2014, Devey was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Business Administration from the University of Wolverhampton. \n\nDevey is an ambassador of the British Citizen Awards, a ceremony held bi-annually to reward everyday individuals and their contribution to society.[http://britishcitizenawards.co.uk/endorsements/ Endorsements – Recognition for people making a difference]\n\nPersonal life\n\nDevey previously resided near Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England, but has now relocated to Boylestone in Derbyshire. She also has a house in London and villas in Morocco, Spain and Boca Raton. For a time she owned a mansion in Florida, which she sold in 2014 for £5.42m.  She has been divorced twice.  Devey owns four dogs, including Mixie and Dixie, her teacup yorkies who have appeared with her in the press and on TV.\n\nDevey suffered a stroke in 2009 after having an abdominoplasty operation. \n\nDevey is a Bolton Wanderers supporter. \n\nIn 2011, Devey was involved in a struggle to help her 24-year-old son, Mevlit Brewster-Ahmet overcome a seven-year drug addiction. She commented: \"The hardest work I've ever done is pulling my son back from the grip of heroin.\" \n\nOn 28 October 2012, Devey spoke on BBC Radio 4 about her family sorrow.  Her mother found out, only years after getting together with her father, that he already had a wife and four children. Years later, history repeated itself when Devey, herself discovered that her ex-partner was also already married with five children.\n\nCharity\n\nDevey campaigns for various charities including Carers Trust, of which she became vice-president in 2012. She donates to charity one penny for each pallet distributed by the Pall-Ex network through her 'Penny a Pallet' scheme.  She also supports the Stroke Association, for which she became a patron in 2010.\n\nFilmography\n\n;Television\n\n;Guest appearances\n*The Million Pound Drop (2013)  \n*Fifteen to One (20 June 2014) \n*Through the Keyhole (4 October 2014)\n*Safeword (3 September 2015)\n\nBooks\n\n* Bold As Brass: My Story, (2012), London, Macmillan, ISBN 978-0-230-76593-1\nQuestion:\nWhich Bolton-born woman, the founder of Pall-Ex Ltd, replaced James Caan on BBC's Dragons Den?\nAnswer:\nHilary Devey\nPassage:\nRetro:Callaghan takes hard line on drugs - Yorkshire ...\nRetro:Callaghan takes hard line on drugs - Yorkshire Evening Post\nRetro:Callaghan takes hard line on drugs\n15:17\n15:30 Thursday 03 May 2007\nDateline: may 1969  THE Main Story...

{"input": "Passage:\nCollecting Gone With the Wind by Mitchell, Margaret ...\nCollecting Gone With the Wind by Mitchell, Margaret - First edition identification guide\nReviews (3)\nMargaret Mitchell only published one complete novel, but it was quite the book - Gone With the Wind earned her the Pulitzer Prize in 1937 and National Book Award for 1936. The epic romance tale set in and around Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War has remained a bestseller, even before the equally popular film starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh was made in 1939.\nFirst edition identification and notes\nThe first edition, first printing of GWTW numbered only 10,000 copies, and they bore an incorrect release date of May, 1936.  These inaccurate first printings, and corrected second printing of 25,000 copies, were both actually released to the American public in June 1936.  Signed first editions are valued from $10,000-$25,000, depending on the book's condition, of course.  The true firsts with the May 1936 date also have the original publisher's price of $3.00 and a \"Spring Novels\" advert with Gone With the Wind as the second title down as indicators of edition.  \nOther collectible or notable editions\nA Book Club Edition was printed and released at the same time as the first and second printings, which causes confusion for new collectors, but they remain one of the few Book Club Editions that still have some value. One indicator of the BCE is roman numerals for 1936 (MCMXXXVI) on the copyright page.There are also many who collect the movie-related books, posters, and ephemera.  The original, unsigned typescript for the film can be found for sale for around $15,000 (all prices as of November 2013). -\nslimjackreelyahoocom : Gone with the Wind belongs to that finite group of books one can confidently call seminal.This novel traces, with heart wrenching passages and beautifully set scenes, the death of the \"Old South\". The horror and cruelty of war is adroitly used to contrast with the slow beauty of the South as it was, and which it can never be again. If a person has not read this book, their Education is incomplete.\nAbbeyRheinhartt : I approached this book with trepidation. Would this be a book that glorified slavery and antebellum life? No, quite the contrary, although it provides rich description of the wealthy class before the Civil War.This book has an excellent story, well told, in which the characters are the symbols of their country. Scarlett is the United States, at first content and lazy with slavery, then hardened by war, and she shifts to be ruthlessly concerned with commerce and moving forward. Ashley is beautiful and pale, and represents the old south, which cannot adapt.You won't find better character development anywhere. This book is extremely well-written. Do yourself a favor and but a nice dusty one, so you can have that authentic feeling.This book is hugely feminist. It also tells a huge story, but is fast-paced, and will keep you locked in to the life of Scarlett.This is a significant book in American literature, but it is not dry. This book is a must-read.Abbey Rheinhartt.\nJennyG (Draper): This is my favorite book of all time. The characters are incredibly well written, as is the story line. Highly recommend reading. The copy I got from Biblio.com was in great condition even though it was used. I definitely plan on buying from them again.\nReview this book (Want a chance to win $50 ?

Who was she?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nInternational Skating Union\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) is the international governing body for competitive ice skating disciplines, including figure skating, synchronized skating, speed skating, and short track speed skating.  It was founded in Scheveningen, Netherlands, in 1892, making it one of the oldest international sport federations. The ISU was formed to establish standardized international rules and regulations for the skating disciplines it governs, and to organize international competitions in these disciplines. It is now based in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nHistory\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) was founded in 1892 to govern speed skating and figure skating.\n  In 1895, the ISU streamlined its mission to deal only with amateur competitors and not professionals.  The organization hosted its first amateur skating championship in February 1896 in St. Petersburg, Russia. \n\nThe United States and Canada formed a competing organization, the International Skating Union of America (ISUA), in 1907.   Within the next two years, twelve European nations had joined the ISU, and the ISUA had only its original members. The ISUA folded in 1927. \n\nEuropean and North American figure skaters rarely competed against each other due to differences in their styles of skating.  The ISU had \"systematized and arranged\" the sport of figure skating, with competitions including  \"a selection of ten or twelve numbers from the I. S. U. programme, ... five minutes' free skating to music, ... [and] special figures\" on one foot.  In 1911, Canada joined the ISU, leaving the United States as the only major competitor to not be a member.\n\nShort track speed skating gained its own world championship event, hosted by the ISU, in 1976.  At the time, the sport was known as indoor speed skating, but it was renamed short-track when indoor rinks for the longer speed skating events were introduced.\n\nBy 1988, 38 nations had joined the ISU.  Within the next few years, the ISU abandoned one of its long-held practices, eliminating the use of mandatory figures in the singles' figure skating competitions and reducing their use in ice dancing. \n\nAfter the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, the ISU implemented sweeping changes to many of its events.  In one of the short track speed skating events, Apolo Anton Ohno was awarded the gold medal after the disqualification of Kim Dong-Sung.  Although the South Korean delegation protested the disqualification, ISU rules did not allow for a review of the official's call.  Several months later, the ISU approved the use of video replay, when available, to review referee decisions.   The rules for judging figure skating were also changed as the result of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal.  According to Ottavio Cinquanta, president of the ISU, \"'Something was wrong there,' ...  'Not just the individual but also the system. It existed for 70 years. Now we are trying to replace one system with another.'\"  A new figure skating judging system took effect in 2004, eliminating the 6.0 system perfect scores and instead giving points for various technical elements. \n\nISU Championships\n\nIn addition to sanctioning other international competitions, the ISU designates the following competitions each year as \"ISU Championships\":\n\nSpeed skating:\n* Long track:\n** World Allround Speed Skating Championships\n** World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships (held only in non-Olympic years)\n** World Sprint Speed Skating Championships\n** World Junior Speed Skating Championships\n** European Speed Skating Championships\n* Short track:\n** World Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n** World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships\n** World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n** European Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n* Figure skating:\n** World Figure Skating Championships\n** World Junior Figure Skating Championships\n** World Synchronized Skating Championships\n** World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships\n** European Figure Skating Championships\n** Four Continents Figure Skating Championships\n\nNote that events such as the Olympic Winter Games and the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating are not ISU Championships. However, they do count towards Personal Best scores.\n\nFirst world championships\n\nDates and locations of first world championships in various disciplines held under the auspices of the ISU:\n* 1893: Speed skating (men only), Amsterdam\n* 1896: Figure skating (men only), St. Petersburg\n* 1906: Figure skating (ladies), Davos\n* 1908: Figure skating (pairs), St. Petersburg\n* 1936: Speed skating (women), Stockholm\n* 1952: Figure skating (ice dance), Paris\n* 1970: Sprint speed skating, West Allis, Wisconsin\n* 1978: Short track speed skating, Solihull, UK\n* 2000: Synchronized skating, Minneapolis\n\nCooperation with other sports\n\nISU has an agreement with Federation of International Bandy to use the same arenas. According to news published at bandynet.ru 7/6  bandy might be on the Olympic programme at Sochi 2014 as a branch of skating because ISU in 2007 got the right to within 3 years add another discipline.\n\nOrganization\n\nAs of the summer of 2008, the ISU consisted of 63 member nations, with a governing council of 11.  To add any proposal to the agenda of meetings, it must have support from four-fifths of the members.  Proposals on the agenda are approved with a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nPresidents of the ISU \n\n* 1892–1895 Pim Mulier\n* 1895–1925 Viktor Balck\n* 1925–1937 Ulrich Salchow\n* 1937–1945 Gerrit W.

The film has become an American holiday classic that’s watched over and over each year. While the memorable characters are forever frozen in time (along with daughter Audrey's eyeballs and lower limbs), Snakkle.com takes a look at what happened to the actors who played them all so well.\nChevy Chase as Clark Griswold\nClark Griswold is determined to enjoy \"the most fun-filled, old-fashioned family Christmas ever,\" so the famously hapless father invites a bunch of dysfunctional relatives to the Chicago home he shares with his wife Ellen and their kids Rusty and Audrey. Too bad his well-intentioned holiday plans quickly spiral out of control as he trips, falls and bumbles his way through one iconic scene after the other. After all, no Griswold Christmas celebration would be complete without 25,000 lights encasing the house, an electrocuted cat in the yard, an exploding turkey on the table and a S.W.A.T. team ready to break down the front door.\nPHOTOS: See all 25 pics in the “Where are they now ‘National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation’ gallery\nChevy Chase NOW\nChevy Chase reprised his role as Clark in the comedy “Vegas Vacation” (1997). Since then he’s continued acting with steady but lower profile work, like a two-episode guest appearance on “Brothers & Sisters” in 2007 and sporadic appearances on the program that launched his career in 1975, “Saturday Night Live.” More recently, fans saw Chase in his role as Pierce Hawthorne on the show “Community.” But perhaps his biggest achievement to date is his long-lasting relationship with Jayni Chase. The couple married in 1982, and they’ve raised three children together.\nJuliette Lewis as Audrey\nAudrey is still as snarky as ever, and she really lets loose when faced with the idea of spending her holiday trapped at home with “loved ones.” “Would it be indecent to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?” she asks. The answer is yes, so she’s forced to share a bed with her brother Rusty. In the film, she’s frozen from the waist down on a chilly expedition to get the family Christmas tree. No worries! “It’s all part of the experience!” shouts her dad about her frost-induced blindness.\nJuliette Lewis NOW\nJuliette Lewis was relatively unknown when she played Audrey in 1989—but her fortunes quickly improved. That year, Lewis began a four-year relationship with heartthrob Brad Pitt after the two met while working on a TV movie. “Dating Brad Pitt isn’t the most interesting thing that ever happened to me,” insists Lewis, who would later be married for two years to skateboarder Steve Berra. Perhaps she’s prouder of her Oscar nomination for her role as Danielle Bowden in the thriller “Cape Fear” (1991) or critically acclaimed roles in hits like “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” (1993) and “Natural Born Killers” (1994). After quitting acting for six years to perform with her punk-rock band Juliette and the Licks, she’s now back on the small screen as Tammy in the TV show “The Firm.”\nBeverly D’Angelo as Ellen Griswold\nIn this holiday installment of the Griswold family movies, Ellen returns as the levelheaded voice of reason. As always, she’s less than impressed with her husband’s efforts to create the perfect family memory. \"Clark! Slow down! I don't want to spend the holidays dead!\" she complains after they hop in the car to look for the perfect Christmas tree. Later she sums up the whole experience as best she can: “I don't know what to say, except, it's Christmas and we're all in misery.”\nBeverly D’Angelo NOW\nBeverly D’Angelo’s Hollywood career has run the gamut in the years since her Christmas adventure with Chevy Chase. She played the ill-fated Kitty Menendez in the made-for-television film “Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills” (1994) and Doris Vinyard in “American History X” (1998). Proving she can’t be typecast, D’Angelo shone as Barbara “Babs” Miller, Ari Gold’s mentor on “Entourage” (2005-2011). The actress’ love life has been just as varied. For a time she was married to Lorenzo Salviati, an Italian duke, and her seven-year relationship with Al Pacino produced twins Olivia and Anton in 2001. The couple split two years later.\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Margo Chester\nSnooty Margo Chester has no problem letting her neighbors know how much she hates their Christmas spirit – with or without her husband’s support! “If you’re not man enough to put an end to this s**t, then I am!” she snipes to Todd Chester of the chaos raging next door. Bah humbug!\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus NOW\nDespite her role as a not-so-nice neighbor, Julia Louise-Dreyfus must have been a very good girl because in 1990 she began a lucrative eight-year stint as Elaine Benes on “Seinfeld.” Even her voice became famous as she gave life to Gloria, Mr. Burn’s love interest, on “The Simpsons” from 2001 through 2008. Today she’s busy starring on the HBO comedy “Veep.” The mother of two sons is just as successful in her personal life – she’s been married to television writer Brad Hall since 1987.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the central family in ‘National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation’?\nAnswer:\nThe Griswolds\nPassage:\nGulf of Aden\nThe Gulf of Aden ( ', ) is a gulf located in the Arabian Sea between Yemen, on the south coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which is more than 20 miles wide. It shares its name with the port city of Aden in Yemen, which forms the northern shore of the gulf. Historically the Gulf of Aden was known as \"The Gulf of Berbera\", named after the ancient Somali port city of Berbera on the south side of the gulf.   However, as the city of Aden grew during the colonial era, the name of \"Gulf of Aden\" was popularised.\n\nThe waterway is part of the important Suez canal shipping route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean with 21,000 ships crossing the gulf annually.\n\nName\n\nThe name of the Gulf was inspired by the former British Crown Colony city of Aden, now part of Yemen. The Somali names are Gacanka Cadmeed or Gacanka Saylac.\n\nGeography\n\nLimits\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Aden as follows: \n\n:On the Northwest – The southern limit of the Red Sea [A line joining Husn Murad () and Ras Siyyan ()].\n\n:On the East – The meridian of Cape Guardafui (Ras Asir, 51°16'E).\n\nHydrography\n\nThe temperature of the Gulf of Aden varies between 15 C and 28 C, depending on the season and the appearance of monsoons. The salinity of the gulf at 10 m depth varies from 35.3 ‰ along the eastern Somali coast to as high as 37.3 ‰ in the gulf's center, while the oxygen content in the Gulf of Aden at the same depth is typically between 4.0 and 5.0 mg/L.\n\nCommerce and trade\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is a vital waterway for shipping, especially for Persian Gulf oil, making it an integral waterway in the world economy.   Approximately 11 percent of the world's seaborne petroleum passes through the Gulf of Aden on its way to the Suez Canal or to regional refineries.  The main ports along the gulf are Aden in Yemen, Djibouti City in Djibouti, and Zeila and Berbera in Somaliland and Bosaso in Somalia.\n\nIn earlier history, the city of Crater, located just south of the modern city of Aden, was an important port in regional trade. Crater was the principal harbor of the pre-Islamic kingdom of Awsan, and after its annexation by the kingdom of Saba at the end of the 5th century, played a significant role in connecting Africa with Arabia.\n\nIn the late 2000s, the gulf evolved into a hub of pirate activity. By 2013, attacks in the waters had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols.  India receives USD 50 billion in imports and sends USD 60 billion in exports through this area annually. Because of this and for the sake of protecting the trade of other countries, India keeps a warship escort in this area. \n\nAlso see Piracy in Gulf of Aden.\n\nEcology\n\nA geologically young body of water, the Gulf of Aden has a unique biodiversity that contains many varieties of fish, coral, seabirds and invertebrates. This rich ecological diversity has benefited from a relative lack of pollution during the history of human habitation around the gulf. However, environmental groups fear that the lack of a coordinated effort to control pollution may jeopardize the gulf's ecosphere.  Whales, dolphins, and dugongs  were once common  before being severely reduced by commercial hunts, including by mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 70s.  Critically endangered Arabian humpback whales were used to be seen in large numbers,  and only a few of large whales still occur in the gulf waters such as bryde's whales,  blue whales,  and sperm whales. \n\nBordering countries\n\n* Northern shore:\n** \n* Western shore:\n** \n* Southern shore:\n** \n\nTowns and cities\n\nTowns and cities on the Gulf of Aden coast:\n\nMaydh\n*  Aden\n*  Al Mukalla\n*  Shokra\n*  Balhaf\n*  Bir Ali\n*  Djibouti city\n*  Obock\n*  Loyada\n*  Zeila\n*  Berbera\n*  Bosaso\n*  Las Khorey\n*  Maydh\nQuestion:\nThe three countries which border the Gulf of Aden are the Yemeni Republic, the Republic of Djibouti, and...?\nAnswer:\nSomali National Salvation Committee\nPassage:\nMiss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby\nMiss Abitha Tibbs and Miss Ursula Gatsby are fictional characters, played by Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts respectively, in the BBC television sitcom Fawlty Towers.\n\nMiss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby are two mostly inseparable and slightly scatty elderly spinsters who are permanent residents of Fawlty Towers (the only other long-term guest being Major Gowen).

Furthermore, it can be characterized as one of the few Mediterranean winds that do not necessarily die out at the end of the day and can easily last more than three to six days. See my climate page for Greek weather statistics.\nThe onset is the monsoonal\neffect of the summer season that leads to the development of an   intense heat trough over southern Asia extending westward over the Anatolian plateau. Higher pressure dominates over the relatively cooler surface of the   Mediterranean Sea, and settled, dry weather persists.    Northerly winds prevail along the Greek coast during the   winter also, but only those northerly winds occurring between May and   November are considered Etesian. The pressure gradients necessary to drive the   Meltemi result from a combination of:\nThe monsoonal effect during the summer that leads to a low pressure      trough over Turkey. Etesian winds flow from a high pressure ridge over     the Balkans toward the trough. During a strong Etesian, the trough may     extend relatively far to the west and beyond Rhodes . It may also form     a closed low, resulting in almost calm winds at Rhodes.\nSynoptic conditions leading to anti-cyclogenesis\nover the Balkans.\nA jet-effect increase of wind caused by channelling of the wind between      islands and mountain valleys. These effects tend to render wind reports     from certain locations unrepresentative. In the lee of Crete, katabatic     flow off the mountains generates gusty winds similar to the Föhn\nof the     Alps. The mountain valleys tend to channel the flow which increases the     wind velocity.\nThe surface flow is generally divergent in an Etesian situation, and    the weather is generally thought to be dry with clear skies. However,    this is mostly true only during the main yacht charter season of July and August    when scattered altocumulus appear a day before an Etesian, and the only other clouds are orographic\ntypes that may form on the lee    side of islands in stronger Etesian winds.\nThe Meltemi occurs mainly during the summer season (June - September with 70%), but also in May and October one may frequently experience this dry wind.\nOne should anticipate its maximum during July and August.\nUsually the wind starts in the early afternoon reaching 4-5 Beaufort\nand dies out at sun set. However, not uncommonly it reaches 5-7 Bft during the day, perseveres during the night and blows 5-7 Bft again the next day; a pattern which can easily be repeated over many days, sometimes even up to ten days.\nIf during this period sailing to windward cannot be avoided, it can be very wise to lift anchor at dawn and to cover as many miles as possible before the wind starts\n.\n \nImportant guidelines\nDue to the katabatic nature of the meltemi one can experience strong fall winds on the leeward side of the islands, notorious are Kea (we did survive though), Evvia, Tinos and Andros , Folegandros , Kos , Serifos , Amorgos and Sifnos . An orographic cloud to leeward of the mountain spells danger.\nWhen the wind encounters very high cliffs on the North shore of an island, a calm - extending several miles off shore - can be expected. Good examples are Amorgos, Paros and Naxos .\nIn the wide corridor between de dodecanese and cycladic islands the Meltemi blows undisturbed over 100 miles. Within six hours of a 30-knot wind, the waves can reach heights over three meters. The adverse currents make these waves steeper, which can be seriously dangerous for yachts smaller than 10 meter.\nThe Ionian Sea in the west of Greece is not affected by these Etesian winds but experiences a reliable Maistro wind throughout the sailing season. For an explanation on the Maistro wind please visit my page on Sailing routes in the Ionian .\nExpect funnelling winds, which can make certain straits dangerous to pass because of currents and higher wind velocities. Classical areas are: between Andros and Evvia (currents up to 5 knots!); between Ikaria and Samos till the Fournoi-archipelago; Between Paros and Naxos; North side of Amorgos; West side of Karpathos. Sometimes South of both Kea and Kythnos .\nTell-tales for your own Meltemi 24-36 hour prediction:\nHigher predicted atmospheric pressure over the Balkan/Northern Aegean.\nA sudden drop in humidity (first morning without dew on deck).\nScattered little altocumulus clouds one day in advance.\nA clear improvement of visibility combined with a raise in atmospheric pressure (4 hPa within 12 hours).\nFortunately, the possibility of stronger winds is actually the only shortcoming of the Aegean. There are hardly any shallow waters, no tides to speak off and no fog (good visibility!): all the ingredients for perfect yacht charter vacations .\nRelated pages:\nQuestion:\nWhat type of weather condition is a Meltemi?\nAnswer:\nBlustery\nPassage:\nRump (animal)\nThe rump or croup, in the external morphology of an animal, is the portion of the posterior dorsum that is posterior to the loins and anterior to the tail.  Anatomically, the rump corresponds to the sacrum.  \n\nThe tailhead or dock is the beginning of the tail, where the tail joins the rump.  It is known also as the base or root of the tail, and corresponds to the human sacrococcygeal symphysis.  In some mammals the tail may be said to consist of the tailbone (meaning the bony column, muscles, and skin) and the skirt (meaning the long hairs growing from the tailbone).  In birds, similarly, the tail consists of tailbone and tailfan (tail fan).\n\nSome animals are subjected to docking, the amputation of the tailbone at or near the dock.  These include dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, and horses.  Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is coccygectomy.\n\nUsage\n\nUsage varies from animal to animal.  Birds and cattle are said to have a rump and tailhead.  Dogs are said to have a rump and dock.  Horses are said to have a croup    (sometimes rump),  thigh or haunch, buttock, and dock.\n\nBirds\n\nIn bird anatomy, the rump is the body immediately above the tail.  The color of plumage on the rump is a characteristic widely used by ornithologists to distinguish between related species, and sometimes also between males and females of the same species. Similarly, the silhouette of the tailfan is a characteristic widely used for purposes of identification, particularly in the field.\n\nSome birds have a food reservoir pouch in the esophagus that is known as a croup.\n\nDogs\n\nIn some breeds it is traditional for tails to be cut off (docked) at the dock.\n\nHorses\n\nIn horse anatomy, the croup refers specifically to the topline of the horse's hindquarters and surrounding musculature, beginning at the hip, extending proximate to the sacral vertebrae and stopping at the dock of the tail (where the coccygeal vertebrae begin). Below the croup is the thigh or haunch. Behind the thigh is the buttock.\nOn horses appearing in parades and other public ceremonies, the croup may be decorated with a pattern in the horse's hair, formed by applying hair gel or spray, then brushing patches of hair in opposite directions.\n\nApplied to horses, the term \"dock\" has two additional uses. Its meaning may be extended to either the entire tail minus the skirt (i.e., synonymous with tailbone)  or the tailhead only.  In other equidae, it encompasses most of the tailbone, as most of that portion of the tail does not have long hairs.  A lack of long hairs can be natural, as in zebras, donkeys, and the Przewalski horse, or artificial, the result of pulling, trimming, or shaving part of the skirt (see Horse grooming).\n\nA sponge used to wash the hairless skin on the underside of the dock and other regions under the tail, protected by the dock, is called a dock sponge. Thus, the meaning of \"dock\" has been used to refer to the orifices beneath the dock, specifically the anus and vagina, creating a misapprehension that \"dock\" refers to the anus, as in, a horse's fundamental orifice is its dock.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the croup of an animal, such as a horse?\nAnswer:\nRump\nPassage:\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (;; 24 May 1686 – 16 September 1736) was a Polish-born German  physicist, engineer, and glass blower who is best known for inventing the mercury-in-glass thermometer (1714), and for developing a temperature scale now named after him. \n\nBiography \n\nFahrenheit was born in the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but lived most of his life in the Dutch Republic. The Fahrenheits were a German Hanse merchant family who had lived in several Hanseatic cities. Fahrenheit's great-grandfather had lived in Rostock, and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in Hildesheim.  Daniel's grandfather moved from Kneiphof in Königsberg (present-day Kaliningrad) to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit (the father of the subject of this article), married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children (two sons, three daughters) who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elizabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Ephraim Krueger of an aristocratic family from Danzig. \n\nDaniel Gabriel  began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating poisonous mushrooms. However, Fahrenheit's interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to Berlin, Halle, Leipzig, Dresden, Copenhagen, and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with Ole Rømer, Christian Wolff, and Gottfried Leibniz. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in The Hague as a glassblower, making barometers, altimeters, and thermometers. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in chemistry in Amsterdam.  He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  Fahrenheit died in The Hague and was buried there at the Kloosterkerk (Cloister Church).\n\nIn 2012, scientists made a computer image of his face using photos of his relatives. \n\nFahrenheit scale \n\nAccording to Fahrenheit's 1724 article,  he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of temperature.  The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride (a salt), and waiting for it to reach equilibrium.  The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point.  The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0 °F.  The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface.  This was assigned as 32 °F.  The third calibration point, taken as 96 °F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.\n\nFahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point.  The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal body temperature today is taken as 98.2 degrees,  whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale. \n\nThe Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of Mr. Fahrenheit, after whom the temperature scale was named?\nAnswer:\nGABRIEL\n", "answers": ["Grace Slick", "Grace Wing", "Grace Barnett Wing"], "length": 2142, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f51fef9942324253a6125258f8af60841e3df1fcaf75899e"}

As the country's chief international and domestic airport, it is definitely Southern Africa's busiest airport. It is the main airport of South African Airways as well as several other local airlines. Designated Africa's leading airport in the 2005 World Travel Awards, O.R.Tambo International Airport is a hub of convenience and comfort for travelers.\nThe airport, originally named Jan Smuts Airport, was established in 1952. Right from its beginnings, the airport gained the great privilege of receiving a De Havilland Comet jet's first commercial flight from London's Heathrow International Airport to the city of Johannesburg. In the 1970s it took part in Concorde tests as a high altitude airport. In 1994 the new South African government renamed Jan Smuts Airport to Johannesburg  International Airport and established a policy stating that airports would not be named for politicians. By 1996 Johannesburg International had taken the lead from Cairo International Airport as Africa's busiest airport. In 2004 some 15.3 million passengers passed through the airport. 27 October 2006 brought another name change to the airport. Under much criticism it was named O.R.Tambo International Airport in honor of the past ANC President.\nO.R.Tambo International Airport has 2 parallel north-south runways. The western runway is amongst the longest in the world, measuring 4,400m. The airports 6 terminals are divided into the domestic terminal, the transit terminal and the international terminal. In 2003 the domestic terminal was upgraded and reopened offering travelers greater facilities. The terminal is focused around the convenience of all its travelers with necessary amenities, easy movement and quick drop-off/pick-up zones. O.R.Tambo Airport's updated facilities include a wide variety of restaurants and shops as well as ATM's and other banking services. The airport also has an outstanding medical clinic with doctors, physiotherapists, optometrists and a dentist. Business men and women can take advantage of the great Internet connections including wireless. The relatively new parkade offers more than 5,000 parking bays. There is plenty of transport to and from O.R.Tambo International Airport including taxis, shuttles and buses. It is projected that by 2015 the airport will be handling some 24 million passengers every year.\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich African city is served by O R Tambo airport?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nConcertmaster\nThe Concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister) is the second-most significant person in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble after the conductor or director.  Another common term in the U.S. is \"First Chair.\" In the U.K., the term commonly used is \"leader.\"\n\nOrchestra \n\nIn an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first violin section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a concerto, in which case a guest soloist usually plays).  It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by his or her playing and bow gestures. \n\nThe concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the \"first chair,\" \"first stand\" or \"first desk\" (in the UK). He or she makes decisions regarding bowing and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. The concertmaster leads the orchestra in tuning before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management.  Leading the orchestral tuning is not just a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, he or she will signal to the oboe player to play another \"A.\" Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence.\n\nThe concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the auditions of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.\n\nConcert band \n\nThe concertmaster in a standard concert band is the principal clarinet, oboe, flute or saxophone and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead flutist will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the ensemble. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.\n\nBrass band \n\nIn brass bands, the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo cornet or trumpet.\n\nDuties \n\nThe duties and tasks of the concertmaster are myriad. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties.\n\nOne of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece. \n\nAnother primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is by definition a generalist.     \n\nFull-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra.  \n  \nIn performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated. They will bow and receive applause on behalf of the orchestra before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, he or she will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.\nQuestion:\nTraditionally, the leader of a symphony orchestra plays what?\nAnswer:\nThe Violin (film)\nPassage:\nGarrote Wire - Deadliest Warrior Wiki - Wikia\nGarrote Wire | Deadliest Warrior Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nEdit\nThe Garrote wire is used to strangle one's opponent or cut into the neck, slicing through the carotid arteries. Because it is easily concealable, silent, and deadly, it is often used for assassinations in situations when a gun is not a suitable option. It is also possible to use a cloth garrote (such as a scarf) to choke out a target without killing them as a means of capturing them.\nTest\nEdit\nThis weapon was tested against the KGB 's Shoe Knife .

Watching him could go either way: it was either going to be fabulous, or like having lemons squeezed in your eye. It was a bit like watching your ancient grandmother having breakfast – you never knew whether she was going to find her mouth that morning. And, the evil little shit that I was, I quite liked all that.\nI had The Goon Show on tape, and I remember feeling that I had to watch these guys. Even though the show could be uncomfortable and embarrassing beyond belief, it could also be the funniest thing you'd ever heard. I don't think the Pythons would have been in existence had it not been for Milligan and the Goons.\nMilligan showed me that there are no limits. He changed the way that people thought about comedy. I was brought up going to the theatre and seeing safe jokes about a woman's knickers. I could hardly believe that the BBC had given Milligan a job.\nHe refused to fit it, and I liked that as well, because he just didn't give a toss. When Prince Charles said that Milligan was his favourite comic, the comedian went on the Parkinson show and called the prince a \"little grovelling bastard\" on live TV . That's a massive part of his appeal, but even bigger than that was the fact Milligan made you laugh so much that you had to leave the room because it was getting ridiculous. I can't remember anyone else doing that at the time or since.\nI met Milligan when he was much, much older on the set of Gormenghast, which we were both in. I was over the moon about meeting him – I was going to push Spike Milligan around in a wheelchair. I thought it would be great. But it wasn't, it was just incredibly sad.

After months of isolation (and fighting off \"nasty bushwackin' animals\"), the local witch doctor takes pity on the lad and informs him \"if you want you boomerang to come back/well, first you've got to throw it!\" He does, and proceeds to bring down an airplane, which crashes with a loud boom. \"Oh, my Gawd,\" the lad says in horror, \"I've hit The Flying Doctor!\" The lad and the witch doctor argue over payment (\"you still owe me fourteen chickens!\") as the record fades out.\n\nThe record was produced by George Martin, who went on to even more enduring fame by producing the Beatles.  Martin used studio tricks to approximate the sound of Aborigine instruments.\n\nControversy\n\n\"My Boomerang\" is not exactly a paragon of political correctness, even by 1961 standards. In the song, an Aboriginal meeting is described as a \"pow-wow\", something more appropriate for Native Americans, while their chanting sounds more African than Aboriginal. Oddly, many of the Aboriginal speakers in the song have either American or British accents. Most of all, Drake raised eyebrows with the chorus: \"I've waved the thing all over the place/practiced till I was black in the face/I'm a big disgrace to the Aborigine race/My boomerang won't come back!\"\nAfter the BBC refused to play the tune (despite its popularity in record shops), a new version was recorded, substituting \"blue in the face\"; this version (on Parlophone Records) entered the UK charts in October and eventually peaked at #14.\n\nNorth American versions\n\nUnited Artists released the record in America, and, not wanting to deal with complaints like the ones in Britain, issued a 45-only version that not only featured the line \"blue in the face\" but was considerably shorter than the UK version (which was 3:32), clocking in at 2:44. (The middle part was tightened up and the entire final bit about \"The Flying Doctor\" was excised, assuming American audiences would be unfamiliar with this service; after the sound of the flying boomerang, the song goes back into the chorus and fades out.) The US version first hit the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1962 and peaked at #21 (a rare pre-Beatles hit for a British artist in the US), for what would be Drake's only American chart appearance. (Oddly, yet another version turned up on an American LP release, which was the same length as the US 45 but again contained the line \"black in the face\".)\n\nThe record also did well in Canada, reaching #3 there. [http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9391]\n\nAustralian version\n\nDespite its less-than-flattering treatment of the Aboriginals, Aussie record-buyers apparently had no problem with the original, \"black in the face\" version; musicologist David Kent has calculated it reached #1 there in December 1962. (A copy of the record has even been archived by Music Australia.) [http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an26148790]\n\nABC ban\n\nIn 2015, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation banned the song, after a listener complained that it was racist.\nThe ABC apologised after its Hobart-based Weekends radio program played the song by request from a listener in September 2015. The broadcaster said it has removed the track completely from its system and taken steps to ensure “this would not happen again”. The ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs Department released a statement that the error was due to staff not being familiar with the track’s lyrics,”.\nQuestion:\nWhich comedy actor had a novelty hit with My Boomerang Won't Come Back?\nAnswer:\nCharles Springall\nPassage:\nAmaretto\nAmaretto (Italian for \"a little bitter\") is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy. Various commercial brands are made from a base of apricot pits, almonds, or both. \n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses, can be drunk by itself, and is added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks, as well as to coffee.\n\nOrigin\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning \"bitter\", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the  bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness is not unpalatable, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products.  Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as \"a little bitter\".\n\nConflation of amaro (\"bitter\") and amore (\"love\") has led to associations with romance.  \n\nOne should not confuse amaretto with amaro, a different family of Italian liqueurs that, while also sweetened, have a stronger bitter flavour deriving from herbs.\n\nLegend\n\nDespite the known history on the introduction and acceptance of almonds into Italian cuisine, newer takes on the meanings and origins have been popularized by the two major brands. Though of sometimes questionable factuality, these tales hold a sentimental place in Saronno culture: \n\nIn 1525, a Saronno church commissioned artist Bernardino Luini, one of Leonardo da Vinci's pupils, to paint their sanctuary with frescoes. As the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Luini needed to depict the Madonna, but was in need of a model. He found his inspiration in a young widowed innkeeper, who became his model and (in most versions) lover. Out of gratitude and affection, the woman wished to give him a gift. Her simple means did not permit much, so she steeped apricot kernels in brandy and presented the resulting concoction to a touched Luini.  \n\nBrands\n\nDisaronno Originale\n\nDisaronno Originale (28% abv) has a characteristic bittersweet almond taste (although it contains no almonds or nuts) and is known for its distinctive appearance. Disaronno has been in commercial production since about 1900. It claims its \"originale\" amaretto's \"secret formula\" is unchanged from 1525,  and claims the Luini tale as its own particular history. Its production remains in Saronno, but the product is sold worldwide.\n\nThe company describes its amaretto as an infusion of \"apricot kernel oil\" with \"absolute alcohol, burnt sugar, and the pure essence of seventeen selected herbs and fruits\". The amber liqueur is presented in a rectangular glass decanter designed by a  craftsman from Murano.\n\nThe product was originally named \"Amaretto di Saronno Originale\" (Original Amaretto from Saronno). It subsequently changed to \"Amaretto Disaronno\", transforming the origin of the product into a more distinctive brand name. Finally, it changed once more to \"Disaronno Originale\"; it has not marketed itself as an \"amaretto\" since 2001.\n\nAccording to the Disaronno website, their amaretto contains no almonds, and is nut-free. Therefore, it is safe for people with nut or related allergies.\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto\n\nLazzaroni Amaretto (24% abv), produced by [https://www.chiostrodisaronno.it/en/c/4-about-us Paolo Lazzaroni & Figli S.p.A.], also presents itself as the first such liqueur. It is based on an infusion of Amaretti di Saronno (macaroons), a process which imparts a \"delicate almond/apricot flavour\". Lazzaroni claim the tale of the young couple blessed by the bishop as the origin of their generations-guarded family recipe, dating it to 1718; the amaretto has been in production since 1851. \n\nOther brands\n\nMany distillers  produce their own brand of amaretto. Among them are Bols, DeKuyper, Hiram Walker, Luxardo,  Mr. Boston,  Paramount, and Phillips.\n\nUsage\n\nAmaretto serves a variety of culinary uses.\n\nCooking\n\n* Amaretto is added to desserts, including ice cream, which enhances the flavour of the dessert with almonds and complements chocolate. Tiramisu, a popular Italian cake, is often flavoured with either real amaretto or alcohol-free amaretto aroma.\n* Savoury recipes which call for it usually focus on meat, such as chicken.\n* A few shots of amaretto can be added to pancake batter for a richer flavour.\n* Amaretto is often added to almondine sauce for fish and vegetables.\n*Amaretto is often added to whipped cream.\n\nBeverages\n\nAmaretto may be served neat (by itself) or on ice. It is often added to other beverages to create several popular mixed drinks. It is also a popular choice of liqueur to add to coffee in the morning.\n\nThe following cocktails highlight Amaretto liqueur as a primary ingredient.\n* French Connection.

The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. 3 Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5 Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”\n6 So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever! 7 The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den. 8 Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” 9 So King Darius put the decree in writing.\n10 Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. 11 Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. 12 So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”\nThe king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”\n13 Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.” 14 When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.\n15 Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”\n16 So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”\n17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed. 18 Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.\n19 At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. 20 When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”\n21 Daniel answered, “May the king live forever! 22 My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.”\n23 The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.\n24 At the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n25 Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth:\n“May you prosper greatly!\n26 “I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.\n“For he is the living God\n    and he endures forever;\nhis kingdom will not be destroyed,\n    his dominion will never end.\n27 He rescues and he saves;\n    he performs signs and wonders\n    in the heavens and on the earth.\nHe has rescued Daniel\n    from the power of the lions.”\n28 So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus[ b ] the Persian.\nFootnotes:\nQuestion:\nIn the Bible who put Daniel in the lions den?\nAnswer:\nKing Darius\nPassage:\nJohn Brunning\nJohn Brunning (born 1954) is an English musician, radio presenter and composer.  He is best known for his regular broadcasts on Classic FM. \n\nBrunning was born in Essex.  He learned guitar and played for a time with the successful band Mungo Jerry.  In 1986 he began broadcasting on local radio.   He joined Classic FM at around the time it began broadcasting in 1992.  He is married with two children.\n\nBrunning's 2006 composition, Pie Jesu, was first recorded by the vocal group All Angels, and has since been recorded by several other artistes including the King's Singers (2010). The Pie Jesu is one of seven movements that together form the oratorio 'Amazing Day' and another piece from this work, his setting of Ave Maria, was recorded by the Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins (2011). He has also composed several pieces for guitar, and Sahara and Romance No.1 (2010) have been recorded by both XueFei Yang and Craig Ogden. Ogden gave the first performance of 'Concerto Magna Carta' for guitar and small orchestra in 2015, and has since recorded the slow movement from it. \n\nAlbums\n\n*Amazing Day\nQuestion:\nOn which national radio station would you listen to Jane Jones, Jamie Crick and John Brunning?\nAnswer:\nCLASSIC FM\nPassage:\nDrill (fabric)\nDrill is stout durable cotton fabric with a strong bias (diagonal) in the weave.  It can be used unbleached, although it is more often bleached or dyed.\n\nUse in clothing\n\nLight weight drill is used in clothing items such as shirts, safari jackets, blouses, and sports clothing.  The heavier weights were often used in corsets,  and are commonly used in work clothing and uniforms.\n\nThe most common use of drill in uniforms and casual wear is in the form of khaki. See:Khaki drill. Usually taken to be a sandy or tan colour, the word comes from the Hindustani \"khak\", meaning the color of dust; a term that became current in mid-19th century India. In the late 1840s native regiments raised for frontier service in the newly conquered Punjab were supplied with 'drab' coloured uniforms to make them \"invisible in a land of dust.\" Learning from this practice, British troops took to dyeing their white drill uniforms to obtain more serviceable campaign clothing; a practice that became widespread during the crisis of the Indian Mutiny. Initially, improvised dyes produced clothing that range in shade from lavender grey to earth brown, although all were referred to as 'khaki.' In the mid-1880s standardised cotton drill uniforms were produced using a colourfast mineral dye of the shade now recognised universally as  khaki. The fabric soon became a popular material for military uniforms, and, in the United States following World War II, as veterans returned to college campuses, it became popular in casual dress as well. \n\nHeavy cotton drill is widely used for making cooks' uniforms (chefs' wear) because it is thick enough to protect the wearer from heat.\n\nOther uses\n\nDrill is a versatile fabric that has been used in a variety of applications. Boat sail drill is a lightweight, unbleached drill used to make sails for sailing craft.   Although duck (canvas) was more commonly used for these purposes,  drill has also been used to make tarpaulins, tents, awnings and canopies,   but the use of both fabrics has been supplanted in modern times with synthetic fabrics. Like duck, drill is used as a covering for furniture and cushions.\nQuestion:\nDrill, Poplin and Velour are all types of what?\nAnswer:\nFabrically\nPassage:\nThe Story of My Life (biography)\nThe Story of My Life, first published in 1903, is Helen Keller's autobiography detailing her early life, especially her experiences with Anne Sullivan.  Portions of it were adapted by William Gibson for a 1957 Playhouse 90 production, a 1959 Broadway play, a 1962 Hollywood feature film, and the Indian film \"Black\", which was directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali ft. Amitabh Bachchan instead of Anne Sullivan.  The book is dedicated to inventor Alexander Graham Bell. The dedication reads, \"To ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL Who has taught the deaf to speak and enabled the listening ear to hear speech from the Atlantic to the Rockies, I dedicate this Story of My Life.\"\n\nPublication history\n\nKeller first began to write The Story of My Life in 1902, when she was still a student at Radcliffe's College. It was first published in the Ladies Home Journal in the same year as a series of installments. The following year, it was published by Doubleday, Page & Co. as a book.

The work is based on photographs of Dr. Naismith and the YMCA gymnasium where he invented the basketball the winter of 1891. Renowned artist / sculptor Michael Roche, who specializes in highly detailed collectibles, created the sculpture, which bears the inscription: “In Recognition of the Invention of Basketball and a Life Lived with Honor” and a copy of the 13 rules he placed on the bulletin board etched on the back of award. Roche’s work includes some of the most prestigious clients, sports figures and unique artwork for any awards including, “gunslingers” golfers” and movie characters like Wizard of Oz and sports figures like, Old Tom Morris, Newt Rockne and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe.\nWhen presenting the award, we require being included in a current event within the recipient’s organization or town, or a special event built around the presentation itself. The award is financed by the local businesses and organizations who partner in promoting the recipient.\nThe “Mid-Size” Naismith Legacy Award stands about 14” high, weighs about 10 pounds and is used to honor top volunteers, coaches, officials, donors or sponsors of your organization. Most awards are funded by the organization or a local sponsor who wants to be affiliated with such a prestigious award. We have the award qualification form and nomination form for you to use in the selection process. For example, we have had great success in using this as a “Coach of the Year” award in local high schools and as a year-end award for the coaches in the whole county presented at the year-end banquet. It also works well as a “Volunteer / Sponsor / Donor Appreciation” award.\nWhat is the Doc Naismith Award?\nThe Doc Naismith Award recipients exemplify the core values the Dr. Naismith lived by and we honor like: respect, teamwork, sportsmanship, honesty, servant hood, integrity and excellence. The award is the “Naismith figure” part of the Naismith Legacy Award and stands about 8” high. The focus of this award honors players, volunteers or coaches. We have the award qualification form and nomination form for you to use in the selection process. \nEvents\nQuestion:\nThe Naismith Award is presented in which sport?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nYou Lucky People\nYou Lucky People is a 1955 British comedy film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Tommy Trinder, Mary Parker and Dora Bryan.  Originally titled Get Fell In, the film was renamed to match Trinder's familiar catchphrase. It was shot in a rival French process to CinemaScope, called 'CameraScope', with the attendant publicity describing \"the first feature to be made with an anamorphic lens in black and white! It's a camerascoop!\". \n\nPlot\n\nAn intake of civilian reservists arrive at army camp to do their two weeks refresher training.\n\nPartial cast\n\n* Tommy Trinder as Tommy Smart\n* Mary Parker as Private Sally Briggs\n* Dora Bryan as Sergeant Hortense Tipp\n* R.S.M.

It is a type of rice wine similar to sake, but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content.  The sugar content is a complex carbohydrate formed naturally via the fermentation process; it is not refined sugar. The alcohol content is further lowered when the liquid is heated.\n\nThere are three general types of mirin. The first is hon mirin (literally: true mirin),  which contains approximately 14% alcohol and is  produced by a forty- to sixty-day mashing (saccharification) process.   The second is shio mirin, which contains alcohol as low as 1.5% to avoid alcohol tax.  The third is shin mirin (literally: new mirin),  or mirin-fu chomiryo (literally: mirin-like seasoning), which contains less than 1% alcohol yet retains the same flavor.\n\nIn the Edo period, mirin was consumed as Amazake.  Otoso, traditionally consumed on Shōgatsu, can be made by soaking a spice mixture in mirin. \n\nIn the Kansai style of cooking, mirin is briefly boiled before using, to allow some of the alcohol to evaporate, while in the Kantō regional style, the mirin is used untreated. Kansai-style boiled mirin is called nikiri mirin ()  (literally: thoroughly boiled mirin).\n\nMirin is used to add a bright touch to grilled (broiled) fish or to erase the fishy smell. A small amount is often used instead of sugar and soy sauce. It should not be used in excess, however, as its flavor is quite strong. It is sometimes used to accompany sushi. Mirin is used in teriyaki sauce. \n\nNovember 30 has been designated the Day of hon-mirin by the mirin industry because in Japanese wordplay the date words sound like '11' (, good) and '30' (, mirin).\nQuestion:\nMirin is a type of wine used for flavouring the cuisine of which country?\nAnswer:\n日本國\n", "answers": ["Basketball", "Basketball gear", "Bball", "Boy's Basketball", "B Ball", "Shoot hoops", "Basketball parity worldwide", "Men's Basketball", "High school basketball", "Basketball Worldwide", "Basketball club", "B-ball", "Basket-ball", "Basketball team", "🏀", "Basketball rim", "Basketballer", "Rim (basketball)", "Basket ball", "Basketball net", "Baksetball", "Basketball player", "Basket-Ball", "Women's hoops", "Men's basketball", "BasketBall", "Basketball Parity Worldwide", "Basket Ball", "Baketball", "Basketball Player", "B ball", "Unicycle basketball"], "length": 1113, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "260be5617540bc6a8bd8ac0fc2a4f4348ec654423451d530"}

The origin is believed to be in a letter written in 1764 by Samuel Adams, as quoted in History of the United States, by George  Bancroft, Volume 5, page 195 (1857), in which Adams wrote \"Boston might become a Christian Sparta.\"\nAlso, in 1819, William Tudor wrote a letter describing the town: \"[Boston] is perhaps the most perfect and certainly the best-regulated democracy that ever existed. There is something so impossible in the immortal fame of Athens, that the very name makes everything modern shrink from comparison; but since the  days of that glorious city I know of none that has approached so near in some points, distant as it may still be from that illustrious model.\"\nAristides the Just\nOn the western slope of Beacon Hill, at Louisburg Square, is a statue of Ancient Greek general and statesman Aristides the Just (530?-468 BC). Aristides led the army in a great victory over the Persians at the Battle of Plataea (479). In 478, he  was a prominent leader in the formation of the confederacy of Greek city-states known as the Delian League. The Aristides statue on Beacon Hill was a significant symbol of the Athens of America alias, and also of 1850s Brahmin culture.\nLouisburg Square is collectively owned by a group of wealthy Boston residents. Joseph Iasigi, of Greek descent and one of the owners of the square, received approval in 1852 and installed the statue of Aristides. The square also hosts a statue of  Christopher Columbus, installed about the same time, located at the opposite end as Aristides. In the early 1900s, a club of engineering and technology students resided at a building in the square, and Aristides became known as  Uncle Louisburg or just  Uncle Louie by the younger generations.\nMany of the quaint row houses and streets on Beacon Hill resemble parts of old London. This was of course, by design. According to the book Some Statues of Boston (1946), by State Street Trust Company, a former resident recalled that the Edison  Company had at one time taken photographs of Louisburg Square, and thus avoided the need to travel to London to take photographs.\nEdinburgh in Scotland was also known as a Modern Athens at about the same time Boston was espousing its similarity with the ancient Greek city.\nQuestion:\n\"Which city of the USA is known as \"\"The Athens of America\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nCity of Boston\nPassage:\nCharacter (computing)\nIn computer and machine-based telecommunications terminology, a character is a unit of information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme, grapheme-like unit, or symbol, such as in an alphabet or syllabary in the written form of a natural language. \n\nExamples of characters include letters, numerical digits, common punctuation marks (such as \".\" or \"-\"), and whitespace. The concept also includes control characters, which do not correspond to symbols in a particular natural language, but rather to other bits of information used to process text in one or more languages. Examples of control characters include carriage return or tab, as well as instructions to printers or other devices that display or otherwise process text.\n\nCharacters are typically combined into strings.\n\nCharacter encoding \n\nComputers and communication equipment represent characters using a character encoding that assigns each character to something — an integer quantity represented by a sequence of digits, typically — that can be stored or transmitted through a network. Two examples of usual encodings are ASCII and the UTF-8 encoding for Unicode.  While most character encodings map characters to numbers and/or bit sequences, Morse code instead represents characters using a series of electrical impulses of varying length.\n\nTerminology \n\nHistorically, the term character has been widely used by industry professionals to refer to an encoded character, often as defined by the programming language or API. Likewise, character set has been widely used to refer to a specific repertoire of characters that have been mapped to specific bit sequences or numerical codes.  The term glyph is used to describe a particular visual appearance of a character. Many computer fonts consist of glyphs that are indexed by the numerical code of the corresponding character.\n\nWith the advent and widespread acceptance of Unicode and bit-agnostic coded character sets, a character is increasingly being seen as a unit of information, independent of any particular visual manifestation.  The ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) International Standard defines character, or abstract character as \"a member of a set of elements used for the organisation, control, or representation of data\". Unicode's definition supplements this with explanatory notes that encourage the reader to differentiate between characters, graphemes, and glyphs, among other things. Such differentiation is an instance of the wider theme of the separation of presentation and content.\n\nFor example, the Hebrew letter aleph (\"א\") is often used by mathematicians to denote certain kinds of infinity, but it is also used in ordinary Hebrew text. In Unicode, these two uses are considered different characters, and have two different Unicode numerical identifiers (\"code points\"), though they may be rendered identically. Conversely, the Chinese logogram for water (\"水\") may have a slightly different appearance in Japanese texts than it does in Chinese texts, and local typefaces may reflect this. But nonetheless in Unicode they are considered the same character, and share the same code point.\n\nThe Unicode standard also differentiates between these abstract characters and coded characters or encoded characters that have been paired with numeric codes that facilitate their representation in computers.\n\nCombining character\n\nThe combining character is also addressed by Unicode. For instance, Unicode allocates a code point to each of i, [\"](combining trema)  and ï (U+00ef). This makes it possible to code the middle character of the word naïve both as a single code point 'ï' or as a combination of the character i with diacritic (\") (U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I + U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS).\n\nBoth are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode standard.\n\nchar \n\nA char in the C programming language is a data type with the size of exactly one byte,  which in turn is defined to be large enough to contain any member of the “basic execution character set” and (in newer C standards) UTF-8 code units  which implies a minimum size of 8 bits. The exact number of bits can be checked via CHAR_BIT macro. By far the most common size is 8 bits, and the POSIX standard requires it to be 8 bits. \n\nSince Unicode requires at least 21 bits to store a single code point, it is usually impossible to store one inside a single char; instead a variable-length encoding such as UTF-8 must be used. Unfortunately, the fact that a character was historically stored in a single byte led to the two terms being used interchangeably in most documentation. This often makes the documentation confusing or misleading when multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 are used, and has led to inefficient and incorrect implementations of string manipulation functions. Modern POSIX documentation attempts to fix this, defining “character” as a sequence of one or more bytes representing a single graphic symbol or control code, and attempts to use “byte” when referring to char data.  However it defines Character Array as an array of elements of type char. \n\nUnicode can also be stored in strings made up of code units that are larger than char. These are called “wide characters”. The original C type was called wchar_t. Due to some platforms defining wchar_t as 16 bits and others defining it as 32 bits, recent versions have added char16_t, char32_t. Even then the objects being stored might not be characters, for instance the variable-length UTF-16 is often stored in arrays of char16_t.\n\nOther languages also have a char type. Some such as C++ use 8 bits like C. Others such as Java use 16 bits for char, in order to represent UTF-16 values.\n\nWord character \n\nA \"word\" character has special meaning in some aspects of computing. A \"word character\" within ASCII typically means a letter of the alphabet A-Z (upper or lower case), the digits 0 to 9, and the underscore. See also the [:word:] regular expression character class\n\nIt might be dependent on localization and encoding in use. If $ or | are not a word character, 'é' (in French) or 'æ' or 'я' (in Russian) or 'ά' (in Greek) are, as used in words such as fédération, Αγορά, or Примечания.\nQuestion:\nThe characters 11 in the binary numeral system equate to what number?\nAnswer:\n3\nPassage:\nBarwick Green\n\"Barwick Green\" is the theme music to the long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers. It is a \"maypole dance\" from the suite My Native Heath, written in 1924 by the Yorkshire composer Arthur Wood, and named after Barwick-in-Elmet in Yorkshire's West Riding. \n\nThe recording used between 1950 and the 1990s was played by Sidney Torch and his orchestra. Sidney Torch recorded a commercial release of \"Barwick Green\" in the 1950s, but it was not used on The Archers itself.\n\nThe familiar opening 7 notes are echoed in the pizzicato in Benjamin Britten's Simple Symphony, written in 1934.  \n\nThe Sunday omnibus broadcast of The Archers starts with a more rustic, accordion-arranged rendition by The Yetties.

Hanbury's other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4's Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don't mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn. Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791. Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow. The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats. It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.  At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.  After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks. \nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.  Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThrush (bird)\nThrushes make up the Turdidae, a family of passerine birds that occurs worldwide.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThrushes are plump, soft-plumaged, small to medium-sized birds, inhabiting wooded areas, and often feed on the ground. The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and . However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The great thrush is similar in length, but less heavily built.  Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.\n\nThey are insectivorous, but most species also eat worms, land snails, and fruit. Many species are permanently resident in warm climates, while others migrate to higher latitudes during summer, often over considerable distances.\n\nThrushes build cup-shaped nests, sometimes lining them with mud. They lay two to five speckled eggs, sometimes laying two or more clutches per year. Both parents help in raising the young.\n\nThe songs of some species, including members of the genera Catharus, Myadestes, Sialia and Turdus, are considered to be among the most beautiful in the avian world.  \n\nEcology\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds of plants, contributing to the dispersal of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.\n\nPlants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.\n\nMany bats and birds rely heavily on fruits for their diet, including birds in the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Rhamphastidae. While eating fruit, these animals swallow seeds and then later regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such ornithochory has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers.\n\nOther seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of this sort. The Turdidae  have a great ecological importance because some populations migrate long distances and disperse the seeds of endangered plant species at new sites, helping to eliminate inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity of local flora.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally, the Turdidae included the small Old World species, like the nightingale and European robin in the subfamily Saxicolinae, but most authorities now place this group in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.\n\nThe family formerly included more species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera Myophonus, Alethe, Brachypteryx and Monticola were included in Turdidae. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in these four genera are more closely related to species in the family Muscicapidae. As a consequence, these four genera are now placed in Muscicapidae. In contrast, the genus Cochoa which had previously been placed in Muscicapidae was shown to belong in Turdidae.\n\nGenera\n\nFAMILY: TURDIDAE\n* Genus Neocossyphus: rufous thrushes (four species) – related to Myadestes\n* Genus Geokichla: (21 species)\n* Genus Zoothera: Asian thrushes (some 15 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Ixoreus: varied thrush – related to other New World genera\n* Genus Ridgwayia: Aztec thrush – related to Hylocichla\n* Genus Cataponera: Sulawesi thrush\n\n* Genus Grandala: grandala\n* Genus Sialia: bluebirds (three species)\n* Genus Myadestes: solitaires (10–11 living species, two or three recently extinct, includes formerly recognized genus Phaeornis)\n* Genus Cichlopsis: rufous-brown solitaire – related to Catharus\n* Genus Catharus: typical American thrushes and nightingale-thrushes (12 species)\n* Genus Hylocichla: wood thrush\n* Genus Entomodestes: solitaires (2 species) – related to Catharus\n* Genus Turdus: true thrushes (some 65 species, one recently extinct)\n* Genus Cochoa: cochoas (four species)\n* Genus Chlamydochaera: fruithunter\n\n* Genus Platycichla: (two species) – part of a South American group within Turdus\n* Genus Nesocichla: Tristan thrush or starchy – part of a South American group within Turdus\n\n* Genus Cichlherminia: forest thrush – genus paraphyletic with Turdus\n\n* Genus Psophocichla: groundscraper thrush\n\nNow usually considered a distinct family distantly related to Picathartes:\n\n* Genus Chaetops: rock-jumpers (two species)\n\nFor other species previously in the Turdidae, see Muscicapidae and chats.\nQuestion:\nIf a bird is described as 'Turdoid', to which family does it belong?\nAnswer:\nMan from uncle\nPassage:\nMarcus Chamat\nMarcus Chamat (pronounced shuh-mat) (born 6 May 1975, in Borlange, Sweden) is a professional eight-ball and nine-ball pool player.

It is the British equivalent of the American Oscars and Australian AACTA Awards. As of 2008, it has taken place in Central London at the Royal Opera House, the latter having taken over from the flagship Odeon cinema on Leicester Square. The 69th British Academy Film Awards was held on 14 February 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) was founded in 1947 as The British Film Academy, by David Lean, Alexander Korda, Carol Reed, Charles Laughton, Roger Manvell and others. In 1958, the Academy merged with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form The Society of Film and Television, which eventually became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.\n\nBAFTA stated charitable purpose is to \"support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public\". In addition to high profile awards ceremonies BAFTA runs a year-round programme of educational events including film screenings and tribute evenings. BAFTA is supported by a membership of about 6,000 people from the film, television and video game industries.\n\nThe Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, which was commissioned by the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.\n\nAnnual ceremony\n\nThe ceremony previously took place in April or May and since 2002 it takes place in February in order to precede the Oscars. The awards are mostly open to all nationalities, though there is an award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Producer or Director. Only UK films are eligible for the categories of The British Short Film and British Short Animation awards.\n\nThe Awards ceremony is delayed broadcast on British television the same evening (usually BBC One), and across the world. It has been broadcast in colour since 1970.\n\nLocation\n\nFrom 2000 to 2007 the ceremonies took place at the flagship Odeon cinema on Leicester Square. , the ceremonies take place at the Royal Opera House.\n\nSponsorship\n\nUntil 2012, the mobile network Orange sponsored the awards and  Orange's parent company, EE, began sponsorship.\n\nAwards categories (competitive)\n\nRetired awards\n\n* BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles (awarded 1952–1984)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay (awarded 1969–1983)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay (awarded 1955–1968)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Actor (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Actress (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA United Nations Award (:fr:United Nations Awards) (awarded 1949–1976).\n\nOther awards (non-competitive)\n\n* BAFTA Fellowship (since 1971)\n* The Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award (known as the Michael Balcon Award from 1979 to 2006) \n\nIn memoriam section\n\nDuring the ceremony, BAFTA pauses to pay tribute to those in the industry who died over the previous twelve months, with a montage of images accompanied by music.\n\nCeremonies\nQuestion:\nWhat award is the equivalent of the Oscars for British industries involved in film, television, video games and forms of animation?\nAnswer:\nBritish academy of film and television arts\nPassage:\nPascal (unit)\nThe pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. It is defined as one newton per square metre.  It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal.\n\nCommon multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa 100 Pa) which is equal to one millibar, the kilopascal (1 kPa \n 1000 Pa), the megapascal (1 MPa 1,000,000 Pa), and the gigapascal (1 GPa \n 1,000,000,000 Pa).\n\nThe unit of measurement called standard atmosphere (atm) is defined as 101.325 kPa and approximates to the average pressure at sea-level at the lattitude 45° N.  Meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in hectopascals. \n\nEtymology \n\nThe unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and experiments with a barometer. The name pascal was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971. \n\nDefinition \n\nThe pascal can be expressed using SI derived units, or alternatively solely SI base units, as:\n{\\rm 1~Pa 1~\\frac{N}{m^2} \n 1~\\frac{kg}{m \\cdot s^2}}\nwhere N is the newton, m is the metre, kg is the kilogram, and s is the second. \n\nOne pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre.\n\nMiscellaneous \n\nThe unit of measurement called atmosphere or standard atmosphere (atm) is 101325 Pa.  This value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards, such as ISO 2787 (pneumatic tools and compressors), ISO 2533 (aerospace) and ISO 5024 (petroleum). In contrast, IUPAC recommends the use of 100 kPa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances. \n\nThe Unicode computer character set has dedicated symbols  and  in the CJK Compatibility block, but these exist for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated.  \n\nUses \n\nThe pascal (Pa) or kilopascal (kPa) as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch (psi) unit, except in some countries that still use the Imperial measurement system, including the United States.\n\nGeophysicists use the gigapascal (GPa) in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the Earth.\n\nMedical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, and often displays the Young's modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals.\n\nIn materials science and engineering, the pascal measures the stiffness, tensile strength and compressive strength of materials. In engineering use, because the pascal represents a very small quantity, the megapascal (MPa) is the preferred unit for these uses.\n\nThe pascal is also equivalent to the SI unit of energy density, J/m3. This applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases, but also to the energy density of electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields.\n\nIn measurements of sound pressure, or loudness of sound, one pascal is equal to 94 decibels SPL.  The quietest sound a human can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is 0 dB SPL, or 20 µPa.\n\nThe airtightness of buildings is measured at 50 Pa. \n\nHectopascal and millibar units\n\nThe units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar, which was close to the average air pressure on Earth, and the millibar. Since the introduction of SI units, meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals (hPa) unit, equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar.        Exceptions include Canada and Portugal, which use kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, the SI is preferred, which means Pa with a prefix (in multiples of 1000) is preferred.  \n\nMany countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation altimeter settings. In practically all other fields, the kilopascal (1000 pascals) is used instead.\nQuestion:\nWhich internationally recognised non-SI unit of pressure is equal to 101,325 Pascals?\nAnswer:\nAtmosfer\nPassage:\nOxo Tower\nThe Oxo Tower is a building with a prominent tower on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The building has mixed use as Oxo Tower Wharf containing a set of design, arts and crafts shops on the ground and first floors with two galleries, Bargehouse and gallery@oxo. The OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie is on the eighth floor, which is the roof-top level with fine and casual dining. In addition to this, situated on the eighth floor is a viewing gallery open to the public. The third to seventh floors contain 78 flats owned by Redwood Housing (1995). Much of the second floor can be hired out for events and weddings.\n\nLocation \n\nOxo Tower Wharf is in the east of London's South Bank cultural area in the London Borough of Southwark. A continuous riverside walkway passes in front of the building, and links it with other riverside attractions such as the Festival Hall, the National Theatre, the Tate Modern and the Globe Theatre.\n\nThe building is flanked to the west by Bernie Spain Gardens and Gabriel's Wharf, and to the east by Sea Containers House. When viewing the tower, there are only a few places in which it can be seen. These include the Observation Point, the adjacent riverside walkway, the green at the back of the tower, and the two piers stood in front of the tower.\n\nHistory \n\nThe building was originally constructed as a power station to supply electricity to the Royal Mail post office, built towards the end of the 19th century (official date unknown). It was subsequently acquired by the Liebig Extract of Meat Company in the 1920s (official date unknown) manufacturers of Oxo beef stock cubes, for conversion into a cold store.\n\nThe building was largely rebuilt to an Art Deco design by company architect Albert Moore between 1928 and 1929. Much of the original power station was demolished, but the river facing facade was retained and extended. Liebig wanted to include a tower featuring illuminated signs advertising the name of their product. When permission for the advertisements was refused, the tower was built with four sets of three vertically-aligned windows, each of which \"coincidentally\" happened to be in the shapes of a circle, a cross and a circle. This was significant because Skyline advertising at the time was banned along Southbank. \nDespite these windows being the building’s architectural focal point, the tower is not accessible by the general public. Granted access is only given to those who maintain the tower, such as electricians.\n\nLiebig and the building were eventually purchased by the Vestey Group.  For a long time the building was left derelict until the late 1970s and early 1980s where there were several proposals to demolish the building and develop it and the adjacent Coin Street site, but these were met with strong local opposition and two planning inquiries were held. Although permission for redevelopment was granted, the support of the Greater London Council (GLC) finally resulted in the tower and adjoining land being sold to the GLC in 1984 for £2.7m—who sold the entire 13 acre site to the non-profit Coin Street Community Builders for just £750,000.\n\nIn the 1990s the tower was refurbished to a design by Lifschutz Davidson to include housing, a restaurant, shops and exhibition space. The tower won the Royal Fine Art Commission/BSkyB Building of the Year Award for Urban Regeneration in 1997, the RIBA Award for Architecture also in 1997, the Brick Development Association Award 1997,\nCivic Trust Award 1998 and The Waterfront Center USA Honor Award 2000.  It includes hireable space and floors devoted to occupation. Regardless of the tower’s historical significance and multiple awards, it is yet to be classed as a listed building.

CSCB has reconstructed the surrounding 13 acres into co-operative homes, shops, galleries, restaurants, cafes and bars; a park and riverside walkway; sports facilities; by organising festivals and events; and by providing childcare, family support, learning, and enterprise support programmes. Income is generated from a variety of sources including the hire of retail and catering spaces, event spaces, meeting room spaces and conference venue spaces as well as the provision of consultancy services. \n\ngallery@oxo\n\nThe gallery located at the bottom of the Oxo Tower Wharf is known for its photography, contemporary design, architecture and issue-based exhibitions. \n\nRestaurant\n\nThe Oxo Tower is also famous for Harvey Nichols' very first restaurant. The tower's popular Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie opened in September 1996.\nQuestion:\nThe OXO Tower is a landmark in which European city?\nAnswer:\nLondon (UK)\nPassage:\nBlue Cross (animal charity)\nBlue Cross is a registered animal welfare charity  in the United Kingdom, founded in 1897 as Our Dumb Friends League.  The charity provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership.\n\nThe charity works closely with a number of other organizations to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\n\nHistory\n\nThe organisation was founded on 10 May 1897 in London as Our Dumb Friends League, to care for working horses on the streets of the British capital.  It opened its first animal hospital, in Victoria, London, on 15 May 1906.\n\nIn 1912, the league launched The Blue Cross Fund to care for horses during the Balkan War. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, it was quickly reopened again. By the armistice in 1918, the Blue Cross Fund had raised nearly £170,000 – the equivalent of almost £6.5 million today – to care for the animals of conflict. Over 50,000 horses were treated in Blue Cross hospitals in France, and the charity had sent vital veterinary supplies to 3,500 units of the British Army. \n\nDonations to the Fund enabled the charity to care for more than 350,000 animals during the Second World War, many of who were wounded during the Blitz. \nThe name of the appeal fund became more widely known than the official charity title and the league officially changed its name to \"The Blue Cross\" in 1950. In 2011 the charity dropped \"The\" from its name and is now simply known as \"Blue Cross.\"\n\nSally de la Bedoyere became the charity’s CEO in November 2014. \n\nOperations\n\nBlue Cross operates a number of services throughout the United Kingdom.  Its major services are: rehoming unwanted animals, providing veterinary services to pet owners who cannot afford the private fees charged by private veterinary surgeons, promoting animal welfare through education, and operating the Pet Bereavement Support Service, a free and confidential support line for those who have lost a pet.  They also operate a horse ambulance service, including at large equestrian events.\n\nBlue Cross operates four animal hospitals, three of which are in London, at Victoria, Merton and Hammersmith, and a fourth in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, as well as running mobile clinics throughout the country. In 2014 it opened a pet care clinic in Derby.   Blue Cross carried out over 97,000 treatments, operations and diagnostic investigations in 2010.\n\nBlue Cross is also heavily involved in animal adoption, arranging adoption for companion animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits and small rodents, as well as larger species such as horses.   In 2013, the charity rehomed 8,191 animals. \n\nThe organisation also works to improve the lives of animals through promotion to pet owners and work in animal behaviour therapy. Every pet owner that rehomes a pet through the charity can benefit from free behaviour advice for the pet’s lifetime. The Pet Bereavement Support Service is available 365 days a year to help people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a pet.\n\nProposed closure of two animal centres\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Blue Cross announced the proposed closure of the two animal adoption centres (Felixstowe and Northiam, East Sussex), both of which had been in existence for over 50 years. Final decisions on both sites were announced on 4 May 2010. After an extensive publicity campaign by locals, it was announced that plans to close the Felixstowe centre had been dropped.  The centre will relocate to a brand new site near Ipswich. Work on the purpose-built rehoming centre is due to begin in 2014. \n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Irish Blue Cross is a related party of Blue Cross.\n\nAwards\n\nMedals have been awarded by Blue Cross to animals and people who have demonstrated bravery or heroism. While the first medals were awarded to people who helped to rescue animals, medals were awarded in 1918 to honour a number of horses which had served in the First World War. Medals were then given out between 1940 and 1951 to a number of dogs, including Juliana who reportedly extinguished an incendiary bomb by urinating on it. In 2006 Jake, a police explosives dog, was given the honour after helping to clear out the London Underground after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nQuestion:\n\"Founded in 1897, which animal welfare charity was formerly known As \"\"Our Dumb Friends League\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBlue Cross (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nHorse Colours - Equestrian and Horse\nHorse Colours\nHorse Colours\nHorses can come in a variety of different colours.\nBay\nA brown horse with a black mane and tail:\nLight Bay\nLight bay has a light brown coat with a black mane and tail.\nDark Bay\nDark bay has a darker brown coat with a black mane and tail.\nBlack\nBlack coat, mane and tail colouring.\nBrown\nBrown mane, tail and coat colouring.\nBuckskin\nBlack mane, tail and points with a dun, golden or cream coat colour\nChestnut\nHorses with light or dark red coat colouring similar to that of the nut of the chestut tree are said to be chesnut:\nLiver Chestnut\nLiver Chestnut       is a deep orange colour, covering the mane, tail and coat.\nChestnut\nChestnut is a lighter colour than the liver covering the mane, tail and coat.\nSorrel\nSorrel is more red in colour than the Chestnut.\nGrey\nThe horse will have white body, mane and tail with categories including:\nFlea Bitten Grey\nFlea Bitten grey is a white horse with dark flecks throughout the coat.\nIron Grey\nIron grey is a very dark type of grey covering the mane, tail and coat.\nCremellis\nCremellis a cream coloured horse with blue eyes.\nAlbino\nAlbino      is a white horse with pink skin with pink eyes\nDappled Grey\nDappled grey      is a white horse with dark grey circular patches that give a dappled effect.\nPalomino\nA light golden colour.

In the play Frank has no surname, but when the film was made he became Dr. Frank Bryant.\n\nSusan (who initially calls herself Rita), dissatisfied with the routine of her work and social life, seeks inner growth by signing up for and attending an Open University course in English Literature. The play opens as 'Rita' meets her tutor, Frank, for the first time. Frank is a middle-aged, alcoholic career academic who has taken on the tutorship to pay for his drink. The two have an immediate and profound effect on one another; Frank is impressed by Susan's verve and earnestness and is forced to re-examine his attitudes and position in life; Susan finds Frank's tutelage opens doors to a bohemian lifestyle and a new self-confidence. However, Frank's bitterness and cynicism return as he notices Susan beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. Susan becomes disillusioned by a friend's attempted suicide and realises that her new social niche is rife with the same dishonesty and superficiality she had previously sought to escape. The play ends as Frank, sent to Australia on a sabbatical, welcomes the possibilities of the change.\n\nThemes\n\nThe play deals with the concept of freedom, change, England's class system, the shortcomings of institutional education, and the nature of self-development and of personal relationships. The play borrows from the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion, itself based upon archetypes from Greek myth.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nThe play was adapted by Russell for a 1983 film with Michael Caine and Julie Walters, directed by Lewis Gilbert.\n\nRadio adaptation\n\nThe play was adapted by Russell for radio in 2009 – see Educating Rita (radio play). It starred Bill Nighy and Laura Dos Santos directed by Kirsty Williams, and was a 90 minute play broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Boxing Day 2009. \n\nRevivals\n\nFrom 26 March-8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio performance on stage as Rita alongside Larry Lamb as Frank. This was the production's first London West End revival.\nThis production transferred to the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End from 8 July-30 October 2010, produced by Sonia Friedman. Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio and Menier Chocolate Factory performance as Rita, and Frank was played by renowned actor Tim Pigott-Smith. Like the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, the production ran in repertory alongside Shirley Valentine starring Meera Syal. A UK tour played in 2012, starring Claire Sweeney and Matthew Kelly as Rita and Frank respectively. A 35th anniversary production was staged at Liverpool Playhouse from 6th February to 7th March 2015, starring Leanne Best as Rita and Con O'Neill as Frank, directed by Gemma Bodinetz.\n\nInfluence\n\nGeoffrey Sampson explains the title of his 1997 book, Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate, as a deliberate allusion to Educating Rita.\nQuestion:\nWhich British playwright wrote Educating Rita, Blood Brothers and Shirley Valentine?\nAnswer:\nBreezeblock Park\n", "answers": ["Wonderbra.", "Wonder-bra", "The Wonderbra", "WonderBra", "Wonderbra", "The Wonder-Bra", "Wonder Bra", "Wonderbra Women"], "length": 3960, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f0ce383eafdaab798f51122c0e4119d19a725fc6c5654169"}

A school with mind, heart, guts and a constant fizz.\"\nGood Schools Guide 2016\nWhen you make your first visit to Wellington College you immediately get a sense that it is more than just a school. The beautiful grounds and breath-taking buildings see to that, as does the palpable sense of purpose among every pupil and member of staff you meet. I genuinely do not believe that there is a better coeducational boarding and day school for 13 – 18 year olds in the land.\nThe College, founded in 1853 as a living memorial to the Duke of Wellington, sought to deliver an inspirational education for all of its pupils. As the school grew, so too did the identity of those pupils. It is an identity built on intellectual curiosity, on true independence, on a generous and far-reaching inclusivity and on the courage to be properly and unselfishly individual. It is, in short, the capacity to be inspired to become the very best you can be. And it is these qualities that are present in the thousands of small interactions that happen all the time here, the little daily miracles that make this such a special place. After all, the school we build is the school we build together, and every pupil who passes through Wellington leaves an indelible mark on our community. It is my absolute responsibility to help all our pupils become the very best that they can be, and to develop the identity that marks them out as a true Wellingtonian.\nWellington College is set in 400 acres of beautiful parkland in leafy Berkshire, one hour from Central London and just 40 minutes from Heathrow. Please do explore our on-line tour to get a sense of the scope and size of the school, for our campus is quite simply stunning. Wellington’s curriculum is vibrant, demanding and progressive, and with our ground-breaking Wellbeing course and classes in Philosophy and Thinking, Wellington has become nationally renowned as a centre for curriculum development. Our stunning examination results and university outcomes speak for themselves.\nCreativity flourishes and it was no surprise when the Arts Council awarded us Artsmark Gold in recognition of the outstanding provision and standards across all the Arts at the school. We have a “premier league” reputation as one of the best schools for sport in the UK and, in recent years, our teams have achieved national renown and titles in hockey, rugby, golf, shooting, triathlon, squash, equestrianism, cricket, rackets and polo. Outward-facing in all that we do, the College’s focus on service, leadership and character education means that Wellingtonians leave the school fully prepared for the challenges of adult life in the 21st Century.\nRT @WillGreenwood: Mia!!! Awesomeness!!! http://EPg3ox7z9g\n@Welly_Master | 18 January 2017\nChoice lies at the heart of our co-curriculum and is central to developing the Wellington Identity which ensures that all our pupils are Inspired, Intellectual, Independent, Individual and Inclusive. Our pupils and our staff see every day as an opportunity, a chance to grow and a chance to learn and the journey as a life-long learner begins the moment a child starts at Wellington.\nWill you let your child join us on that journey? It could be the most inspired choice you ever make.\nJulian Thomas – 14th Master of Wellington College\nQuestion:\nIn which county is Wellington College?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTagus\nThe Tagus (; ; ; Ancient Greek: Τάγος Tagos) is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula.  It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.\n\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank.  The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nCourse\n\nIn Spain\n\nThe first notable city on the Tagus is Sacedón. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama,  Henares, Algodor and Tajuña.  Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River.  Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche.  At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdecañas, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Tiétar, and the lower reservoir, the Alcántara Dam into which flows the Alagón at the lower end.\n\nThere is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.\n\nIn Portugal\n\nAfter forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de Ródão, Abrantes, Constância, Entroncamento, Santarém and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.\n\nThe Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from além Tejo \"Beyond the Tagus\" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying \"Upper Tagus\".\n\nGeology\n\nThe lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. \n\nHistory\n\nThe Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. \n\nPopular culture\n\nA major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: \n\"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village...\" \n\nRichard Crashaw's poem \"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\" refers to the \"Golden\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).\nQuestion:\nThrough which European capital city does the River Tagus flow?\nAnswer:\nCapital of Portugal\nPassage:\nExpert tips on cutting your own hair - NY Daily News\nExpert tips on cutting your own hair - NY Daily News\nIf you're tempted to cut your own hair, be sure to follow our experts' tips\nExpert tips on cutting your own hair\nIf you’re not careful when you cut your own hair, you could run into problems.\n(VladimirFLoyd/Getty Images/iStockphoto)\nNEW YORK DAILY NEWS\nSunday, July 13, 2014, 2:00 AM\nDame Helen Mirren hacks at her own hair — something many New York women have been tempted to do, especially during hot, humid months.\nAnd it almost always ends in disaster.\n“I can’t handle going to the hairdresser every six weeks, so I only go about once a year,” Mirren, 68, tells the August issue of Redbook magazine. “In between, I get out the scissors and do something, usually rather disastrously.\n“Sometimes I’ll even chop my hair the morning of a big red carpet event.”\nIf you’re a woman, chances are you’ve done the same at at some point in your life — often resulting in tears and a swift trip to the hairdresser for a fix-up.\n“I thought I could pull it off,” says Linda Charles, from the Bronx. “It was like a bad buzz cut from the Army. I went into hiding. I would never do it again.”\nKatherine White, 22, of the Upper East Side, cuts her own hair often. “It was at college and I didn’t want to spend money,” she says. “Sometimes it’s a little screwy in the back.”\nDon’t expect perfection\" “People can cut their own hair as long as the end goal isn’t a perfect, crisp, polished look.\"\nYou get what you pay for.\nBut with summer here, some gals just want to get their hair out of their face as soon as possible, and can’t always wait for a salon appointment.\nIf you’re going to chop your own locks, follow these tips from the experts.\n-----\nDon’t wet your hair: Cut it while it’s dry. Most stylists agree.\nHelen Mirren says she sometimes resorts to cutting her own hair, even before red-carpet events.\n(Jason Merritt/Getty Images)\nUse tiny scissors: Forget about professional haircutting shears. “Use something like cuticle scissors or baby nail-trimming shears, with very small blades,” says Donna Williams, stylist at Tomahawk Salon in Bushwick. “You don’t want a professional scissor — that blade is too long to control what you’re doing.”\nBe realistic: Don’t expect perfection. “People can cut their own hair as long as the end goal isn’t a perfect, crisp, polished look,” says Michael Angelo, founder of Michael Angelo’s Wonderland Beauty Parlor in the West Village.\nDon’t cut while tipsy: You’ll need steady hands and good judgment. Angelo, who’s done his share of fix-ups, says many disasters occur when the self-stylist has had a few glasses of wine. “We should always do things like this when we’re stone-cold sober,” he says.\nCut only what you can see : Don’t try to use a mirror for trimming the back. “Never,” says Donna Williams of Tomahawk Salon in Bushwick. “If you can’t pull the hair around and look at those ends, then don’t try to cut it.”\nKeep your style. “Don’t try to re-do a haircut,” or invent a new one at home, Williams says. “You don’t ever want to take on layers yourself.” Basic maintenance is what you’re looking for.\nDo the twist: Beauty blogger Nuccia Ardagna did a YouTube tutorial on trimming split ends yourself. The technique involves tightly coiling dry one-inch sections of hair around your own index finger. Any ends that pop up when you’re done twisting are split ends — trim them off.\nWhen you trim your own hair, experts says it’s best to do it with small scissors, when you’re sober, and when the hair is dry.\n(Goodshoot/Getty Images)\n-----\nTRIMMING YOUR BANGS\nAim high: For cutting bangs, point the end of the scissors towards the ceiling, not straight across, for a softer look, says Angelo.\nPull it together: With dry hair, “Pull your bangs down, then twist them all together, and then you cut it — the whole section,” says Jessica Ruby Whalen, stylist at Fringe on the Lower East Side.\nJust the basics: If you want to do something “really specialized” — like supershort baby bangs, or a blunt cut — don’t try this at home, advises Williams.\n- with Jenna O’Donnell\nQuestion:\nAn autotonsorialist is a person who cuts their own what?\nAnswer:\nHair bud\nPassage:\nTrident\nA trident is a three-pronged spear. It is used for spear fishing and historically as a polearm.  \nThe trident is the weapon of Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea in classical mythology. In Hindu mythology it is the weapon of Shiva, known as \ntrishula (Sanskrit for \"triple-spear\").\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word \"trident\" comes from the French word trident, which in turn comes from the Latin word tridens or tridentis: tri \"three\" and dentes \"teeth\". \nSanskrit trishula is  compound of tri त्रि \"three\"\"\".\n\nThe Greek equivalent is τρίαινα (tríaina), from Proto-Greek trianja (threefold).\n\nUses\n\n In Greek, Roman, and Hindu mythology, the trident is said to have the power of control over the ocean.\n\nFishing\n\nTridents for fishing usually have barbed tines which trap the speared fish firmly.  In the Southern and Midwestern United States, gigging is used for harvesting suckers, bullfrogs, flounder, and many species of rough fish. \n\nCombat\n\nThe trident, known as dangpa, is featured as a weapon in the 17th- to 18th-century systems of Korean martial arts.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, in a parody of fishing, tridents were famously used by a type of gladiator called a retiarius or \"net fighter\". The retiarius was traditionally pitted against a secutor, and cast a net to wrap his adversary and then used the trident to kill him. \n\nSymbolism/Mythology\n\nIn Hindu legends and stories Shiva, a Hindu God who holds a trident in his hand, uses this sacred weapon to fight off negativity in the form of evil villains. The trident is also said to represent three gunas mentioned in Indian vedic philosophy namely sāttvika, rājasika and tāmasika.  \n\nIn Greek myth, Poseidon used his trident to create water sources in Greece and the horse.  Poseidon, as well as being god of the sea, was also known as the \"Earth Shaker\" because when he struck the earth in anger he caused mighty earthquakes and he used his trident to stir up tidal waves, tsunamis and sea storms. Parallel to its fishing origins, the trident is associated with Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology, the Roman god Neptune.\n\nIn Roman myth, Neptune also used a trident to create new bodies of water and cause earthquakes. A good example can be seen in Gian Bernini's Neptune and Triton.\n\nIn religious Taoism, the trident represents the Taoist Trinity, the Three Pure Ones. In Taoist rituals, a trident bell is used to invite the presence of deities and summon spirits, as the trident signifies the highest authority of Heaven.\n\nThe trishula of the Hindu god Shiva.\nA weapon of South-East Asian (particularly Thai) depiction of Hanuman, a character of Ramayana.\n\nA fork Jewish priests (Kohanim) used to take their portions of offerings. \n\nThe glyph or sigil of the planet Neptune in astronomy and astrology.\n\nPolitical\n* The  Tryzub in the Coat of Arms of Ukraine, adopted 1918 (in a reinterpretation of a medieval emblem which most likely depicted a falcon) \n*The national emblem on the flag of Barbados.\n*The \"forks of the people's anger\", adopted by the Russian anti-Soviet revolutionary organization, National Alliance of Russian Solidarists (NTS).\n*Britannia, the personification of Great Britain.\n\nCivilian use\n*The symbol for Washington and Lee University.\n*The symbol (since June 2008) for the athletic teams (Tritons) at the University of Missouri–St. Louis.\n*Sparky the Sun Devil, the mascot of Arizona State University, holds a trident.

NGPS is owned and operated by ON Power.  \n\nPlans for utilizing the Nesjavellir area for geothermal power and water heating began in 1947, when some boreholes were drilled to evaluate the area's potential for power generation. Research continued from 1965 to 1986. In 1987, the construction of the plant began, and the cornerstone was laid in May 1990. The station produces approximately 120 MW of electrical power; it also delivers around 1100 l of hot water (82-85 °C) per second, servicing the space heating and hot water needs of the Capital Region.\nQuestion:\nThe Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station is in which country?\nAnswer:\nIJsland\nPassage:\nList of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies\nThere are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom, each electing a single Member of Parliament to the House of Commons at least every five years.  Voting last took place in 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 7 May 2015. 330 are held by the Conservative Party, 229 are held by the Labour Party, 54 are held by the Scottish National Party, 8 are held by the Liberal Democrats, 3 are held by Plaid Cymru, 1 is held by UKIP, 1 is held by the Green Party of England and Wales, 5 are independents and there are 18 Northern Ireland seats held by different parties.  In addition there is the constituency of the Speaker.\n\nThe number of seats rose from 646 at the 2005 general election after proposals made by the Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were adopted through statutory instruments.      Constituencies in Scotland remained unchanged, with the Boundary Commission for Scotland having completed a review shortly prior to the 2005 general election.\n\nPrimary legislation provides for the independence of the Boundary Commissions for each of the four parts of the UK, the number of seats for each of the countries, permissible factors to use in departing from any old boundaries and a strong duty to consult.  For the 2013 review this is primarily the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011.

Plenary sessions are typically scheduled both near the start of a conference, and in the latter half, but not typically at the final hour, due to many attendees leaving before the last day. Various prominent speakers often give opening plenary speeches, at the start of a conference, or closing plenary speeches, in the final plenary session.

It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on “shaking palsy” a disease whose cause is still unknown.\n1. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.\n2. The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2\n3. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.  The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.\n4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson’s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.\nA. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as “pill rolling” because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.\nB. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.\nC. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.\n5.   Genetic factors associated with Parkinson’s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures\nto chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson’s disease.\n6.  Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient’s functional ability.\n7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson’s disease because malnutrition and constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow\nthemselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.\n8. Parkinson’s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Each patient must be evaluated to determine which medication is best for them. Some drug classes\ninclude; Dopamine Agonists, Anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors and Carbidopa/Levodopa. Levodopa is the most effective and is being used in 70 to 80 percent of all Parkinson’s patients.\n9.  Parkinson’s disease can be treated surgically through deep brain stimulation (DBS). This involves placing an electrode in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus and connecting it to a generator placed in the upper chest. The device delivers a specific current to the brain to improve motor function. This procedure is reversible if needed.\n10. Parkinson’s disease interesting opinions: Adolf Hitler is said to have had the disease, people who smoke and drink are less likely to develop the disease, and Japan is the only country in the world that has more women than men with Parkinson’s disease.\nReferences\nPDF founder William Black.

It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations.\n\nCAFOD was founded in 1962. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities; and promote social justice in witness to Christian faith and gospel values. It is also involved in short-term relief. It is a sponsor of the new [http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford.\n\nCAFOD is an agency of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and part of the Caritas International Federation which operates in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. CAFOD is a member of the DEC Disasters Emergency Committee and the British Overseas Aid Group. In 2010/11 it raised £69 million and employed 369 staff.\n\nHistory\n\nCAFOD was born when volunteer members of the National Board of Catholic Women organised the first Family Fast Day on Friday, March 11, 1960. In 1962 CAFOD was officially registered as a public charity. In 1965 CAFOD became a member of Caritas Internationalis and in 1969 joined the CIDSE, a collection of European and North American Catholic Charities. In 1979 its first campaign was launched in the Philippines and they kept growing. Caritas in 1987 asked CAFOD to lead and lobby for a worldwide programme on HIV and Aids. In 1993 its first international office was formed in CAFOD Albania. In 1998 offices were formed in Zimbabwe and Kenya and one year later its Kosovo Appeal raised £8 million. In 2005 the MakePovertyHistory rally in Edinburgh was attended by 249000 people and in 2012, on the same year as the Queens Diamond Jubilee, CAFOD celebrated its 50th Anniversary.\n\nInternational programmes\n\nCAFOD has offices in Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa & Goma), Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe. CAFOD also has staff based with partners in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.\nQuestion:\nIn the abbrevation CAFOD - for what does the 'O' stand?\nAnswer:\nOverseas\nPassage:\nWitch-hazel\nWitch-hazels (Hamamelis,)  are a genus of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae, with four species in North America  (H. mexicana,  H. ovalis,  H. virginiana and H. vernalis), and one each in Japan (H. japonica) and China (H. mollis). The North American species are occasionally called winterbloom. http://www.witchhazel.com/about.htm Dickinson's Witch Hazel, commercially available witch hazel-based products\n\nGrowth\n\nThe witch-hazels are deciduous shrubs or (rarely) small trees growing to 3 – tall, rarely to 12 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, oval, 4 – long and 3 – broad, with a smooth or wavy margin.  The genus name, Hamamelis, means \"together with fruit\", referring to the simultaneous occurrence of flowers with the maturing fruit from the previous year.  H. virginiana blooms in September-November while the other species bloom from January-March. Each flower has four slender strap-shaped petals 1 – long, pale to dark yellow, orange, or red. The fruit is a two-part capsule 1 cm long, containing a single 5 mm glossy black seed in each of the two parts; the capsule splits explosively at maturity in the autumn about 8 months after flowering, ejecting the seeds with sufficient force to fly for distances of up to 10 m, thus another alternative name \"Snapping Hazel\".\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Witch in witch-hazel has its origins in Middle English wiche, from the Old English wice, meaning \"pliant\" or \"bendable\".  \"Witch hazel\" was used in England as a synonym for Wych Elm, Ulmus glabra;  American colonists simply extended the familiar name to the new shrub. The use of the twigs as divining rods, just as hazel twigs were used in England, may also have, by folk etymology, influenced the \"witch\" part of the name.\n\nGenera\n\nThe Persian ironwood, a closely related tree formerly treated as Hamamelis persica, is now given a genus of its own, as Parrotia persica, as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are Parrotiopsis, Fothergilla, and Sycopsis (see under Hamamelidaceae). Witch-hazels are not closely related to the true Corylus hazels, though they have a few superficially similar characteristics which may cause one to believe that they are.\n\nCultivation and uses\n\nThey are popular ornamental plants, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers which begin to expand in the autumn as or slightly before the leaves fall, and continue throughout the winter.\n\nGarden shrubs\n\nHamamelis virginiana was introduced into English gardens by Peter Collinson, who maintained correspondence with plant hunters in the American colonies. Nowadays, it is rarely seen in the nursery trade except for woodland/wildlife restoration projects and native plant enthusiasts. Much more common is H. mollis, which has bright red flowers that bloom in late winter instead of the yellow blossoms of H. virginiana which tend to be lost among the plant's fall foliage. The plant-hunter Charles Maries collected for Veitch Nurseries in the Chinese district of Jiujiang in 1879. It languished in nursery rows for years until it was noticed, propagated and put on the market in 1902. \nNumerous cultivars have been selected for use as garden shrubs, many of them derived from the hybrid H. × intermedia Rehder (H. japonica × H. mollis). Jelena and Robert de Belder of Arboretum Kalmthout, selecting for red cultivars, found three: the first, with bronze flowers, was named 'Jelena'; the next, with red flowers, was named 'Diane' (the name of their daughter); the last, with deep red flowers, was called 'Livia' (the name of their granddaughter).\n\nMedicinal uses\n\nThe leaves and bark of the North American Witch-hazel Hamamelis virginiana may be used to produce an astringent,  also referred to as witch hazel, and is used medicinally. This plant extract was widely used for medicinal purposes by Native Americans and is a component of a variety of commercial healthcare products.\n\nIt is mainly used externally on sores, bruises, and swelling. Witch hazel hydrosol is used in skin care. It is a strong anti-oxidant and astringent. It is often used as a natural remedy for psoriasis, eczema, aftershave applications, ingrown nails, to prevent sweating of the face, cracked or blistered skin, for treating insect bites, poison ivy, and as a treatment for varicose veins and hemorrhoids.  It is found in numerous over-the-counter hemorrhoid preparations.Michael C. Bingham, [http://www.conntact.com/archive_index/archive_pages/3210_Business_New_Haven.html Which Witch Is Witch Hazel (and Which Dickinson Makes It)?], Connecticut Business Journal, 20 October 1997. It is recommended to women to reduce swelling and soothe wounds resulting from childbirth. \n\nEcology\n\nHamamelis species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including feathered thorn.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Hamamelis flowers.jpg|Hamamelis sp. flowers, Menai Bridge, Wales\nImage:Hamamelis Flower.jpg|Hamamelis in Fürth City Park (Germany), 2004-02-08\nImage:Colonial Park Arboretum and Gardens - Hamamelis.jpg|Hamamelis in the Colonial Park Arboretum and Gardens\nImage:Hamamelis Japonica x Mollis.JPG|Hamamelis ×intermedia (H. japonica × H. mollis)\nImage:Hamamelis japonica0.jpg|Hamamelis japonicaclose-up flowers\nImage:Hamamelis Jelena flowers2.jpg|Hamamelis ×intermedia 'Jelena'\nImage:Hamamelis 'Diane' flowers 002.JPG|Hamamelis ×intermedia 'Diane'\nImage:Hamamelis molis JPG1Aa.jpg|Hamamelis mollis tree in autumn\nImage:Hamamelis molis JPG1Fua.jpg|Hamamelis mollis in autumn\nImage:Hamamelis molis JPG1Fub.jpg|Hamamelis mollis leaves in autumn\nImage:Zaubernuss Witch-hazel Hamamelis - Winterblueher Winter-flowering.jpg|Winter-flowering in the Vogelsberg Mountains\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat is the old common name for Hamamelis or Winterbloom and its extract, used for skin/bruises/acne treatment (and dowsing)?\nAnswer:\nWitch Hazel\nPassage:\nWillie John McBride\nWilliam James McBride, MBE, better known as Willie John McBride (born 6 June 1940) is a former rugby union footballer who played as a lock for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. He played 63 Tests for Ireland including eleven as captain, and toured with the Lions five times — a record that gave him 17 Lions Test caps. He also captained the most successful ever Lions side which toured South Africa in 1974.\n\nYouth\n\nMcBride was born at Toomebridge, County Antrim.  Owing to his father's death when he was five years old, he spent most of his spare time helping out on his family farm.  Because of this he did not start playing rugby until he was 17. He was educated at Ballymena Academy and played for the school's First XV. After he left he joined \nBallymena R.F.C..\n\nPlaying career\n\nIn 1962 was selected to play for Ireland. His  first Test on 10 February 1962 was against England at Twickenham. Later that year he was selected to tour South Africa with the British and Irish Lions.\n\nMcBride continued to play for Ireland throughout the 1960s and played for Ireland when they first defeated South Africa (the Springboks) in 1965, and when Ireland defeated Australia in Sydney — the first time a Home Nations team had defeated a major southern hemisphere team in their own country. He was again selected for the Lions in 1966, this time touring New Zealand and Australia. He toured South Africa with the Lions again in 1968.\n\nHe was selected to play for the Lions in their 1971 tour of New Zealand. Despite being criticized by some as being \"over the hill\", McBride was made pack leader and helped the Lions to a Test series win over New Zealand; their first and last series win over New Zealand. He received an MBE in 1971 for services to rugby football.\n\n1974 Lions tour to South Africa\n\nMcBride's outstanding leadership qualities led to his appointment as captain of the British and Irish Lions in their 1974 tour to South Africa. The Test series was won 3-0, with one match drawn — the first Lions series ever won in South Africa. It was one of the most controversial and physical Test match series ever played. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, and so decided to match fire with fire.  Willie John McBride instigated a policy of \"one in, all in\" - that is, when one Lion retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok. \n\nAt that time there were only substitutions if a doctor agreed that a player was physically unable to continue and there were no video cameras and sideline officials to keep the punching, kicking, and head butting to a minimum. If the South Africans were to resort to foul play then the Lions decided \"to get their retaliation in first.\" The signal for this was to call \"99\" (a shortened version of the emergency number in the United Kingdom — 999). This was a signal for the Lions to clobber their nearest rival players.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn 1975 as his international career was ending he played his last game for Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The game was against France and near the end of the match, he scored his first Test try for Ireland. It was the crowning moment of a great playing career. His last international game was against Wales on Saturday 15 March 1975.  \n\nAfter retiring from playing the game, McBride coached the Irish team and was manager of the 1983 Lions tour to New Zealand. Despite the test results being mainly poor, team camaraderie was high and some good wins were recorded in other games. In 1997 he was an inaugural inductee into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He lives in Ballyclare. He has been asked to present Test jerseys and give motivational speeches to Lions players prior to matches. In 2004 he was named in Rugby World magazine as \"Rugby Personality of the Century\". He is a major supporter of the Wooden Spoon Society. \n\nHe is remembered by members and supporters of Stockport Rugby Club for attending the Glengarth Sevens with a lion cub from Longleat, helping to raise money for the charity and adding to the atmosphere and help upkeep the reputation of sevens rugby at Stockport.\nQuestion:\nWillie John McBride is a name associated with which sport?\nAnswer:\nRugby union footballer\nPassage:\nJapan economy slips back into recession in July-Sept, blow ...\nJapan economy slips back into recession in July-Sept, blow to Abenomics | The Indian Express\nJapan economy slips back into recession in July-Sept, blow to Abenomics\nJapan economy slips back into recession in July-Sept, blow to Abenomics\nThe world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 0.8 percent in July-September, more than a median market forecast for a 0.2 percent contraction, government data showed on Monday.\nBy: Reuters | Tokyo |\nPublished:November 16, 2015 8:39 am\nThe world’s third-largest economy shrank an annualised 0.8 percent in July-September, more than a median market forecast for a 0.2 percent contraction, government data showed on Monday. (Source: Reuters)\nJapan’s economy slid back into recession in July-September as uncertainty over the overseas outlook hurt business investment, keeping policymakers under pressure to deploy new stimulus measures to support a fragile recovery.\nA rebound in private consumption and exports offered some hope the world’s third-largest economy is emerging from the doldrums, despite slowing Chinese demand and the pain households are feeling from rising imported food prices.\nStill, many analysts expect the economy to grow only moderately in the current quarter as companies remain hesitant to use their record profits for wage hikes, underscoring the challenges premier Shinzo Abe faces in pulling Japan sustainably out of stagnation with his “Abenomics” stimulus policies.\nShare This Article\nJapan out of recession,outlook shaky\n“A big drop in inventory was the largest factor behind a third-quarter contraction. Weak capital spending was a concern, but excluding these factors, the GDP figures were not so bad,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\nThe world’s third-largest economy shrank an annualised 0.8 percent in July-September, more than a median market forecast for a 0.2 percent contraction, government data showed on Monday.\nThat followed a revised 0.7 percent contraction in April-June, which was the first decline in three quarters.\nJapan thus slipped back into technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, after suffering one last year due to the hit on consumer spending from a sales tax hike in April 2014.\nThe data may affect debate among policymakers on how much fiscal spending should be earmarked in a supplementary budget that is expected to be compiled this fiscal year.\nThe government maintained a cautiously upbeat view, saying that despite some weaknesses, the economy continues to recover moderately on improvements in job and income conditions.\n“While there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of various (stimulus) steps taken so far,” Economics Minister Akira Amari said in a statement after the data was released.\nCapital expenditure fell 1.3 percent, more than a median market forecast of a 0.4 percent decrease to mark a second straight quarter of declines, on sluggish investment by automakers and machinery manufacturers.\nBut private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), rose 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, roughly in line with a median market forecast.\nWhile domestic demand shaved 0.3 percentage point off GDP, external demand added 0.1 point to growth, the data showed.\nThe weak data would be of little surprise to many Bank of Japan officials, who had largely factored in the recession and expect growth to rebound in coming quarters as consumption and factory output show signs of a pick-up.\nWhile the data will be closely scrutinised by the policymakers, the BOJ is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady at its rate review this week, analysts say.\n“China’s economic slowdown did not have a big impact on Japan’s Q3 GDP, but we could see a negative impact in the following quarters,” said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n“The government does not have to respond right away, but economic stimulus could become more likely if things do not get better.”\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich nation slipped back into technical recession in mid-November 2014?\nAnswer:\n日本國\n", "answers": ["Notable sufferers of parkinson's disease", "Symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Signs of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons", "Pakinson's Disease", "Parkinson's", "Parkinsonism, primary", "Parkinston's disease", "Shaking Palsy", "Hypokinetic rigid syndrome", "Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson's disease and Diet", "Morbus Parkinson", "Motor symptoms parkinson's disease", "Parkinsonians", "Antiparkinsonism", "Shaking palsy", "Parkinson’s", "Neuropsychiatric symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Epidemiology of parkinson's disease", "History of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s Disease", "Parkinsons' disease", "Diagnosis of parkinson's disease", "Prognosis of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson disease", "Parkinsons Disease", "Traumatic Parkinson's", "Parkinson's disease research directions", "Parkinson's Disease", "Causes of parkinson's disease", "Research directions in parkinson's disease", "Parkinston’s disease", "Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s disease", "Pathophysiology of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons' Disease", "Classification of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons disease", "Parkinsonian tremor", "Research directions of parkinson's disease", "Paralysis agitans", "Parkinsonian tremors", "Genetic causes of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson facies"], "length": 3440, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e7c62cf25d5d1da0eea6a08b1e4d8a78b9d0f5d6e29fae00"}

Like Super-Cannes that followed it, it deals with the idea of dystopian resort communities which maintain their seemingly perfect balance via a number of dark secrets.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe story's protagonist, Charles Prentice, ventures to Estrella de Mar in order to rescue his jailed brother, Frank who has been arrested for instigating an arson attack which killed 5 people.   Upon arriving and talking with his sibling, Charles finds to his horror that his brother has confessed to everything, and has no interest in trying to escape his plea.  In a matter of days, Charles becomes immersed in the strange world of Estrella de Mar, learning more of her dark secrets, and spending less time worrying about his brother.

Althaea chinensis Wall., Althaea ficifolia Cav., Althaea rosea Cav.) is an ornamental plant in the Malvaceae family.\n\nIt was imported into western Europe from southwestern Asia and the Balkans during, or possibly before, the 15th century. William Turner, a herbalist of the time, gave it the name  \"holyoke\" from which the English name derives.\n\nCultivation\n\nAlcea rosea is variously described as a biennial (having a two-year life cycle), as an annual, or as a short-lived perennial.  It frequently self-sows, which may create a perception that the plants are perennial. The plant may flower during its first year when sown early.  It will grow in a wide range of soils, and can easily reach a height of about 8 ft.  \n\nThe flowers are a range of colours from white to dark red, including pink, yellow and orange.  Different colours prefer different soils. The darker red variety seems to favour sandy soils, while the lighter colour seems to favour clay soils.  The plants are easily grown from seed, and readily self-seed.  However, tender plants, whether young from seed or from old stock, may be wiped out by slugs and snails. The foliage is subject to attack from rust (Puccinia malvacearum), which may be treated with fungicides. Commercial growers have reported that some closely related species (Alcea rugosa and Alcea ficifolia) are resistant to this fungus. \n\nHerbalism\n\nIn herbal medicine, Hollyhock is believed to be an emollient and laxative. It is used to control inflammation, to stop bedwetting and as a mouthwash in cases of bleeding gums. \n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\n‘Alcea rosea’ is the Latin name for which common garden flower?\nAnswer:\nAlcea\nPassage:\nHoosegow & Pokey « The Word Detective\nHoosegow & Pokey « The Word Detective\nHoosegow & Pokey\nLemme outta here.\nDear Word Detective:  Where did the words “hoos-cow” and “pokey” originate as slang for jail? — Siobhan Taaffe.\nOh boy, jail.  Also known as the slammer.  The tank. The big house.  The  clink.  The joint.  The Graybar Hotel.  The cooler. Stir. Inside.  Gosh,  you’d never guess that the US has the highest per capita incarceration  rate in the world, would you?  So it’s not very surprising that we have  so many slang synonyms for “correctional institution.”  By the way,  every time I hear the euphemism “correctional institution,” I picture a  training school for proofreaders, which is ironic because I once worked  with two proofreaders who were eventually dragged away by the FBI for  insider trading.\nMuch as I like the spelling “hoos-cow” (“Hoos cow is that in the  cafeteria?”), the standard form of the word is “hoosegow” (although  there are more than a thousand Google hits for “hooscow,” so that may  change).  “Hoosegow” is a souvenir of our close connection to Mexico, a  modified form of the Mexican Spanish word “juzgado,” meaning “jail.”   The original meaning of “juzgado,” interestingly, was “tribunal” or “court,” and the word is derived from the Latin “judicare,” meaning “to  judge” (and from which our “judge” and “judgment” also derive).  “Hoosegow” first arose in the the western US, probably in the 19th  century, although the first occurrence of the word in print found so far  is from 1908.\n“Pokey” as slang for “jail” dates to early 20th century America and is  actually a variant form of “pogey,” a 19th century English word for “poorhouse” or “welfare hotel.”  The roots of “pogey” are largely a  mystery, but the word may be related to the adjective “poky,” an  interesting word in itself.  The original sense of “poky,” in the 18th  century, was, logically, “something that pokes,” i.e., projects or  points out (as in a “poke bonnet,” a style of the day that featured a  prominent brim).  In the 19th century, the word came to mean “cramped or  confined,” as a small room might make a resident feel “poked at” by the  walls.  Since jail cells are not known for their generous elbow room,  this is probably the connection between “poky” (cramped) and “pokey” (jail).\n“Poky” also acquired the meaning of “dull, narrow-minded and slow” here  in the US, probably from that same sense of “cramped.”  “Poky” today is  a useful little word that can be applied to anything from horses (“Plop,  plop, plopity plop… The feet of Father Ready’s poky old saddle horse  slowly ate upon the weary miles,” 1932) to computer programs (“HyperCard  is quite poky when running on a standard 1-megabyte Mac Plus, even from  a hard disk,” 1989).\nQuestion:\nWhat is also known as the clink, the big house, or the pokey?\nAnswer:\nPenitentiary system\nPassage:\nEdge (geometry)\nFor edge in graph theory, see Edge (graph theory)\nIn geometry, an edge is a particular type of line segment joining two vertices in a polygon, polyhedron, or higher-dimensional polytope.  In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary,  and is often called a side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces meet.  A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.\n\nRelation to edges in graphs\n\nIn graph theory, an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices, unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.\nHowever, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges.  Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs. \n\nNumber of edges in a polyhedron\n\nAny convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.\n\nIncidences with other faces\n\nIn a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by Balinski's theorem, at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d-dimensional convex polytope. \nSimilarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge,  while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.\n\nAlternative terminology\n\nIn the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes, a facet or side of a d-dimensional polytope is one of its (d − 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a (d − 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a (d − 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks..\nQuestion:\nHow many sides does a trapezoid have?\nAnswer:\nfour\nPassage:\nFinchley (UK Parliament constituency)\nFinchley was a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election; its best-known MP was Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. Although boundary changes meant that she never again attained her large majority of 1959, she was nonetheless returned by comfortable (9,000) majorities at General Elections throughout her premiership.\n\nThe seat was abolished in 1997 and split between the Finchley and Golders Green and Chipping Barnet constituencies.\n\nBoundaries \n\n1918-1945: The Urban Districts of Finchley and Friern Barnet.\n\n1945-1950: The Municipal Borough of Finchley, part of the Municipal Borough of Hornsey, and part of the Urban District of Friern Barnet.\n\n1950-1974: The Municipal Borough of Finchley, and the Urban District of Friern Barnet.\n\n1974-1997: The London Borough of Barnet wards of East Finchley, Finchley, Friern Barnet, St Paul's, and Woodhouse.\n\nIn 1918 the constituency was created as a county division of Middlesex, centred on the town of Finchley, which before 1918 had been located in the Hornsey constituency. In 1934 the Finchley district became a Municipal Borough.\n\nIn 1945 there was an interim redistribution of parliamentary constituencies to split those with more than 100,000 electors, prior to the general redistribution of 1950.

This toxin belongs to the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family. Ophanin weakly blocks the contraction of smooth muscles elicited by high potassium-induced depolarization, suggesting that it inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe toxin was named ophanin after the snake whose venom it is derived from, the King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).\n\nSources \n\nOphanin is produced in the venom glands of the King Cobra (O. Hannah).\n\nAlthough the venom has relatively low toxicity, this is compensated by the high amounts of it injected into the prey for each bite.\n\nChemistry \n\nStructure \n\nOphanin was successfully isolated from O. Hannah venom by gel filtration and cation-exchange chromatography. Its molecular weight is 25 kDa (from positions 19 – 239), which conforms to the molecular mass predicted from its cDNA sequences. \n\nHomology \n\nOphanin is a cysteine-rich secretory protein and therefore belongs to the CRISP family. \nThese proteins possess 16 strictly conserved cysteines and contain 8 disulfide bonds. \nTen of the 16 cysteine residues are clustered at the C-terminal end of the protein.  \nOphanin belongs to the “long” CRISPs subgroup, which consists of the 9 CRISPs with the longest sequences. Snake venom CRISPs belonging to different subgroups act on different biological targets, contributing in this way to the diversity of damaging effects of snake venoms.\n\nFamily \n\nThe phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of all known snake venom CRISPs shows that ophanin is more closely related to the Viperidae branch than the Elapidae branch even though O. Hannah belongs to the Elapidae snakes.\n\nOphanin, along with other specific snake toxins like triflin and ablomin, is also a helothermine-related venom protein (Helveprin) which was originally isolated from the skin of the Mexican beaded lizard.\n\nTarget \n\nOphanin is a weak blocker of the high potassium-induced contraction of smooth muscles. Snake venom CRISP family proteins inhibit depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction to different extents. Compared to the normal contraction of smooth muscle, ophanin is able to reduce their force of contractility to 84% ± 1%, which is less than most other CRISPs.\n \nThe differences between the inhibitory activity of CRISPs may be explained through sequence comparisons that suggest a site that may be critical for inhibition of channel activity. Phe189 and Glu186 are the most likely functional residues: strong blockers of smooth muscle contraction (ablomin, triflin, and latisemin) all have Phe189, and all blockers of smooth muscle contraction except ophanin have Glu186. The significance of this lack of the probable functional residues in ophanin has not yet been addressed. However, it is likely that the picture is more complex and other residues contribute to the inhibitory activity of CRISPs on smooth muscle contraction and some data supports this. For example pseudecin, while also having Phe189, does not affect depolarization-induced contraction.\n\nMode of action \n\nThere is no direct evidence of a particular mode of action of ophanin blocking depolarization-induced contractions of the smooth muscles. However, based on the hypothesis of Yamazaki and colleagues in regards to ablomin, another snake venom toxin from the CRISP family that also blocks depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction, we can postulate a similar mechanism might be in place for ophanin.\n\nSince ablomin only blocks contraction induced by depolarization, but not by caffeine, the effect of ablomin is likely to be caused by inhibition of voltage-gated ion channels. An activation of smooth muscle cells through caffeine activates ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, whereas an activation through high levels of extracellular potassium depolarizes the membrane (due to the change of the reversal potential for potassium towards more positive values) and would then activate voltage-gated calcium-ion channels leading to high levels of intracellular calcium ions. The intracellular calcium ion concentration correlates well with contraction force in the rat-tail artery. Thus, contraction following extracellular application of high-potassium solution depends on the influx of the extracellular calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels. Therefore ablomin (and by extension ophanin) most likely targets voltage-gated calcium channels on smooth muscle.\n\nToxicity \n\nThe  of the venom in mice is ~1.2 to 3.5 mg/kg via intravenous injection. The LD50 of ophanin is not yet known.\nQuestion:\nOphanin, piscivorin, ablomin, latisemin and triflin, cysteine-rich secretory proteins that can reduce muscle contractions, are naturally found where?\nAnswer:\nCobra Toxin\n", "answers": ["Chili Pepper", "Red Chili", "Hot peppers", "Red chile", "Red chili", "Chili (capsicum)", "Chili Peppers", "Chili pepper", "Chilli pepper", "Chillies", "Chilli (pepper)", "Chile peppers", "🌶", "Chili peppers", "Hot pepper", "Chilli", "Green chilies", "Dahon ng sili", "Red chillies", "Chilli peppers", "Chile pepper", "Chilly pepper", "Green chile", "Green chillies", "Red Chillies", "Gochoo", "Chile (capsicum)", "Green chili"], "length": 3272, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5fb15940295be04d377d24c988a6308c0f5c552a8354735f"}

It was released on 25 November in 1977 by RSO Records. The release, titled after Clapton's nickname, is to this date one of his both commercially and musically most successful studio albums. Slowhand produced the two hit singles \"Lay Down Sally\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.\n\nRecording\n\nClapton wanted to work with record producer Glyn Johns, because he thought Johns produced great work with famous groups like The Rolling Stones and The Eagles and understands how to work with both British and American musicians. While in the studio with Johns, Clapton notes that the A-list producer was very disciplined and disliked jamming, because it would kill important recording time. Although Clapton and his band were either drunk or stoned nearly all the time when recording, Johns liked Clapton's work and brought out the best in every musician, according to Clapton. \n\nTitle and artwork\n\nThe album was titled after Clapton's nickname, which was given to him by Giorgio Gomelsky. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalled that the name \"Slowhand\" seemed to be hanging on to his real name, because it seemed to be well received by both his American friends and fans who think of the wild west when hearing the nickname. The album's artwork was done by Clapton himself with the help of Pattie Boyd and Dave Stewart, credited as \"El & Nell Ink\". Besides choosing various photos for the inner side of the gramophone record packaging are two pictures, Clapton notes, which have deeper importance to him: one picture, in which he kisses Boyd and another photograph showing a demolished Ferrari 365 GT4 BB, which Clapton bought after seeing George Harrison turning up with the same model at his Hurtwood Edge Estate. The car, which has been involved with Clapton in a car accident after the British recording artist finished touring in Australia, nearly killed him.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nSlowhand was released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records.  In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, John Swenson found Clapton's playing more subtle than before but his songs sobering and interesting psychologically, especially \"Next Time You See Her\", as they showed him \"in touch with the horrible moral power and long-suffering self-righteousness that is the essence of the blues\".  Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, lamenting how most of the record's best guitar solos were played by George Terry and feeling Clapton had regressed as a singer, \"sounding like he's blown his voice. Doing what, I wonder.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the confident, virtuosic quality in the band's playing and the diversity of the songwriting made Slowhand \"rank with 461 Ocean Boulevard as Eric Clapton's best albums\". Yahoo! Music's Dave DiMartino said the record was full of hits and \"tasteful\" music.  In 2003, Slowhand was ranked number 325 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \n\nCensure in Argentina\n\nThe rock song \"Cocaine\" was censored and removed from the Argentinian edition of the album in late 1977. The military government of the time claimed that the song Clapton recorded was harmful to young people and inviting them to get high. The ban was finally lifted in 1984. Clapton felt indignation in later years after learning of censorship, since \"Cocaine\" is a song which is against drugs, and not to please as many people think. The musician once said that it is useless to intentionally write a song that goes against drugs and hope that people grasp the meaning. In \"Cocaine,\" an anti-drug perspective is communicated more effectively through an honest song whose cautionary message is apparent upon reflection.  After several years, Clapton began including the phrase 'that dirty cocaine' in live performances to highlight the anti-drug message of the song.  In addition, Clapton donated much of their funds to Crossroads Centre, a center that helps drug addicts to fight to stop drugs and rehabilitate themselves. \n\nDeluxe Edition\n\nIn November 2012, a remastered two-compact-disc 35th anniversary deluxe edition of Slowhand was released. The first disc consists of the remastered album, with additional bonus tracks and studio jam sessions. The second disc features a previously unreleased live concert, recorded in April 1977 at the Hammersmith Odeon; although the concert is of the same era as the Slowhand sessions, it was performed prior to the album's recording and release, and so does not include any of the album's tracks. \n\nTrack listings\n\nOriginal release\n\n2012 Deluxe edition\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Eric Clapton – lead vocals, guitar\n*Jamie Oldaker – drums, percussion\n*Carl Radle – bass guitar\n*Dick Sims – keyboards\n*George Terry – guitar\n\n*Mel Collins – saxophone\n*Yvonne Elliman – harmony and backing vocals\n*Marcy Levy – harmony and backing vocals, duet on 'The Core'\n*Glyn Johns – producer, engineer\n*El & Nell Ink. – Art design\n\nChart positions\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\nQuestion:\nWhich guitarist is known as Slowhand?\nAnswer:\nErick Clapton\nPassage:\nRed Lake Mine\nThe Red Lake mine is one of the largest gold mines in Canada and in the world.  The mine is located in northwestern Ontario at Red Lake. The mine has estimated reserves of 3.23 million oz of gold.\n\nThe Red Lake Mining District has produced over 22 million ounces of gold through 2004, worth over $US 35 billion at 2014 prices. The two principal mines, Campbell and Red Lake, both have historic ore grades averaging about 0.57 oz/ton Au (22 g/tonne). \n\nThe rocks and mineralization features in this district are complex. The host rock here is a metamorphosed tholeiitic basalt dating to ~2.85 billion years (early Neoarchean). This basalt has been subjected to biotite-carbonate alteration and auriferous silicification. Gold mineralization has been dated to 2.712-2.723 billion years (during collision-related emplacement of several nearby igneous intrusions - Uchian Phase of the Kenoran Orogeny), and  at 2.63-2.66 or 2.699 billion years (during a regional thermal event or another igneous intrusive event).\nQuestion:\nThe Red Lake Mine, said to produce the richest gold ore in the world is in which country?\nAnswer:\nCanada\n", "answers": ["John Chilcot", "Sir John Chilcot"], "length": 1113, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f6f381412c3dcdb7a9c1c7739cf02528d435ee9f152e0ea0"}

If it were to be included it would be number 3 on the list. The United States is  a respectable 8th on the list at 19,924 km (12,383 miles).\nShare on Social Media:\n  \n  \nCanada has the longest coastline of any nation, bordering on three oceans: Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic. Out of the ten provinces and territories of Canada that have coastline, the province with the most is Newfoundland & Labrador with 28,956 kilometres (including islands). The province/territory  with the smallest coastline is the Yukon with 343 kilometres.   Nearly one-fourth of all the fresh water in the world is in Canada with more than two million lakes and an incalculable number of rivers. If you were to try to walk around Canada, following the shoreline at a good pace of 20 kilometres each day, it would take you 33 years to complete the journey. Approximately seven million Canadians live in coastal areas and including all the islands the coastline of Canada is more than six times as long as the distance around the earth at the equator.\nA countries coastline follows the general line of the coast, but sometimes, in the case of small inlets or bays, the coastline is measured as running directly across the bay or inlet to rejoin the coastline on the opposite side. Coastline is not measured as precisely as is shoreline. Coastline measurements are more difficult because of the effects of tides and the necessarily arbitrary decisions that must be made about measuring bays, coves, islands, and inlets leading to streams and rivers.\nThere exists a term \"coastline paradox\" that describes the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length. This results from the fractal-like properties of coastlines. It was first observed by Lewis Fry Richardson. More concretely, the length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it. Since a landmass has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometres in size to tiny fractions of a millimetre and below, there is no obvious limit to the size of the smallest feature that should not be measured around, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landmass. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.  More concretely, the length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it.

The word “paediatrics” means “healer of children”; they are derived from two Greek words: (pais = child) and (iatros = doctor or healer). Paediatrics is a relatively new medical specialty, developing only in the mid-19th century. Abraham Jacobi (1830–1919) is known as the father of paediatrics.\nWhat does a pediatrician do?\nA paediatrician is a child's physician who provides not only medical care for children who are acutely or chronically ill but also preventive health services for healthy children. A paediatrician manages physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the children under their care at every stage of development, in both sickness and health.\nAims of pediatrics\nThe aims of the study of paediatrics is to reduce infant and child rate of deaths, control the spread of infectious disease, promote healthy lifestyles for a long disease-free life and help ease the problems of children and adolescents with chronic conditions.\nPaediatricians diagnose and treat several conditions among children including:-\ninjuries\ncancers\norgan diseases and dysfunctions\nPaediatrics is concerned not only about immediate management of the ill child but also long term effects on quality of life, disability and survival. Paediatricians are involved with the prevention, early detection, and management of problems including:-\ndevelopmental delays and disorders\nmental disorders including depression and anxiety disorders\nCollaboration with other specialists\nPaediatrics is a collaborative specialty. Paediatricians need to work closely with other medical specialists and healthcare professionals and subspecialists of paediatrics to help children with problems.\nHow does pediatrics differ from adult medicine?\nRelated Stories\nQuestion:\nPaediatrics is concerned with what?\nAnswer:\nInfants, children, and adolescents\nPassage:\nThraex\nThe Thraex (pl. thraeces), or Thracian, was a type of Roman gladiator, armed in the Thracian style with small rectangular, square or circular shield called a parmula (about 60 x 65 cm) and a very short sword with a slightly curved blade called a sica (like a small version of the Dacian falx), intended to maim an opponent's unarmoured back.  His other armour included armoured greaves (necessitated by the smallness of the shield), a protector for his sword arm and shoulder, a protective belt above a loin cloth, and a helmet with a side plume, visor and high crest.\n\nHe and the hoplomachus, with his Greek equipment, were usually pitted against the murmillo, armed like a legionary, mimicking   the opposition between Roman soldiers and their various enemies.\nQuestion:\nThraex, murmillo, and hoplomachus are types of?\nAnswer:\nMunus\nPassage:\nWest Mercia Police\nWest Mercia Police, formerly known as West Mercia Constabulary, is the territorial police force responsible for policing the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire (including Telford and Wrekin) and Worcestershire in England. The force area covers 2868 sqmi making it the fourth largest police area in England and Wales. The resident population of the area is 1.19 million.\n\nThe force is divided into five divisions and represent a very wide spread of policing environments from densely populated urban conurbations on the edge of Birmingham as well as Telford, Shrewsbury, and Worcester, to sparsely populated rural areas found in the rest of the force area.\n\nAs of June 2014, the force employs 2367 police officers, 283 police community support officers, 1779 police staff and 224 members of the special constabulary. West Mercia is Home Office force 22 and call sign YK.\n\nThe force has its headquarters in the historical manor house and grounds of Hindlip Hall on the outskirts of the city  of Worcester. Its badge combines the heraldry of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire.\n\nThe force was formed on 1 October 1967, by the merger of the Worcestershire Constabulary, Herefordshire Constabulary, Shropshire Constabulary and Worcester City Police.  It lost territory to West Midlands Police when that was constituted on 1 April 1974. It changed its name from \"West Mercia Constabulary\" to \"West Mercia Police\" on 5 May 2009. \n\nWest Mercia is a partner, alongside two other forces, in the Central Motorway Police Group. In 2013 an alliance was formed with Warwickshire Police.\n\nPaul West, QPM, who retired as chief constable on 31 July 2011 is the longest serving chief constable in the force's history. He was succeeded by his deputy chief constable, David Shaw, who took up the senior post on 1 August 2011. \n\nForce area divisions\n\nThe force is organised into five territorial policing units (TPUs) which are alphabetically coded geographically from south to north (C D E F & G). Operating across three counties, West Mercia Police maintains many stations, with each TPU having an HQ Police station. The TPUs are further divided into Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNTs); there are 82 SNTs across the force.\n\nListed below are the TPUs and police stations maintained by the force:\n\nC - South Worcestershire\n\nCovering Worcester, Malvern, Droitwich, Pershore and Evesham\n*Worcester (TPU HQ / Custody)\n*Pershore\n*Malvern\n*Evesham\n*Broadway\n*Droitwich\n*Tenbury Wells\n*Upton-on-Severn\nWest Mercia Police also owns Defford, formerly RAF Defford\n\nD - North Worcestershire\n\nCovering Kidderminster, Bromsgrove and Redditch\n*Kidderminster (TPU HQ / Custody)\n*Stourport\n*Bewdley\n*Hagley\n*Wythall\n*Rubery\n*Bromsgrove\n*Redditch\n\nE - Herefordshire\n\n*Hereford (TPU HQ / Custody)\n*South Hereford\n*Leominster \n*Bromyard\n*Ledbury\n*Peterchurch\n*Ross-on-Wye\n*Kington\n\nF - Shropshire\n\n(excluding Telford & Wrekin)\n\n*Shrewsbury (Monkmoor) (TPU HQ / Custody)\n*Shrewsbury (Town Centre)\n*Bishops Castle\n*Bridgnorth\n*Church Stretton\n*Ludlow\n*Market Drayton\n*Oswestry\n*Pontesbury\n*Wem\n*Whitchurch\n*Albrighton\n*Cleobury Mortimer\n*Ellesmere\n*Highley\n*Much Wenlock\n*Shifnal\n\nG - Telford & Wrekin\n\n*Telford (Malinsgate) (TPU HQ / Custody)\n*Wellington, Shropshire\n*Donnington\n*Madeley\n\nVolunteer police cadets scheme\n\nA volunteer cadet scheme had existed in the Telford division since the early 1990s and in September 2013, the scheme was expanded force-wide, creating a new detachment of police cadets in each Territorial Policing Unit area. Each detachment is headquartered in the respective TPU HQ, except the South Worcestershire detachment, which is based at Tudor Grange Academy.\n\nIn 2010, the Telford Cadets Detachment was awarded The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service. \n\nAccording to [http://www.westmercia.police.uk/policecadets/ West Mercia Police's website], \"The scheme is aimed at young people who wish to engage in a program that offers them an opportunity to gain a practical understanding of policing, develop their spirit of adventure and good citizenship, while supporting their local policing priorities through volunteering, working with partner agencies and positive participation in their communities.\"\n\nA new intake of approximately 15 new cadets per detachment occurs annually. New recruits must be aged 16 or over and have finished secondary education. Young people can remain as cadets for up to two years. Cadets can then consider joining the force at age 18, becoming a cadet leader in their detachment, or leaving the scheme altogether.[http://www.westmercia.police.uk/policecadets West Mercia Police Cadet website]\n\nEach detachment is led by several cadet leaders who are police officers, PCSOs and police volunteers from the force.\n\nMerger plans\n\nIn November 2005, the government announced major reforms of policing in England and Wales, which raised the prospect of West Mercia Constabulary being merged with other forces in the West Midlands region.\n\nUnder final proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, it would merge with Staffordshire Police, Warwickshire Constabulary and West Midlands Police to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region. This came under particular criticism from West Mercia Constabulary, especially as it was rated the best force in the country. Instead, the constabulary wishes to remain a separate force. The proposals are also unpopular with many of the local authorities in the West Mercia area.\n\nWhen Labour's John Reid became Home Secretary in 2006, he put plans to merge the forces on hold. The subsequent coalition and Conservative governments have not made any indication of re-introducing such plans.\n\nWarwickshire alliance\n\nIn 2013 the West Mercia and Warwickshire police forces formed an alliance, sharing certain administrative functions in order to save both forces money.\n\nBibliography\n\n* Policing Shropshire 1836–1967 by Douglas J.

Thalassophobia is a clinical phobia generally classified under specific phobias, fear of a single specific panic trigger.  Symptoms for thalassophobia are the same as for most specific phobias.\n\nAlthough it is a clinical phobia, it often accompanies other anxiety disorders. In some cases anxiolytic medications may be prescribed or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may be indicated.\n\nThalassophobia can include fear of being in large bodies of water, fear of the vast emptiness of the sea, and fear of distance from land.  Thalassophobes may also be afraid of encountering sea creatures rather than the sea itself.\nQuestion:\nThalassophobia is the irrational fear of which natural expanse?\nAnswer:\nOpen sea\nPassage:\nBulb\nIn botany, a bulb is a short stem with fleshy leaves or leaf bases  that function as food storage organs during dormancy. (In gardening, plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called \"ornamental bulbous plants\" or just \"bulbs\".)\n\nA bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. Roots emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. Tunicate bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.  Species in the genera Allium, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and Tulipa all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as Lilium and Fritillaria species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales. \n\n \nOther types of storage organs (such as corms, rhizomes, and tubers) are sometimes referred to as bulbs, although as the term is used in botany, they are not. The technical term for plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as tubers and corms, is geophyte. Some epiphytic orchids (family Orchidaceae) form above-ground storage organs called pseudobulbs, that superficially resemble bulbs.\n\nNearly all plants that form true bulbs are monocotyledons, and include:\n*Amaryllis, Crinum, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and several other members of the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae. This includes onion, garlic, and other alliums, members of the Amaryllid subfamily Allioideae.\n*Lily, tulip, and many other members of the lily family Liliaceae.\n*Two groups of Iris species, family Iridaceae: subgenus Xiphium (the \"Dutch\" irises) and subgenus Hermodactyloides (the miniature \"rock garden\" irises).\nOxalis, in the family Oxalidaceae, is the only dicotyledon genus that produces true bulbs. \n\nBulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring. Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.\n\nAfter the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.\n\nBulbil \n\nA bulbil is a small bulb, and may also be called a bulblet, bulbet, or bulbel.\n\nSmall bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called renewal bulbs. Increase bulbs are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.\n\nSome lilies, such as the tiger lily Lilium lancifolium, form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf axils. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including Allium sativum (garlic), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers. The so-called tree onion (Allium × proliferum) forms small onions which are large enough for pickling.\n\nSome ferns, such as Hen and Chicken Fern produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae, which are sometimes referred to as bulbils.\n\nImage:Lilium lancifolium bulbils.jpg|Bulbils form in the leaf axils of Lilium lancifolium\nImage:Alliumvineale1web.jpg|Wild garlic (Allium vineale) bulbils sprouting\nImage:Allium fistulosum bulbifera0.jpg|\"Tree onions\" form clusters of small bulbs instead of flowers\nQuestion:\nWhich autumn-flowering bulbous plant is sometimes known as ‘the belladonna lily’?\nAnswer:\nMarch lilly\n", "answers": ["Thomas Beecham", "Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet", "Thomas Beacham", "Sir Thomas Beecham", "Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet, CH", "Thomas, 2nd Baronet Beecham"], "length": 3931, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2d6d3dafd53c0d19c8209cffa9634e26c60b5bbb96cf7a51"}
{"input": "Passage:\nSudanese teddy bear blasphemy case\nThe Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case concerns the 2007 arrest, trial, conviction, imprisonment and subsequent release of British schoolteacher Gillian Gibbons, who taught middle-class Muslim and Christian children at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan. She was convicted of insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nArrest\n\nGillian Gibbons was born in 1953 and gained a Bachelor of Education degree from the C.F. Mott College of Education in Prescot in 1975 (the college closed in 1992).  Teaching in a school in Sudan, she was arrested for allegedly insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nInitially it was thought that the complaint had originated from a parent of one of the children at the school.  However, it was later revealed that an office assistant employed at the school, Sara Khawad, had filed the complaint and was the key witness for the prosecution. Khawad was said to be angry with the school's head teacher. \"I was used by the secretary to get at the school\", Gibbons told The Guardian shortly after her release.\n\nSudan's legal system is strongly influenced by sharia, which prohibits depictions of Muhammad and other prophets. However, many Muslim organizations in other countries publicly condemned the Sudanese over their reactions,  as Gibbons did not set out to cause offence.  The chairman of the Unity School council, Ezikiel Kondo, indicated that he perceived ulterior motives in the affair, \"The thing may be very simple, but they just may make it bigger. It's a kind of blackmail.\"\n\nConviction and reaction\n\nOn 25 November 2007, Gibbons was arrested, interrogated and then put in a cell at a local police station. On 28 November, it was reported that she had been formally charged under Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act, for \"insulting religion, inciting hatred, sexual harassment, racism, prostitution and showing contempt for religious beliefs\". This carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment, a fine, or 40 lashes. On 29 November 2007, Gibbons was found guilty of \"insulting religion;\" one of the three counts against her, and was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and deportation.  The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella organization of British Muslim groups, including MPACUK  said the punishment was \"completely unjustified\"  and that it was \"appalled\",  and called on the Sudanese government to intervene. \n\nOn 30 November approximately 10,000 protesters took to the streets in Khartoum,  some of them waving swords and machetes, demanding Gibbons's execution after imams denounced her during Friday prayers. During the march, chants of \"Shame, shame on the UK\", \"No tolerance – execution\" and \"Kill her, kill her by firing squad\" were heard.  Witnesses reported that government employees were involved in inciting the protests.  Gibbons was then moved to a secret location because of fears for her safety.\n\nRelease\n\nIn an attempt to push for the release of Gibbons, two British Muslim peers (members of the House of Lords), Lord Ahmed (Labour) and Baroness Warsi (Conservative), visited Sudan with hopes of talking to the country's President Omar al-Bashir. \n\nWhile the two British politicians were meeting the President on 3 December it was announced that Gibbons was to be released from prison having been granted a Presidential pardon. After eight days in jail, she was released into the care of the British embassy in Khartoum and then returned to Liverpool, after issuing a written statement saying: \"I have a great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone.\"  \n\nAfterwards\n\nThe school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.\nQuestion:\nIn what Sudan city was Gillian Gibbons imprisoned for the blasphemous naming of a teddy bear incident?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca (; literally \"spaghetti in the style of a prostitute\" in Italian) is a tangy, somewhat salty Italian pasta dish invented in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe ingredients are typical of Southern Italian cuisine: tomatoes, olive oil, anchovies, olives, capers and garlic.\n\nOrigin\n\nVarious accounts exist as to when and how the dish originated, but it likely dates to the mid-twentieth century. The earliest known mention of it is in Raffaele La Capria’s Ferito a Morte (Mortal Wound), a 1961 Italian novel which mentions \"spaghetti alla puttanesca come li fanno a Siracusa (spaghetti alla puttanesca as they make it in Syracuse)\".  The sauce became popular in the 1960s, according to the Professional Union of Italian Pasta Makers. \n\nThe 1971 edition of the Cucchiaio d’argento (The Silver Spoon), one of Italy's most prominent cookbooks, has no recipe with this name, but two which are similar: The Neapolitan spaghetti alla partenopea, is made with anchovies and generous quantities of oregano; while spaghetti alla siciliana is distinguished by the addition of green peppers. Still again there is a Sicilian style popular around Palermo that includes olives, anchovies and raisins.  \n\nIn a 2005 article from Il Golfo—a daily newspaper serving the Italian islands of Ischia and Procida—Annarita Cuomo asserted that sugo alla puttanesca was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of Rancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.   According to Cuomo, Petti's moment of inspiration came when—near closing one evening—Petti found a group of customers sitting at one of his tables. He was low on ingredients and so told them he didn't have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry. \"Facci una puttanata qualsiasi,\" or \"Make any kind of garbage,\" they insisted. Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some capers—the basic ingredients for the sugo, “So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,” Petti told Cuomo.  Later, Petti included this dish on his menu as spaghetti alla puttanesca.\n\nBasic recipe\n\nThe sauce alone is called sugo alla puttanesca in Italian. Recipes may differ according to preferences; for instance the Neapolitan version is prepared without anchovies, unlike the version popular in Lazio, and chili peppers are sometimes added. In most cases, however, the sugo is a little salty (from the capers, olives, and anchovies) and quite fragrant (from the garlic). Traditionally, the sauce is served with spaghetti, although it also goes well with penne, bucatini, linguine and vermicelli.\n\nChopped garlic and anchovies (omitted in the Neapolitan version) are sautéed in olive oil. Chopped chili peppers, olives, capers, diced tomatoes and oregano are added along with salt and black pepper to taste. The cook then reduces this mixture by simmering and pours it over spaghetti cooked al dente. The final touch is a topping of parsley. \n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe dish is featured in The Bad Beginning from the novel series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket as the dish the Baudelaire children prepare at Count Olaf's house.  The dish also features prominently in the movie based on the novels. The dish is also featured in the opening scene of season 11, episode 10 of the TV series Bones. This dish also appears in Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Diamond Is Unbreakable, in the story arc \"Let's Go Out for Italian Food\", where the Stand user Tonio Trussardi plants his Stand, Pearl Jam, into the food he makes in order to rid of his customer's health problems.\nQuestion:\nThe hot and spicy dish Spaghetti Alla Puttanesca is named after what group of workers in Naples?\nAnswer:\nLot lizard\nPassage:\nQuarter Pounder\nThe Quarter Pounder is a hamburger product sold by international fast food chain McDonald's, so named for containing a patty with a precooked weight of a quarter of a pound (113.4 g). It was first introduced in 1972. In 2013, the Quarter Pounder was expanded to represent a whole line of hamburgers that replaced the company's discontinued Angus Third Pounder hamburger. In 2015, McDonald's increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz (120.5 g). \n\nHistory\n\nThe Quarter Pounder was created by Al Bernardin, a franchise owner and former McDonald's Vice President of product development, in Fremont, California, in 1971.   Bernardin had moved to Fremont in 1970 after purchasing two company-owned McDonald's restaurants.\n\nBernardin began experimenting with new menu items for his McDonald's franchises. According to a 1991 interview, Bernardin noted that he \"felt there was a void in our menu vis-à-vis the adult who wanted a higher ratio of meat to bun.\" In 1971, Bernardin introduced the first Quarter Pounders at his McDonald's in Fremont using the slogan, \"Today Fremont, tomorrow the world.\"  His Quarter Pounder became a success and was added to the national American menu in 1972. \n\nIn November 2008, McDonald's Japan (which did not ordinarily offer the Quarter Pounder) converted two Tokyo restaurants into \"Quarter Pounder\" branded restaurants which only sold Quarter Pounder meals. These promotional branches closed on November 27, 2008 coinciding with the re-introduction of the Quarter Pounder at regular McDonald's branches throughout the Kantō (Tokyo) region from November 28.  The Quarter Pounder was launched at one McDonald's restaurant in the Kansai (Osaka) region on December 23, 2008.  It was later reported that 15,000 customers had visited the restaurant on the first day, generating a record 10.02 million yen in sales for a single restaurant in one day. However, it was also revealed that McDonald's had hired 1,000 \"extras\" to queue up on the first day. McDonald's Japan explained that the hirees were used for \"product monitoring purposes\". \n\nProduct description\n\nIn most markets that do not use US customary measurements, the Quarter Pounder is known as the Hamburger Royale,  Royal, McRoyal, or variants thereof. In France, Belgium and Portugal the Quarter Pounder includes cheese as standard and is named Royal Cheese. In Italy, formerly known as McRoyal DeLuxe, it goes by Deluxe, Cheese and Bacon variants.\n\nIn English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand that have adopted metrication, the burger retains the Quarter Pounder name. The term Quarterão com Queijo is used in metric Brazil, Cuarto de Libra con Queso in Spain and in Latin America, and Quarter Pounder Cheese is used in Sweden and Finland. In the United States and South Africa there are two variations: the Quarter Pounder with cheese, and the Quarter Pounder Deluxe. In some Middle-Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, McDonald's provides both a Quarter Pounder and a McRoyale burger on its menu, the McRoyale having slightly different ingredients.  In Chinese markets, the Quarter Pounder is known as a \"full three taels\" ( Zú sān liǎng) because three taels is approximately equal in weight to a quarter pound. In Russia, it is known as Royal Cheeseburger. In Japan, the name is a katakana representation of \"Quarter Pounder\" (Japanese: クォーターパウンダー).\n\nThe burger comprises a beef patty weighing 4.25 oz. (120.5 g) before cooking  and 3 oz. prepared, pickles, raw onion, ketchup, and mustard.\n\nThe nutritional content of the Quarter Pounder varies between countries and locations. For example, in Australia, which uses local beef for its McDonald's products, the average Quarter Pounder has 33.7 g of protein per serving, a higher value than that stated for the same burger in the United States. \n\nOther quarter-pound hamburgers\n\n\"Quarter Pounder\" is a trademark in the United States, but restaurants in other countries have been able to use similar names for their own products, such as the British Wimpy chain's \"Quarterpounder.\"\nQuestion:\nAt a French McDonald's, what would they call a quarter pounder with cheese?\nAnswer:\nRoyale with cheese\nPassage:\nUnited Arab Emirates dirham\nThe dirham () (sign: د.إ; code: AED) is the currency of the United Arab Emirates. The ISO 4217 code (currency abbreviation) for the United Arab Emirates dirham is AED. Unofficial abbreviations include DH or Dhs. The dirham is subdivided into 100 .\n\nHistory \n\nThe name Dirham derives from the Greek word Drachmae, literally meaning \"handful\", through Latin.  Due to centuries of old trade and usage of the currency, dirham survived through the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates dirham was introduced on 19 May 1973. It replaced the Qatar and Dubai riyal at par. The Qatar and Dubai riyal had circulated since 1966 in all of the emirates except Abu Dhabi, where the dirham replaced the Bahraini dinar at 1 dirham = 0.1 dinar. Before 1966, all the emirates that were to form the UAE used the Gulf rupee. As in Qatar, the emirates briefly adopted the Saudi riyal during the transition from the Gulf rupee to the Qatar and Dubai riyal.\n\nCoins \n\nIn 1973, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils, and 1 dirham. The 1, 5 and 10 fils are struck in bronze, with the higher denominations in cupro-nickel. The fils coins were same size and composition as the corresponding Qatar and Dubai dirham coins. In 1995, the 50 fils and 1 dirham coins were reduced in size, with the new 50 fils being curve-equilateral-heptagonal shaped.\n\nThe value and numbers on the coins are written in Eastern Arabic numerals and the text is in Arabic. The 1, 5 and 10 fils coins are rarely used in everyday life, so all amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of 25 fils. The 1 fil coin is a rarity and does not circulate significantly. In making change there is a risk of confusing the old 50 fils coin for the modern 1 dirham coin because the coins are almost the same size.\n\nSince 1976 the Currency Board of the United Arab Emirates has minted several commemorative coins celebrating different events and rulers of the United Arab Emirates. For details, see Commemorative coins of the United Arab Emirates dirham.\n\nIssues with fraud \n\nBy August 2006 it became publicly known that the Philippine one peso coin is the same size as one dirham.  As 1 peso is only worth 8 fils, this has led to vending machine fraud in the U.A.E.\nPakistan's 5 rupee coin, the Omani 50 Baisa coin and the Moroccan 1 dirham are also the same size as the U.A.E. one dirham coin.\n\nA falcon watermark is present on all dirham notes to prevent fraud.\n\nBanknotes \n\nOn 20 May 1973, the U.A.E. Currency Board introduced notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 dirhams; a 1000 dirham note was issued on 3 January 1976.  A second series of note was introduced in 1982 which omitted the 1 and 1000 dirham notes. 500 dirham notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 200 dirham in 1989. 1000 dirham notes were reintroduced in 2000. Banknotes are currently available in denominations of 5 (brown), 10 (green), 20 (light blue), 50 (purple), 100 (pink), 200 (green/brown), 500 (navy blue) and 1000 (greenish blue) dirhams.\n\nThe obverse texts are written in Arabic with numbers in Eastern Arabic numerals; the reverse texts are in English with numbers in Arabic numerals. The 200 dirham denomination is scarce as it was only produced in 1989; any circulating today come from bank stocks. The 200 dirham denomination has since been reissued and is now in circulation since late May 2008 – it has been reissued in a different colour; Yellow/Brown to replace the older Green/Brown. \n\nThe United Arab Emirates Central                                                                Bank has released a new 50 dirham note. The security thread is a 3-mm wide, color-shifting windowed security thread with demetalized UAE 50, and it bears the new coat of arms which was adopted on 22 March 2008.\n\nExchange rates \n\nOn January 28, 1978, the dirham was officially pegged to the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs).

It covers a total surface area of 250 km2 and is a part of Africa's Great Lakes system, although not itself considered one of the Great Lakes. Like the other lakes in the region, it was named after a member of the British royal family, in this case Prince George, later to become King George V of the United Kingdom. Lake George drains to the southwest into Lake Edward through the Kazinga Channel.\n\nExplorer Henry M. Stanley was the first European to see the lake in 1875, after following the course of the Katonga river from Lake Victoria. Thinking it was part of Lake Albert, he named it Beatrice Gulf.  On his second visit in 1888 through 1889, he realized that there were two independent lakes, and gave it its current name.\nQuestion:\nIn which African country is Lake George?\nAnswer:\nUgandese\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872–1926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIn which of London's Royal Parks is Speakers' Corner located ?\nAnswer:\nHYDE PARK\nPassage:\nLeft-arm unorthodox spin\nLeft-arm unorthodox spin also known as slow left arm chinaman, is a type of left arm wrist off spin bowling in the sport of cricket. Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball, and make it deviate, or \"turn\" from left to right after pitching. The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler; however, the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist. \n\nSome left-arm unorthodox bowlers also bowl the equivalent of a \"googly\", (or \"wrong'un\"), which turns from right to left on the pitch. The ball turns away from the right-handed batsman, as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner.\n\nOrigin of the term chinaman \n\nIn cricketing parlance, the word \"chinaman\" is used to describe the stock delivery of a left-arm \"unorthodox\" spin bowler (though some reserve it for the googly delivery [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chinaman]). The origin of the term is uncertain. One version relates to a Test match played between England and the West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933. Ellis \"Puss\" Achong, a player of Chinese origin, was a left-arm orthodox spinner, playing for the West Indies. He had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As he walked back to the pavilion, Robins reportedly said to the umpire, \"fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!\",  leading to the popularity of the term in England, and subsequently, in the rest of the world.\n\nAmong noted players who have bowled the chinaman is Denis Compton, who specialised in the delivery when bowling. Although better known for fast bowling and orthodox slow left arm, Garfield Sobers could also use the chinaman to good effect. In modern day, Brad Hogg is a natural spinner of the ball who popularized chinaman and has one of the most well-disguised wrong-un's. He won Australia two World Cups, picking up 13 wickets in 2003 World Cup and 21 wickets in 2007 World Cup.\nQuestion:\nIn which sport or pastime might you see six chinamen in a maiden or a nightwatchman out with a duck?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nSquare foot\nThe square foot (plural square feet; abbreviated ft2 or sq ft) is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit (non-SI, non-metric) of area, used mainly in the United States and partially in Canada, United Kingdom, Ghana, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. It is defined as the area of a square with sides of 1 foot.  \n\nA symbol for square foot, square feet, and \"per square foot\" commonly used in architecture, real estate and interior space plans is a simple square with a vertical line bisecting it.  It is also occasionally written as a square with a slash through it.\n\nTo calculate the Square footing of an area, multiply the length of one side of a regular quadrilateral multiplied by the length of an adjacent side (for example, a rectangle of 0.5 foot by 2 foot would cover 1 square foot).\n\nConversions \n\n1 square foot is equivalent to:\n* 144 square inches (Sq In)\n* 1/9 square yards (Sq Yd)\n* 0.09290304 square metres (symbol: m2)\nQuestion:\nHow many square inches are there in one square foot?\nAnswer:\n144\n", "answers": ["Discotheque", "Night clubs", "Diskotek", "Dance club", "Clubbers", "Night club", "Discothèque", "Nightclubs", "Clubber", "Theque", "Discoteck", "Dance Club", "Discotech", "Discothèques", "Clubgoer", "Nightclub culture", "List of nightclubs", "Nightclub", "Discoteque", "Discotheques", "Discothek", "History of discotheques", "Disco Bar", "Dance clubs", "Night Clubs", "Disco pub", "Discotek", "Discotheke", "Club scene", "Night-club", "Club night", "History of nightclubs"], "length": 1530, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "164a23bc00045e95a08da074c80679e0c861d48a7f49a6a7"}

A blue floating ghost-like creature, Willo had a long pointed nose which caricatured that of Williams. The name refers to the ghostly light will-o'-the-wisp from folklore.\n* Arthur the caterpillar (as a gruff cockney).\n* Mavis Cruet (known by Arthur as Mave), a plump clumsy fairy with erratic magical powers.\n* Evil Edna, a witch in the form of a walking, talking television set who could zap people with her aerials.\n* Carwash, a snooty bespectacled cat with a character based on Noël Coward.\n* The Moog, a supposed \"dog\" who is unable to think for himself.\n* Twit, a small bird.\n* The Beast, who began life as the dim Prince Humbert The Handsome, who can't pronounce the letter r correctly; an unfortunate encounter with Edna ended up with his transformation into a hairy shambling creature. In this encounter, he crashed into Edna on his bicycle and called her, \"Vewy dangewous. And what a wotten pwogwamme.\" Edna replied, \"I'll 'wotten-pwogwamme' him!\" and transformed him into The Beast.\n\nOther recurring characters include:\n\n* Gnomes, one of which Mavis takes a liking to.\n* The Astrognats, explorers of space with a mushroom-shaped spaceship.\n* The Bookworm, a very clever intelligent worm who eats facts from books as a source of knowledge.\n* A regiment of toy soldiers.\n* A bat.\n\nThe series was written and directed by Nick Spargo and produced by Nicholas Cartoon Films in association with the BBC and Tellytales Enterprises. The character of Willo the Wisp originated in an educational animation created by Nick Spargo for British Gas plc in 1975 and the stories were set in Doyley Woods, a small beech wood in Oxfordshire, near the director's home.\n\nEach of the original 26 episodes lasted approximately 5 minutes and were broadcast at 5:35pm on BBC1, a tradition as short cartoons were usually shown on weekdays between the end of the main children's program for that afternoon, and the BBC Evening news at 5:40pm.

It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women’s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter—a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29° sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower’s body may not rotate a full turn (360°) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men’s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women’s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\nQuestion:\nWhat Olympic event involves throwing a spear?\nAnswer:\nAkontion\nPassage:\nA Harlot's Progress\nA Harlot's Progress (also known as The Harlot's Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now destroyed) and engravings (1732) by the English artist William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, M. (Moll or Mary) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.\n\nIn the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.\n\nHistory\n\nThe protagonist \"M. Hackabout\" (see Plate 1, Plate 3, and the coffin-lid in Plate 6, which reads: \"M. Hackabout Died Sepr 2d 1731 Aged 23\") is either named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout or ironically after the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.\n\nThe series of paintings proved to be very popular and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a \"limited edition\" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a Guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake's Progress, followed some years later by Marriage à-la-mode.\n\nThe original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill House in 1755, the country house of William Beckford (1709–1770), a politician and father of William Thomas Beckford (1 October 1760 – 2 May 1844) builder of Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth's widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818; and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.\n\nAdaptation\n\nBritish composer Iain Bell composed an operatic adaptation of the work which opened at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 2013 with German soprano Diana Damrau in the title role. The world premiere of the opera A Harlot's Progress was on 13 October 2013. \n\nThe plates\nQuestion:\n‘The Harlot’s Progress’ is a series of paintings and engravings by which 18th Century English painter?\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nCentral London\nCentral London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area, but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \n\nRoad distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross (in the City of Westminster), which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nDefinitions\n\nLondon Plan\n\nThe London Plan defines the \"Central Activities Zone\" policy area, which comprises the City of London, most of Westminster and the inner parts of Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea.  It is described as \"a unique cluster of vitally important activities including central government offices, headquarters and embassies, the largest concentration of London's financial and business services sector and the offices of trade, professional bodies, institutions, associations, communications, publishing, advertising and the media\". \n\nFor strategic planning, since 2011 there has been a Central London sub region comprising the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.  From 2004 to 2008, the London Plan included a sub-region called Central London comprising Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster. It had a 2001 population of 1,525,000. The sub-region was replaced in 2008 with a new structure which amalgamated inner and outer boroughs together. This was altered in 2011 when a new Central London sub region was created, now including the City of London and excluding Wandsworth. However, districts at the outer edge of this subregion such as Streatham, Dulwich and Holloway are not generally considered as Central London.\n\nCensus\n\nThe 1901 census defined Central London as the City of London and the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Holborn, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stepney, St Marylebone and Westminster. \n\n1959–1963 proposals for a Central London borough\n\nDuring the Herbert Commission and the subsequent passage of the London Government Bill, three attempts were made to define an area that would form a central London borough. The first two were detailed in the 1959 Memorandum of Evidence of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics. \n\n'Scheme A' envisaged a central London borough, one of 25, consisting of the City of London, Westminster, Holborn, Finsbury and the inner parts of St Marylebone, St Pancras, Chelsea, Southwark and Lambeth. The boundary deviated from existing lines in order to include all central London railway stations, the Tower of London and the museums, such that it included small parts of Kensington, Shoreditch, Stepney and Bermondsey. It had an estimated population of 350,000 and occupied 7000 acre. \n\n'Scheme B' delineated central London, as one of 7 boroughs, including most of the City of London, the whole of Finsbury and Holborn, most of Westminster and Southwark, parts of St Pancras, St Marylebone, Paddington and a small part of Kensington. The area had an estimated population of 400,000 and occupied 8000 acre.\n\nDuring the passage of the London Government Bill an amendment was put forward to create a central borough corresponding to the definition used at the 1961 census. It consisted of the City of London, all of Westminster, Holborn and Finsbury; and the inner parts of Shoreditch, Stepney, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St Marylebone and St Pancras. The population was estimated to be 270,000.\nQuestion:\nWhat central London street is famous for containing the main government offices?\nAnswer:\nVerge of the Palaces of St James and Whitehall\nPassage:\nEra (geology)\nA geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time. The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record. These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries, the P-T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K-T boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.\n\nThe Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian. This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard-shelled animals. More recently, however, those eons have been subdivided into eras of their own.\n\nList of geological eras in Earth's evolutionary history\nQuestion:\nWhich geological era, spanning the massive time-period between 245 million and 65 million years ago, is divided into three periods named the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous ?\nAnswer:\nTHE MESOZOIC ERA\n", "answers": ["Basoon", "Bassoonist", "Bassoon", "French bassoon", "Buffet system", "BASSOON", "Fagott", "Bassoons", "Fagotto", "Pancake key (bassoon)", "Heckel system", "Basoonist", "Baßoon", "Fagotte"], "length": 1694, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "68d5d0ad374c5fd4714eb3344e7ed1b90b80322bbbffa848"}
{"input": "Passage:\nBorscht\nBorscht is a tart soup popular in several East European cuisines, including Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Romanian and Ashkenazi Jewish. The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which gives the dish a distinctive red color. It shares the name, however, with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, cabbage borscht, etc.\n\nBorscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed, a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables, which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a dainty clear broth or a smooth refreshing drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs and/or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as ' or ', that can be served with the soup.\n\nIts popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Today, several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its variegated local guises, as their own national dish and consume it as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe English word borscht, also spelled borsch, borsht, or bortsch, comes from Yiddish  ('). The latter derives from the word  ('), which is common to East Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian or Russian. Together with cognates in other Slavic languages, it comes from Proto-Slavic *bŭrščǐ 'hogweed' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bhr̥sti- Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore political boundaries ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient of borscht soup?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nEsure\nesure is an internet and telephone based insurance company based in Reigate, Surrey, England. It also has offices in Manchester and Glasgow. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nHistory\n\nesure was founded in 2000 by businessman Peter Wood, who also launched the Direct Line insurance company for the Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2005 Peter Wood also Launched the highly successful insurance brand \"Sheilas' Wheels\". The brand is characterised by its three pink sequin-clad Sheilas who starred in a series of adverts made for the brand alongside a pink 'Sheilamobile'. The brand become one of the fastest selling insurance brands in the UK. Sheilas' Wheels focuses on women drivers but has offered cover to men too from its launch. The product includes benefits such as enhanced bag cover. \n\nesure is also known for its high-profile commercials with Michael Winner, used from 2002 to 2005 and resuming in 2007. The adverts spawned the phrase, \"Calm down dear, it's a commercial\".  Winner was temporarily replaced by Mr. Mouse, a blue animated mouse character with an American accent. Mr. Mouse was designed by Sian Vickers and Chris Wilkins, who came out of retirement at the request of Peter Wood, the founder of esure. The pair were responsible for the Smash Martians as well as the four-wheeled red telephone used by Direct Line in their publicity.  Mr. Mouse's catchphrases include \"Insurance at mices' prices!\" and \"Go on, give us a click!\". Mr Mouse was voiced by the actor and arts critic Kerry Shale. \n\nOn 21 November 2007, it was announced that esure would replace E.ON as the sponsor of ITV National Weather bulletins. The two-year deal, rumoured to be worth £10 million, was negotiated by Carat Sponsorship and began on 1 January 2008. \n\nLloyds Banking Group sold its 70% stake in esure to esure Group Holdings, led by Peter Wood on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million.  The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2013. \n\nOn the 8 December 2014, esure announced that it was acquiring the remaining 50% of shares in financial comparison website Gocompare.com having previously secured a non-controlling stake in the company.\n\nOperations\n\nesure is now one of the largest providers of motor insurance in the UK and also offers home and travel insurance. The company focuses on lower risk customers, offering cheaper premiums for customers with a current no claims bonus for its car insurance products. esure car insurance also incorporates the First Alternative brand which in the past offered quotes to higher risk customers as a separately authorised insurer but now sits as a small-scale sub-brand of esure.\n\nCriticism and concerns\n\nConcerns were raised in 2013 about potential conflict of interest. Esure's Peter Wood donated tens of thousands to the Conservatives and esure's Initial Public Offering (IPO) of February 2013 highlighted that insurance company friendly legislation of 2012 offered esure expansion potential. \"Quite evidently, Esure itself thought it was benefitting from the changes under new laws, as did Peter Wood personally, who made some £198 Million from the flotation\"; about a third of his shares. \n\nIn October 2014, esure faced criticism after it declined an insurance claim and offered only a ‘goodwill payment’ of £5,000 on behalf of a policy holder whose abusive husband had set fire to her home. The husband pleaded guilty to effectively torturing his wife with an axe over a period of three days, and the non-payment of the policy left the victim homeless. In a statement, esure said they had \"utmost sympathy for the horrific incident\" but added that insurance was there to cover \"unexpected events and accidents, not deliberate and unlawful acts by individuals destroying their property\".\n\nConcerns were raised in 2014 about potential conflicts of interest when insurance companies own insurance comparison sites. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations says such potential conflicts of interest must be 'flagged up'. A FCA report said \"Small print on the Gocompare.com website informs customers that it is 50% owned by Esure\" [esure owned 100% of GoCompare as of December 2014]. However, \"the FCA found no evidence that such firms had profited as a result of their potentially conflicting ownership.\"\nQuestion:\nIn the first series of the Esure Insurance TV adverts, Michael Winner's famous quote was Calm down dear, it's only a what?\nAnswer:\nCommerical\nPassage:\nTiananmen Square massacre remembered in HK - CNN.com\nTiananmen Square massacre commemorated in Hong Kong - CNN.com\n1 of 19\nPhotos: 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown\nNil by mouth – May 13, 1989, student demonstrations at Tiananmen Square escalate into a hunger strike with thousands taking part and calling for democratic reforms.\nHide Caption\n2 of 19\nPhotos: 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown\nTiananmen sit in – Student hunger strikers camp out on top of buses parked at Tiananmen Square.\nHide Caption\n3 of 19\nPhotos: 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown\nGorbachev visits – May 16, 1989, then Chinese President Deng Xiaoping (center) takes then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife Raisa by the hand at the Great Hall of the People.

His feast day is May 4. St. Florian is also the patron of Upper Austria, jointly with Saint Leopold.\n\nLife\n\nFlorian was born about 250 AD in the ancient Roman city of Aelium Cetium in present-day Sankt Pölten, Austria. He joined the Roman army and advanced in the ranks,[http://www.stflorianparish.org/en/history/saint-florian/ \"St. Florian\", Saint Florian Roman Catholic Church] rising to commander of the imperial army in the Roman province of Noricum. In addition to his military duties, he was also responsible for organizing firefighting brigades. Florian organized and trained an elite group of soldiers whose sole duty was to fight fires.[http://www.brooklinefirefighters.org/index.cfm?zone/unionactive/view_page.cfm&page\nSt20Florian \"St. Florian History\", Brookline Firefighters Association, Brookline, Massachusetts]\n\nDuring the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians, reports reached Rome that Florian was not enforcing the proscriptions against Christians in his territory. Aquilinus was sent to investigate these reports. When Aquilinus ordered Florian to offer sacrifice to the Roman gods in accordance with Roman religion, he refused. Florian was sentenced to be burned at the stake. Standing on the funeral pyre, Florian is reputed to have challenged the Roman soldiers to light the fire, saying \"If you do, I will climb to heaven on the flames.\" Apprehensive of his words, instead of burning Florian, he was executed by drowning in the Enns River with a millstone tied around his neck.\n\nHis body was later retrieved by Christians and buried at an Augustinian monastery near Lorch. Later a woman named Valeria had a vision in which she saw him; Florian, in this vision, declared his intent to be buried in a more appropriate location.\n\nVeneration\n\nSaint Florian is very widely venerated in Central Europe.[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id\n149 St. Florian - Catholic Online]   The Austrian town of Sankt Florian is named after him. According to legend, his body was interred at St. Florian's Priory, around which the town grew up. His body, recovered and was eventually removed to the Augustinian Abbey of St. Florian, near Linz. \n\nSaint Florian was adopted as patron saint of Poland in 1184, when Pope Lucius III consented to the request of King Casimir II to send relics of Florian to that country. Kraków thus claims some of his relics.\n\nA statue of Florian by Josef Josephu was unveiled in Vienna in 1935.  It stood at the main firehouse of Vienna, in the city's main square, Am Hof.  After the firehouse was bombed in 1945 during World War II the statue was moved on to the Fire Brigade Museum (Wiener Feuerwehrmuseum).\n\nSeeking the sponsorship of a helpful saint was and still is a part of the namegiving practice in Catholic areas. It is important to select a saint to protect one against one's main fears; for example, animal plague(s) and fire. In the southern, Catholic parts of the German Empire (mainly present Bavaria and Austria), peasants regularly have used the name, Florian, as one of the given names for at least one of their male children: to secure the saints patronage against fire. Hence the given name is still widespread in these areas.  In Austria and Germany, fire services use Florian in radio communications as universal call sign for fire stations and fire trucks. The call sign Florentine for firefighting-related, hand held radio equipment is also derived, somewhat inaccurately, from that usage.\n\nFolk saying\n\nThe \"Florian Principle\" (known in German language areas as \"Sankt-Florians-Prinzip\") is named after a somewhat ironic prayer to Saint Florian: \"O heiliger Sankt Florian, verschon' mein Haus, zünd' and're an\", equivalent to \"O Holy St. Florian, please spare my house, set fire to another one\". This saying is used in German much like the English \"not in my back yard\", when the speaker wants to point out that some person tries to get out of an unpleasant situation by an action that will put others in that very same situation. The name Florian is considered synonymous with fireman in the German speaking world. In some cases call for a fireman will actually be spoken as calls for Florian.\n\nGallery\n\nfile:Cerkev sv.

The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, wine, and onion. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.\n\nRisotto in Italy is normally a primo (first course), served on its own before the main course, but risotto alla milanese,, is often served together with ossobuco alla milanese.\n\nRice varieties\n\nA high-starch (amylopectin), low-amylose round medium- or short- grain white rice is usually used for making risotto. Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties. The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano.  Carnaroli, Maratelli (historical Italian variety) and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over another. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties like Roma, Baldo, Ribe and Originario may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish. These varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and for making sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of Superfino, Semifino and Fino refer to the size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) of the grains, and not the quality.\n\nBasic preparation\n\nThere are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure.\n\nThe rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and, butter or olive oil, to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white or red wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has evaporated, then the heat is raised to medium high, and very hot stock is gradually added in small amounts, while the concoction is stirred gently, almost constantly: stirring loosens the starch molecules from the outside of the rice grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured liquid. At that point, the pot is taken off the heat for the mantecatura (the point when diced cold butter is vigorously stirred in), to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\n\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy, but has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy, or flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat and can become too dry with the grains too soft.\n\nItalian regional variations\n\nMany variations have their own names:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient in risotto?\nAnswer:\nPolished rice(medical)\nPassage:\nE&OE\nErrors and omissions excepted (E&OE ) is a phrase used in an attempt to reduce legal liability for potentially incorrect or incomplete information supplied in a contractually related document such as a quotation or specification.\n\nIt is often applied as a disclaimer in situations in which the information to which it is applied is relatively fast-moving. In legal terms, it seeks to make a statement that information cannot be relied upon, or may have changed by the time of use.\n\nIt is regularly used in accounting, to \"excuse slight mistakes or oversights.\" \n\nIt is also used when a large amount of information is listed against a product, to state that—to the best of the supplier's knowledge—the information is correct, but that they will not be held responsible if an error has been committed.\nQuestion:\n\"What does the expression \"\"e and oe\"\" mean?\"\nAnswer:\nErrors and omissions excepted\n", "answers": ["Beetroot", "Beet Root", "Beetroots", "Red beet", "Beets", "Beet root", "Beet (vegetable)", "Beet Juice", "Garden beet", "Beet", "Beet juice", "Table beet", "Beet leaves", "Beet greens"], "length": 3413, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1a61756a389c0fa418663b0e087074f2daa76faf7e74809f"}

The song became the group's international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor.

It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.\n\nThe evidence for the use of pravastatin is generally weaker than for other statins. The antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT), failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction/fatal coronary heart disease rates between patients receiving pravastatin 40 mg daily (a common starting dose) and those receiving usual care. \n\nAdverse effects and contraindications\n\nPravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.   However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms such as heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.\n\nThese uncommon side effects should be promptly reported to the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service: \n* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness\n* lack of energy\n* fever\n* jaundice, yellowing of the skin or eyes\n* pain in the upper right part of the stomach\n* nausea\n* extreme tiredness\n* unusual bleeding or bruising\n* dark-colored urine\n* loss of appetite\n* flu-like symptoms\n* rash\n* hives\n* itching\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n\nThese symptoms should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or increase in severity:\n* heartburn\n* headache\n* memory loss or forgetfulness\n* confusion\n\nContraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism.\n\nDrug interactions\n\nMedications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to:\n* Cimetidine (Tagamet) \n* Colchicine (Colcrys)\n* Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune)\n* Ketoconazole (Nizoral)\n* Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan);\n* Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone).\n\nPravastatin is cleared by the kidney, giving it a distinct advantage over other statins when a potential for drug interactions using the hepatic pathway exists.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream.  Overall, the result is a reduction in circulating cholesterol and LDL. A minor reduction in triglycerides and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are common.\n\nHistory\n\nInitially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc.Jonathan A.

Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as \"one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers\". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write \"Holding Back the Years,\" which would become one of Simply Red's biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935–2009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of \"Holding Back the Years\", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen's show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year's general election – which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than £5,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair's stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had \"more respect for Blair than ever\" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC's political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label \"Il Cantante\" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Mick Hucknell's band?\nAnswer:\nSimply Red\nPassage:\nThe Absinthe Drinker - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org ...\nThe Absinthe Drinker, 1901 - Pablo Picasso - WikiArt.org\nThe Absinthe Drinker\nit is a historically significant artwork\nthe image is only being used for informational and educational purposes\nthe image is readily available on the internet\nthe image is a low resolution copy of the original artwork and is unsuitable for commercial use\nMore …\nWikiArt.org allows unlimited copying, distributing and displaying of the images of public domain artworks solely.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce starring Bennie the fat cat and George. It was animated in 1952. Voices by Mel Blanc and music by Carl Stalling. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form.  Because this cartoon's rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases.\n\nPlot\n\nThe two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury-causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. \"Mexican food\" (Benny: \"It gives me the heartburn and I love it!\"), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself \"Speedy Gonzales: Fastest Mouse in All Mexico\".\n\nGeorge and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring \"I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!\" Among the cats' failed attempts:\n\n1. A crate full of \"Acme Anvils\" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny's cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny's head right on top of his own! When Benny asks \"Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?\", the slap-happy cat answers: \"I like it, I like it!!\"\n\n2. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn't have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as \"a funny way to spell 'water'\" leaving him half furless.\n\n3. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size.\n\nFinally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy's hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding \"I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,\" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares \"I love those fellows. They're so see-lee (silly)!\" Iris out.\nQuestion:\nWhich famous animated character, first seen in 1953 in a feature called 'Cat Tails for Two' was usually wearing an over-sized sombrero, white shirt and trousers and red kerchief?\nAnswer:\nAriba Ariba\n", "answers": ["The owl and the pussycat", "The Owl And The Pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussy Cat", "Owl and the Pussy Cat", "Goatlyboatly", "Owl and the Pussycat", "Goatly boatly", "Owl and the pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussy-Cat"], "length": 1937, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "125c30881451c149972622516769741a212e415865f40465"}

It is located at the northeast end of Busta Voe, on the narrow isthmus that separates the mainland from Northmavine. The village also stages its own Up Helly Aa.\n\nThe A970 which connects Lerwick to Northmavine forms the main street of Brae.

The word 'Brae' in Shetland dialect has a different meaning; it may come from the Old Norse word breiðr meaning broad. The village may take its name from the broad isthmus between Sullom Voe and Busta Voe as opposed to the narrower one a little further north at Mavis Grind.

He is also a producer and performer for the classic soundtrack of the hip hop film, Wild Style, and writer of the soundtrack for the film Union City.  An acclaimed photographer, Stein has taken thousands of images documenting the early New York City punk music scene, the visual allure of Debbie Harry and Blondie, and his collaborations with artistic luminaries including Andy Warhol and H.R. Giger.  Stein's photography was published most recently in September 2014 by Rizzoli International in his book, Chris Stein / Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk.  \n\nIn addition to being the sole writer of the Blondie hit song, \"Sunday Girl\", Stein co-wrote numerous hits with Blondie's lead vocalist, Deborah Harry, including \"Heart of Glass\", \"Picture This\", \"Dreaming\", \"Island of Lost Souls\", \"Rapture\", and \"Rip Her to Shreds\". Stein also ran the Animal Records label between 1982 and 1984. \n\nIn 1983, Stein was diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin, but he has since regained normal function. Stein had developed a mild form of the disease, and was able to control it with a program of steroids.  As of 2014, he was still touring and recording with Blondie. \n\nPersonal life\n\nStein is Jewish (although he is not practising)  and was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York.  While in Blondie, Stein and Harry maintained a romantic relationship but never married. In 1989, the couple went their separate ways but have continued to work together on a professional basis. Stein was co-host of TV Party, a public-access television cable TV show in New York City, that ran from 1978 to 1982.\n\nIn 1999, Stein married the actress Barbara Sicuranza, and they have two daughters.\nQuestion:\n\"Chris Stein, Debbie Harry, Clem Burke, Jimmy Destri and Gary Valentine, originally billed as \"\"Angel and the Snake\"\", achieved fame under what name?\"\nAnswer:\nBlondie\nPassage:\nShirley Crabtree\nShirley Crabtree, Jr (14 November 1930 – 2 December 1997), better known as Big Daddy, was an English professional wrestler with a record-breaking 64 inch chest. He worked for Joint Promotions and the British Wrestling Federation. Initially a villain, he teamed with Giant Haystacks. He later became a fan favourite, working until the 1990s.\n\nProfessional wrestling career \n\nEarly career\n\nCrabtree decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, Shirley Crabtree, Sr., becoming a professional wrestler in 1952. He first became popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a blue-eye billed as \"Blond Adonis Shirley Crabtree.\" He won the European Heavyweight Championship in Joint Promotions and a disputed branch of the British Heavyweight title in the independent British Wrestling Federation before he quit in 1966 following a (non-kayfabe) campaign of harassment by former champion Bert Assirati. He retired for roughly six years.\n\nComeback\n\nIn 1972, Crabtree returned to Joint Promotions as a villain with a gimmick of The Battling Guardsman based on his former service with the Coldstream. It was during this period that he made his first appearances on World of Sport on ITV.\n\nNot long afterwards, Shirley's brother, Max, was appointed as Northern area booker with Joint Promotions and began to transform Crabtree into the persona for which he would be best remembered. Based originally on the character of the same name played by actor Burl Ives in the first screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), 'Big Daddy' was first given life by Crabtree in late 1974, initially still as a villain. The character's leotards were emblazoned with just a large \"D\" and were fashioned by his wife Eunice from their chintz sofa. The character first gained attention in mid-1975 when he formed a tag team with TV newcomer Giant Haystacks. However, during this period, Daddy began to be cheered for the first time since his comeback when he entered into a feud with masked villain Kendo Nagasaki, especially when he unmasked Nagasaki during a televised contest from Solihull in December 1975 (although the unmasked Nagasaki quickly won the bout moments later).\n\nBy the middle of 1977, Daddy had completed his transformation into a blue eye, a change cemented by the breakdown of his tag team with Haystacks and a subsequent feud between the two which would last until the early 1990s. A firm fans' favourite particularly amongst children, Big Daddy came to the ring in either a sequinned cape or a Union Flag jacket and top hat. In addition to his feud with Haystacks, Daddy also feuded with Canadian wrestler 'Mighty' John Quinn. He headlined Wembley Arena with singles matches against Quinn in 1979 and Haystacks in 1981. Later in the 1980s he feuded with Dave \"Fit\" Finlay, Drew McDonald and numerous other villains.\n\nIn August 1987 at the Hippodrome circus in Great Yarmouth, Big Daddy performed in a tag team match pitting himself and nephew Steve Crabtree (billed as \"Greg Valentine\") against King Kong Kirk and King Kendo. After Big Daddy had delivered a splash and pinned King Kong Kirk, rather than selling the impact of the finishing move, Kirk turned an unhealthy colour and was rushed to a nearby hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Despite the fact that the inquest into Kirk's death found that he had a serious heart condition and cleared Crabtree of any responsibility, Crabtree was devastated.\n\nHe continued to make regular appearances into the early 1990s, but he eventually retired from wrestling altogether to spend the remainder of his days in his home town of Halifax. During his career, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II said they were fans of 'Big Daddy'.  \n\nPersonal life \n\nCrabtree was a former rugby league player for league club Bradford Northern. His temper often forced him off the pitch early.  He also had stints as a coal miner and with the British Army's Coldstream Guards.\n\nCrabtree's 64 inch chest earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nHis brother Brian was a wrestling referee and later MC, while his other brother Max was a booker for – and later proprietor of – Joint Promotions. His nephews Steve and Scott Crabtree also had wrestling careers – Steve wrestled in the 1980s and 1990s, billed as 'Greg Valentine' (named after the American wrestler of the same name) while Scott wrestled as Scott Valentine. Both worked as tag team partners for their uncle. Another nephew Eorl Crabtree is now a Huddersfield and England international rugby league player.\n\nCrabtree died of a stroke in December 1997 in Halifax General Hospital. He was survived by his second wife of 31 years, Eunice and six children. \n\nOther media\n\nBig Daddy had his own comic strip in Buster during the early 1980s drawn by Mike Lacey. In 1982 ITV planned to build a TV programme around 'Big Daddy' as a replacement for the popular children's Saturday morning Tiswas show. A pilot for Big Daddy's Saturday Show was shot and a series announced but Crabtree pulled out at the last moment, leaving the hastily renamed The Saturday Show presented by Isla St Clair and Tommy Boyd.\n\nThe European version of the multi-format game Legends of Wrestling II featured Big Daddy as an exclusive extra Legendary Wrestler.\n\nA stage play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26–28 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain.  Big Daddy features on Luke Haines' 2011 album \"9½ Psychedelic Meditations on British Wrestling of the 1970s and early '80s\" as the owner of a Casio VL-Tone synthesizer.\n\nIn wrestling\n\n*Finishing moves\n*Daddy Splash (Big splash)\n\n*Signature moves\n*Body block\n*Scoop slam\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\n*British Wrestling Federation\n*British Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n*European Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nEnglish wrestler Shirley Crabtree Jr was better known by what name?\nAnswer:\nBig Daddy\nPassage:\nBikram Choudhury\nBikram Choudhury (born February 10, 1944) is an Indian yoga teacher and the founder of Bikram Yoga, a form of hot yoga performed in a series of 26 hatha yoga postures done in a hot environment of 40 C.\n\nLife and work\n\nBorn in Calcutta, India, Bikram Choudhury began learning Hatha Yoga poses at the age of three. At five, he began studying with Bishnu Ghosh (Paramahansa Yogananda’s brother) and is reported to have won the National India Yoga Championship for three consecutive years in his teens.\n\nBikram created a 26 posture series, which he reports restored his health. The 105 degree Fahrenheit heat in which Bikram yoga is practiced is, according to Choudhury, meant to mimic the climate of India.\n\nAt age 20, Bikram describes being in a crippling weightlifting accident. Although he says he was told he would never be able to walk again, with the help of Ghosh, he reports to have fully recovered within 6 months.   Choudhury emigrated to the United States in the 1970s and founded yoga studios in California and Hawaii. In the 1990s, he began offering nine-week teacher certification courses. Certified instructors now number in the thousands with Bikram Yoga studios all over the world.\n\nBikram Choudhury was married to Rajashree Choudhury, founder of the United States Yoga Federation.  In December 2015, Rajashree filled for divorce from Bikram citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in May 2016.  \n\nCopyright claims on Bikram Yoga\n\nBikram Choudhury previously made claims that the postures of his yoga practice, Bikram Yoga, were under copyright and that they could not be taught or presented by anyone whom he had not authorized. Bikram began making copyright claims on Bikram Yoga in 2012. In 2011 Choudhury started a lawsuit against Yoga to the People, a competing yoga studio founded by a former student of Bikram's and with a location near one of the Bikram Yoga studios in New York City. As a result of that lawsuit, the United States Copyright Office issued a clarification that yoga postures (asanas) could not be copyrighted in the way claimed by Bikram, and that Yoga to the People and others could continue to freely teach these exercises.\n\nControversy\n\nAs of January 2014, five women were suing Bikram Choudhury with allegations including sexual harassment and sexual assault.  Two lawsuits accusing Bikram Choudhury of rape were filed in May 2013, in which a Jane Doe alleges sexual battery, false imprisonment, discrimination, harassment and other counts in addition to the rape allegation. It describes a cult-like atmosphere where members of Bikram’s inner circle help him find young women to assault.  Jane Doe 2 claims that Choudhury recruits volunteers from overseas who are \"so in fear of defendant Bikram Choudhury’s wrath that they will travel to the US and risk violating immigration laws in order to serve him.\"  \n\nMinakshi \"Micki\" Jafa-Bodden served as Head of Legal and International Affairs from Spring 2011 to March 13, 2013 when she claims she was \"abruptly and unlawfully terminated\" according to the court documents filed on July 12, 2013 in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles. During the two years that Jafa-Bodden worked closely with Bikram, she claims she was both the victim of and witness to Bikram’s \"severe, ongoing, pervasive and offensive conduct\" toward women, homosexuals, African Americans and every other minority. Bikram teacher Sarah Baughn filed a sexual harassment suit in March, just before Jafa-Bodden was fired.  On January 25, 2016, a jury awarded Jafa-Bodden $924,500 against Choudhury in actual damages. The jury also found that Choudhury acted with malice, oppression and fraud.  On January 26, 2016, the jury awarded Jafa-Bodden an additional $6.4 million in punitive damages. \n\nBooks\n\n* \n* Choudhury, B., & Reynolds, B. J. (2000). Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class (2nd ed.)

But it can only do this by freefalling, harnessing the force of gravity.\nLast year, scientists recorded male Anna's hummingbirds reaching speeds of 97.2km/h (27m/s; 60.4mph) during diving courtship displays in front of females, an extreme speed considering the bird's tiny size.\nHowever, flying fast in level flight takes much more effort.\nA relative of the common swift, the white-throated needletail, also known as the needle-tailed swift or spine-tailed swift (Hirundapus caudacutus) is commonly reported as the fastest bird in level flight.\nA 'screaming party' of swifts flies by at record speed\nIt is reported to reach a top speed of 169km/h (47m/s; 105mph).\nBut the record is difficult to verify as the methods used to measure the bird's speed have never been published, says avian flight specialist Dr Per Henningsson of Lund University in Sweden.\nConfirmation of the new record came as Dr Henningsson and Lund University colleagues Dr Christoffer Johansson and Professor Anders Hedenstrom filmed common swifts using two high speed cameras.\nUsing this equipment they were able to deduce the bird's flight speed and wing-beat frequency.\nNeed for speed\nDuring the study, they clocked common swifts flying at 75km/h (20.8m/s; 47mph), with one swift registering a top speed of 111.6km/h (31m/s; 69.3mph).\nThat is the highest confirmed speed achieved by a bird in level flight, the researchers say.\nExtraordinarily, the birds occasionally reached top speed while performing steep climbing flights.\nFAST FLYERS\nWatch a male Anna's hummingbird hit its extraordinarily high speed\nAlso surprising is the circumstances in which the swifts fly so fast.\nUsually, common swifts fly at a relatively consistent speed of 36 to 43km/h (10 to 12m/s; 22 to 26mph), regardless of whether they are flying to a roost, migrating or flying in a wind tunnel, says Dr Henningsson.\nBut the birds \"turboboost\" their speed when they are showing off.\nWhen common swifts come together to mate, both breeders and non-breeders fly together in a social display, which scientists call \"screaming parties\" based on the vocalisations the birds emit.\n\"They were generally known for flying very fast during this behaviour,\" says Dr Henningsson.\n\"However, there were no really certain measurements of how fast these flights are.\n\"It is remarkable that a bird that otherwise appears to be 'finely tuned' to perform at a narrow range of flight speeds at the same time is able to fly more than twice as fast when it needs to.\"\nThat means the birds need to be able to radically alter their aerodynamic performance, by altering their wing profile and physiology, depending on whether they are flying normally or in a screaming party.\nOther bird species can dramatically change their flight capabilities: for example chickens rarely take to the air, but they are capable of short, explosive bursts of flight when spooked.\nBookmark with:\nQuestion:\nWhich bird has been recorded at the highest speed in level flight?\nAnswer:\nSWIFTNet\nPassage:\nWhat a Year\nWhat a Year was an Australian television documentary series, hosted by former ACA host Mike Munro and supermodel Megan Gale in 2006 and Bert Newton and Julia Zemiro in 2007.

The hosts spoke to people who witnessed and experienced the particular events first-hand.\n\nHistory\n\nMike Munro and Megan Gale presented the 2006 series. They successfully hosted nine episodes and it attracted a lot of viewers. In 2007, Gale and Munro's show contracts expired, so Newton and Zemiro replaced them as presenters. However, it was cancelled by the Nine Network after coming last place in the nightly ratings on 6 August 2007 due to the big win for Channel Seven..\n\nIn a November issue of a TV Week magazine in 2007, Munro claimed he and Gale left the show because the programmers wanted to lighten up the show and make it more fun. Munro explained that he disliked wearing fashionable clothes for that era. But Newton loved wearing them, so he was hired instead of Munro.\n\nThe episodes that remained unaired after the show's axing were broadcast by Channel Nine over the summer non-ratings period, beginning the unaired episodes on 27 December 2007. The new episodes replaced plans to screen repeats of Australian travel series, Things To Try Before You Die.\n\nDuring March 2011, the Nine Network replayed the 1980 and 1999 themed episodes, on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm on their HD digital multi channel GEM after being abruptly cancelled and replaced with filler shows.\n\nAfter \"What A Year\"\n\n# Gale continued her modelling career and has also done some acting.\n# Munro hosted Missing Persons Unit from 2006 to 2008 and is now working on Sunday Night for Channel Seven.\n# Newton hosted 20 to 1 from 2006 to 2011.\n# Zemiro went to host Rockwiz on SBS.\n\nList of episodes\n\n2006\n\n# What a Year - 1975 - 2 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1983 - 9 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1997 - 16 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1969 - 23 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1986 - 30 October 2006\n# What a Year - 2001 - 6 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1991 - 13 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1977 - 20 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1989 - 27 November 2006\n\n2007\n\n# What a Year - 1980 - 30 July 2007\n# What a Year - 1999 - 6 August 2007\nQuestion:\n\"In what year did Magnus Magnusson say \"\"I've started, now I've finished\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\none thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven\nPassage:\nAble seaman (rank)\nIn the British Royal Navy in the middle of the 18th century, the term able seaman (abbreviated AB) referred to a seaman with more than two years' experience at sea and considered \"well acquainted with his duty\".  Seamen with no or more than one year experience at sea are referred to as landmen or ordinary seamen respectively.\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nIn 1653 the Royal Navy introduced a new pay scale as part of reforms following defeat in the Battle of Dungeness the previous year. Included in these reforms were, for the first time, separate pay scales for more experienced seamen. It distinguished between an ordinary seaman and an able seaman. The higher ranked able seaman could steer, use the lead and work aloft, traditionally to \"hand, reef, and steer.\"  An able seaman received about 25% higher pay than an ordinary seaman.\n\nIn time of war (such as the Seven Years' War or the Napoleonic Wars), with many more warships in service, the navy, merchant marine, and privateers competed ferociously for the limited pool of able seamen, leading to the unpopular use of impressment by the Royal Navy to keep its ships manned. In peacetime, with fewer active warships, there was usually a surplus of unemployed able seamen willing to work in the navy. As late as the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy's practice of stopping American ships to press American sailors into involuntary service was one of the main factors leading to the War of 1812 with the United States.\n\nNotable able seamen\n\nSome notable able seamen from the Royal Navy include:\n*Simon (cat), ship's cat on HMS Amethyst, promoted to able seaman in the Royal Navy. Also said to have been promoted to \"able seacat\"\n*Just Nuisance, a Great Dane in the Royal Navy, famous for his dislike of officers and liking of ordinary sailors.\n*Alistair MacLean, author\n*Sir Fairfax Moresby, English admiral of the fleet, entered the Royal Navy as an able seaman.\n*William Charles Williams, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n*William G. V. Williams, first recorded Australian casualty in World War 1. He was actually part of the Royal Australian Navy and was an able seaman. He died on 11 September 1914 in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea as part of the Australian expeditionary force that captured the former German colony called German New Guinea. He is buried in the Rabaul (Bita Paka) War Cemetery in Kopoko that is near Rabaul on the island of New Britain, being part of Papua New Guinea.\n*George Hinckley, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n*William Bligh, best known as \"Captain Bligh\" for the famous mutiny that occurred against his command aboard HMS Bounty, entered the Royal Navy as an able seaman\n*Admiral of the Fleet Sir Provo William Perry Wallis entered the Royal Navy as an able seaman at age four\n*William Alfred Savage, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n*Albert Edward McKenzie, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n*Edward Robinson, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n*Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet, English admiral, entered the Royal Navy as an able seaman\n*Michael Byrne, signed as an able seaman by Captain Bligh on the Bounty primarily to play the fiddle\n*Matthew Quintal, able seaman and mutineer aboard HMS Bounty\n*Kate Nesbitt, first female recipient of the Military Cross in the Royal Navy\n*Sean Connery, actor\n\nRoyal Canadian Navy\n\nIn the Royal Canadian Navy, able seaman (AB) is the second-lowest of the non-commissioned member ranks, ranking above ordinary seaman and below leading seaman. Able seamen wear a single gold chevron, point down, as an insignia of rank; it is worn on the upper part of both sleeves of the service dress tunic, and on slip-ons on both shoulders on other uniforms.\n\nIn all trades, the rank is awarded on completion of 30 months of service, by which time all initial training is completed. Consequently, it is sometimes said that promotion to the rank of able seaman means the recipient has lost their 'best excuse', on the theory that ordinary seamen are generally assumed to know nothing.\n\nAble seaman is the equivalent rank to private (trained), or simply private, in the Army and Air Force. In French the rank is called matelot de 2e classe.\n\nRoyal Australian Navy\n\nIn the Royal Australian Navy, able seaman (AB) is the second-lowest of the non-commissioned member ranks, ranking above seaman and below leading seaman.\n\nAble seaman is the equivalent rank to Leading aircraftman, in the Royal Australian Air Force and Private Proficient Private Proficient in the Australian Army.  It is not equivalent to Lance Corporal which is rated as E4, not E3 like the ranks of Able Seaman and Leading Aircraftsman.\nQuestion:\nAble seaman Kate Nesbitt, a medical assistant, became the first woman in the RN to receive which award in Nov. 2009?\nAnswer:\nThe Military Cross\nPassage:\nWedding anniversary\nA wedding anniversary is the anniversary of the date a marriage took place. Traditional names exist for all of them: for instance, 50 years of marriage is called a \"golden wedding anniversary\" or simply a \"golden anniversary.\" Twenty-five years is called a \"silver wedding anniversary\" or \"silver anniversary.\" Sixty years is a \"diamond wedding anniversary\" or  \"diamond anniversary\". First year anniversary is called a \"Paper Anniversary.\"\n\nOfficial recognition\n\nThe historic origins of wedding anniversaries date back to the Holy Roman Empire, when husbands crowned their wives with a silver wreath on their twenty-fifth anniversary, and a gold wreath on the fiftieth. Later, principally in the twentieth century, commercialism led to the addition of more anniversaries being represented by a named gift. \n\nIn the Commonwealth realms, one can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th, and 70th wedding anniversaries, and any wedding anniversary after that.  This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom, or to the Governor-General's office in the other Commonwealth realms. \n\nIn Australia, where one can receive a letter of congratulations from the Governor-General on the 50th and all subsequent wedding anniversaries; the Prime Minister, the federal Opposition leader, local members of both state and federal parliaments, and state Governors may also send salutations for the same anniversaries. \n\nIn Canada, one can also receive a message from the Governor-General for the 50th anniversary, and every fifth anniversary after that. \n\nIn the United States, a couple can receive a greeting from the President for any wedding anniversary on or after the 50th. \n\nRoman Catholics may apply to the Office of Papal Charities for a Papal blessing for wedding anniversaries of a special nature (25th, 50th, 60th, etc.).  \n\nCelebration and gifts\n\nThe names of some anniversaries provide guidance for appropriate or traditional gifts for the spouses to give each other; if there is a party these can be brought by the guests or influence the theme or decoration. These gifts vary in different countries, but some years have well-established connections now common to most nations: 5th Wooden, 10th Tin, 15th Crystal, 20th China, 25th Silver, 30th Pearl, 40th Ruby, 50th Gold, 60th Diamond, 70th Platinum. In English speaking countries the first, wooden, gift was cut on the day of celebration and then presented to the wife as a finished article before the next two quarter days had passed. The tradition may have originated in medieval Germany where, if a married couple lived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their wedding, the wife was presented by her friends and neighbours with a silver wreath to congratulate them for the good fortune that had prolonged the lives of the couple. Over time the number of symbols expanded and the German tradition came to assign gifts that had direct connections with each stage of married life. The symbols have changed over time. For example, in the United Kingdom, diamond was a well known symbol for the 75th anniversary, but this changed to the now more common 60th anniversary after Diamond Anniversary of Queen Victoria. The current monarch Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne was widely marked as her Diamond Jubilee and commemorated in 2012.\n\nAnniversary Gift Lists \n\nLists of wedding anniversary gifts vary by country. The traditional and modern U.S. versions were compiled by librarians at the Chicago Public Library.    \n\nFlower gifts\n\nGemstone Jewelry Anniversary gifts\n\nFor lovers of jewelry, the Jewelry Anniversary list with gemstone jewelry for each anniversary year was established by The American Gem Society, The Gemological Institute of America, The American Gem Trade Association, Jewelers of America, and the International Colored Gemstone Association.\nQuestion:\nA traditional gift for a 20th wedding anniversary should be made of what?\nAnswer:\nChinese People's Republic\nPassage:\nGrindslow Knoll\nGrindslow Knoll is a hill in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire, England. It is joined to Kinder Scout by a high col though from most angles appears as an independent peak. It is the high point at the western side of Grindsbrook Clough.\n\nViews \n\nAlthough the high mass of Kinder Scout blocks views to the north, Grindslow Knoll is an excellent viewpoint stretching over a large portion of the southern Peak District and steep slopes to the Vale of Edale give a great sense of height. There are views of the Nab to the east.\n\nAscent \n\nIt is most often climbed from Edale, either via a steep and heavily eroded path that climbs 350m in just under a mile, or via the popular Grindsbrook Clough. The summit is also an easy detour from the path along the southern edges of Kinder Scout.\n\nWalking \n\nThe Pennine Way crosses the hill's southern slopes shortly after leaving Edale, climbing to Broadlee Bank Tor before dropping to Upper Booth. This is the start of a very popular walk taking in Jacob's Ladder, Edale Cross, the Woolpacks and either Grindsbrook Clough or Grindslow Knoll.\nQuestion:\nRinging Roger and Grindslow Knoll are features in which English National Park?\nAnswer:\nPeak District National Park Authority\nPassage:\nBallasalla\nBallasalla ()  is a village in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man, close to the airport and the town of Castletown. The village was built mostly from the ruins of the nearby Rushen Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and dissolved in the 16th century.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe lowest-level local authority is Malew Parish Commissioners who are based in Ballasalla.\n There are currently five commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk, Mr Barry Powell.\n The commissioners' offices are located on the main road of the village close to the Whitestone Inn.\n\nResidents' association\n\nThe village has an active residents' association, Ballasalla and District Residents Association (BADRA).\n\nSince 2010 the village has had a very popular Community Partnership set up with the involvement of the Isle of Man Government, outside agencies and local residents, with Graham Cregeen, MHK for Malew and Santon, as Chairman. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe HQ of Citywing, the Isle of Man airline, is at Hangar 9 at Isle of Man Airport near Ballasalla.  The former Manx Airlines also had its head office at the Airport.  At Balthane on the eastern edge of the village is an industrial estate with local businesses including Athol Garage, sellers of motor vehicles, and Pooil Vaaish, dealing in slate, marble and monumental masonry.\n\nEducation\n\nThe village has its own primary school, Ballasalla School. \n\nSport\n\nMalew football club play their home games at the Malew Football Ground, Clagh Vane and Ronaldsway play their home games at the Ronaldsway Aircraft Factory Fields. Both clubs compete in the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 3 buses an hour to Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin operated by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at the eastern side of the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle dock and goods sidings, seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.\n\nReligion\n\nSt Mark's Church is in St Mark's Road, some distance from the village. The foundation stone was laid in 1771 and it was consecrated in 1772 by the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, Mark Hildesley. It was intended to serve as a chapel of ease and a parish school more conveniently located for those from the outlying hill district than Kirk Malew Church. There was an ancient church near the site which is said to have been dedicated to St Mark.  \n\nSt Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway. The church was consecrated in 1896 and remains in regular use today, with its own substantial church hall within its grounds.\n Both churches are Church of England in the Diocese of Sodor and Man.\n\nBallasalla has had three Methodist chapels in the past. The original Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel dates from about 1798. It was restructured in 1846, although the original roof slate is still intact.  It is now a scout hall. Ballasalla (Bridge Road) Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1833. It closed as a chapel in 1949, but continued to be used as a Sunday school until 1975. It was sold in 1980 and the seats, pulpit and choir pews were moved to Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A second Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1893. It closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1981 as the building was unsafe. \n\nAmenities and events\n\nBallasalla is the site of the mediaeval Monks' Bridge over the Silver Burn which leads to the Manx National Heritage site of Rushen Abbey; this forms part of the Story Of Mann set of attractions established in 1989 and now part of an island-wide series of attractions. The abbey was extensively redeveloped as a heritage site in 1996, having latterly been home to The Academy, one of very few nightclubs outside of Douglas.\n\nAlso near the village is the Silverdale Glen, set amongst woodland, with a small boating lake, café and sprawling playing fields and playground including a water-powered carousel. A wooded footpath alongside the Silverburn river runs between Rushen Abbey, the Monks' Bridge, and Silverdale Glen. In a small hamlet above the village the eponymous St Mark's Fair is held annually on the third Saturday in July.\n The Millennium Way long distance footpath, opened in 1979, which begins at Castle Rushen and heads north towards Ramsey, runs through the village alongside the banks of the river, leading to Poulsom Park in Castletown to the south, and to St. Mark's above the village to the north. \n\nThe village has a pub and various shops. The local authority Malew Parish Commissioners office is next to the pub and a modern office development, Portland Court, occupies former railway goods yard. This was sold off in 1985 for redevelopment and the new station lies on the opposite side of the tracks.\nQuestion:\nBallasalla and Colby are railway stations on which British island?\nAnswer:\nMan Island\n", "answers": ["Shetland lamb", "Burnside, Shetland", "Shetland Islands (council area)", "Shetlandshire", "County of Shetland", "Sand, Shetland Islands", "Shetland islands", "Shetland (Scotland)", "Shetland (islands council area of Scotland)", "Shetland, Scotland", "Shetland", "Shetland Islands", "County of Zetland", "Shetland Isles", "Ȝetland", "Hjaltland", "Shetland Islands council area", "Shetlanders", "Shetlands", "Shetland Island", "Shetland (council area)", "Yetland", "Shetland Isles council area", "Shetland’s"], "length": 5953, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "febbf7e46065811b46026d452b97e044ca606e665d92279a"}

Dushanbe means Monday in the Tajik language.   It was so named because it grew from a village that originally had a popular market on Mondays. Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe (), and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad (, ). , Dushanbe has a population of 778,500.\n\nHistory\n\nSituated at the confluence of two rivers, Varzob and Kofarnihon, Dushanbe  is the capital of Tajikistan. Although archaeological remnants dating to the 5th century BC have been discovered in the area, there is little to suggest that Dushanbe was more than a small village until the early 20th century.\n\nThe first written mention of the village Dushanbe found at the end of 1676.  It was at the crossroads, where a large bazaar occurred on Mondays, hence the name Dushanbe-Bazar (, Dushanbe Bozor; )  from Dushanbe, which means Monday in the Persian language. In the village, there were more than 500 households and a population of about 8,000 people.\n\nBy 1826, the town was called Dushanbe Qurghan (, Dushanbe Qurghon; , with the suffix qurƣon from Turkic qurğan, meaning \"fortress\") Russified as Dyushambe ().  The first map showing Dyushambe was drafted in 1875.  At that time, the town was a fortress on a steep bank on the left bank of the Varzob River with 10,000 residents.\n\nIn 1920, the last Emir of Bukhara briefly took refuge in Dyushambe after being overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution. He fled to Afghanistan after the Red Army conquered the area the next year.  At the beginning of 1922, the town was taken by Basmachi troops led Enver Pasha, but on 14 July 1922 again came under the power of the Bolsheviks and was proclaimed the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924.\n\nA Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic separate from the Uzbek SSR was created in 1929, and its capital Dyumshambe was renamed Stalinabad (Russian: ; Tajik:   Stalinobod) for Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on 16 October 1929.  In the years that followed, the city developed at a rapid pace.\n\nThe Soviets transformed the area into a centre for cotton and silk production, and tens of thousands of people relocated to the city. The population also increased with thousands of Tajiks migrating to Tajikistan following the transfer of Bukhara and Samarkand to the Uzbek SSR as part of national delimitation in Central Asia. \n\nOn 10 November 1961, Stalinabad was renamed Dushanbe, the name it retains to this day.\n\nSevere rioting occurred in February 1990, after it was rumored that the Soviet government planned to relocate tens of thousands of Armenian refugees to Tajikistan. The Dushanbe riots were primarily fueled by concerns about housing shortages for the Tajik population, but they coincided with a wave of nationalist unrest that swept Transcaucasia and other Central Asian states during the twilight of Gorbachev's era. \n\nClimate\n\nDushanbe features a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with strong continental climate influences (Köppen: Dsa).  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are chilly, but not very cold. The climate is damper than other Central Asian capitals, with an average annual rainfall over 500 mm as moist air is funnelled by the surrounding valley during the winter and spring. Winters are not as cold as further north owing to the shielding of the city by mountains from extremely cold air from Siberia. January 2008 was particularly cold, and the temperature dropped to .[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav012408.shtml Tajikistan: Citizens Ponder Bleak Future Amid Harsh Winter | Eurasianet.Org]\n\nEconomy\n\nTajik Air has its head office on the grounds of Dushanbe Airport in Dushanbe.

Tajikistan's principal railways are in the southern region and connect Dushanbe with the industrial areas of the Gissar and Vakhsh valleys and with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. \n\nThe Dushanbe trolleybus system operates public buses in the city. Automobiles are the main form of transportation in the country and  many highway and tunnel construction projects are underway or have recently been completed. Major projects include rehabilitation of the Dushanbe – Chanak (Uzbek border), Dushanbe – Kulma (Chinese border), Kurgan-Tube – Nizhny Pyanj (Afghan border) highways and construction of tunnels under the mountain passes of Anzob, Shakhristan, Shar-Shar  and Chormazak. \n\nDemographics\n\nThe population of Dushanbe:\n* in 1987 was about 796,000 and was made up of ethnic Tajiks (75%), Uzbeks (10%), ethnic Russians (3%), and others (12%);\n* in 2011 was about 679,400 and was made up of ethnic Tajiks (c. 83.4%), Uzbeks (9.1%), Russians (5.1%), and others (2.4%).\n\nDistricts\n\nDushanbe is divided into the following districts:\n# Avicenna (, Abūali Ibni Sino; )\n# Ferdowsi (, Firdavsi; )\n# Ismail Samani (, Ismoili Somoni; )\n# Shah Mansur (, Shohmansur; )\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\n\nDushanbe is twinned with:\nQuestion:\nDushanbe is the capital city of which former Soviet republic?\nAnswer:\nEtymology of Tajikistan\nPassage:\nParting is such sweet sorrow - Shakespeare Quotes\nParting is such sweet sorrow - eNotes Shakespeare Quotes\nParting is such sweet sorrow\nJuliet:\n'Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone—\nAnd yet no farther than a wan-ton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from his hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silken thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nRomeo:\nI would I were thy bird.\nJuliet:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night!

Parting is sorrowful because Juliet would prefer, like a mischievous youth (\"wan-ton\"), to snare her lover in twisted \"gyves\" (chains or fetters). Parting is pleasurable, presumably, because doing anything with Romeo is pleasurable. Note the latent sadomasochism of this exchange, and the almost wistful prophecy that Romeo will be killed with too much cherishing.\nJuliet's \"Good night, good night!\" is, incidentally, the thou-sand-and-first and thousand-and-second times she bids Romeo goodnight [see A THOUSAND TIMES GOOD NIGHT ].\nQuestion:\nIn drama, which character says 'parting is such sweet sorrow'?\nAnswer:\nJuliet (character)\nPassage:\nTonton Macoute\nThe Tonton Macoute ()    or simply as the Macoute   was a special operations unit within the Haitian paramilitary force created in 1959 by dictator François \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier. In 1970 the militia was renamed the ' (Militia of National Security Volunteers or MVSN, perhaps named after the homonymous Italian Fascist paramilitary organisation).  Haitians named this force after the Haitian Creole mythological Tonton Macoute (Uncle Gunnysack) bogeyman, who kidnaps and punishes unruly children by snaring them in a gunny sack () and carrying them off to be consumed at breakfast.  \n\nReign of terror\n\nAfter the July 1958 Haitian coup d'état attempt against President François Duvalier, he disbanded the army and all law enforcement agencies in Haiti and executed numerous officers. He created a paramilitary force in 1959, Milice de Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale (Militia of National Security Volunteers or MVSN), two years after he became president, that answered only to him. He perceived a threat to his regime from the regular armed forces.\n\nDuvalier authorized the Tontons Macoutes to commit systematic violence and human rights abuses to suppress political opposition. They were responsible for unknown numbers of murders and rapes in Haiti. Political opponents often disappeared overnight, or were sometimes attacked in broad daylight. Tontons Macoutes stoned and burned people alive. Many times they put the corpses of their victims on display, often hung in trees for everyone to see and take as warnings against opposition. Family members who tried to remove the bodies for proper burial often disappeared themselves. Anyone who challenged the MVSN risked assassination. Their unrestrained state terrorism was accompanied by corruption, extortion and personal aggrandizement among the leadership. The victims of Tontons Macoutes could range from a woman in the poorest of neighborhoods who had previously supported an opposing politician to a businessman who refused to comply with extortion threats (ostensibly as donations for public works, but which were in fact the source of profit for corrupt officials and even President Duvalier). The Tontons Macoutes murdered between 30,000 and 60,000 Haitians. \n\nLuckner Cambronne led the Tonton Macoute throughout the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. His cruelty earned him the nickname \"Vampire of the Caribbean\". He profited by extortion carried out by his followers. In 1971, President Duvalier died and his widow Simone, and son Baby Doc Duvalier ordered Cambronne into exile. Cambronne moved to Miami, Florida where he lived until his death in 2006. \n\nSome of the most important members of the Tonton Macoute were Vodou leaders. This religious affiliation gave the Macoutes a kind of unearthly authority in the eyes of the public. From their methods to their choice of clothes, Vodou always played an important role in their actions. The Tontons Macoutes wore straw hats, blue denim shirts and dark glasses, and were armed with machetes and guns. Both their allusions to the supernatural and their physical presentations were used with the intention of instilling fear and respect.  \n\nThe Tontons Macoutes were a ubiquitous presence at the polls in the 1961 election, in which Duvalier's official vote count was an \"outrageous\" and fraudulent , electing him to another term.  They appeared in force again at polls in 1964, when Duvalier held a rigged referendum that declared him President for Life.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Tontons Macoutes remained active even after the presidency of \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier's son Baby Doc Duvalier ended in 1986. Massacres led by paramilitary groups spawned from the Macoutes continued during the following decade. The most feared paramilitary group during the 1990s was the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), which Toronto Star journalist Linda Diebel described as modern Tontons Macoutes, and not the legitimate political party they claimed to be.\n\nRepresentation in other media\n\n* The Comedians  (1966) is about the struggle of a former hotel owner against the Tonton Macoute.\n* The Comedians (1967), adaptation of the book as a feature film, starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Peter Ustinov and Alec Guinness.\n*\"Heaven Knows (Robert Plant song)\" a song by Robert Plant on his album Now and Zen, references the Tonton Macoute. \n*The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), a horror film directed by Wes Craven, loosely based on the book of the same name, deals with Haitian Vodou and Duvalierist political repression.\n* The Dew Breaker  (2004) is a novel by Edwidge Danticat that features the Tonton Macoute as important in the plot.\n* Prior to her solo career, Sinéad O'Connor sang in a band called  Macoute. \n\nThis terror group is also mentioned in Season 1, Episode 9 of the popular television series \"Dexter.\" Within the episode, a former member of the Tonton Macoute is recognized and killed by a Miami police officer that formerly was part of the US special forces stationed in Haiti.\nQuestion:\nIn which country were the Tonton Macoute active?\nAnswer:\nHaitian Ancestry\nPassage:\nconvallaria majalis Lily Of The Valley, European lily of ...\nconvallaria majalis Lily Of The Valley,  European lily of the valley PFAF Plant Database\nBloom Color: White.

It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs)  and are pollinated by Bees,  flies,  self.The plant is self-fertile.\nIt is noted for attracting wildlife.\nSuitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.\nSynonyms\nConvallaria bracteata. Convallaria fragrans. Convallaria latifolia.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.\nLaxative ;   Poultice ;   Sedative .\nLily of the valley has a long and proven reputation in herbal medicine in the treatment of heart complaints. It contains the glycosides convallarin and convallamarin which are powerful cardiac tonics and diuretics and are also used in allopathic medicine[244]. However, because of the plants potential toxic properties it should never be used without expert advice[9]. All parts of the plant are antispasmodic, cardiotonic, strongly diuretic, emetic, febrifuge, laxative and sedative[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 165, 222, 254]. The plant is usually harvested when in flower and can be dried for later use[4], though it is stronger acting when fresh[238]. The inflorescence is said to be the most active medicinally and is often harvested separately[4]. An infusion of the flowers and roots is a digitalis substitute (obtained from Digitalis species), though less powerful, that is especially useful in the treatment of valvula heart diseases, cardiac debility, dropsy and chronic lung problems such as emphysema[4, 222, 254]. Lily of the valley encourages the heart to beat more slowly, regularly and efficiently, at the same time it is strongly diuretic, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure[254]. Its effect is less cumulative than digitalis which makes it safer for elderly patients[238]. It is often prescribed combined with the fruits of Crataegus spp[238]. An ointment made from the roots is used in the treatment of burns and to prevent scar tissue[222]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Convallaria majalis : Lily Of The Valley for arrhythmia, cardiac insufficiency, nervous heart complaints (see [302] for critics of commission E).\nOther Uses\nDye ;   Essential .\nAn essential oil is obtained from the flowers[46, 171]. It is used in perfumery and for snuff[238]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves in spring[13, 14, 115]. A yellow dye is obtained from the leaves in autumn[14]. Plants can be grown as a ground cover in woodland shade or in a shrubbery[200, 208]. As a garden ornamental it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nCultivation details\nLandscape Uses:Border, Container, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen, Woodland. garden Succeeds in almost any situation, including the dense dry shade of large trees[1, 4, 24]. Prefers a position in semi-shade in a moderately fertile well-drained moist woodland soil[200, 208]. Grows well in heavy clay, sand or chalky soils[208]. Dislikes pure clay soils and boggy sites[233]. Plants are hardy to -20°c or lower[200]. A polymorphic species[200]. It is a very ornamental plant, though it can become very invasive once it is established[28]. Plants can take a couple of years to become established[208]. There are several named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[233]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Lily of the valley is occasionally cultivated as a medicinal plant for herbalists and allopaths. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[4]. Special Features: Not North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers.\nPropagation\nSeed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, otherwise in late winter, in a cold frame[164]. Germination, particularly of stored seed can be very slow, taking 2 - 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be allowed to grow on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Apply a liquid feed during the growing season to ensure that the seedlings are well fed. Divide the young plants into individual pots when they die down in late summer and grow them on in pots in a shady position in a cold frame for at least another year before planting them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. Division in September[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.\nOther Names\nEuropean lily of the valley,  lily-of-the-valley\nFound In\nNative throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere in Asia, and Europe.

Icelanders call the ten extra letters (not in the English alphabet), especially thorn and eth, séríslenskur (\"specifically Icelandic\" or \"uniquely Icelandic\"), although they are not. Eth is also used in Faroese, and while thorn is no longer used in any other living language, it was used in many historical languages, including Old English. Icelandic words never start with ð, which means the capital version Ð is mainly just used when words are spelled using all capitals.\n\nSometimes the glyphs are simplified when handwritten, for example æ (considered a separate letter, originally a ligature) may be written as ae, which can make it easier to write cursively.\n\nThe alphabet consists of the following 32 letters.\n\n;Deleted letter\n\nThe letters a, á, e, é, i, í, o, ó, u, ú, y, ý, æ and ö are considered vowels, and the remainder are consonants.\n\nThe letters C (sé,), Q (kú,) and W (tvöfalt vaff,) are only used in Icelandic in words of foreign origin and some proper names that are also of foreign origin. Otherwise, c, qu, and w are substituted with k/s/ts, hv, and v respectively. (In fact, hv etymologically corresponds to Latin qu and English wh in words inherited from Proto-Indo-European: Icelandic hvað, Latin quod, English what.)\n\nThe letter Z (seta,) was used until 1973, when it was abolished, as it was only an etymological detail. It originally represented an affricate, which arose from the combinations t+s, d+s, ð+s; however in modern Icelandic it came to be pronounced, and as it was a rare letter anyway it was decided in 1973 to replace all instances of z with s.  However, one of the most important newspapers in Iceland, Morgunblaðið, still uses it sometimes (although very rarely), and a secondary school, Verzlunarskóli Íslands has it in its name. It is also found in some proper names, and loanwords such as pizza. Older people, who were educated before the abolition of the z sometimes also use it.\n\nWhile the letters C, Q, W, and Z are found on the Icelandic keyboard, they are rarely used in Icelandic; they are used in some proper names of Icelanders, mainly family names (family names are the exception in Iceland). Many consider the letters should be part of the Icelandic alphabet, as the alphabet is first and foremost a tool to collate words and names, and not having these letters in the alphabet makes it impossible to alphabetize names like Carl and Walter that are well known in Iceland. The alphabet, as taught in Icelandic schools until c. 1980, consisted of 36 letters: a, á, b, c, d, ð, e, é, f, g, h, i, í, j, k, l, m, n, o, ó, p, q, r, s, t, u, ú, v, w, x, y, ý, z, þ, æ, ö.\n\nHistory\n\nThe modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard established in the 19th century, by the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask primarily. It is ultimately based heavily on an orthographic standard created in the early 12th century by a document referred to as The First Grammatical Treatise, author unknown. The standard was intended for the common North Germanic language, Old Norse. It did not have much influence, however, at the time.\n\nThe most defining characteristics of the alphabet were established in the old treatise:\n\n* Use of the acute accent (originally to signify vowel length).\n* Use of þ, also used in the Old English alphabet as the letter thorn.\n\nThe later Rasmus Rask standard was basically a re-enactment of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent North Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of k rather than c. Various old features, like ð, had actually not seen much use in the later centuries, so Rask's standard constituted a major change in practice.\n\nLater 20th century changes are most notably the adoption of é, which had previously been written as je (reflecting the modern pronunciation), and the replacement of z with s in 1973. \n\nFunction of symbols\n\nThis section lists Icelandic letters and letter combinations, and how to pronounce them using a narrow International Phonetic Alphabet transcription.  \n\nIcelandic vowels may be either long or short, but this distinction is only relevant in stressed syllables: unstressed vowels are neutral in quantitative aspect. The vowel length is determined by the consonants that follow the vowel: if there is only one consonant (i.e., a syllable), the vowel is long; if there are more than one, including geminates, the vowel is short. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule:\n# A vowel is long when the first consonant following it is and the second, e.g. esja, vepja, akrar, vökvar, tvisvar.\n# A vowel is also long in monosyllabic substantives with a genitive -s whose stem ends in a single following a vowel (e.g. ráps, skaks), except if the final is assimilated into the, e.g. báts.\n# The first word of a compound term preserves its long vowel if its following consonant is one of the group, e.g. matmál.\n# The non-compound verbs vitkast and litka have long vowels.\n\nThe chart below is incomplete:\nQuestion:\nWhich letter is unique to the Icelandic alphabet?\nAnswer:\nThorns (album)\nPassage:\nBody fluid\nBody fluid, bodily fluids or biofluids are liquids originating from inside the bodies of living people. They include fluids that are excreted or secreted from the body, and body water that normally is not.\n\nThe dominating content of body fluids is body water. Approximately 60-65% of body water is contained within the cells (in intracellular fluid) with the other 35-40% of body water contained outside the cells (in extracellular fluid). This fluid component outside the cells includes the fluid between the cells (interstitial fluid), lymph and blood. There are approximately 6 to 10 liters of lymph in the body, compared to 3.5 to 5 liters of blood. \n\nList of body fluids\n\nBy type:\n* Intracellular fluid\n* Extracellular fluid\n** Intravascular fluid (blood plasma)\n** Interstitial fluid\n** Lymphatic fluid (sometimes included in interstitial fluid)\n** Transcellular fluid\n\nIn plants:\n* Plant exudates\n\nHealth\n\nBody fluid is the term most often used in medical and health contexts. Modern medical, public health, and personal hygiene practices treat body fluids as potentially unclean. This is because they can be vectors for infectious diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases or blood-borne diseases. Universal precautions and safer sex practices try to avoid exchanges of body fluids.  Body fluids can be analyzed in medical laboratory in order to find microbes, inflammation, cancers, etc.\n\nClinical samples\n\nClinical samples are generally defined as non-infectious human or animal materials including blood, saliva, excreta, body tissue and tissue fluids, and also FDA-approved pharmaceuticals that are blood products.   In medical contexts, it is a specimen taken for diagnostic examination or evaluation, and for identification of disease or condition. \n\nSampling\n\nMethods of sampling of body fluids include:\n* Blood sampling for any blood test, in turn including:\n** Arterial blood sampling, such as radial artery puncture\n** Venous blood sampling, also called venipuncture\n* Lumbar puncture to sample cerebrospinal fluid\n* Thoracocentesis to sample pleural fluid\n* Amniocentesis to sample amniotic fluid\n\nBody fluids in art\n\nA relatively new trend in contemporary art is to use body fluids in art, though there have been rarer uses of blood (and perhaps feces) for quite some time, and Marcel Duchamp used semen decades ago.  Examples include:\n\n* The controversial Piss Christ (1987), by Andres Serrano, which is a photograph of a crucifix submerged in urine;\n*In Janine Antoni's Conduit (2009) she created a copper cast gargoyle device that she could pee through on the top of the Chrysler Building, Antoni's urine acting as the patina.\n* Andy Warhol's Oxidations series, begun in 1977, in which he invited friends to urinate onto a canvas of metallic copper pigments, so that the uric acid would oxidize into abstract patterns;\n* Self (1991, recast 1996)  by Marc Quinn, a frozen cast of the artist's head made entirely of his own blood;\n* Piss Flowers, by Helen Chadwick (1991–92), are twelve white-enameled bronzes cast from cavities made by urinating in snow (though this might not be characterized as the use of bodily fluids in art, just their use in preparation);\n* performances by Lennie Lee involving feces, blood, vomit from 1990\n* many paintings by Chris Ofili, which make use of elephant dung (from 1992).\n* Gilbert and George's The Naked Shit Pictures (1995)\n* Hermann Nitsch and Das Orgien Mysterien Theatre use urine, feces, blood and more in their ritual performances.\n* Franko B from 1990 blood letting performances.\n* The cover of the Metallica's album Load is an original artwork entitled \"Semen and Blood III\", one of three photographic studies by Andres Serrano created in 1990 by mingling the artist's own semen and bovine blood between two sheets of Plexiglas.\nQuestion:\nWhat term can be both a highly energised state of matter and a bodily fluid?\nAnswer:\nBiological plasma\nPassage:\nOscars 2013 Winners: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress ...\nOscars 2013 Winners: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director Awards for Academy Awards 2013 (FULL LIST)\nCP Entertainment\nOscars 2013 Winners: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director Awards for Academy Awards 2013 (FULL LIST)\nFree sign up cp newsletter!\nSign up\nBy Anne Thomas , Christian Post Contributor\nFeb 24, 2013 | 11:41 PM\nx\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nReuters\nThe Oscars 2013 ceremony took place on Sunday night with the biggest stars of Hollywood coming together.

It was directed by Richard Fleischer,  and stars Tony Curtis as Albert DeSalvo, the strangler, and Henry Fonda as John S. Bottomly, the chief detective now famed for obtaining DeSalvo's confession. \n\nPlot\n\nThe first part of the film shows the police investigation, with some examples of the seedier side of Boston life, including promiscuity in the adult quarters of the city.  The second part shows the apprehension of DeSalvo. Bottomly's intent is to answer the question presented in the film's famous print ad:\nWhy did 13 women willingly open their doors to the Boston Strangler?\n\nCast\n\n* Tony Curtis as Albert DeSalvo\n* Henry Fonda as John S.

This is essentially a work of fiction 'based' on the real events. And based on them in such a way to entertain us, which it does, but for the wrong reasons, I believe. This film, which was made so well, should not have been made at all.\" \n\nIn the same vein, The New York Times film critic Renata Adler, wrote \"The Boston Strangler represents an incredible collapse of taste, judgment, decency, prose, insight, journalism and movie technique, and yet—through certain prurient options that it does not take—it is not quite the popular exploitation film that one might think. It is as though someone had gone out to do a serious piece of reporting and come up with 4,000 clippings from a sensationalist tabloid. It has no depth, no timing, no facts of any interest and yet, without any hesitation, it uses the name and pretends to report the story of a living man, who was neither convicted nor indicted for the crimes it ascribes to him. Tony Curtis 'stars'—the program credits word—as what the movie takes to be the Boston strangler.\" \n\nMore recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz discussed the film's style, writing, \"What mostly filled the split-screen was the many interrogation scenes, where on one side was the suspect and interrogator in the present and on the other side the suspect and his interrogator in flashbacks. Fleischer eschews the graphic violence in the murders and aims instead to try to understand the killer through the script's bogus psychology. The big things the film tried didn't pan out as that interesting, as the flashy camera work counteracts the conventional storyline chronicling the rise, manhunt, fall, and prosecution of De Salvo.\" \n\nIn Popular Culture\n\nThe film was humorously alluded to in the season five episode of All In The Family entitled \"Prisoner In The House.\"\n\nAwards\n\n;Nominations\n* Golden Globe Award: Best Motion Picture Actor - Drama, Tony Curtis; 1969.\n* Edgar Award: Edgar Allan Poe Award, Best Motion Picture, Edward Anhalt; 1969.\n* American Cinema Editors: Eddie, Best Edited Feature Film, Marion Rothman; 1969.\nQuestion:\nWho starred in the title role in the 1968 Film The Boston Strangler?\nAnswer:\nBernard Schwartz (actor)\nPassage:\nDunnock\nThe dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name \"dunnock\" comes from the Ancient British *dunnākos, meaning \"little brown one.\"  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.\n\nDescription\n\nA European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5–14 cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nDunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.\n\nTerritoriality\n\n \n\nThe main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.\n\nDunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. \n\nFemale territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.\n\nThe male’s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. \n\nBreeding\n\nMating systems\n\nThe dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.\n\nOther mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.\n\nStudies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). \n\nNest\n\nThe dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.\n\nParental care and provisioning\n\nBroods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.\n\nA study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.\nQuestion:\nThe hedge sparrow is another common name for which bird?\nAnswer:\nHedge accentor\n", "answers": ["BLACKSTAR", "Blackstar (TV series)", "BlackStar", "Powerstar"], "length": 7493, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "236cc54c26437eae7a80deedd8ab93cc756e44f787c9994b"}

Born on a farm at Ettrick, he had ambitions to be a writer from an early age and came to believe that he might emulate Burns. He was still working as a shepherd when his first, unsuccessful, volume of poems appeared in 1801. The following year he met Scott who would champion him over many years.\nImage Rights Holder:\n205:The National Galleries of Scotland, Phase 1\nMaterial:\nPainting: James Hogg, 1770 - 1835.

He was buried in Ettrick churchyard.\nDescription:\nHogg's appearance on the literary scene was established by The Queen's Wake which came out in 1813. Many times reprinted, it contains his most quoted piece of verse, 'Kilmeny'. Thereafter his work ranged from the brilliant parodies of contemporary poets in The Poetic Mirror to the works in prose: The Brownie of Bodsbeck, The Three Perils of Man, and, most remarkable of all, The Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, which introduced the theme of the evil doppelganger into Scottish literature.\nAll Rights Burns Scotland\nQuestion:\nWhich poet (1770-1835) was known as the Ettrick Shepherd?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nRiver Itchen, Hampshire\nThe River Itchen (previously also known as the River Alre) is a river in Hampshire, England. It flows from mid-Hampshire to join with Southampton Water below the Itchen Bridge in the city of Southampton. The river has a total length of 28 mi, and is noted as one of the world's premier chalk streams for fly fishing,  especially using dry fly or nymphing techniques. The local chalk in the earth provides excellent filtration and thus watercress thrives all along the Itchen valley in its once pristine, crystal clear waters, now affected by pollution by some farming practices. It is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is noted for its high-quality habitats, supporting a range of protected species including the endangered water vole,  otter, brook lamprey and white-clawed crayfish.\n\nThe river is managed by the Environment Agency, whilst the Port of Southampton is the navigation authority for the tidal section below Swaythling.\n\nDuring Roman Britain, the river may have been associated with the Celtic goddess Ancasta.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the name is thought to be very ancient and pre-Celtic; the meaning is unknown. The settlement of Itchen Abbas on the river is given as Icene in the Domesday Book of 1086. \n\nCourse\n\nThe source of the Itchen is situated just south of the village of Cheriton. Initially the river flows north, through the villages of Cheriton and Tichborne, before joining up with its tributaries the River Alre and the Candover Brook, just below the town of New Alresford. The river then flows west down the upper Itchen Valley passing the villages of Avington, Itchen Stoke, Itchen Abbas, Martyr Worthy, Easton, and Abbots Worthy. Before entering the historic city of Winchester it crosses Winnall Moors. \n\nThe river flows in several different channels through the city of Winchester, some of which come close enough to Winchester Cathedral to have caused serious problems to the building's foundations in earlier years. The main channel flows through Winchester City Mill and to the east of the city's Roman walls, along a promenaded reach known as \"The Weirs\".\n\nThe river then heads south, through a series of water meadows, passing the Hospital of St Cross, the villages of Twyford and Shawford, between the town of Eastleigh and the village of Bishopstoke and through Itchen Valley Country Park before reaching the northern suburbs of Southampton at Mansbridge. Between Winchester and Mansbridge, sections of the river were once deepened or widened as part of the long disused Itchen Navigation, and the former towpath forms part of the Itchen Way. \n\nMonks Brook flows into the Itchen at Swaythling, and the river then passes under Woodmill Bridge and becomes tidal. Four further bridges cross the river before its confluence with the River Test estuary in Southampton Water:\n\n* Cobden Bridge, a road bridge connecting Bitterne Park and St Denys.\n* The bridge carrying the Southampton – Portsmouth railway line.\n* Northam Bridge, a road bridge carrying the A3024 road from Bitterne Manor to Northam, which was originally opened in 1799.\n* The Itchen Bridge, a high-level toll road bridge connecting the docks area with Woolston. This replaced the Woolston Floating Bridge (a chain ferry) which had previously crossed the river at this point.\n\nBetween the latter two bridges, the river passes St Mary's Stadium, the home of Southampton F.C. As the river joins onto Southampton Water it passes the major mixed-development on the eastern side of the river in Woolston, called Centenary Quay.\n\nPollution\n\nIn recent years there have been attempts to reduce possible phosphate pollution from commercial watercress businesses such as Vitacress Salads and the Watercress company. There is an ambition for compliance  by 2016.\nQuestion:\nWhich British city lies between the mouths of the rivers Test and Itchen?\nAnswer:\nSouthampton\nPassage:\nPaul Revere's Ride by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\nPaul Revere's Ride by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\nListen my children and you shall hear\nOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\nOn the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\nHardly a man is now alive\nWho remembers that famous day and year.\nHe said to his friend, \"If the British march\nBy land or sea from the town to-night,\nHang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\nOf the North Church tower as a signal light,--\nOne if by land, and two if by sea;\nAnd I on the opposite shore will be,\nReady to ride and spread the alarm\nThrough every Middlesex village and farm,\nFor the country folk to be up and to arm.\"\nThen he said \"Good-night!\" and with muffled oar\nSilently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\nJust as the moon rose over the bay,\nWhere swinging wide at her moorings lay\nThe Somerset, British man-of-war;\nA phantom ship, with each mast and spar\nAcross the moon like a prison bar,\nAnd a huge black hulk, that was magnified\nBy its own reflection in the tide.\nMeanwhile, his friend through alley and street\nWanders and watches, with eager ears,\nTill in the silence around him he hears\nThe muster of men at the barrack door,\nThe sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\nAnd the measured tread of the grenadiers,\nMarching down to their boats on the shore.\nThen he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,\nBy the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\nTo the belfry chamber overhead,\nAnd startled the pigeons from their perch\nOn the sombre rafters, that round him made\nMasses and moving shapes of shade,--\nBy the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\nTo the highest window in the wall,\nWhere he paused to listen and look down\nA moment on the roofs of the town\nAnd the moonlight flowing over all.\nBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,\nIn their night encampment on the hill,\nWrapped in silence so deep and still\nThat he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,\nThe watchful night-wind, as it went\nCreeping along from tent to tent,\nAnd seeming to whisper, \"All is well!\"\nA moment only he feels the spell\nOf the place and the hour, and the secret dread\nOf the lonely belfry and the dead;\nFor suddenly all his thoughts are bent\nOn a shadowy something far away,\nWhere the river widens to meet the bay,--\nA line of black that bends and floats\nOn the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\nMeanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\nBooted and spurred, with a heavy stride\nOn the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\nNow he patted his horse's side,\nNow he gazed at the landscape far and near,\nThen, impetuous, stamped the earth,\nAnd turned and tightened his saddle girth;\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\nThe belfry tower of the Old North Church,\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\nLonely and spectral and sombre and still.\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\nHe springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\nA second lamp in the belfry burns.\nA hurry of hoofs in a village street,\nA shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\nAnd beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\nStruck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;\nThat was all!

It first produced cask ales in 1978.\n\nProducts\n\nThe brewery produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles.\n\nHistory\n\nThe business was founded in 1865 by William Moorhouse as a producer of mineral waters. The business was successful and by 1870 Moorhouse had a purpose built building erected in Moorhouse Street off Accrington Road, Burnley which incorporated stables for the delivery horses and houses for the workers and Moorhouse family. William's sons took over the business and early in the 20th century began making low alcohol hop bitters which were exported throughout the world, notably United States and the Middle East. \n\nIn the 1930s the mineral water production was sold to Thwaites Brewery.\n\nIn 1978 Michael Ryan, a local builder, bought the premises and equipment from Tom Fawcett, the cousin of the last surviving Moorhouse family member, Ben Moorhouse (Ben has a son -Robert - who, in turn, has a son - William Moorhouse - born in 2011). Ryan turned the soft drinks company into a cask ale brewery. The first cask ale produced was Premier Bitter.\n\nThe brewery struggled during its first four years, changing owners several times before being taken over in 1982 by Alan Hutchinson, a local hotel owner, who introduced the successful Pendle Witches Brew brand. After Hutchinson died in 1985 the brewing side of the business was about to be closed down when William Parkinson, a businessman who was born in Burnley, tried the last batch of Pendle Witches Brew and decided to buy the brewery, investing £500,000 in new equipment, a distribution depot, and buying six pubs.\n\nBeers\n\nThe company produces five regular cask ales: \n\n* Black Cat Mild\n* Blond Witch Golden Ale\n* Pendle Witches Brew Strong Ale\n* Premier Bitter\n* Pride of Pendle Best Bitter\n\nThere are also 5 special blends produced:\n\n* Broomstick Bitter\n* Blackwitch\n* Witches Cauldron\n* Witchfinder General\n* Witch Hunt\n\nAdditionally, there is a special beer brewed per month. \n\nDistribution\n\nThe cask ales are available in the company's six pubs, as guests in pubs throughout Britain and at British beer festivals. The two bottled beers are distributed throughout Britain and North America. The British supermarket Morrisons regularly stocks the bottled beers. Pendle Witches Brew is also brewed under licence in Cyprus.\nQuestion:\nIn which town is Moorhouse's brewery?\nAnswer:\nBurnley, Lancashire\nPassage:\nDoctor Foster\n\"Doctor Foster\" is an English language nursery rhyme that has appeared in many anthologies since the nineteenth century. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19288.\n\nThe rhyme\n\nThe rhyme was first published in its modern form in 1844, although the rhyming of 'puddle' with 'middle' suggests that it may have originally been the archaic 'piddle' for a stream and that the verse may therefore be much older.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 173. The first recorded text was:\n\nDoctor Foster went to Gloucester,\nIn a shower of rain;\nHe stepped in a puddle,\nRight up to his middle,\nAnd never went there again.\n\nOrigins and meaning\n\nIt was suggested by Boyd Smith (1920) that the rhyme may be based on a story of Edward I of England travelling to Gloucester, falling off his horse into a puddle, and refusing to return to the city thereafter. There is a rhyme published in Gamer Gurton's Garland (1810) with a similar form:\n\nOld Dr. Foster went to Gloster,\nTo preach the work of God.\nWhen he came there, he sat in his chair,\nAnd gave all the people a nod.\n\nThis variant and the late date of recording suggest that the medieval meaning is unlikely.\nQuestion:\nIn a nursery rhyme, where did Dr Foster step into a puddle right up to his middle?\nAnswer:\nGloucester, England\nPassage:\nGranthi\nA Granthi (,) is a person, male or female, of the Sikh religion who is a ceremonial reader of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is the Holy Book in Sikhism, often read to worshipers at Sikh temples called a Gurudwara. The name Granthi comes from the Sanskrit granthika, which means a relater or narrator. Any Sikh individual appointed the title of being a Granthi is considered a principal religious official of Sikhism. Although they are considered religious officials in Sikhism, they are not considered to be the equivalent of a priest, as the belief is that there are no such religious intermediaries. \n\nQualifications \n\nTo be appointed a Granthi, one of the main qualifications is the commitment to the Sikh religion by becoming an Amritdhari Sikh. This is an acceptance of the full physical and spiritual discipline outlined in the Sikh Reht Maryada through a religious ceremony performed at the Gurudwara called an Amrit Sanchar. This ceremony is approved and conducted by the Panj Pyare, the Five Beloved Ones, who have themselves committed to the religion by becoming an Amritdhari Sikh. The five who are selected to perform this ceremony are chosen by the holy congregation referred to as the Sangat.\n\nOther important qualifications include being able to read the holy scriptures of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is the duty of a Paathi in the Gurudwara. A Granthi must be able to interpret the sacred hymns written in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, referred to as Gurbani, and must be able to fluently deliver sermons to the Sangat at the Gurudwara. Another important qualification is the ability to complete all duties related to taking care of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib at ceremonies as it is referred to as the \"living Guru\" in a Gurudwara and by Sikhs worldwide.\n\nA Granthi has to spend a few years as an assistant to a qualified reputable Granthi, who will act as a mentor and pass on his or her knowledge to teach ceremonial aspects of his or her duties. Assistant Granthis must possess the skills to play  tabla, which is a pair of percussion drums use in classical Indian music. This is a necessity as they are required to join the head Granthi during Gurmat Kirtan, which is the rendering of verses from the Sri Guru Granth Sahib in the Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib, Taalas, and musical scores composed in the scripture, considered the most important aspect of a prayer gathering.\n\nIt is expected that an assistant Granthi looking to become a qualified Granthi be mentored for a minimum of three years so that they learn all aspects of the ceremonial procedures and that they build up their ability to become a head Granthi at a Gurudwara who can recite prayers to a medium- to large-size Sangat.\nQuestion:\nA ‘Granthi’ is the keeper and reader of the scriptures in which religion?\nAnswer:\nSikh faith\nPassage:\nBattle of the Solent\nThe naval Battle of the Solent took place on 18 and 19 July 1545 during the Italian Wars, fought between the fleets of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, in the Solent channel off the south coast of England between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The engagement was inconclusive and is most notable for the sinking of the English carrack Mary Rose.\n\nIn 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers.\n\nThe French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast.  The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch.\n\nOn 18 July 1545 the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. La Maitresse was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering.\n\nOn the night of 18 July Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle.\n\nThe next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but 35–40 of her crew. The exact reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after firing at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the French fleet believed that the galleys had sunk her, though this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains. \n\nThe French troops ashore made no progress and returned to France in August.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nThe inconclusive 'Battle of the Solent' against the French on July 18/19 1545 was most notable for the loss of which ship?\nAnswer:\nEnglish carrack Mary Rose\nPassage:\nRichard Dunwoody\nThomas Richard Dunwoody MBE (born 18 January 1964 in Belfast, Northern Ireland) is a retired British jockey in National Hunt racing. He was a three-time Champion Jockey, riding 1699 British winners in his career. His father was a leading Point to Point rider.\n\nRacing career\n\nHis big race victories include the King George VI Chase four times - twice on the legendary grey Desert Orchid in 1989 and 1990 and twice on another grey One Man in 1995 and 1996. He also won the 1986 and 1994 Grand Nationals on West Tip and Miinnehoma respectively, and the 1988 Cheltenham Gold Cup on Charter Party. \nHe received the Lester Award for Jump Jockey of the Year on five occasions.\n\nCharity work\n\nHe is Patron or Trustee for the charities; Sparks, Spinal Research and Racing Welfare.\n\nOn 18 January 2008, it was reported that he and American explorer Doug Stoup had reached the South Pole following a 48-day trek raising money for charity. Their route followed one which had previously been attempted by Ernest Shackleton and was both the first successful completion of that route on foot as well the first successfully completed new route to the South Pole in ten years. \n\nIn January 2014, Richard hosted his debut photographic exhibition at St Martin-in-the-Fields featuring images taken in Pakistan, India, Guatemala and Egypt for the charity Brooke Hospital for Animals. \n\nThousand-miles in a Thousand-hours\n\nOn 29 May 2009, Richard started a 1000 Mile Challenge for charity and walk the same mile 1000 consecutive times in Newmarket for 1000 consecutive hours with the last mile up the home straight of Newmarket racecourse just before the Bunbury Cup on 10 July 2009.  He successfully completed the challenge raising tens of thousands of pounds for charity.\n\nThe challenge undertaken was to emulate Robert Barclay Allardice, of Stonehaven, whose most famous feat was walking 1000 miles in 1000 consecutive hours for a wager of 1000 guineas in 1809, 1 June to 12 July.\nIf the report of the total wagers was accurate, this is equivalent to some £5 million ($US 8 million) in modern terms.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing\n\nOn 25 August 2009 it was announced that he would take part in Series 7 of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing partnering Lilia Kopylova. On 26 September 2009 Dunwoody was voted off of Strictly Come Dancing after his first performance.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHis autobiography is called Obsessed which was published after his retirement - he retired due to the potential danger of long term damage to his neck. In his autobiography Dunwoody reveals that he experienced a messy divorce with his former wife Carol. Richard runs a betting advisory service, Richard Dunwoody Racing Associates Ltd.  and leads riding holidays for adventure travel company Wild Frontiers.  He is also a motivational speaker. \n\nDunwoody is a supporter of the Conservative Party, and at the 2010 general election he backed the party after expressing his concern at the county's financial crisis as well as tighter health and safety regulations.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the horse on which jockey Richard Dunwoody won the 1986 Grand National?\nAnswer:\nWest Tip\nPassage:\nBraxy\nBraxy is an inflammatory disease in the abomasal lining of sheep caused by the bacterium Clostridium septicum (aka Bacillus septicus), followed by rapid death.\n\nBraxy is often brought on by a change from succulent food to dry (or icy) food.  It is usually seen in young sheep, in particular those not protected with a Clostridial vaccine.\n\nThe mutton affected with this disease can also be referred to as braxy.\nQuestion:\nBraxy is a fatal bacterial infection in which animal?\nAnswer:\nSheep\nPassage:\nMegapode\nThe megapodes, also known as incubator birds or mound-builders, are stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet in the family Megapodiidae. Their name literally means \"large foot\" (Greek: mega large, poda \n foot), and is a reference to the heavy legs and feet typical of these terrestrial birds. All are browsers, and all but the malleefowl occupy wooded habitats. Most are brown or black colored. Megapodes are superprecocial, hatching from their eggs in the most mature condition of any birds. They hatch with open eyes, bodily coordination and strength, full wing feathers and downy body feathers, and are able to run, pursue prey, and, in some species, fly on the same day they hatch. \n\nDescription\n\nMegapodes are medium-sized to large terrestrial birds with large legs and feet with sharp claws. They range from 28 to 70 cm. The largest members of the clade are the species of Alectura and Talegalla. The smallest are the Micronesian scrubfowl (Megapodius laperouse) and the Moluccan scrubfowl (Eulipoa wallacei). They have small heads, short beaks, and rounded and large wings. Their flying abilities vary within the clade. They present the hallux at the same level of the other toes just like the species of the clade Cracidae. The other Galliformes have their  halluces raised above the level of the front toes. \n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nMegapodes are found in the broader Australasian region, including islands in the western Pacific, Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Indonesia east of the Wallace Line, but also the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The distribution of the family has contracted in the Pacific with the arrival of humans, and a number of island groups such as Fiji, Tonga, and New Caledonia have lost many or all of their species.\n\nBehaviour and ecology\n\nMegapodes are mainly solitary birds that do not incubate their eggs with their body heat as other birds do, but bury them. Their eggs are unique in having a large yolk, making up 50-70% of the egg weight. They are best known for building massive nest-mounds of decaying vegetation, which the male attends, adding or removing litter to regulate the internal heat while the eggs hatch. However, some bury their eggs in other ways; there are burrow-nesters which use geothermal heat, and others which simply rely on the heat of the sun warming sand. Some species vary their incubation strategy depending on the local environment.Steadman D, (2006). Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds, University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-77142-7  Although the Australian brushturkey was thought to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, this was later proven false;  temperature does, however, affect embryo mortality and resulting offspring sex ratios.  The non-social nature of their incubation raises questions as to how the hatchlings come to recognise other members of their species, which is due to imprinting in other members of the order Galliformes. Recent research suggests an instinctive visual recognition of specific movement patterns is made by the individual species of megapode. \n\nMegapode chicks do not have an egg tooth; they use their powerful claws to break out of the egg, and then tunnel their way up to the surface of the mound, lying on their backs and scratching at the sand and vegetable matter. Similar to other superprecocial birds, they hatch fully feathered and active, already able to fly and live independently from their parents.\n\nEggs previously assigned to Genyornis have been reassigned to giant megapode species. A lot of the dietary and chronological data previously assigned to dromornithids may instead be conssigned to giant megapodes. \n\nSpecies \n\nThe more than 20 species are in seven genera. Although the evolutionary relationships between the Megapodiidae are especially uncertain, the morphological groups are clear: \n\nMegapodiidae\n\n* Scrubfowl group\n** Genus: Macrocephalon\n*** Maleo, Macrocephalon maleo\n** Genus: Eulipoa (sometimes included in Megapodius)\n*** Moluccan megapode, Eulipoa wallacei.\n** Genus: Megapodius\n*** Tongan megapode, Megapodius pritchardii\n*** Micronesian megapode, Megapodius laperouse\n**** Marianas Island megapode, Megapodius laperouse laperouse\n**** Palau Island megapode, Megapodius laperouse senex\n*** Nicobar megapode, Megapodius nicobariensis\n*** Philippine megapode, Megapodius cumingii\n*** Sula megapode, Megapodius bernsteinii\n*** Tanimbar megapode Megapodius tenimberensis\n*** Dusky megapode, Megapodius freycinet\n**** Forsten's megapode, Megapodius (freycinet) forstenii\n*** Biak scrubfowl Megapodius geelvinkianus\n*** Melanesian megapode, Megapodius eremita\n*** Vanuatu megapode, Megapodius layardi\n*** New Guinea scrubfowl, Megapodius affinis\n*** Orange-footed scrubfowl Megapodius reinwardt\n*** †Pile-builder scrubfowl Megapodius molistructor\n*** †Viti Levu scrubfowl Megapodius amissus\n*** †Consumed scrubfowl Megapodius alimentum\n* Malleefowl group\n** Genus: Leipoa\n*** Malleefowl, Leipoa ocellata\n*** †Giant malleefowl, Leipoa gallinacea\n* Brushturkey group\n** Genus: Alectura\n*** Australian brushturkey, Alectura lathami\n** Genus: Aepypodius\n*** Wattled brushturkey, Aepypodius arfakianus\n*** Waigeo brushturkey, Aepypodius bruijnii\n** Genus: Talegalla\n*** Red-billed brushturkey, Talegalla cuvieri\n*** Black-billed brushturkey, Talegalla fuscirostris\n*** Collared brushturkey, Talegalla jobiensis\nQuestion:\nA megapode is what type of creature?\nAnswer:\nAvians\nPassage:\nChawton\nChawton is a village and civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England.  The village lies within the South Downs National Park  and is famous as the home of Jane Austen for the last eight years of her life.\n\nIn 2000, Chawton had a population of around 380. It is within the census area of Downland which has 2,149 people. \n\nVillage History\n\nChawton's recorded history begins in the Domesday survey of 1086. In the 13th century, there was a royal manor house. The owner, John St John, served as deputy to Edward I in Scotland. Henry III visited the manor on over forty occasions. The descendants of John Knight, who built the present Chawton House at the time of the Armada (1588), added to it and modified the landscape in ways that reflect changes in politics, religion and taste. One of those descendants was Elizabeth Knight, whose progresses were marked by the ringing of church bells and whose two husbands both had to adopt her surname.   Later in the 18th century, Jane Austen's brother Edward Austen Knight (who had been adopted by the Knights) succeeded, and in 1809 was able to move his mother and sisters to a cottage in the village.\n\nVisitor attractions\n\nChawton Cottage\n\n\"Chawton Cottage\", Jane Austen's house and garden are open to the public.\n\nChawton House\n\nChawton House, the 400-year-old grade ll* listed Elizabethan manor house that once belonged to Jane Austen's brother and 275 acre of land, has been restored as part of a major international project to establish the new Centre for the Study of Early Women's Writing, 1600–1830. It houses a collection of over 9,000 volumes, together with some related manuscripts. Visitors can see the relationship between the library, the house, the estate and a working farm of the 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIn 1992 a 125-year lease on the house was purchased for £1.25 million by a foundation established by Sandra Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems. \n\nSt Nicholas Church\n\nChawton has a single church, St Nicholas.  A church has stood on the site in Chawton since at least 1270 when it was mentioned in a diocesan document.  The church suffered a disastrous fire in 1871 which destroyed all but the chancel.  The rebuilt church was designed by Sir Arthuer Blomfield and is now listed Grade 2*. \n\nThe churchyard was reserved for burial for the Knight family, and the graves include that of Jane Austen's mother and sister, both called Cassandra.  \n\nServices\n\nChawton C of E Primary School is the only school in Chawton.  It is within the Diocese of Winchester and accepts children from ages four to eleven, and has close ties with St Nicholas's church.  There has been a school on the site since about 1840, and the site sits opposite the village green and cricket field. \n\nThere are no retail stores in Chawton.  On Winchester Road, which runs through the village, there is a tea shop opposite Jane Austen's house called Cassandra's Cup, which is named after Jane Austen's sister.  Just down the road from this is a Fuller's pub called The Greyfriar which has an oak beamed traditional bar, a secluded beer garden and a large car park.  Also on Winchester Road is the Village Hall.\n\nAdjacent to Gosport Road lies a green containing a cricket pitch and the home of Chawton Cricket Club,  a newly refurbished playground and a set of allotments.\n\nTransport\n\nChawton has only two road exits, one leading to a roundabout connected to the A31 and the A32, and the other to the A339/B3006 Selborne Road.\n\nThe nearest railway station is 1.7 miles (2.7 km) northeast of the village, at Alton.\n\nThree bus routes run through the village: \n* Bus 38 - which runs from Alton to Petersfield\n* Bus 64/X64 - which runs from Alton to Winchester\n* Bus 205 - which runs from Holybourne to East Tisted\nQuestion:\nWhich author lived at 'Chawton'?\nAnswer:\nJane austen\nPassage:\nPolitician\nA politician (from Classical Greek πόλις, \"polis\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government.  In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office.  In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues.  Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government.  Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.  Broadly speaking, a \"politician\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.\n\nIdentity \n\nPoliticians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics.  Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments.   Some elected law enforcement officers, such as sheriffs, are considered politicians.  \n\nMedia and rhetoric\n\nPoliticians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements. They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.  Politicians of necessity become expert users of the media.   Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters.  In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign.   In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smart phones. \n\nRumor  has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one's own side. \n\nBureaucracy and spoils\n\nOnce elected, the politician becomes a government official and has to deal with a permanent bureaucracy of non-politicians. Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.  In patronage-based systems, such as the United States and Canada in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the bureaucracy with local politicians who formed their base of support, the \"spoils system\".  Civil service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of government services that were involved.   However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today. \n\nCareers\n\nMattozzi and Merlo argue that there are two main career paths which are typically followed by politicians in modern democracies. First come the career politicians. They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement. Second are the \"political careerists\". These are politicians who gain reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nNumerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections.   In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians.  For example, there are studies of the \"Supermadre\" model in Latin American politics. \n\nMany politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were renowned for their memories.  \n\nOther studies show that politicians have simple brains, lacking the complex personalities that other people display. \n\nCriticism\n\nMany critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public. Areas of friction include the manner in which politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to \"obscure, mislead, and confuse\". \n\nIn the popular image, many politicians are corrupt, taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public  good. \n\nMany ex-politicians who could not bear the leadership in politics that causes reprisals for critical thought criticize those who remain politicians for lacking critical thought.\nQuestion:\nThe memoirs of which US politican are called Decision Points?\nAnswer:\nGeorge Walker Bush\nPassage:\nHistory: September 10, 1960: 1st Sub-Saharan African Wins ...\nHistory and HeadlinesHistory: September 10, 1960: 1st Sub-Saharan African Wins Olympic Gold Medal - History and Headlines\nNo Comments\nA Brief History\nOn September 10, 1960, the final event of the Summer Olympics held in Rome, Italy, was the scene of the first Sub-Saharan African (Black) to win an Olympic Gold Medal.  Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia won the prestigious Olympic Marathon race (about 26.2 miles long) and won it in high fashion, that is, barefoot!\nDigging Deeper\nOnly 126 lbs, this slim 5’11” runner was 28 years old when he ran his historic race, and for good measure he won the Olympic Gold Medal in the Marathon in the 1964 Olympics as well.  The course of events that led to Bikila’s historic performance makes for a good background story.  The only reason he even went to Rome to compete was because another Ethiopian runner had taken ill and Bikila was a last minute substitute.  On top of that, because of the late addition to the team, running shoe company Adidas that sponsored the Olympics did not have shoes for Bikila that fit properly, which is why he ran barefoot.  He won in record time by a 25 second margin.\nIn the 1964 Olympics Bikila competed as the reigning champion and would not surprise anyone this time.  Between his Olympic Gold Medal performances, Bikila won every Marathon he ran except a disappointing 5th place in the 1963 Boston Marathon.  In fact, Boston was the only Marathon Bikila ran (completed) in his career that he did not win.\nDisaster nearly struck 40 days before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics when Bikila came down with appendicitis and required surgery.  Though he traveled to Tokyo, he was not expected to run.  Bikila did choose to run, and won his second Olympic Gold Medal, once again setting a new record, while becoming the first man to win a second Olympic Marathon.  His emperor, Haile Selassie, presented Bakila with a brand new Volkswagen Beetle.  No kidding.\nIn 1968 disaster did indeed strike, and Bikila had to pull out of the Olympic Marathon due to injury to his knee.  It seems he had earlier broken a bone in his foot as well.  In 1969 an even bigger disaster struck when Bikila swerved his Volkswagen to avoid protesters in the roadway.  He wrecked his car and became a quadriplegic from his injuries.  In 1973 Bikila died at age 41 of a cerebral hemorrhage, leaving a legacy of excellence by Sub-Saharan (Black) African long distance runners to follow.\nOf course, Black African athletes had won Olympic Gold Medals before Bikila, but not representing an African nation.  African-Americans such as Jesse Owens had won Olympic Gold, but Bikila was the first to bring his medal back to Africa.  Since Bikila’s heroics, Olympic Marathons have been won by athletes from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, and twice Ethiopian women have won the Olympic Marathon.\nWhat other Sub-Saharan African athletes can you think of that have achieved greatness?  Please tell us your favorites.\nIf you liked this article and would like to receive notification of new articles, please feel welcome to subscribe to History and Headlines by entering your email address at the top right of this page or like us on Facebook .\nYour readership is much appreciated!\nHistorical Evidence\nQuestion:\nIn 1960, who became the first Sub-Saharan African to win an Olympic Gold Medal?\nAnswer:\nAbeba Bikila\nPassage:\nJoe Yule\nNinian Joseph Ewell, known professionally as Joe Yule (April 30, 1892 – March 30, 1950),  was a Scottish-American vaudeville comedian who later appeared in many films as a character actor. He was noted for his role in the Jiggs and Maggie film series, and as the father of Mickey Rooney.\n\nEwell was born in the Polmadie district of Glasgow, and emigrated circa 1900 with his parents to the United States.  As a teenager he joined the vaudeville circuit and adopted the stage name Joe Yule.  In 1919, he married fellow vaudevillian Nellie W. Carter, a native of Kansas City, Missouri. In 1920, while they were appearing together in a Brooklyn production of A Gaiety Girl, their only son,  Joseph Yule, Jr. (later Mickey McGuire, then Mickey Rooney), was born.  The Yules separated in 1924 during a slump in vaudeville, and in 1925 Nellie moved with her son to Hollywood. When the elder Yule died 25 years later from a heart attack one month before he turned 58,  Rooney arranged to have his father buried next to Rooney's friend and longtime acting colleague Wallace Beery, who had died a few years prior. \"I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side,\" he wrote. \n\nFilmography\n\n*Idiot's Delight (1939)\n*Fast and Furious (1939)\n*The Secret of Dr. Kildare (1939)\n*Sudden Money (1939)\n*Judge Hardy and Son (1939)\n*New Moon (1940)\n*Strike Up the Band (1940)\n*Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940)\n*Boom Town (1940)\n*Florian (1940)\n*Go West (1940)\n*Forty Little Mothers (1940)\n*The Wild Man of Borneo (1941)\n*Sucker List (short, 1941)\n\n*Come Live With Me (1941)\n*The Trial of Mary Dugan (1941)\n*Married Bachelor (1941)\n*Maisie Was a Lady (1941)\n*Kathleen (1941)\n*I'll Wait for You (1941)\n*Billy the Kid (1941)\n*Babes on Broadway (1941)\n*Woman of the Year (1942)\n*For Me and My Gal (1942)\n*Nazi Agent (1942)\n*Calling Dr. Gillespie (1942)\n\n*Mighty Lak a Goat (short, 1942)\n*Famous Boners (short, 1942)\n*Panama Hattie (1942)\n*The Omaha Trail (1942)\n*Jackass Mail (1942)\n*Born to Sing (1942)\n*Presenting Lily Mars (1943)\n*Swing Shift Maisie (1943)\n*Lost Angel (1943)\n*I Dood It (1943)\n*Harrigan's Kid (1943)\n*Air Raid Wardens (1943)\n\n*Meet the People (1944)\n*Radio Bugs (short, 1944)\n*Kismet (1944)\n*Nothing But Trouble (1944)\n*Bringing Up Father (1946)\n*Murder in the Music Hall (1946)\n*The Mighty McGurk (1946)\n*Jiggs and Maggie in Society (1947)\n* Jiggs and Maggie in Court (1948)\n*Jiggs and Maggie in Jackpot Jitters (1949)\n*Jiggs and Maggie Out West (1950)\nQuestion:\nJoe Yule Jr born 1920 became famous as who?\nAnswer:\nRooneyesque\n", "answers": ["Ettrick shepherd", "The ettrick shepherd", "The Ettrick Shepherd", "James Hogg"], "length": 7446, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fa2666d5e42eda29f2e6cf4263659cb40c8a98020481cc65"}

On the day Bobbyjo was the subject of a huge gamble that saw him sent off at the short odds of 10/1 with Paul Carberry, the son of the trainer Tommy in the saddle. As coincidence had it, Tommy had been the rider twenty-four years earlier, the last time an Irish trained runner had won the race. \n\nThe victory signalled an upturn in fortunes for Irish trained runners in the decade that followed, though he himself completed the course well beaten when defending his crown in 1999.\n\nBobbyjo broke a knee at Fairyhouse Racecourse in February 2001 and had to be destroyed one month later due to his incurable injuries.

The daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, she was born in the caverns beneath Mount Olympus. She and her sister Euryale were both immortal, and the third sister, Medusa, was mortal.  \n\nOf the three Gorgons, she was known to be the most independent and ferocious, having killed more men than both of her sisters combined. In Greek mythology, she was transformed into a Gorgon because of standing with her sister Medusa, who was raped by the sea god Poseidon in the Temple of Athena. Athena bearing no emotion and finding no fault in Poseidon, was furious with Medusa. As a punishment, Medusa was changed into a terrible monster, along with her sisters Stheno and Euryale. Stheno tends to be depicted as a thin gorgon monster with red snakes curling around her head instead of hair, however earlier accounts describe her as having a scaly head, a boar's tusks, bronzed hands, a protruding tongue, glaring eyes and a snake around the waist as a belt. \n\nWhen the gorgon Medusa was beheaded by Perseus, Stheno and Euryale tried to kill him, but failed due to his use of Hades' cap, becoming invisible.\nQuestion:\nIn Greek legend, what were Stheno, Euryale and Medusa, winged female monsters with snakes for hair who turned mortals to stone if they looked directly at them?\nAnswer:\nLoud-roaring\nPassage:\nPretty Woman (1990) - Quotes - IMDb\nPretty Woman (1990) - Quotes - IMDb\nPretty Woman (1990)\nVivian : People put you down enough, you start to believe it.\nEdward Lewis : I think you are a very bright, very special woman.\nVivian : The bad stuff is easier to believe.

They are a World Heritage Site and include the Semien Mountains National Park. The mountains consist of plateaux separated by valleys and rising to pinnacles.  The tallest peak is Ras Dashen (4,550 m); other notable heights include Mounts Biuat (4,437 m) and Kidis Yared (4,453 m). \n\nBecause of their geological origins the mountains are almost unique, with only South Africa's Drakensberg having been formed in the same manner and thus appearing similar. Notable animals in the mountains include the walia ibex, gelada, and caracal. There are a few Ethiopian wolves. \n\nHuman history \n\nAlthough the word Semien means \"north\" in Amharic, according to Richard Pankhurst the ancestral form of the word actually meant \"south\" in Ge'ez, because the mountains lay to the south of Aksum, which was at the time the center of Ethiopian civilization. But as over the following centuries the center of Ethiopian civilization itself moved to the south, these mountains came to be thought of as lying to the north, and the meaning of the word likewise changed. \n\nThe Semiens are remarkable as being one of the few spots in Africa where snow regularly falls.  First mentioned in the Monumentum Adulitanum of the 4th century AD (which described them as \"inaccessible mountains covered with snow\" and where soldiers walked up to their knees in snow), the presence of snow was undeniably witnessed by the 17th century Jesuit priest Jerónimo Lobo.  Although the later traveler James Bruce claims that he had never witnessed snow in the Semien Mountains, the 19th century explorer Henry Salt not only recorded that he saw snow there (on 9 April 1814), but explained the reason for Bruce's failure to see snow in these mountains – Bruce had ventured no further than the foothills into the Semiens. \n\nDespite their ruggedness and altitude, the mountains are dotted with villages linked by tracks. Historically they were inhabited by Ethiopian Jews (the Beta Israel), who after repeated attacks by the zealous Christian Emperors in the 15th century withdrew from the province of Dembiya into the more defensible Semien mountains. \n\nTowards the end of the Zemene Mesafint, Dejazmach Wube Haile Mariam maintained his arsenal and treasury on Mount Hai. \n\nGallery\n\nSemien Mountains 02.jpg|\nSemien Mountains 01.jpg|\nSemienWaterfall.jpg|Waterfall in Semien Mountains, falling into the Gishe Abbai, near Debarq.\nGelada 02.jpg|A gelada in the Semien Mountains\nQuestion:\nThe Semien Mountains whose highest peak is Ras Dashen lie in what African country?\nAnswer:\nEthiopean\nPassage:\nRobe\nA robe is a  loose-fitting outer garment. Unlike garments described as capes or cloaks, robes usually have sleeves. The English word robe derives from Middle English robe (\"garment\"), borrowed from Old French robe (\"booty, spoils\"), itself taken from the Frankish word *rouba (\"spoils, things stolen, clothes\"), and is related to the word rob. There are various types of robes, including:\n\n* A gown worn as part of the academic regalia of faculty or students, especially for ceremonial occasions, such as a convocations, congregations or graduations.\n* A gown worn as part of the attire of a judge or barrister.\n* A wide variety of long, flowing religious dress including pulpit robes and the robes worn by various types of monks.\n* A gown worn as part of the official dress of a peer or royalty.\n* Any of several women's fashions, as robe d'anglaise (18th century), \"robe de style\" (1920s).\n* A gown worn in fantasy literature and role-playing games by wizards and other magical characters.\n* A \"bathrobe\" worn mostly after bathing or swimming. A typical bathrobe is made of an absorbent material such as towelling, and might be worn at home after a bath, to keep warm and preserve modesty if there is no need to dress. A similar garment not made of absorbent material might be called a dressing gown or housecoat.  See, for example, that worn by the fictional character Arthur Dent.\n* (Informal usage) Any long flowing garment; for example, a cassock is sometimes called a robe, although a cassock is close-fitting.\nQuestion:\nDeriving from the French for 'long coat', what name is given to the close-fitting, ankle length robe worn by Christian clergymen?\nAnswer:\nCassocks\nPassage:\nAllegheny County Courthouse\nThe Allegheny County Courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is\npart of a complex (along with the old Allegheny County Jail) designed by H. H. Richardson.  The buildings are considered among the finest examples of the Romanesque Revival style for which Richardson is well known.\n\nThe complex is bordered by wide thoroughfares named for city founders James Ross (Ross Street), John Forbes (Forbes Avenue) and James Grant (Grant Street).   The current building, completed in 1888, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.  Richardson later referred to it as his \"great achievement\". \n\nEarly structures\n\nPittsburgh's original courthouse, first occupied in 1794, was a wooden structure located on one side of Market Square.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and from December 7, 1818, until 1841 the Western District of Pennsylvania also held court sessions at Market Square. \n\nLand for a new courthouse was purchased in April, 1834. This was a tract of land on the corner of Fourth and Grant Streets, on Grant's Hill. Construction took place between 1836 and 1840. This court house was built with polished gray sandstone, quarried at Coal Hill (present-day Mount Washington), opposite Water Street along the Monongahela River. The building was designed by John Chislett. The Greek Revival design included a domed cupola housing a rotunda 60 ft in diameter and 80 ft high. The building was completed in 1841.  The building's second floor again served as the headquarters for both the Commonwealth Supreme Court Pittsburgh region and the Federal Western District, serving the latter until a new U.S. Customs House/Post Office opened on Fifth and Smithfield in 1853. Due to corrosion caused by coal smoke, the building deteriorated: the dressed surface of the facade dropped off, some of the cornices near the roof began to fall, and the building had a scaly appearance. Even in its deteriorated state, it was a handsome structure. On May 7, 1882, a fire broke out and ruined the building.  Subsequently, it was demolished. The third, and present, courthouse was erected on the same spot. \n\nCurrent structure\n\nFollowing the destruction of the 2nd courthouse, Allegheny County Commissioners decided to hold a competition to design a replacement. The winner of the competition was Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and construction of the buildings was begun by the Norcross Brothers, Richardson’s construction firm of choice, in 1884.\n\nThe design of the main building, which Richardson considered to be his finest, was innovative in that the building is built around an interior courtyard, thus allowing natural light and fresh air to reach most of the building. The courtyard is surrounded by four stories in three sides. A tower rises five stories from the courtyard’s open side. As was usually the case with Richardson’s buildings, the roof is steep with dormers placed at all the corners.\n\nA prison is connected to the courthouse via the \"Bridge of Sighs\". The design was based on the Bridge of Sighs in Venice. The entire complex was built of large rusticated blocks of granite, with the entrance ways and windows topped with wide arches.  This gives the building a heavy, stable and dignified appearance.\n\nIn the 1900s the street level in front of the building was lowered as part of a general re-grading of Pittsburgh.  Richardson had anticipated this and courses of finished masonry had been buried underground, now to be revealed. Unfortunately this left the ceremonial entrance a full story above the street. A grand stairway was built, but removed during street widening in the 1930s- the low arched doorways were extended downwards to street level, with the result that the visitor is not greeted by the grand entrance hall Richardson planned, but by the low corridors which were once the basement.\n\nMuralist Vincent Nesbert completed five murals for the building on its second floor in 1940: \"Industry,\" \"Justice,\" \"Peace,\" \"Fort Duquesne\" and \"The Battle of Grant's Hill.\"\n\nIn 1973, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  In 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nLegacy and impact\n\nThe design of the Allegheny County Courthouse has influenced buildings in many cities across America, such as Minneapolis City Hall, Altgeld Hall on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and James W. McLaughlin's Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond, Indiana.\n\nIn 2007, the American Institute of Architects asked Harris Interactive to survey 2,000 people, who were shown 247 photographs of buildings and other structures in different categories chosen by 2,500 architects. The Allegheny County Courthouse was ranked 35th overall on the list and above every other courthouse in the nation except the United States Supreme Court Building. \n\nIn popular culture\n\nSeveral big-budget films have portrayed the Courthouse.  Striking Distance and  Hoffa primarily used interior shots, while Desperate Measures and \nThe Next Three Days used both interior and exterior shots, with Boys on the Side and Mrs. Soffel featuring the Ross Street side of the complex and the \"Bridge of Sighs\". The interior of the Courthouse is also visible in the 2013 film The Next Three Days.\n\nGallery \n\nFile:AlleghenyCountyCourthouseCourtyard.jpg|Courthouse Courtyard\nFile:AlleghenyCountyCourthouseFountain.jpg|Fountain in the Courtyard\nFile:RichardsonAlleghanyCH4.jpg|Interior courtyard\nFile:Allegheny County Courthouse skyway over Ross St in Pittsburgh.jpg|Bridge of Sighs\nFile:FormerAlleghenyCountyJail.jpg|The former Allegheny County Jail\nQuestion:\nIn which European city is the sixteenth century limestone Bridge of Sighs?\nAnswer:\nSestiere (Venice)\nPassage:\nSukhoi\nSukhoi Company (JSC; ) is a major Russian aircraft manufacturer, headquartered in Begovoy District, Northern Administrative Okrug, Moscow,  and designs both civilian and military aircraft. It was founded by Pavel Sukhoi in 1939 as the Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB-51, design office prefix Su).\n\nCompany history\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, each of the multitude of bureaus and factories producing Sukhoi components was privatized independently. In 1996, the government re-gathered the major part of them forming Sukhoi Aviation Military Industrial Combine (Sukhoi AIMC). In parallel, other entities, including Ulan Ude factory, Tbilisi factory, Belarus and Ukraine factories, established alternate transnational Sukhoi Attack Aircraft (producing e.g. Su-25 TM).\n\nThe Sukhoi AIMC comprises the JSC Sukhoi Design Bureau located in Moscow, the Novosibirsk Aviation Production Association (NAPO), the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) and Irkutsk Aviation. Sukhoi is headquartered in Moscow. Finmeccanica (since 2016, Leonardo-Finmeccanica) owns 25% + 1 share of Sukhoi's civil division.   The Russian government merged Sukhoi with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, and Yakovlev as a new company named United Aircraft Corporation.   Mikoyan and Sukhoi were placed within the same operating unit. \n\nSukhoi is also working on what is to be Russia's fifth-generation stealth fighter, the Sukhoi PAK FA. The maiden flight took place on the 29 January 2010.[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/2010/01/venajalla_esiteltiin_uusi_havittajakone_1405552.html Venäjällä esiteltiin uusi hävittäjäkone | Ulkomaat | YLE Uutiset | yle.fi]\n\nUsage\n\nSukhoi's Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, Su-30, Su-34, Su-35 and shipborne Su-33 aircraft are in service with the Russian Air Force and Navy as well as foreign armies. The Su-25 is the oldest Sukhoi still in production. Sukhoi attack and fighter aircraft have been supplied to Armenia, India, China, Poland, the Czech Republic, Iraq, Slovakia, Hungary, Georgia, East Germany, Syria, North Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Libya, Iran, Angola, Ethiopia, Peru, Eritrea, and Indonesia. Venezuela signed contracts for the purchase of 30 Su-30 fighter jets in July 2006. More than 2,000 Sukhoi aircraft were supplied to foreign countries on export contracts. With its Su-26, Su-29 and Su-31 models Sukhoi is also a manufacturer of aerobatic aircraft.\n\nU.S. sanctions\n\nOn August 4, 2006, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on Sukhoi for allegedly supplying Iran in violation of the United States Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000.  Sukhoi was prohibited from doing business with the United States Federal Government.   In November 2006, the U.S. State Department reversed its sanctions against Sukhoi.[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/21432/us-lifts-sanctions-on-jet-maker-sukhoi US lifts sanctions on jet maker Sukhoi – World – GMA News Online – Latest Philippine News]\n\nCivilian aircraft\n\nIn September 2007, Russia launched its first modern commercial regional airliner—the Superjet 100, a 78 to 98 seater, built by Sukhoi.

The primary characteristics of the kipper tie are its extreme breadth (normally 4.5–5 inches) and often garish colours and patterns.\n\nDesign origin \n\nWide neckties were fashionable in the 1940s: first among Zoot suiters rebelling against wartime austerity, and later as part of the \"Bold Look\" worn by World War II veterans returning to civilian life.  Ties of this period often featured bright colors and bold prints, including birds, animals, and floral designs like Paisley. British comedian Max Miller was well known for wearing suits and wide ties made from the same fabric as Aloha shirts. \n\nKipper ties made a comeback among the younger generation during the late 1960s and early 70s as the thin ties and slim fitting Mod suits began to be replaced by the precursors to disco fashion.  British fashion designer Michael Fish designed the kipper tie in 1966 working out of his establishment in Piccadilly. \n\nRevival\n\nDespite the backlash against disco during the early 1980s, thinner kipper ties continued to be worn, often with double breasted power suits. The end of the 80s saw ultra thin ties become fashionable, together with 1950s inspired bolo ties. In the mid-1990s, kipper ties made a comeback due to a resurgence of interest in 1970s fashion.  These were typically darker and less kitsch than those from its hey-day. By the 2000s, however, wide ties had become associated with older men, and fell out of favour as skinny ties influenced by indie pop and Mod subculture became fashionable. \n\nName of the tie \n\nIt has alternately been proposed that the name \"kipper tie\" is a reference to the extreme breadth of the tie resembling a kipper,  or a sly reference to the designer, whose last name, Fish, was evocative of a kipper.  \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to a brightly coloured and very wide tie?\nAnswer:\nKipper tie\nPassage:\nGateshead Millennium Bridge\nThe Gateshead Millennium Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist tilt bridge spanning the River Tyne in England between Gateshead's Quays arts quarter on the south bank, and the Quayside of Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank. Opened for public use in 2001, the award-winning structure was conceived and designed by architect Wilkinson Eyre and structural engineer Gifford.  The bridge is sometimes referred to as the 'Blinking Eye Bridge'  or the 'Winking Eye Bridge'  due to its shape and its tilting method. In terms of height, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge is slightly shorter than the neighbouring Tyne Bridge, and stands as the sixteenth tallest structure in the city.\n\nDesign\n\nThe bridge was lifted into place in one piece by the Asian Hercules II,  one of the world's largest floating cranes, on 20 November 2000. It was opened to the public on 17 September 2001, and was dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 2002.  The bridge, which cost £22m to build, was part funded by the Millennium Commission and European Regional Development Fund. It was built by Volker Stevin. \n\nSix 45 cm diameter hydraulic rams (three on each side, each powered by a 55 kW electric motor) rotate the bridge back on large bearings to allow small ships and boats (up to 25 m tall) to pass underneath.  The bridge takes as little as 4.5 minutes to rotate through the full 40° from closed to open, depending on wind speed.  Its appearance during this manoeuvre has led to it being nicknamed the \"Blinking Eye Bridge\".\n\nThe bridge has operated reliably since construction, opening to allow river traffic to pass. It also opens periodically for sightseers and for major events such as the Northumbrian Water University Boat Race and the Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race. One of the principal requirements for opening the bridge is to allow access to HMS Calliope where Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Example is based.\n\nFor the construction of the bridge, the architect Wilkinson Eyre won the 2002 Royal Institute of British Architects Stirling Prize and Gifford the 2003 IStructE Supreme Award.  \nIn 2005, the bridge received the Outstanding Structure Award  from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.\n\nBollards were installed when the bridge was built to protect it from collisions. As the bollards were unsightly, and as it became noted that they were not really needed, they were removed in March 2012. \n\nTilt times for the bridge are displayed both on the bridge itself, and also on a page on the [http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/attractions/bridge/Home.aspx Gateshead Council] website.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nImage:Millenium bridge close.jpg|View along the bridge from the Gateshead side\nFile:Gateshead Millennium Bridge, Front.JPG|The bridge at night\nImage:Gateshead Millennium Bridge.jpg|Gateshead Millennium Bridge when cars had been put in the River Tyne as part of Artwork\nImage:A close-up of the Pivots as the Gateshead Millennium Bridge opens.jpg|A close-up of the Pivots as the bridge opens.\nImage:MBN.jpg|Gateshead quayside across the River Tyne at night\nImage:Bridge over the river grim.JPG|View of the bridge by night from the Newcastle side\nImage:Millenniumbridge7 640.JPG|View of the bridge by day from the Newcastle side\nImage:Tyne Millennium bridge.jpg|A view taken from on the Millennium bridge itself, looking west (upriver) at dusk, showing the coloured lighting\nImage:PZarobkiewiczMilleniumNewcastle 01.jpg|A night view of Millennium bridge, photo taken from the northern embankment looking west\nImage:PZarobkiewiczMilleniumNewcastle 02.jpg|A night view taken from on the Millennium bridge, looking west\nQuestion:\nThe Bridge referred to locally as The Blinking Eye Bridge, or the Winking Eye Bridge spans which river?\nAnswer:\nTyne\nPassage:\nMohs scale of mineral hardness\nThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness is a qualitative ordinal scale that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. It was created in 1812 by the German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science, some of which are more quantitative.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387714/Mohs-hardness \"Mohs hardness\"] in Encyclopædia Britannica Online The method of comparing hardness by seeing which minerals can visibly scratch others, however, is of great antiquity, having been mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise On Stones, c. 300 BC, followed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, c. 77 AD.    While greatly facilitating the identification of minerals in the field, the Mohs scale does not show how well hard materials perform in an industrial setting. \n\nUsage\n\nDespite its simplicity and lack of precision, the Mohs scale is highly relevant for field geologists, who use the scale to roughly identify minerals using scratch kits. The Mohs scale hardness of minerals can be commonly found in reference sheets. Reference materials may be expected to have a uniform Mohs hardness.\n\nMinerals\n\nThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on the ability of one natural sample of mineral to scratch another mineral visibly. The samples of matter used by Mohs are all different minerals. Minerals are pure substances found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals.  As the hardest known naturally occurring substance when the scale was designed, diamonds are at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, and/or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale would fall between 4 and 5.  \"Scratching\" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-elastic dislocations visible to the naked eye. Frequently, materials that are lower on the Mohs scale can create microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. While these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental to the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered \"scratches\" for the determination of a Mohs scale number. \n\nThe Mohs scale is a purely ordinal scale. For example, corundum (9) is twice as hard as topaz (8), but diamond (10) is four times as hard as corundum. The table below shows the comparison with the absolute hardness measured by a sclerometer, with pictorial examples.  \n\nOn the Mohs scale, a streak plate (unglazed porcelain) has a hardness of 7.0. Using these ordinary materials of known hardness can be a simple way to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.\n\nIntermediate hardness\n\nThe table below incorporates additional substances that may fall between levels:\n\nHardness (Vickers) \n\nComparison between Hardness (Mohs) and Hardness (Vickers):\nQuestion:\nOn the Mohs scale of hardness, what is the second hardest mineral, after diamond?\nAnswer:\nCorundum structure\nPassage:\nVictoria, Seychelles\nVictoria (sometimes called Port Victoria) is the capital city of the Seychelles and is situated on the north-eastern side of Mahé island, the archipelago's main island. The city was first established as the seat of the British colonial government. In 2010, the population of Greater Victoria (including the suburbs) was 26,450 out of the country's total population of 90,945. \n\nThe principal exports of Victoria are vanilla, coconuts, coconut oil, fish and guano.\n\nAttractions in the city include a clocktower modelled on that of Vauxhall Clock Tower in London, England, the Courthouse, the Victoria Botanical Gardens, the Victoria National Museum of History, the Victoria Natural History Museum and the Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market. Victoria Market is the local hotspot for the Seychellois people and the brightly coloured fish and fruit markets are not to be missed. Also nearby is the gallery of the renowned local artist Georges Camille.\n\nThe city is home to the national stadium, the International School Seychelles and a polytechnic.\n\nVictoria is served by Seychelles International Airport, completed in 1971. The inner harbour lies immediately east of the town, where tuna fishing and canning forms a major local industry. One of the largest bridges in Victoria was destroyed by tsunami waves from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area that would become Victoria was originally settled in 1778 by French colonists after they claimed the island in 1756, but it wasn't until after the Treaty of Paris of 1814 was signed that the British formally established Victoria and gave it its modern name.  \n\nDistrict\n\nVictoria proper is composed of parts of three Districts of Seychelles:\n#English River (La Riviere Anglaise) (the innermost part)\n#Saint Louis\n#Mont Fleuri\n\nGreater Victoria encompasses these three, and five more of the 25 Districts of Seychelles as follows:\n#Mont Buxton\n#Bel Air\n#Roche Caiman\n#Les Mamelles\n#Plaisance\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\n\nVictoria is twinned with:\n\nClimate\n\nVictoria features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af) with high temperatures throughout the course of the year. The capital does have noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year, with June and July being its driest months and December through February being the city's wettest months. However, since in no month does the average monthly precipitation falls below 60 mm in Victoria, the city does not have a true dry season month. This lack of a true dry season month is a primary reason why the climate falls under the tropical rainforest climate category. The capital averages about 2,000 mm of precipitation annually. Although being very rainy, skies are usually clear to partly clear and completely cloudy days remain scarce throughout the year even during the rainiest months.\nQuestion:\nVictoria is the capital of which group of islands in the Indian Ocean?\nAnswer:\nSeychelles islands\n", "answers": ["Carberry", "Carberry (disambiguation)"], "length": 5625, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "24e4a2bb6b981fad0bd71c8974512c65ee7defd515f0af47"}

The History Learning Site, 17 Mar 2015. 16 Aug 2016.\nThe English Civil War started in 1642 when Charles I raised his royal standard in Nottingham. The split between Charles and Parliament was such that neither side was willing to back down over the principles that they held and war was inevitable as a way in which all problems could be solved. The country split into those who supported the king and those who supported Parliament – the classic ingredients for a civil war.\n \nAs with most wars during the C17th, the English Civil War was not a long continuous war. Armies lacked mobility and the time taken to collect the most basic of equipment meant that there were long periods of time when no fighting was taking place despite England being at war at the time. The weather was also a major determining factor in whether armies could fight or not. Roads were no more than tracks and the winter could cut them up to make them beyond use. Therefore moving any armies around would be very difficult.\n \nThere were only three major battles in the English Civil War – Edge Hill (1642) Marston Moor (1644) and Naseby (1645).\n \nWhile it is difficult to give an exact breakdown of who supported who as there were regional variations, at a general level the nobility, landowners and Anglicans supported Charles I while those in the towns and cities supported Parliament. However, this is a generalisation and there were noblemen who supported Parliament and there were towns such as Newark that supported Charles.\n \nThe first major battle of the English Civil War was at Edge Hill. While both sides claimed success, there was no decisive result from this battle. The following year, 1643, saw a series of smaller battles that were equally as indecisive in the sense that neither side dealt a fatal blow to the other. In 1643, Oliver Cromwell came more and more to the fore with his desire for a New Model Army. This new force was to have a decisive impact on the course of the English Civil War.\n \nIn 1644, Charles lost control of the north of England as a result of a major defeat at the Battle of Marston Moor. The combined armies of Parliament and the Scots heavily defeated the Royalists.\n \nIn June 1645, Cromwell’s New Model Army inflicted a fatal blow to the king’s army at the Battle of Naseby. Charles did not recover from this defeat and his cause was lost.\n \nIn 1646, Charles surrendered to the Scots rather than to Parliament. He hoped to take advantage of the fact that the Scottish and Parliamentary alliance was fragile and could collapse at any time. In fact, the Scots took advantage of Charles and sold him to Parliament for £400,000 in January 1647. The problem Parliament now had was what to do with Charles. The king actually helped in his own downfall. In November 1647, he escaped to Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight and in 1648 the short-lived second civil war broke out. The supporters of the king were defeated at Preston. All that Charles had proved to Parliament was that he could not be trusted.\n \nCharles was tried at Westminster Hall in January 1649, and found guilty that he had “traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament and the people therein represented.”\nQuestion:\nThe first major battle of the English Civil War ended in stalemate in 1642 – what was it?\nAnswer:\nEdge Hill (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nVolkswagen History: page 5 - Westminster College\nVolkswagen History: page 5\n \n \n    Beetles built before 1953 (and some during that year) looked almost identical to the KdF Wagen designed before WWII. Midway in 1953, Volkswagen changed the rear split windows of the Beetles, and added a slightly larger oval window. This oval window was said to increase visibility out of the rear of the car up to 33%. By 1955, Volkswagen came out with a new model called the Karmann Ghia. It used many parts from the Beetle to keep production cheaper, and  less complex. The Karmann Ghia was a joint venture by companies Karmann (builds VW Beetle cabriolets) and Ghia.\n    Volkswagen production kept increasing through the late 1950s. In 1958, the larger rear window that most people see in Beetles today  (Ovals and Splits are much more rare than the larger window Beetles) was adopted. In each year, minor changes were made to the Beetle, and the other cars in Volkswagen's  lineup, but nothing very drastic. Different turn signals were added, slightly improved engines, and other small things were common in the year to year changes. Volkswagen also had a very successful advertising campaign in the 1960s which helped contribute to its success in the United States. The Disney movie, Herbie, also helped promote the Beetle. The Herbie movies portrayed the Beetle as a \"love bug.\" Later in the 1960s, Volkswagen produced over one million Beetles each year. 1969 was the most productive year for Volkswagen.\n    After the Beetle's boom years in the late 1960s, its sales began to decline. In 1967, the transporter underwent major design changes, and in 1969 on US Export Beetles, VW added CV joints in the rear of the car in an effort to improve high speed stability on American highways. The traditional swingaxle system worked Ok, but at high speeds tended to lose stability. In 1971, Volkswagen developed a *new* car called the Super Beetle. The Super Beetle had modern MacPherson struts in the front instead of the older transverse beam arrangement it had since the 1930s: this new suspension allowed the trunk to be deeper, thus creating more luggage space in the front trunk. The Super Beetles of '71 had the same windshields as the standard Beetles did, but from '72-'74, a wrap around curved windshield was implemented. These were the only Beetles to have anything in the way of a real dashboard. Super Beetles were smoother cruisers on the highway, but did not make good Baja Beetle platforms. Ever increasing US government regulations on safety and emissions controls pushed the Beetle to its limits. The Beetle could not be adapted to keep up with the  other cars in the industry. Volkswagen stopped production of the Beetle sedan in 1977, and stopped production of the cabriolet in 1979.\n    However, the Beetle was still thriving in Mexico and  South America. Volkswagen of Brazil continued building Beetles and VW Vans until  1993. Volkswagen of Mexico still hasn't stopped building Beetles! In fact, the Beetle is by far the most popular car in Mexico. Take a look at the picture to see a common view of a Mexican street: count the Beetles.\nDue to the size of the monitor I have been using, It has been very difficult to think and make this page at the same time. I am sure I have left out several key elements in VW's history, so make sure you check back every few weeks to  see if there are any new spots here and there.

In the scene, Batman and Robin have to help up Mr. Freeze who is in dire medical straits and barely conscious from overheating with his refrigerating collar being lost. Acting etiquette generally requires when that an actor is lifted up while performing, he is expected to subtly help the lifting actors by partially getting on his feet to reduce the load. In this case, Preminger instead remained limp throughout the scene and Adam West and Burt Ward had to carry him for real the entire time.

This mythical bird is surrounded by folklore and legend. Read on to know about this legendary fictitious bird.\nBy Mansi Chitranshi | Saturday, February 14, 2009\nPhoenix - To Burn Itself and Rise Again From Its Ashes\nThe phoenix bird is a symbol of immortality, rebirth and afterlife. In earliest Greek and Egyptian mythology, it is linked with the sun god. As per the Greeks, Phoenix resides in Arabia, close to a cold well. Each sunrise at dawn, the sun god would stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing a melodious song while it bathed in the well.\nOnly one phoenix exists at a time. When the bird felt its death was near, every 500 to 1,461 years, it would build a nest of aromatic wood and set it on fire. The bird then was consumed by the flames.\nLegend\nThe phoenix, germinating in the legends of ancient Egypt, has become a common emblem of reincarnation and the most legendary of all magnificent birds. Covered with red and gold feathers, it carries the color of the rising sun; it had a harmonious voice that became despondent with impending bereavement. Other mortals were then so surmounted by its beauty and melancholy that they themselves fell dead.\nThe prodigy surrounding the Phoenix bird has myriad variants, with some of the most primitive accounts dating back to 8 centuries before the Christ was born. It is said that if the Phoenix is wounded, it can cure itself and enjoy a long life span.\nWhen the Phoenix gets close to the termination of its life, it's believed to build itself a nest of fragrant spices such as cinnamon and myrrh. It then sets the nest and itself on fire and is burned to ashes. Soon after, the Phoenix rises again and starts its life anew. In some customs, the new Phoenix collects the ashes of the old and takes them to Heliopolis to present them to the Sun God.\nPortrayal - What a Phoenix Looks Like\nPhoenix, as described by appearance, has the dimension of an eagle, with gold plumage around the neck, an amethyst body, and a sapphire tail. The throat has a crown, and the head has a clump of feathers.\nTraits - Some Attributes\nThe main characteristic of the phoenix is that it is reborn through fire: when it gets aged it will make a nest and put it on fire. The phoenix will envelop in the flames, but will take another life out of the ashes.  There can be only one Phoenix at a time; its life extends for many years (accounts vary from 500, 540, 1000 or 1460 years.) No one has ever seen this bird devour.  This myth was very widespread among the Egyptians, the Greek, oriental cultures, and during ancient period.\nThe Phoenix Re-emerges\nPhoenix, as they believe, is the only bird competent of restoring and reproducing its own life form. Contrasting to other birds, the Phoenix does not nourish on seeds, but on the gum of frankincense (a pungent resin) and the juices of amomum (an herb of the ginger family)\nPhoenix represents\nPhoenix is said to represent the sun, which dies ach night and take a new birth every morning. Some traditional writers also relate it with \"existing in heaven\", enjoying everlasting adolescence. Amid Christians, it signifies reincarnation.\nAlso Referred to As\nAlso called Feng-Huang- (Chinese adaptation) in this translation, the bird is sent to the world to execute astonishing tasks and to assist the development of mankind. It emerges in diverse phases of the earth's evolution, and then proceeds to heaven.\nQuestion:\nWhat mythical bird rises from its own ashes?\nAnswer:\nPhœnix\nPassage:\nWest Texas Intermediate\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas light sweet, is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. It is the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts.\n\nThe price of WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside the price of Brent crude from the North Sea. Other important oil markers include the Dubai Crude, Oman Crude, Urals oil and the OPEC Reference Basket.  WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent, and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nWTI is a light crude oil, with an API gravity of around 39.6 and specific gravity of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a sweet crude oil (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate price settlement point\n\nCushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for crude oil and has been the delivery point for crude contracts and therefore the price settlement point for West Texas Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange for over three decades.  Although the town of Cushing, Oklahoma  is a small, remote place with only 7,826 inhabitants (according to the 2010 Census)  it became a \"vital transshipment point with many intersecting pipelines, storage facilities and easy access to refiners and suppliers\". Crude oil flows \"inbound to Cushing from all directions and outbound through dozens of pipelines\".\n It is in Payne County, Oklahoma, United States.\n\nPricing\n\nWest Texas Intermediate is used as a benchmark in oil pricing. Historically, it has traded closely to Brent and the OPEC basket but currently it has been discounted against Brent crude oil. Historical price data for WTI can be found at a website by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. It is listed as WTI, Cushing, Oklahoma. \n\nPricing anomalies\n\nOn April 13, 2007 Bloomberg reported on a Lehman Brothers study stating WTI prices were not a good barometer of world oil prices.\n  On May 24, 2007, WTI was priced at $63.58 per barrel versus $71.39 per barrel for Brent (Bloomberg). The anomaly occurred perhaps because of a temporary shortage of refining capacity. In early 2007 a large stockpile of oil at the giant Cushing, Oklahoma storage and pricing facility (mainly due to a refinery shutdown) caused price to be artificially depressed at the Cushing pricing point. As stockpiles decreased, the WTI price increased to exceed the price of Brent once again. \n\nIn February 2011, WTI was trading around $85/barrel while Brent was at $103/barrel. The reason most cited for this difference was that Cushing had reached capacity, due to a surplus of oil in the interior of North America. At the same time, Brent moved up in reaction to civil unrest in Egypt and across the Middle East. Since WTI-priced stockpiles at Cushing could not easily be transported to the Gulf Coast, WTI crude was unable to be arbitraged in bringing the two prices back to parity. Oil prices at coastal areas of the US were closer to Brent than to WTI. In June 2012, the Seaway Pipeline, which had been transporting oil from the Gulf Coast to Cushing, reversed its flow direction, to transport WTI-priced crude to the Gulf Coast, where it received Brent prices. The price difference persisted, however, and was large enough that some oil producers in North Dakota put their oil on tanker cars, and shipped it by rail to the Gulf and East coasts, where it received Brent prices.  Brent continued to trade US$10–20 higher than WTI for two years, until June 2013.  By July 2013, the disparity had shrunk to about US$4. By January 2014 the spread between the two has once again increased to over US$14, but was back down to US$4 by the end of 2014.\nQuestion:\nWest Texas Intermediate and London Brent are grades of what?\nAnswer:\nAlternatives to petroleum\nPassage:\nThe Country of the Blind\n\"The Country of the Blind\" is a short story written by H. G. Wells. It was first published in the April 1904 issue of The Strand Magazine and included in a 1911 collection of Wells's short stories, The Country of the Blind and Other Stories. It is one of Wells's best known short stories, and features prominently in literature dealing with blindness.\n\nWells later revised the story, with the expanded version first published by an English private printer, Golden Cockerel Press, in 1939.\n\nPlot summary\n\nWhile attempting to summit the unconquered crest of Parascotopetl (a fictitious mountain in Ecuador), a mountaineer named Nuñez (prn: noon-yes) slips and falls down the far side of the mountain. At the end of his descent, down a snow-slope in the mountain's shadow, he finds a valley, cut off from the rest of the world on all sides by steep precipices. Unbeknownst to Nuñez, he has discovered the fabled \"Country of the Blind\". The valley had been a haven for settlers fleeing the tyranny of Spanish rulers, until an earthquake reshaped the surrounding mountains, cutting the valley off forever from future explorers. The isolated community prospered over the years, despite a disease that struck them early on, rendering all newborns blind. As the blindness slowly spreads over many generations, the people's remaining senses sharpened, and by the time the last sighted villager had died, the community had fully adapted to life without sight.\n\nNuñez descends into the valley and finds an unusual village with windowless houses and a network of paths, all bordered by curbs. Upon discovering that everyone is blind, Nuñez begins reciting to himself the refrain, \"In the Country of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man is King\". He realises that he can teach and rule them, but the villagers have no concept of sight, and do not understand his attempts to explain this fifth sense to them. Frustrated, Nuñez becomes angry, but the villagers calm him, and he reluctantly submits to their way of life, because returning to the outside world seems impossible.\n\nNuñez is assigned to work for a villager named Yacob. He becomes attracted to Yacob's youngest daughter, Medina-Saroté. Nuñez and Medina-Saroté soon fall in love with one another, and having won her confidence, Nuñez slowly starts trying to explain sight to her. Medina-Saroté, however, simply dismisses it as his imagination. When Nuñez asks for her hand in marriage, he is turned down by the village elders on account of his \"unstable\" obsession with \"sight\". The village doctor suggests that Nuñez's eyes be removed, claiming that they are diseased and are affecting his brain. Nuñez reluctantly consents to the operation because of his love for Medina-Saroté. However, at sunrise on the day of the operation, while all the villagers are asleep, Nuñez, the failed King of the Blind, sets off for the mountains (without provisions or equipment), hoping to find a passage to the outside world, and escape the valley.\n\nIn the original story, Nuñez climbs high into the surrounding mountains until night falls, and he rests, weak with cuts and bruises, but happy that he has escaped the valley. His fate is not revealed. In the revised and expanded 1939 version of the story, Nuñez sees from a distance that there is about to be a rock slide. He attempts to warn the villagers, but again they scoff at his \"imagined\" sight. He flees the valley during the slide, taking Medina-Saroté with him.\n\nCharacters\n\n*Nuñez – a mountaineer from Bogotá, Colombia\n*Yacob – Nuñez's master\n*Medina-Saroté – the youngest daughter of Yacob\n\nAdaptations\n\n*Several radio adaptations of the story have been produced. Escape aired debuted its adaptation starring Raymond Burr Thanksgiving week, 1947, which featured a different ending in which Nuñez escapes the Valley alone (and thus is able to tell the story in-character), but goes blind in the process due to the constant glare from the snow. Another episode of Escape aired 6/27/1948, starring Paul Frees. In 1954, 1957 and 1959 the CBS radio series Suspense rebroadcast this version. CBS Radio Mystery Theater aired another radio adaptation May 7, 1979. The episode was titled \"Search for Eden\" (episode 977) and the main characters' names were changed—Nunez was renamed Carlos and Medina-Saroté was renamed Eva. The BBC folded the story in two others by Wells for a BBC Radio 4 Extra entitled \"The Door in the Wall\", also with a twist at the end in which the storyteller reveals himself to be the tale's protagonist. \n*A teleplay written by Frank Gabrielsen was produced in 1962 for the TV series The DuPont Show of the Week. The title of the hour-long episode was \"The Richest Man in Bogota\", and it aired on 17 June 1962.  It starred Lee Marvin as Juan de Nuñez, and Míriam Colón as \"Marina\" (not Medina-Saroté, as in the original story).\n*The Russian studio Soyuzmultfilm made a wordless 19-minute animated film adaptation in 1995 called Land of Blind (Страна Слепых). \n*The composer Mark-Anthony Turnage wrote a chamber opera based on the story, completed in 1997.\n*A stage production was written by Frank Higgins; the only production to date has been in The Coterie Theater in Kansas City, Missouri in 2006.\nQuestion:\n\"Who said \"\"In the Country of the Blind The One-eyed Man is King?\"\nAnswer:\nHerbet wells\n", "answers": ["Wonderbra.", "Wonder-bra", "The Wonderbra", "WonderBra", "Wonderbra", "The Wonder-Bra", "Wonder Bra", "Wonderbra Women"], "length": 4599, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8ab5f2128793381da73aef50ff6a9ddfd7bd8de00aa8c1e1"}

The 1947 song Civilization by  Bob Hilliard and Carl Sigman, recorded by various artists, contained the line \"Bongo, Bongo, Bongo, I Don't Want to Leave the Congo\".  A variation of this was adopted for a poster produced by the fascist Union Movement bearing the chant \"Bongo, bongo, whites aren't going to leave the Congo\". \n\nThe term has featured in political controversies. Alan Clark, while Conservative Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, once, in a departmental meeting, allegedly referred to Africa as \"Bongo Bongo Land\".   When called to account, however, by then Prime Minister John Major, Clark denied the comment had any racist overtones, claiming it had simply been a reference to the President of Gabon, Omar Bongo. \n\nTaki Theodoracopulos called Kenya \"bongo-bongo land\" in his Spectator column. The Guardian later criticized his use of \"offensive and outdated stereotypes\". \n\nIn July 2013, Godfrey Bloom, Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) was filmed referring to countries which receive overseas aid from the United Kingdom as \"Bongo Bongo Land\".  UKIP later banned use of the term, and while Bloom refused to apologise for his remarks,  he later stated that he regretted \"any genuine offence which might have been caused.\"  A spokesperson from Show Racism the Red Card stated that Bloom's remarks were: \"crude stereotypes that see Britain as a civilised place and overseas as tribal\".  Matthew d'Ancona wrote in the Daily Telegraph: \"There may indeed be some who inwardly cheered Bloom’s choice of words. But there will be many – including, crucially, some who agree with his position on aid – who felt queasy at the use of such antediluvian language.\"\nQuestion:\n\"Which UKIP MEP quit the party in 2014 over problems with \"\"Bongo Bongo Land\"\" and \"\"women in the kitchen\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nGodfrey Bloom\nPassage:\nWilkins Micawber\nWilkins Micawber is a fictional character from Charles Dickens's 1850 novel, David Copperfield.  He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands.\n\nMicawber's long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms.  She lives by the maxims, \"I will never desert Mr. Micawber!\" and \"Experientia does it!\" (from Experientia docet, \"One learns by experience.\")\n \nMicawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber's debts arise from dishonesty.  But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.\n\nIn Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.\n\nPopular culture\n\nMicawber is known for asserting his faith that \"something will turn up\".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:\n\n\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness.

Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.\n\nKeith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) \"Micawber\". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, \"There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.\"\n\nIn addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that \"would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough.\" (quotations and citations omitted).\n\nEntry into general English\n\nThe character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun \"Micawber\" and the adjectives \"Micawberish\" and \"Micawberesque\". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as \"one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune\".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as \"pure Micawberism\". \n\nQuotations\n\nBesides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:\n* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)\n* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)\n* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)\n* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, \"FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY.\" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.\n* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary!

Chinese beer has also seen a rise in popularity internationally in the last few decades. While most Chinese beers are pale lagers, other styles are occasionally found, such as Tsingtao Dark Beer.\n\nHistory\n\nProduction and consumption of beer in China has occurred for around nine thousand years, with recent archaeological findings showing that Chinese villagers were brewing beer-type alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scales. Made with rice, honey, and grape and hawthorn fruits, this early beer seems to have been produced similarly to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.  Ancient Chinese beer was important in ancestral worship, funeral and other rituals of Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the beer was called as Lao Li (醪醴 in oracle bone script). However, after the Han Dynasty, Chinese beer faded from prominence in favor of huangjiu, which remained the case for the next two millennia. Modern beer brewing was not introduced into China until the end of 19th century, when Russians established a brewery in Harbin, with another three following (also in Harbin), set up by Germans, Czechoslovaks and Russians respectively. Japanese also established in 1934 in Mukden Manchurian Beer, which later became Shenyang Snow Beer and the origin of Snow Beer when it was absorbed in 1994 by China Resources Enterprises. \n\nEmergence of Craft Beer in China\n\nThe emergence of craft beer in China started in the large metro areas including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.  Consumer interest in premium brands and local and imported craft beers is currently on the rise. \n\nBrewing ingredients\n\nChinese beers often contain rice, sorghum and sometimes rye in addition to barley. Interestingly, some beer is produced that uses bitter melon instead of hops as the bittering agent.\n\nChinese media reported in 2001 that as many as 95% of all Chinese beers contained formaldehyde, to prevent sedimentation in bottles and cans while in storage.  This practice has now been made illegal.\n\nEconomy\n\nSnow Beer, produced by CR Snow is the best selling beer in China, holding 21.7% market share,  having recently overtaken Tsingtao Beer, produced by Tsingtao Brewery, which is the brand most widely exported to other countries. Tsingtao Beer is brewed in the city of Qingdao (formerly spelled Tsingtao in English) which was a German base in the time of unequal treaties and late-colonial western influence in China. The Germans needed beer for their sailors, soldiers and traders, and production continued after they lost the city to the Japanese in World War I.\n\nApart from Tsingtao, other major Chinese brewing groups include China Blue Ribbon,  Yanjing, Sie-Tang Lio and Zhujiang. Many major international brewers now have interests in, or joint ventures with, Chinese breweries, and popular international brands such as Carlsberg are now produced in China. This gives them access to the Chinese market, while providing capital and expertise to help upgrade local brewing standards, albeit at the cost of variety.\n\nBrewpubs are gaining popularity in China, primarily in major cities which have a resident western community, though there are a few exceptions in more remote locations like [http://badmonkeybar.com/brewery/ Bad Monkey Brewery] in Dali Old Town, Yunnan. The oldest craft brewery in Shanghai is Henry's (which is now closed), followed by The Bund Brewery. [http://www.shanghaibrewery.com Shanghai Brewery] is the largest craft brewery in Shanghai, followed by [http://www.boxingcatbrewery.com Boxing Cat Brewery], The BREW and Dr. Beer. In Beijing, several craft breweries such as Great Leap Brewing, [http://jingabrewing.com/ Jing-A Brewing], and Slow Boat Brewery have become staples in the local nightlife scene. Another popular brewpub is Kaiwei Beer House, a chain based in Wuhan. Craft beer festivals have been popularized since the early 2010s in Beijing and Shanghai. Two popular beer festivals in Shanghai, [http://www.shbeerfest.com/homepage.html Shanghai International Beer Festival] and [http://shanghaibeerweek.com Shanghai Beer Week], were both started in 2012.\n\nSince 2011, a few specialty beer delivery services were launched in Shanghai such as [http://www.cheers-in.com Cheers In] and [http://www.deansbottleshop.cn/ Dean's Bottle Shop].\n\nIn 2015 market share of imported beer reached 1.14% and volume increased by 58.9% to 538.5 million litres. \n\nList of major Chinese beers\n\nNote: This is a partial list of China's major breweries.

The three-day event was run annually at Great Altcar in Lancashire, England from 1836 to 2005 and it used to attract tens of thousands of spectators to watch and gamble on the coursing matches. It was founded by The 2nd Earl of Sefton and, originally, was supported by his patronage.\n\nIt was the biggest annual hare coursing event in the United Kingdom and was often referred to by its supporters as the blue riband event of the coursing year.  A hare coursing event of identical name was held in Australia from 1868 to 1985, at which point it became a lure coursing event. \n\nRun as a knock-out tournament between sixty four coursing greyhounds from Great Britain and Ireland, supporters described it as the ultimate test of a greyhound but opponents of hare coursing, such as the League Against Cruel Sports, saw it as a celebration of cruelty. The Hunting Act 2004 which came into force just after the 2005 cup made hare coursing events illegal in England and Wales, and the Waterloo Cup has not taken place since.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Waterloo Cup was the premier event in the coursing calendar and known as the 'blue ribbon of the leash'. It was inaugurated in 1836 by Mr William Lynn, proprietor of the Waterloo Hotel in Liverpool's Ranelagh Street. Encouraged by the extra trade generated by the Waterloo Cup, the Liverpool entrepreneur turned his attention to the Turf the following year and organised the first running of the Grand Liverpool Steeplechase, known as the Grand National since 1839.\n\nThe first winner of the Waterloo Cup was a bitch named Milanie, owned by Lord Molyneux, the eldest son of the Earl of Sefton on whose land the contest was run on the plains of Altcar. In addition to stakes of £16, Lord Molyneux won a trophy in the form of a silver snuff box.\n\nThe first supreme champion in the sport of coursing was Lord Lurgan's greyhound Master McGrath who won the Waterloo Cup on three occasions, 1868, 1869 & 1871. The dog became a household name in Britain and such was his fame that Queen Victoria commanded his appearance at Windsor Castle. Master McGrath set the standard by which all proceeding greyhounds would be judged. The great Master McGrath's record was finally eclipsed by Colonel North's greyhound \"Fullerton\" who recorded four consecutive victories in the Waterloo Cup between 1889 and 1892. \n\nIn later years the event has been championed by Newmarket trainer Sir Mark Prescott.\n\nThe 2005 event, held on February 14-16, was eventually won by a dog called Shashi, bred by Ernest Smith, and owned by him with Albert Shackcloth and Michael Darnell. Trained at Malton, North Yorkshire by the Jonathan Teal, the winner beat Hardy Admiral, owned by Diana Williams, in the final.\n\nPast winners\n\n \n\n * Cup divided\n + Substituted event called the Victory Cup\nQuestion:\nWhere was the venue for the hare-coursing 'Waterloo Cup'?\nAnswer:\nPetro-free\nPassage:\nMastering the Art of French Cooking\nMastering the Art of French Cooking is a two-volume French cookbook written by Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, both of France, and Julia Child of the United States.  The book was written for the American market and published by Knopf in 1961 (Volume 1) and 1970 (Volume 2).\n\nHistory\n\nThe book was the result of a collaboration among Beck, Bertholle, Child (listed alphabetically), illustrator Sidonie Coryn, and Paul Cushing Child (Child's husband), and was the impetus for Child's long and successful career as a pioneering television chef. Julia Child's goal was to adapt classic French cuisine for mainstream Americans. The collaboration of this cookbook proved groundbreaking and has since become a standard guide for the culinary community.  Mastering Volume 1 (ISBN 0-375-41340-5) was originally published in 1961 after some early difficulties (which are recounted in great detail in Julia Child's memoirs My Life in France as well as Child's introduction to the 2003 edition).  Volume 1 was a broad survey of French flavors and techniques, and grew out of the work the three women had done for their Paris cooking school, \"L'École des trois gourmandes\" (whose logo Child wore as a badge throughout the production of her first TV series, The French Chef).  Mastering Volume 2 (ISBN 0-394-40152-2), released in 1970, this time a collaboration between Julia Child and Simone Beck but not Louisette Bertholle with whom the professional relationship had ended, expanded on certain topics of interest that had not been covered as completely as the three had planned to in the first volume (particularly baking and charcuterie). Taken together, the two volumes are considered one of the most influential works in American cookbook history. Child has long been accorded near-universal respect in the cooking world, in part due to the influence of these books.\n\nBeck had wanted to create a volume 3, but Child, with her TV career doing well, was less interested; they severed their writing partnership and Beck's work for volume 3 became her first published book in English, Simca's Cuisine.\n\nContents\n\nMastering the Art of French Cooking… doesn't mean it has to be fancy cooking, although it can be as elaborate as you wish. — Julia Child  \n\nVolume 1 covers the basics of French cooking, striking as much of a balance between the complexities of haute cuisine and the practicalities of the American home cook. Traditional favorites such as beef bourguignon, bouillabaisse, and cassoulet are featured, as are extensive instructions on how to prepare vegetables in a manner more appetizing than that of the 1960s American kitchen. This volume has been through many printings and has been reissued twice with revisions: first in 1983 with updates for changes in kitchen practice (especially the food processor), and then in 2003 as a 40th anniversary edition with the history of the book in the introduction. The cookbook includes 524 recipes. \n\nSome classic French baking is also included, but baking received a more thorough treatment in Volume 2, published in 1970 after Bertholle had gone on to other projects. Also covered is breadmaking, which Child and Beck studied under Professor Raymond Calvel at the time one of France's recognized experts on bread and charcuterie. Coryn's illustrations in the second volume were a result of Paul Child's photography.\n\nCultural references\n\nIn 2002, writer Julie Powell began the Julie/Julia Project, a popular blog in which she recorded her ultimately successful attempt to cook all the recipes in the book in the space of an entire year.  This challenge and that of Child's creation of the book in the early years of her career are dramatized in the 2009 film, Julie & Julia, with Amy Adams as Julie Powell and Meryl Streep as Julia Child.  The success of this film, combined with a tied-in reissue of the 40th Anniversary edition, caused it to once again become a bestseller in the United States, 49 years after its initial release.  Upon hearing about Powell's attempt, Child was reported to have been unimpressed, viewing her attempt to be a stunt, and that Powell wasn't serious about doing it.\n\nJulia Child's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, has created a Facebook page dedicated to Julia Child. \n\nIn honor of Child's 100th birthday, bloggers from across the web are celebrating by highlighting a recipe from Child's cookbook. \n\nJulia Child's original kitchen can be visited at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.  After leaving her Massachusetts home in 2001 to return to California, Julia Child gave her kitchen to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \n\nEditions and printings\n\nFirst edition (published August, 1961)\n* 1.

The equivalent popular culture term is body language, a term Ray Birdwhistell, considered the founder of this area of study,  neither used nor liked the term (on the grounds that what can be conveyed with the body does not meet the linguist's definition of language). Even so, many people use the term.\n\nBirdwhistell's work\n\nKinesics was first used (in 1952) by Ray Birdwhistell, an  anthropologist who wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance, and movement.  His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book, Kinesics and Context.  Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behavior generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass market (non academic) publications as How to Read a Person Like a Book.  Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not clearly seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was The Natural History of an Interview, a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including Gregory Bateson, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin, and others. \n\nDrawing heavily on descriptive linguistics, Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behavior has a grammar that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a \"kineme\" is \"similar to a phoneme because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning.\" \n\nBirdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.  He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by Paul Ekman, who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in facial expression. \n\nModern applications\n\nIn a current application, kinesic behaviors are sometimes used as signs of deception by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered.\n\nRelevant concepts include these:\n*Emblems - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase\n*Illustrators - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages\n*Affect Displays - Show emotion\n*Regulators - Control the flow and pace of communication\n*Adaptors - Release physical or emotional tension\n\nKinesic behaviors are an important part of nonverbal communication. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.\nQuestion:\nKinesics is more commonly known as what form of communication?\nAnswer:\nPinocchio Syndrome\nPassage:\n2010 French Open – Women's Singles\nSvetlana Kuznetsova was the defending champion, but lost in the third round to Maria Kirilenko.\n\nFrancesca Schiavone claimed her maiden Grand Slam title, defeated Samantha Stosur 6–4, 7–6(7–2) in the final, also playing in her first Major singles final.

It is not the primary product or service being produced. In the context of production, a by-product is the 'output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or net realizable value (NRV) when compared to the main products'.  Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced.  A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste.\n\nIEA offers the following definition for the purpose of life-cycle assessment: \n... main products, co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product), by-products (which result in smaller revenues), and waste products (which provide little or no revenue).\n\nMajor by-products\n\nAnimal sources\n\n*blood meal – from slaughterhouse operations\n*poultry by-product meal – clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered poultry, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, and intestines\n*chrome shavings – from a stage of leather manufacture\n*collagen and gelatin – from the boiled skin and other parts of slaughtered livestock\n*feathers – from poultry processing\n**feather meal – from poultry processing\n*fetal pigs\n*lanolin – from the cleaning of wool\n*leather - hides and skins from slaughterhouse operations processed via the leathermaking process\n*manure – from animal husbandry\n*meat and bone meal – from the rendering of animal bones and offal\n*poultry litter – swept from the floors of chicken coops\n*whey – from cheese manufacturing\n\nVegetation\n\n*acidulated soap stock – from the refining of vegetable oil\n*bagasse – the fibrous residue remaining after sugarcane or sorghum stalks are crushed to extract their juice\n*black liquor from the production of cellulose pulp using the kraft process\n*bran and germ – from the milling of whole grains into refined grains\n*brewer's yeast – from ethanol fermentation\n*cereal food fines – from breakfast cereal processing\n*corn steep liquor – from corn wet-milling\n*distillers grains – from ethanol fermentation\n*glycerol – from the production of biodiesel\n*grape seed oil – recovered from leftovers of the winemaking process\n*molasses – from sugar refining\n*orange oil and other citrus oils – recovered from the peels of processed fruit\n*pectin – recovered from the remains of processed fruit\n*sawdust and bark – from the processing of logs into lumber\n*soybean meal – from soybean processing\n*stover – residual plant matter after harvesting of cereals\n*straw – from grain harvesting\n*tall oil from the production of cellulose pulp using the Kraft process\n*vinasse – from the fermentation of sugar to ethanol fuel\n\nMinerals and petrochemicals\n\n*asphalt – from the refining of crude oil\n*fly ash – from the combustion of coal\n*slag – from ore refining\n*gypsum – from flue-gas desulfurization\n*helium - from natural gas extraction\n*ash and smoke – from the combustion of fuel\n*mineral oil – from refining crude oil to produce gasoline\n*salt – from desalination\n*Molybdenum – from copper extraction\n\nOther\n\n*sludge – from wastewater treatment\n*waste heat - from electricity production and usage\n*carbon dioxide - process of burning\nQuestion:\nA viscous byproduct from its manufacture, what is the syrup drained from raw sugar called?\nAnswer:\nBlackstrap\nPassage:\nMock turtle soup\nMock turtle soup is an English soup that was created in the mid-18th century as a cheaper imitation of green turtle soup.  It often uses brains and organ meats such as calf's head or a calf's foot  to duplicate the texture and flavour of the original's turtle meat.\n\nMrs. Fowle's Mock Turtle Soup:\n\nTake a large calf's head. Scald off the hair. Boil it until the horn is tender, then cut it into slices about the size of your finger, with as little lean as possible. Have ready three pints of good mutton or veal broth, put in it half a pint of Madeira wine, half a teaspoonful of thyme, pepper, a large onion, and the peel of a lemon chop't very small. A ¼ of a pint of oysters chop't very small, and their liquor; a little salt, the juice of two large onions, some sweet herbs, and the brains chop't. Stand all these together for about an hour, and send it up to the table with the forcemeat balls made small and the yolks of hard eggs. \n\nGermany \n\nIn the Oldenburg and Ammerland regions of Germany, Mockturtlesuppe—the English designation \"mock turtle\" retained—is a traditional meal, dating from the time of the personal union between the Kingdom of Hanover and the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nUS \n\nThe Campbell Soup Company once produced canned mock turtle soup made of calf's head.  In a 1962 interview with David Bourdon, Andy Warhol, commenting on Campbell's discontinued soups, said that Mock Turtle had once been his favorite.  An American version of the soup is popular in Cincinnati and canned under the name Worthmore's Mock Turtle Soup.\n\nIn popular culture \n\nMock turtle soup is the basis for the character of the Mock Turtle in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the joke being that mock turtle soup is supposedly made from these creatures.\n\nIn season 4, episode 16 of Gilmore Girls, Richard Gilmore requests mock turtle soup while in mourning in the days after the death of his mother, the eldest Lorelai Gilmore, as it was \"something his mother used to have made for him when he was a little boy.\"\n\nIn season 4, episode 8 of American Horror Story, Ethel Darling (Kathy Bates) serves Mock Turtle Soup to Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange).\nQuestion:\nMock Turtle Soup is traditionally made from the head of a?\nAnswer:\nDogie\nPassage:\nLacrosse in Canada\nLacrosse was first declared the National Game of Canada in 1859. In 1994 Parliament passed the Canada's National Sport Act which declared lacrosse to be \"Canada's National Summer Sport\", with hockey as the national winter sport. \n\nHistory\n\nLacrosse was invented in the 1850s, when the Anglophone middle class of Montreal adopted the Aboriginal people's game of \"baggataway\", which was a violent game played by the First Nation teams numbering hundreds of players.  The first known game between whites and Aboriginals took place in 1843.   \n\nIn 1856 the Montreal lacrosse club was established; by the mid-1860s there were active teams in eastern Ontario. The National Lacrosse Association was formed in 1875; in 1880 the league became the National Amateur Lacrosse Association.   By the 1880s the organized sport was found nationwide, and had become a popular spectator sport. To deal with the violence, middle class promoters spoke in Social Gospel terms about the ideal of \"muscular Christianity.\"  As working class players and spectators became more prominent, the rhetoric focused on winning at all costs. \n\nThe 1860s the Montreal Shamrocks introduced a new level of aggressiveness; it was Irish, Catholic, and fought to win.  During the 1870s and 1880s the Shamrocks had bloody confrontations with the middle-class Protestant Montreal and Toronto Lacrosse Clubs.  Field lacrosse was spread across Canada by Anglophone migrants from Ontario and Quebec. In February 1887, the Toronto Lacrosse Club began using hockey as a form of exercise during the winter months. By the early 1890s it was the most popular summer game in Canada; the 1900s were the golden years, as two professional leagues were set up.    Escalating violence led to the collapse of the professional leagues in 1914, and the game's base of support shrank to Montreal, Victoria, Vancouver, New Westminster, and a few small-towns. Its failure to establish a solid base derived from a thin organizational infrastructure; for example, it was not played by schools or churches. \n\nIn 1931, big city hockey promoters introduced \"box lacrosse\" to turn winter hockey fans into a year-round audience. Box lacrosse was played in a smaller indoor arena space, and competitions could also be held in baseball stadiums, and again, the play was violent. Not enough cities could support teams, however, and the hard times of the Great Depression in the 1930s reduced the number of fans. Entrepreneurs, while failing to make a major commercial success, transformed Canadian amateur lacrosse, making it quite different from field lacrosse as played in the United States, Britain, and Australia. In 1987 the National Lacrosse League began; it has clubs in twelve cities in the United States and Canada. \n\nRecent\n\nThe Canadian Lacrosse Association, founded in 1925, is the governing body of lacrosse in Canada. It conducts national junior and senior championship tournaments for men and women in both field and box lacrosse. It also participated in the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championship in 2003.\n\nThe CLA along with 5 other National sporting association had their charitable status revoked in June 2010 as part of a Revenue Canada crackdown on Parklane Financial's tax shelter scheme, in which charitable organizations issued receipts far in excess of any material donations. The fact that the CLA Board of Directors agreed to participate in such a scheme may in part be due to the fact that the CLA Board of Directors is largely made up of elected lacrosse representatives, with no particular expertise in legal or financial matters of governance.\n\nAt the provincial level, the Ontario Lacrosse Association controls the majority of lacrosse in Ontario. The OLA is governed by a larger Board than the CLA, though also populated largely by members with a strong lacrosse background. OLA lacrosse officials are sanctioned by the OLA, and represented by the Ontario Lacrosse Referees Association (OLRA).  Unlike typical referee associations, the OLRA has a governing structure that is open only to Box lacrosse officials who officiate Junior/Senior/Major-series games, though the vast majority of officials do not officiate at that level. The OLRA is an extension of the OLA, and does not represent an independent officiating union.\n\nThe National Lacrosse League is a professional box lacrosse league, with franchises in Canada and the United States. The 2006 World Lacrosse Championship was held in London, Ontario. Canada beat the United States 15-10 in the final to break a 28-year U.S. winning streak. One of the best lacrosse players of all time, Gary Gait was born in Victoria, British Columbia and has won every possible major lacrosse championship. Great achievements in Canadian Lacrosse are recognized by the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\nQuestion:\nOfficially, what is Canada’s national summer sport?\nAnswer:\nLacrosse\nPassage:\nCalgary Foothills FC\nCalgary Foothills FC (CFFC) is a Canadian soccer club based in Calgary, Alberta, that competes in the Premier Development League. The club was founded in 1972 and in 2015 as a PDL franchise. The team plays its home games at Glenmore Athletic Park.    The team colours are green and white. \n\nHistory \n\nCalgary last hosted a team, the Calgary Storm, in the Premier Development League during the 2001 season.  The PDL club of Calgary Foothills FC launched in 2014 as they played a series of exhibition games against Vancouver Whitecaps U 23's,  FC Edmonton Reserves,  and local university clubs.\n\nThe club's inaugural PDL game was played on May 17, 2015 against Puget Sound, as Foothills were victorious 2-1.   The club finished 4th in the PDL's Northwest Division in 2015 with a 3-2-7 record, ultimately missing the playoffs.\n\nIn the 2016 season, Calgary Foothills won the Northwest Division with an 8-3-3 record, despite only 4% of supporters predicting the club would win the division. In the playoffs, Calgary Foothills would defeat Seattle Sounders U-23, FC Golden State Force, and FC Tuscon to win the Western Conference.   Calgary Foothills would later defeat Ocean City Nor'easters in the PDL semifinals to advance to the 2016 PDL Final against Michigan Bucks.  \n\nSupporters' Groups\n\nThe Foot Soldiers were founded in February 2015 with the intention of bringing a passionate atmosphere to Calgary Foothills FC games. \n\nPlayers and Staff \n\nAs of May 12, 2016 \n\nStaff\n\n*  Tommy Wheeldon Jr. – Head Coach\n*  Leon Hapgood – Assistant Coach\n*  Brian McDonnell – Goalkeeping Coach\n*  Shari MacDonald – Athletic Therapist\n*  Rob Jenkins – Team Manager\n\nNotable former players\n\n*  Sam Adekugbe\n*  Paul Hamilton\n*  Owen Hargreaves\n*  Kevin McKenna\n*  Sean Melvin\n*  Bradley Kamdem\n* Source: [http://calgaryfoothillssoccer.com/default.asp?idsuccess&l\n1 Calgary Foothills FC]\n\nClub Records\n\nMost Appearances\n\nLeague, & Playoffs\n\nBolded players are currently on the Calgary Foothills roster.\n\nTop goalscorers\n\nLeague, & Playoffs\n\nBolded players are currently on the Calgary Foothills roster.\n\nRecord\n\nYear-by-year\n\nAs of July 17, 2016\nQuestion:\nWhich England international footballer started his footballing career at Canadian club Calgary Foothills FC?\nAnswer:\nOwen Hargreaves\nPassage:\nDettol\nDettol is the trade name for a line of hygiene products manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser. It has been in use since before 1936, when it was used after surgery as an antiseptic. \n\nComposition and chemistry\n\nThe original Dettol liquid antiseptic and disinfectant is light yellow in colour in the concentrated form but, as several of the ingredients are insoluble in water, it produces a milky emulsion of oil droplets when diluted with water, exhibiting the ouzo effect.\n\nThe active ingredient in Dettol that confers its antiseptic property is chloroxylenol (C8H9ClO), an aromatic chemical compound. Chloroxylenol comprises 4.8% of Dettol's total admixture,  with the rest made up by pine oil, isopropanol, castor oil, soap and water.\n\nUsage\n\nDiluted, Dettol may be used to clean cuts, wounds, etc. and to disinfect environmental surfaces such as household floors and kitchen work surfaces.\n\nToxicity\n\nHumans\n\nAs with other manufactured household cleaners, Dettol has the potential for causing lethal toxicity. It is poisonous when ingested and even when it is unintentionally inhaled.\n\nIn a case report, a 42-year-old British man died from Dettol overexposure in May 2007.  He was suffering from \"obsessive cleaning disorder\" and used to keep buckets of dettol around his flat with rooms littered with dettol. The autopsy was not able to conclude whether the lethal exposure to Dettol was via ingestion or inhalation.  A medical study which analyzed 177 cases of Dettol intoxications via ingestion in Hong Kong concluded that ″Dettol poisoning resulted in serious complications in 7% of patients, including death\". \n\nAnimals\n\nDettol is toxic to many animals, especially cats.   Dettol contains the phenol chloroxylenol.  Phenols are of particular concern because cats are unable to eliminate the toxins following ingestion. A cat may swallow the product by licking its paws after they have come into contact with it.\n\nIn Australia, Dettol spray has been shown to be lethal to cane toads, an invasive species that was introduced from Hawaii, as a result of bad judgment, in 1935. It had been hoped that the amphibian would control the cane beetle but it became highly destructive within the ecosystem. Spraying the disinfectant at close range has been shown to cause rapid death to toads. It is not known whether the toxins are persistent or whether they harm other Australian flora and fauna.\n\nOwing to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of Dettol as an agent for pest control was banned in Western Australia by the Department of Environment and Conservation in 2011.\nQuestion:\nWhich company's products include Dettol, Veet, Cillit Bang and Durex?\nAnswer:\nReckitt & Colman Ltd.\nPassage:\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names ...\nAudi and Volvo - Latin origin of the car company names - High Names\n03.20.13 Posted in Naming blog by christa\nLet’s get back to the car business. We know a lot of the car companies are named after their founders – the trend was spread worldwide from the earliest electric automobiles. These include Ford (after Henry Ford), Peugeot (after the Peugeot family), also later Bentley (after Walter Owen Bentley), Porsche (after Ferdinand Porsche). The trend is also present in Asia by car manufacturers like Toyota (after Kiichiro Toyoda) and Honda (after Soichiro Honda).\nHowever, there are still original company names between the world-wide known brands in the car industry. The naming strategy is often so unique that they cannot be put in categories. But Audi and Volvo can. Can you guess what the connection between those two famous car companies is in terms of naming? Latin.\nVolvo – on the different car company names\nDespite that Volvo is a Swedish company the founders didn’t name the car Viking or Nordic or anything like that. They decided on the Latin word volvere, meaning to roll. It seems a logical word choice since the purpose of working on a Swedish car project was to build cars that could withstand the cold Scandinavian weather and uneven roads – basically a car that rolls. What they did is only conjugate the verb volvere in first person (because unlike in English many other languages use similar but still different words when saying I roll, you roll, etc) and voilà – you have Volvo. It’s like the car speaks to you – I roll.\nAudi – on the translated car company names\nThe reason for naming the famous car company Audi isn’t that spontaneous compared to Volvo. The truth is that the founder August Horch (and no the AU in Audi doesn’t come from the first two letters of the founder’s name) had originally founded another car company named August Horch & Co. This happened in 1904 when the German engineer had quit working for Karl Benz. However, after some problems in the company, in 1909 Horch founded a second company – but his family name could not be used again as a name for the company because he didn’t have the rights on the company name. The story says that one of his business partners’ son came up with the name Audi. But this wasn’t a random Latin word that simply starts with the letter A (as you may know by now from our blog posts having a company name that starts with A is great because you get listed early in alphabetically ordered lists). If you speak German you’ll know that horch comes from the infinitive form of horchen and actually has a meaning – to listen (carefully). Now, can you guess what the Latin translation of horchen is? It’s audire – a verb that when conjugated in the same form as horch, becomes audi. The name seemed logical since August Horch could no longer use his own name. And a little more than 100 years later Audi is still one of the most popular names in the car industry.\nQuestion:\nWhich car manufacturer's name is Latin for roll?\nAnswer:\nGlossary of Volvo features\nPassage:\nOscar and Lucinda\nOscar and Lucinda is a novel by Australian author Peter Carey which won the 1988 Booker Prize, the 1989 Miles Franklin Award, and was shortlisted for The Best of the Booker.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nIt tells the story of Oscar Hopkins, the Cornish son of a Plymouth Brethren minister who becomes an Anglican priest, and Lucinda Leplastrier, a young Australian heiress who buys a glass factory. They meet on the ship over to Australia, and discover that they are both gamblers, one obsessive, the other compulsive. Lucinda bets Oscar that he cannot transport a glass church from Sydney to a remote settlement at Bellingen, some 400 km up the New South Wales coast. This bet changes both their lives forever.\n\nInspiration\n\nThe novel partly takes its inspiration from Father and Son, the autobiography of the English poet Edmund Gosse, which describes his relationship with his father, Philip Henry Gosse.\n\nFilm\n\nA film version released in 1997 was directed by Gillian Armstrong and starred Ralph Fiennes, Cate Blanchett, and Tom Wilkinson.\nQuestion:\nWho won the Booker Prize twice for his novels 'Oscar and Lucinda' and 'True History of the Kelly Gang'?\nAnswer:\nPeter Carey (footballer)\nPassage:\nCamanachd Association\nThe Camanachd Association (in Scottish Gaelic, Comann na Camanachd) is the world governing body of the Scottish sport of shinty. The body is based in Inverness, Highland, and is in charge of the rules of the game. Its main competitions are the Camanachd Association Challenge Cup and the Scottish Hydro Premier Division.  \n\nStructure \n\nThe Camanachd Association was founded in 1893 after a meeting in Kingussie in order to formalize a set of rules for the many shinty clubs across the British Isles.\n\nThe Camanachd Association maintained its initial structure for much of its first century but the ‘Future of Shinty' Report published in 1981 led to a compete restructuring of the way in which shinty was organised and managed. That, in turn, led to the move away from a dependence on volunteers to govern the sport, to the Association's first salaried employees being employed.   This also resulted in the other myriad associations which organised shinty coming under the Association.  Other associations which still have a strong role in organising shinty are the Glasgow Celtic Society, the Macaulay Association and the Schools Camanachd Association.\n\nIn 2005, the Camanachd Association took the decision to change its structure again and moved to being a company limited by guarantee with no share capital. The company is overseen by a board of directors, most of whom are volunteers who are chosen by the members at the AGM.\n\nThe membership of the association consists of shinty clubs and related associations, such as the Glasgow Celtic Society.  The membership appoints non-salaried office-bearers through the Annual General Meeting, which is also the only medium through which the playing rules of shinty can be altered.\n\nRecent history \n\nIn 2006 the association appointed its first Chief Executive, Richard Tulloch.  He resigned within three months.  The Board of Directors appointed Gill McDonald, the first woman CEO in the sport - in April 2009 she resigned from the position mere weeks before the association's AGM, having been criticised for much of the poor running of the association in that timeframe. \n\nThe association was dogged by severe criticism of its ability  to administer the game in 2007, with a fixture list which ran into December, partly due to a lack of rescheduling of fixtures which were delayed earlier in the year amongst the complaints. The association's lack of communication with the grassroots of the sport also came under fire. \n\nDuncan Cameron was appointed President of the association for the second time in 2007. His presidency has been marked by controversy due to resignations and an ongoing debate about reducing the game to 9 a-side with plastic pitches.   \n\nIn February 2008, the association was investigated by the Northern Constabulary for alleged financial irregularities.   In May 2008, a man was charged in connection with these financial irregularities.   A former employee of the association was convicted of fraud linked to the association's funds in August 2008. \n\nIn March 2009, the association aimed to change its structure by having sub-committees for different sectors of the game,  this development was one of the factors in the spate of resignations in early 2009. \n\nIn November 2009, the association approved the use of astroturf for senior fixtures, however, there is no astroturf park in Scotland large enough to accommodate a full size shinty park.  Plans are afoot to develop such a facility in Fort William. \n\nIn January 2010, they announced that Torquil MacLeod would become the third permanent Chief Executive as of April 2010. \n\nThe presidential election of 2010 was a hotly competed affair between Donald Stewart and the popular Archie Robertson.  Robertson won the election resoundingly and became President at the 2011 A.G.M..   \n\nThe association permitted the use of rolling substitutions as of the 2011 season.  The Association also decided to admit Lewis Camanachd to the league setup on a trial basis for 2011.  The Association came under pressure to admit the club due to their claim to be a national sport of Scotland.   The Board of Directors voted to make Lewis a permanent member of the league in December 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Strathspey applied to join the leagues, Ardnamurchan asked to switch from the North District to the South, and  an EGM was needed in early February to ratify changes to substitutions and free-hits.\n\nJim Barr was named President in 2014.\n\nInternational\n\nThe association co-ordinates the Scotland national shinty team, which plays annually against Ireland in the Shinty/Hurling International Series, a series played under the hybrid rules of Composite rules shinty–hurling.\nQuestion:\nWhich sport is supervised in Scotland by the Camanachd Association?\nAnswer:\nShinty\nPassage:\n2007 Monaco Grand Prix\nThe 2007 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 27 May 2007 at the Circuit de Monaco. It was the fifth round of the 2007 Formula One season. The 78-lap race was won by Fernando Alonso for the McLaren team, from a pole position start. Lewis Hamilton finished second in the other McLaren car, with Felipe Massa third in a Ferrari car.\n\nReport\n\nBackground\n\nThe Grand Prix was contested by 22 drivers, in eleven teams of two. The teams, also known as \"constructors\", were Renault, McLaren-Mercedes, Ferrari, Honda, Spyker-Ferrari, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull-Renault, Williams-Toyota, Toro Rosso-Ferrari and Super Aguri\n\nBefore the race, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship, with 30 points, ahead of team-mate Fernando Alonso on 28 and Ferrari driver Felipe Massa on 27 points. Massa's team-mate Kimi Räikkönen was fourth, ahead of BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld in fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren were leading with 58 points, nine points ahead of Ferrari with 49 points; BMW Sauber were a further 26 points in third.\n\nTesting started a week and a half before the race at Circuit Paul Ricard using the circuit's 2D SC configuration to replicate the Circuit de Monaco.  Lewis Hamilton went on to score the fastest times on the days of testing whilst the circuit was in the Monaco configuration.\n\nHamilton, who had never lost a race on the Monte Carlo track (having won there in both GP2 and F3) played down his chances of winning the race, although he still remained \"realistic\" and optimistic, looking to fight for a win as is \"the case with everything (he) competes in.\"\n\nPractice\n\nThe final practice session on Saturday morning was heavily affected by rain. Adrian Sutil of Spyker topped the timesheets for this session due to the conditions.\n\nQualifying\n\nQualifying was dominated throughout by the two McLarens of Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. Despite Hamilton setting fastest times for the first session, Alonso outpaced him in the final stages to take pole position, with Hamilton being held up slightly by Mark Webber. Felipe Massa of Ferrari qualified third fastest, posting a time after the clock stopped. Kimi Räikkönen made a mistake and hit the barriers coming out of the Swimming Pool Complex during the second qualifying stage, breaking his front-right suspension. The damage inflicted could not be repaired and he qualified sixteenth. Despite provisionally making the top ten, David Coulthard was penalised for impeding Heikki Kovalainen and demoted to thirteenth. Coulthard's demotion allowed Jenson Button to participate in the final qualifying stage, but he failed to move up the field and finished the qualifying session in 10th place.\n\nOf those whose qualifying went well, former Monaco resident Giancarlo Fisichella fared best, putting his Renault on the second row in fourth place. Nico Rosberg's performance marked a return to form for his Williams team; his fifth place was the British constructor's best qualifying position since Mark Webber's second place at the same track one year before in 2006. Webber himself also fared well, filling the second slot on row three, alongside Rosberg, in sixth place.\n\nRace\n\nThe race started at 14:00 CET. From the starting line everyone got away for the first laps, with Hamilton diving in behind Alonso to defend any of the Ferrari's advances. After the race, FIA launched an investigation of the McLaren team for giving out team orders, to the effect of asking Hamilton not to attempt to race or overtake Alonso.  Ecclestone said McLaren \"could be excluded from the championship or they could have points deducted\".  McLaren were later cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA. \n\nNo other car in the field could keep up with the sheer pace of both of the McLaren-Mercedes, with Massa, after a competitive first stint in third place, dropping to sixty seconds behind Hamilton. Notably, he was the only car the two McLaren drivers did not lap during the afternoon.\n\nKimi Räikkönen came back up the field to eighth place to gain one championship point after his poor qualifying performance.\n\nVitantonio Liuzzi crashed out of the race on the second lap, a fate that befell Spyker driver Adrian Sutil in the second half of the Grand Prix.  The other Spyker car, driven by Christijan Albers failed to finish the race due to a mechanical problem.  The only other retirement was Mark Webber, whose Red Bull's gearbox failed in the early stages of the race.\n\nClassification \n\nQualifying \n\n;Notes:\n* – David Coulthard was penalised for blocking Heikki Kovalainen and not allowed to take part in Q3 despite posting the 8th fastest time of Q2, he was then given a two place grid penalty and started the race in 13th place. Jenson Button, who had qualified 11th in Q2, therefore inherited the final place in Q3 from Coulthard. \n\nRace \n\n;Notes:\n* – Christijan Albers was classified as 19th, because he completed 90% of the race winner's distance\n\nChampionship standings after the race \n\n;Drivers' Championship standings\n\n;Constructors' Championship standings\n\n*Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\nQuestion:\nWho won the Monaco Grand Prix in 2000\nAnswer:\nDavid Coulthard\nPassage:\nHenry Gray\nHenry Gray (1827 – 13 June 1861) was an English anatomist and surgeon most notable for publishing the book Gray's Anatomy.  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) at the age of 25.\n\nBiography\n\nGray was born in Belgravia, London, in 1827   and lived most of his life in London. In 1842, he entered as a student at St. George’s Hospital, London (then situated in Belgravia, now moved to Tooting), and he is described by those who knew him as a most painstaking and methodical worker, and one who learned his anatomy by the slow but invaluable method of making dissections for himself.\n\nWhile still a student, Gray secured the triennial prize of Royal College of Surgeons in 1848 for an essay entitled The Origin, Connexions and Distribution of nerves to the human eye and its appendages, illustrated by comparative dissections of the eye in other vertebrate animals. In 1852, at the early age of 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year he obtained the Astley Cooper prize of three hundred guineas for a dissertation “On the structure and Use of Spleen.”\n\nIn 1858, Gray published the first edition of Anatomy, which covered 750 pages and contained 363 figures. He had the good fortune of securing the help of his friend Henry Vandyke Carter, a skilled draughtsman and formerly a demonstrator of anatomy at St. George’s Hospital. Carter made the drawings from which the engravings were executed, and the success of the book was, in the first instance, undoubtedly due in no small measure to the excellence of its illustrations. This edition was dedicated to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, Bart, FRS, DCL. A second edition was prepared by Gray and published in 1860.  The book is still published under the title Gray's Anatomy and is widely appreciated as an extraordinary and authoritative textbook for medical students.\n\nGray held successively the posts of demonstrator of Anatomy, curator of the museum and Lecturer of Anatomy at St. George’s Hospital and was in 1861 a candidate for the post of assistant surgeon.\n\nDeath \n\nGray was struck by an attack of confluent smallpox, the most deadly type of the disease where individual lesions become so numerous that they join as a continuous, \"confluent\" sheet. He is assumed to have been infected due to his extended and meticulous caring for his ten-year-old nephew, Charles Gray, who did eventually recover. On the day he was to appear for an interview as a final candidate for a prestigious post at the St. George's Hospital, he died in London - 13 June 1861  - at the age of 34. He was buried at St James, Pancras and Highgate Cemetery.   Of note is the fact that Gray had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child with one of the early forms of the vaccine.\nQuestion:\n\"The long-standing textbook, \"\"Anatomy\"\", by Henry Gray (1827-1861) owed much of its effectiveness to the illustrations which were drawn by whom?\"\nAnswer:\nDr Henry Vandyke Carter\nPassage:\nCauldron Snout\nCauldron Snout is a waterfall on the upper reaches of the River Tees in Northern England, immediately below the dam of the Cow Green Reservoir.

{"input": "Passage:\nThe Little Mermaid (statue)\nThe Little Mermaid () is a bronze statue by Edvard Eriksen, depicting a mermaid. The sculpture is displayed on a rock by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is  tall  and weighs 385 lb.\n\nBased on the fairy tale of the same name by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and has been a major tourist attraction since 1913. In recent decades it has become a popular target for defacement by vandals and political activists.\n\nMermaid is among iconic statues that symbolize cities; others include: Manneken Pis in Brussels,  the Statue of Liberty in New York and Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. In several cases, cities have commissioned statues for such a purpose, such as with Singapore's Merlion.\n\nHistory\n\nThe statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, who had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale in Copenhagen's Royal Theatre and asked the ballerina, Ellen Price, to model for the statue. The sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue, which was unveiled on August 23, 1913. The statue's head was modelled after Price, but as the ballerina did not agree to model in the nude, the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, was used for the body. \n\nThe Copenhagen City Council arranged to move the statue to Shanghai at the Danish Pavilion for the duration of the Expo 2010 (May to October), the first time it had been moved officially from its perch since it was installed almost a century earlier.   While the statue was away in Shanghai an authorised copy was displayed on a rock in the lake in Copenhagen's nearby Tivoli Gardens.  \nCopenhagen officials have considered moving the statue several meters out into the harbour to discourage vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it,  but as of May 2014 the statue remains on dry land at the water side.\n\nVandalism\n\nThis statue has been damaged and defaced many times since the mid-1960s for various reasons, but has been restored each time.\n\nOn April 24, 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement, amongst them Jørgen Nash. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and placed on the statue. On July 22, 1984, the right arm was sawn off and returned two days later by two young men.[http://jp.dk/indland/kbh/article1027279.ece Den Lille Havfrue reddet fra gramsende turister] (in Danish). Jyllands-Posten. Published August 1, 2007. Retrieved February 1, 2012. In 1990, an attempt to sever the statue's head left an  deep cut in the neck.\n\nOn January 6, 1998, the statue was decapitated again;  the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby television station, and reattached on February 4. On the night of September 10, 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbour's waters. Holes had been blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee. \n\nIn 2004, the statue was draped in a burqa in a protest against Turkey's application to join the European Union.  In May 2007, it was again found draped in Muslim dress and a head scarf. \n\nPaint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007.  On March 8, 2006, a dildo was attached to the statue's hand, green paint was dumped over it, and the date March 8 were written on it. It is suspected that this vandalism was connected with International Women's Day, which is on March 8.  \n\nCopies\n\nAside from the statue on display, which is a replica of the original,  thirteen undamaged copies of the statue are located around the world, listed by Mermaids of Earth,  including Solvang, California; Kimballton, Iowa;  Piatra Neamţ, Romania; Torrejón de Ardoz (Madrid), Spain; and a half-sized copy in Calgary, Canada.   The grave of Danish-American entertainer Victor Borge includes a copy as well. The Copenhagen Airport also has a replica of the mermaid along with a statue of Andersen.\n\nA copy of the statue forms the Danish contribution to the International Peace Gardens in Salt Lake City.  The half-size replica was stolen on February 26, 2010, but was recovered on April 7, evidently abandoned in the park after the thief became nervous about being caught with it. \n\nCopyright issues\n\nThe statue is under copyright until 2029, which is 70 years after the 1959 death of the creator; therefore several copies of the statue have provoked legal actions. , replicas of the statue can be purchased on the internet, authorized for sale by the Eriksen family. \n\nA replica was installed in Greenville, Michigan in 1994 to celebrate the town's Danish heritage, at a cost of $10,000.  In 2009 the town was sued by the Artists Rights Society claiming the work violated Eriksen's copyright, and asking for a $3,800 licensing fee.

Richard was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847 as Richard Horatio Marriott; both his two sisters, Adeline Marriott (b. 1853) and Grace Marriott (b. 1858) were also born in Lancashire. Later all three children chose to take the surname of their mother's husband, Robert Edgar, whom she married in 1856.[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl?start\n1856&end1856&sq\n2&eq2&type\nMarriages&vol1d&pgno\n130&jsexec1&mono\n0&vMTM0NTgwMjQ5OTo2YTNlNWYwYzRiOGNmODllMThjYjE3ODkzY2UwY2MyMTAyMDQyZmZj&searchdef\ndb%3Dbmd_1344282533%26sq%3D1%26v%3DMTM0NTgwMTc4MDowMWFlOWIzMmE2YzgxZDExMzZjMDQ3MDc0ZDI2ZGM5ODdiMjE2OTYx%26s_surname%3Dmarriott%26surname%3Dedgar%26end%3D1856%26type%3DMarriages%26eq%3D2%26start%3D1856&action=Find FreeBMD marriage record, June 1856]\n\nRichard and Jenny married in March 1875, with Richard being unaware that he had fathered an illegitimate namesake son, Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace, with widowed actress Mrs Mary Jane \"Polly\" Richards, after a brief sexual encounter. Polly had invented an obligation in London to hide her pregnancy and give birth in secret on 1 April 1875, almost a month after Richard and Jenny married. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace.\n\nRichard and Jenny Taylor's children were Alice Marriott Edgar (b. 1876, London), twins Richard and Jennifer Marriott Edgar (b. 1878, London), after whose births the family moved to Scotland where George was born, then  returning to London where Joseph Marriott Edgar was born in 1884 and Adeline Alice Edgar in 1886.\n\nEarly career\n\nLittle is recorded of George Marriott Edgar's early career, but he was talented performer, poet and writer. His first real successes began after he had been in the cast of The Co-Optimists and worked with Stanley Holloway.[http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid\n718 Cary Ginell on Stanley Holloway at classicsonline.com] At the start of the 1930s they went to Hollywood, where Edgar - who had dropped his first name for the professional appellation Marriott Edgar - met his famous half-brother.\n\nMonologues\n\nHolloway was already enjoying some success with the monologue format, with such classics as Sam, Pick Oop Tha' Musket. Edgar asked him if he had heard a story about a couple who had taken their son to the zoo, only to see the lad eaten by a lion.  Holloway had indeed heard the story, and shortly afterwards Edgar supplied him with a script.  The Lion and Albert became one of Holloway's most popular pieces, one of many he recorded beginning in 1930. The lion of the poem is named \"Wallace\", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838, and his name became a popular one for lions.[http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/lions/2006/11/3/wallace-the-lion.html Wallace the lion at ravishingbeasts.com] Edgar gave the poem the titleThe Lion and Albert but some later performances and re-publications used the form Albert and the Lion.[http://www.seiyaku.com/lit/monologues/003.html The Lion and Albert ] The nearby pub also uses the latter form.\n\nThe monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically, with piano accompaniment which in many cases was also composed by Edgar.for examples see The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections. All were illustrated by John Hassall, many of whose lively images also became classics.

It is the northernmost point of all the territory of the United States, at . The distance to the North Pole is 1122 nmi. The northernmost point on the Canadian mainland, Murchison Promontory, is 40 mi farther north. \n\nPoint Barrow is also an important geographical landmark, marking the limit between two marginal seas of the Arctic, the Chukchi Sea on its western side and the Beaufort Sea on the eastern, both delimited to the North by the edge of the map as seen here.\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that Point Barrow was occupied by the ancestors of the Inupiat almost 1,000 years prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. The headland is an important archaeological site, yielding burials and artifacts associated with the Thule culture, including uluit and bola. The waters off Point Barrow are on the bowhead whale migration route and it is surmised that the site was chosen to make hunting easier.  There are also burial mounds in the area, at the nearby Birnirk Site, associated with the earlier Birnirk culture, identified in 1912 by Vilhjalmur Stefansson while excavating in the area.  \n\nIt was named by English explorer Frederick William Beechey in 1826 for Sir John Barrow, a statesman and geographer of the British Admiralty. The water around it is normally ice-free for two or three months a year, but this was not the experience of the early explorers. Beechey could not reach it by ship and had to send a ship's boat ahead. In 1826 John Franklin tried to reach it from the east and was blocked by ice. In 1837 Thomas Simpson walked 50 miles west to Point Barrow after his boats were stopped by ice. In 1849 William Pullen rounded it in two whale boats after sending two larger boats back west because of the ice.\n\nPoint Barrow has been a jumping-off point for many Arctic expeditions, including the Wilkins-Detroit Arctic Expeditions and the April 15, 1928, Eielson-Wilkins flight across the Arctic Ocean to Spitsbergen.  \n\nIt is close to Rogers-Post Site, the scene of the airplane crash on August 15, 1935 that killed aviator Wiley Post and his passenger, the entertainer Will Rogers.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1972 it was used as a launch site for Nike-Cajun and Nike Apache sounding rockets. It is the site of a Global Atmosphere Watch atmospheric monitoring station.\n\nThe term Point Barrow whales refers to whales that were trapped in the ice at Point Barrow in 1988, which attracted attention from the public of the United States.\nQuestion:\nPoint Barrow is the most northerly point of which country?\nAnswer:\nThe United States of America\nPassage:\nTell Laura I Love Her\n\"Tell Laura I Love Her\", a teenage tragedy song written by Jeff Barry and Ben Raleigh, was an American Top Ten popular music hit for singer Ray Peterson in 1960 on RCA Victor Records, reaching #7 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Later that same year, the song was recorded and released by Ricky Valance in the United Kingdom, where it went all the way to the #1 spot in the UK Singles Chart.  \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" has been a hit in 14 countries, and has sold over seven million copies. \n\n\"Tell Laura I Love Her\" is the tragic story of a teenage boy named Tommy who is desperately in love with a girl named Laura. Although they are only teenagers, he wants to marry her, so he enters a stock car race, hoping to win, and use the prize money to buy Laura a wedding ring. The second verse tells the mysterious story of how the boy's car overturned and burst into flames—though no-one knows why—and the boy was killed, his last words being \"Tell Laura I love her... My love for her will never die.\"  In the final verse, Laura prays inside the chapel, where she can still hear Tommy's voice intoning the title one more time, before it fades out.\n\nRecording history\n\nThe lyrics of \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" originally concerned a rodeo, not an automobile race, as composer Jeff Barry was an aficionado of cowboy culture. However, at RCA's instigation Barry rewrote the song, in order to more closely resemble the #1 hit \"Teen Angel\". The personnel on the original recording included Al Chernet, Charles Macy and Sebastian Mure on guitar, Lloyd Trotman on bass, Andrew Ackers on organ, Bob Burns on sax and Bunny Shawker on drums.\n\nDecca Records in England decided not to release Ray Peterson's 1960 recording on the grounds that it was \"too tasteless and vulgar,\" and destroyed about twenty thousand copies that had already been pressed. A cover version by Ricky Valance, released by EMI on the Columbia label, was No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.  \n\nIn 1962, Smash Records released an album, The Tale of Patches by Dickey Lee, that included a cover of \"Tell Laura I Love Her\". A cover version by J. Frank Wilson & the Cavaliers on the album Last Kiss was released on the Josie Records label in 1964. Another cover was recorded by singer Ricky Nelson.\n\nJohn Leyton attended a singing audition with producer Joe Meek and subsequently recorded the song, which was released on the Top Rank label. At that time, however, Top Rank was undergoing a takeover by EMI, which had already released Ricky Valance's version of the same song. The John Leyton recording was withdrawn from sale.\n\nA decade later, Johnny T. Angel's recording on Bell Records peaked at #94 on June 8, 1974 (US). \n\nTell Laura was one of 50s revival group Sha Na Na's most popular and beloved numbers, both in concert and on record, with lead vocals by group tenor Johnny Contardo.\n\nThe Swedish band the Boppers also released a version on their album Number 1 (1978). \n\nGerman rock band Rudolf Rock & die Schocker sang their version \"Sag' Laura, ich liebe sie\".\n\nMexican artist César Costa recorded a version in Spanish titled \"La Historia de Tommy\".\n\nThe story of the song was adapted for stage and turned into Tell Laura I Love Her (The Musical) in 2007 by Richard C Hague. \n\nAnswering lyrics\n\nLater on an album named The Answer To Everything - Girl Answer Songs Of The '60'S , an answer song, \"Tell Tommy I Miss Him,\" was performed by Marilyn Michaels. It was originally released by RCA Victor Records on a single as catalog number 47-7771. In 1961, country singer Skeeter Davis released the same song on her album Here's The Answer.\n\nThe British singer, Laura Lee with Orchestra directed by Johnny Keating, also recorded a version. It was released by Triumph Records on a single in the UK as catalog number RGM 1030 in August 1960.\nQuestion:\nIn the Pop Song 'Tell Laura I Love Her' what was the name of the young driver the lover of Laura who died?\nAnswer:\nTommy (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nChilham Castle\nChilham Castle is a manor house and keep in the village of Chilham, between Ashford and Canterbury in the county of Kent, England.  \n\nHistory\n\nThe polygonal keep of the Norman Castle, the oldest building in the village, dates from 1174 and is still inhabited. It was said to have been built for King Henry II. But archaeological excavations carried out in the 1920s suggest that it stands on the foundations of a much older Anglo-Saxon fortification, possibly dating from the fifth century, and there is evidence of earlier Roman habitation in the vicinity. In June 1320, Chilham Castle was the venue for a splendid reception hosted by  Bartholomew de Badlesmere for Edward II and his entourage when they were travelling to Dover en route for France. \n\nThe Jacobean building, within sight of the \"Old Castle\" (the keep), was completed in 1616 for Sir Dudley Digges on a hexagonal plan, with five angled ranges and the sixth left open. It has battlemented parapets, clustered facetted brick chimneys and corner towers with squared ogee cappings. The Victorian tradition that this bold but vernacular house was designed by Inigo Jones  is not credited by architectural historians.  Indeed, Nicholas Stone, a master mason who had worked under Jones' direction at Holyrood Palace in 1616, and at the Whitehall Banqueting House, was commissioned to add a funerary chapel to Chilham church for Sir Dudley Digges, to contain Stone's funerary monument to Lady Digges, in 1631-32;  if any traces of the manner of Jones were discernible at Chilham Castle, Nicholas Stone might be considered as a candidate.  It is, nevertheless, one of the finer mansions in the south-east of England and commands exceptional views across the valley of the River Stour, Kent. \n\nThe gardens, said originally to have been laid out by John Tradescant the elder, were redesigned twice in the eighteenth century. First, under the London banker James Colebrooke  (who bought the estate from the Digges family) fine vistas were created stretching to the river and then, under Thomas Heron (who acquired the estate from Colebrooke's son Robert),  Capability Brown made further recommendations for change, some of which were implemented. Chilham Castle was purchased by James Wildman in 1794  and in 1816 was inherited by his son James Beckford Wildman, who sold it in 1861, because of falling income after emancipation of the slaves on the family estates in the West Indies. Plans of Chilham showing some of the substantial changes made to the building by David Brandon for Charles Stewart Hardy in 1862 and by Sir Herbert Baker for mining magnate Sir Edmund and Lady (Mary) Davis in the early nineteen twenties are conserved in the Victoria & Albert Museum. \n\nThe present terracing, altered in the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, leads down to a fishing lake dating from the time of Charles Stewart Hardy in the 1860s and 70s. The walls to the grounds date mostly from the eighteenth century, although the two gatehouses were only added in the early 1920s, again replacing a very different 19th century one.\n\nFrom 1949 until his death in 1992 it was owned by the Hon. John Clotworthy Talbot Foster Whyte-Melville Skeffington  Chilham Castle is currently owned by UKIP activist Stuart Wheeler, who lives there with his wife Tessa and his three daughters, Sarah, Jacquetta, and Charlotte.\n\nThe site now hosts the Chilham Park Equestrian Centre.\n\nIn 1965 it was used for part of the filming of The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders starring Kim Novak, Leo McKern and Angela Lansbury. In 1985 Chilham Castle featured in an episode of 1980s police drama Dempsey & Makepeace as Makepeace's family home (filmed summer 1984). The episode was titled 'Cry God For Harry' and most of the hour-long episode was filmed in the castle and its grounds.  It also featured in the first episode in 1989 of the ITV adventure game show Interceptor produced by Chatsworth Television who were responsible for the earlier Treasure Hunt series. A medieval joust was being held there and a contestant was required to take part in order to progress further in the show.\nIn 1994, the castle featured in an episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot (ITV), as Simeon Lee's manor house Gorston Hall. It was also used in the TV film, \"The Moving Finger\" (Miss Marple) as the magnificent home of Cardew Pye - a character.

There are six held each year, a system established in 1958. Only honbasho results matter in determining promotion and relegation for rikishi (sumo wrestlers). Tournaments in general may be called basho. \n\nA literal translation of honbasho is \"main (or real) tournament\". This term is used to distinguish these tournaments from display basho which are held as part of sumo tours, between the six major tournaments.  Such display tournaments may have prize money attached but a wrestler's performance has no effect on his ranking.  This type of sumo is often called hana-sumo (lit. flower-sumo) as it is not taken as seriously by the wrestlers.\n\nHonbasho last for 15 days. Sumo wrestlers ranked in the top two divisions (makuuchi and jūryō) wrestle once each day, while those of the lower divisions wrestle seven times, approximately once every alternate day.\n\nThe first aim for most wrestlers is to achieve kachi-koshi, or a majority of wins, and thus ensure a promotion for the next tournament. In addition for each division there is a championship prize (yūshō) for the wrestler with the most wins at the end. A playoff on the final day is used to decide the winner in case of a tie.\n\nUnless a playoff is required, two wrestlers will fight each other no more than once in a whole tournament. The bout schedule is set by a committee of sumo elders a day or two in advance of a tournament day, and may be announced from the sumo wrestling ring the day prior by a senior sumo referee. Although there is no fixed method, for the first half of a tournament the top division of sumo wrestlers will generally pair the best-ranking wrestlers (san'yaku) against the lowest-ranking wrestlers (maegashira) in the tournament, with the rest of maegashira fighting among ranks closer in strength. The schedule for the second half of the tournament will have mainly san'yaku fighting each other, with the remainder of the ranks determined by their win-loss records up to that point. One consideration is to minimize the necessity for a tiebreaker bout, particularly if a contender for the yūshō is lower-ranked and has thus far faced only other lower-ranked wrestlers.\n\nOutside playoff bouts, neither wrestlers from the same heya nor wrestlers related by blood are scheduled to fight each other.\n\nFor jūryō and below, the first half of a tournament will have wrestlers of similar rank competing against each other, while the second half will be determined by win-loss records.\n\nA bye is only possible if a wrestler has withdrawn due to injury after the bout schedule for a day is already set, in which case his opponent wins by forfeit. Otherwise, if a withdrawal results in an odd number of wrestlers in one division, the schedule is filled in by pairing a lower-ranked wrestler against a higher-ranked wrestler from the next-lower division.\n\nThe six honbasho are:\n\nThe March tournament in 2011 was cancelled due to the Sumo Association launching an investigation into allegations of match-fixing involving several sekitori ranked wrestlers. This was the first cancellation of a honbasho since 1946, when the summer tournament was not held because of renovations to the Kuramae Kokugikan following damage sustained in World War II. The May 2011 tournament went ahead, but was described by the Japan Sumo Association as a \"technical examination\" tournament rather than a fully fledged honbasho, with tickets given away for free in a lottery, and no prize money or trophies awarded.\nQuestion:\nIn which sport is a contest called honbasho or basho?\nAnswer:\nSumo Wrestling\nPassage:\nSwear It Again\n\"Swear It Again\" is a song by Irish boy band Westlife, released as the first single from their debut album Westlife. It peaked at number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in May 1999.  It moved to 182,000 units in the first two weeks of its release and spent 13 weeks on the charts.  This made it the first of fourteen UK number-one singles. To date, it is Westlife's only single to have charted in the U.S., peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and ranking number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 Year End Charts, in 2000. The song was performed live on Miss Teen USA 2000. The single has sold over 365,000 copies to date in the UK and the US and also achieved gold status there.  \n\nBackground\n\n\"Swear It Again\" is notable for being, along with \"Flying Without Wings\", one of the first two songs that Steve Mac wrote for both Westlife and Simon Cowell. The success of the two tracks led to Mac becoming Cowell's first choice producer and songwriter.  The song's B-side, \"Forever\", was a significant choice because it was the song - as originally recorded by Damage - that first alerted Cowell to the talent of Steve Mac and then led to the producer working with Westlife.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe British video features the band in a mini theatre, singing on a stage fitted with lighting panel flooring while facing a screen with black and white videos of their studio recording process. This version was directed by Wayne Isham and aired in May 1999. The video was shot at Pinewood Studios in March 1999. \n\nThe United States video features the band at a car wash and subsequently washing a white car. This version was directed by Nigel Dick and aired in June 2000.\n\nTours performed at\n\n*Where Dreams Come True Tour (2001)\n*World of Our Own Tour (2002)\n*Unbreakable Tour (2003)\n*Turnaround Tour (2004)\n*The Number Ones Tour (2005)\n*Face To Face Tour (2006)\n*Back Home Tour (2008)\n*Where We Are Tour (2010)\n*The Farewell Tour (2012)\n\nTrack listing\n\n* United Kingdom\n; CD1\n# \"Swear It Again\" (Radio Edit) - 4:04\n# \"Forever\" - 5:05\n# \"Interview\" (Video)\n\n; CD2\n# \"Swear It Again\" (Radio Edit) - 4:04\n# \"Swear It Again\" (Rokstone Mix) - 4:07\n# \"Interview\" (Audio) - 3:36\n\n* Japan\n# \"Swear It Again\" (Radio Edit) - 4:04\n# \"Until The End Of Time\" - 3:12\n# \"Forever\" - 5:05\n# \"Everybody Knows\" (Demo Version) - 4:09\n# \"Let's Make Tonight Special\" - 4:57\n# \"Don't Calm The Storm\" - 3:47\n# \"Interview\" (Audio) - 3:36\n\n* America\n# \"Swear It Again\" (Radio Edit) - 4:04\n# \"Album Snippet Medley\" - 4:55\n\nCharts and certifications\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nChart successions\n\nPersonnel\n\nSong credits\n\nCD production\n\nCover versions\n\nAmerican boyband, WoW, has a remake of the song which became the band's single in mid-2010.

As well as hosting the 1901 FA Cup Final replay, it was the scene in 1946 of one of the greatest disasters in English football, and the subject of an L. S. Lowry painting. It was demolished in 1999.\n\nLocation\n\nSituated on Manchester Road in the Burnden area of Bolton - less than a mile from the town centre - the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. It also hosted the replay of the 1901 FA Cup Final, in which Tottenham Hotspur beat Sheffield United 3-1. \n\nHistory\n\nBolton Wanderers was formed in 1874 as Christ Church FC, with the vicar as club president. After disagreements about the use of church premises, the club broke away and became Bolton Wanderers in 1877 meeting at the Gladstone Hotel.   At this time Bolton played at Pike's Lane but needed a purpose built ground to play home matches. As a result, Bolton Wanderers Football and Athletic Club, one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, became a Limited Company in 1894 and shares were raised to build a ground. Land at Burnden was leased at £130 per annum and £4,000 raised to build the stadium. Burnden Park was completed in August 1895. The opening match was a benefit match against Preston and the first League match was against Everton in front of a 15,000 crowd. \n\nThe finals of the Rugby Football League's 1986–87 and 1988–89 John Player Special Trophy tournaments were played at the ground before crowds of 22,144 and 20,709 respectively. \n\nIn its heyday, Burnden Park could hold crowds of up to 70,000, but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life, mainly because of new legislation which saw virtually all English stadia reduce their capacities for safety reasons. A section of the embankment was sold off in 1986 to make way for a new Normid superstore. \n\nThe club's directors had decided by 1992 that it would be difficult to convert Burnden Park into an all-seater stadium for a club of Bolton's ambition. They were members of the new Division Two (which was known as the Third Division until the creation of the Premier League) but the club wanted to build a stadium to meet these requirements in the event of promotion to Division One and ultimately the Premier League.\n\nThe last ever Wanderers game played at the historic ground was against Charlton Athletic in April 1997. Bolton, who were already Division One champions, defeated Charlton 4-1 after being 1-0 down at half time. Whites' legend John McGinlay scored the final goal shortly before Bolton received their trophy and the crowd united in singing Auld Lang Syne. \n\nIt was decided to build a new multimillion-pound 25,000-seater stadium (later raised to around 29,000) – the Reebok Stadium – 6 miles away at the Middlebrook development. The move took place in 1997, bringing an end to 102 years of football at Burnden Park.\n\nBurnden Park disaster\n\nOn 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the Burnden Park disaster, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British football history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City.  There was an estimated 85,000 strong crowd crammed in for the game, at least 15,000 over-capacity. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes's official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes. \n\nOutside football\n\nThe railway embankment of Burnden Park was seen in the 1962 film A Kind of Loving, starring Alan Bates and June Ritchie. Part of the Arthur Askey film \"The Love Match\" was also filmed at Burnden Park in the early 1950s. A painting of Burnden Park in 1953 by L. S. Lowry, Going to the Match, was bought for £1.9 million by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1999. \n\nRedevelopment\n\nFor some years, the site suffered. Travellers camped in the car park of the derelict Normid superstore and Burnden Park itself fell into disrepair, with demolition not taking place until two years after the last match had been played. \n\nThere is now an Asda superstore on the site, which opened in 2005 after taking over the Big W. The Asda store identifies itself with Burnden Park by having a number of extremely large photographs of the former stadium and players, placed high above the checkouts. Also on the site are a Co-operative travel, a Subway, a Carphone Warehouse and a Johnson's Cleaners adjacent to Manchester Road.\nQuestion:\nWho plays at Burnden Park?\nAnswer:\nBWFC\n", "answers": ["København, Denmark", "K-Town, Copenhagen", "UN/LOCODE:DKCPH", "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Koepenhamn", "K-Town Hardcore", "Capital of Denmark", "Ktown Hardcore", "Copenhague", "Kaupmannahöfn", "Kaupmannahofn", "Kopenhamn", "Koebenhavn", "K Town Hardcore", "Köpenhamn", "Kopenhagen", "København", "Hafnia (Latin)", "Kjøbenhavn", "K Town punk", "Kobenhavn", "Copenhagen (Denmark)", "K-Town punk", "Copenhagen", "DKCPH"], "length": 7654, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6b056473c38137074b7af33c57f2101b4c8056453db8cfd9"}

Chemically, cobalt blue pigment is cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or cobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl2O4. Cobalt blue is lighter and less intense than the (iron-cyanide based) pigment  Prussian blue. It is extremely stable and has historically been used as a coloring agent in ceramics, (especially Chinese porcelain), jewelry, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based cobalt pigment smalt.\n\nHistorical uses and production\n\nCobalt blue in impure forms had long been used in Chinese porcelain,  but it was independently discovered as a pure alumina-based pigment by Louis Jacques Thénard in 1802.  Commercial production began in France in 1807. The first recorded use of cobalt blue as a color name in English was in 1777.  The leading world manufacturer of cobalt blue in the 19th century was Benjamin Wegner's Norwegian company Blaafarveværket, (\"blue colour works\" in Dano-Norwegian). Germany was also famous for production, especially the blue colour works (Blaufarbenwerke) in the Ore Mountains of Saxony.\n\nCobalt blue in human culture\n\nArt\n* Watercolorist and astrologer John Varley suggested cobalt blue as a good substitution for ultramarine for painting skies, writing in his \"List of Colours\" from 1818: \"Used as a substitute for Ultramarine in its brightness of colour, and superior when used in skies and other objects, which require even tints; used occasionally in retrieving the brightness of those tines when too heavy, and for tints in drapery, etc. Capable, by its superior brilliancy and contrast, to subdue the brightness of other blues.\" \n* Cobalt blue has been used in paintings since its discovery by Thénard by painters such as Turner, the Impressionists such as Renoir, Monet and Post-Impressionists such as Van Gogh.  It is stable and lightfast and also compatible with all other pigments.\n* Maxfield Parrish, famous partly for the intensity of his skyscapes, used cobalt blue, and cobalt blue is sometimes called Parrish blue as a result.\n* Cobalt blue was the primary blue pigment used in Chinese blue and white porcelain for centuries, beginning in the late 8th or early 9th century. \nAutomobiles\n* Several car manufacturers including Jeep and Bugatti have cobalt blue as one paint options.\nConstruction\n* Because of its chemical stability in the presence of alkali, cobalt blue is used as a pigment in blue concrete.\nGlassmaking\n* The blue seen on many glassware pieces is cobalt blue, and it is used widely by artists in many other fields.\n* Cobalt glass almost perfectly filters out the bright yellow emission of ionized sodium.\nOphthalmology\n*Cobalt blue is used as a filter used in ophthalmoscopes, and is used to illuminate the cornea of the eye following application of fluorescein dye which is used to detect corneal ulcers and scratches.\nSports\n* Major League Soccer's Sporting Kansas City have had cobalt blue as the secondary color of its home uniforms since 2008. \nVexillology\n* Several countries including the Netherlands and Romania, and a U.S. state - Nevada - have cobalt blue as one of three shades of their flags.\nVideo Games\n* Sega's official logo color is cobalt blue. Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's current mascot, was colored to match. \n\nToxicity \n\nCobalt blue is toxic when inhaled or ingested. Potters who fail to take adequate precautions when using cobalt blue may succumb to cobalt poisoning.\nQuestion:\nDodger, Oxford and Cobalt are shades of which colour?\nAnswer:\nBLUE\nPassage:\nHitler's Eagle's Nest Retreat - Berchtesgaden, Germany\nHitler's Eagle's Nest Retreat - Berchtesgaden, Germany\nIF YOU LIKE THIS... Then you should check out Appenzell,        Switerland or Neuschwanstein Castle, Germany .\nHitler's \"Eagle's Nest\" was designed and built for Adolf Hilter's 50th              Birthday by his personal secretary and Head of the Nazi Party              Chancellery Martin Bormann.  The monument is called \"Kehlsteinhaus\" in German because of it was originally intended to be a \"Teahouse\" for the head of the Third Reich.  This mountain-top hideaway              played a prominent role as the main unit objective in HBO's              critically acclaimed mini-series \" Band of Brothers .\"\n \n \nThe allied bombing and              battles of World War II left the building intact and today the Eagle's              Nest remains in its original state.  In the years after the              war, the Eagle's Nest and the surrounding area of Berchtesgaden              remained a part of US Armed Forces property in southeastern Germany.  The US military set up a recreation center where servicemembers              could hike in the summer and ski in the winter.  The US              military returned the area to Germany in the 1990s.\nAt that time, the German government demolished the American      General Walker Hotel at Obersalzberg, to make way for the      existing bus depot that serves the Eagle's Nest.\n \nTODAY:\nToday, you can get there by taking the local bus or driving              from Berchtesgaden to Obersalzberg, a small village community.  At Obersalzberg, you must buy tickets on the Eagle's Nest bus (the              road is closed to privately-owned vehicles) which takes you up the              mountain.  This bus route provides some of the most spectacular              views of the German and Austrian Alps. \nAt the end of the bus              ride, you will walk through a marble-lined tunnel 400 feet into the              heart of the mountain.  There you will ride the original brass              elevator 400 feet straight up into the Eagle's Nest building at the              top of the mountain.\n \n \n \nThere you will be able to walk around the grounds at 6017 feet              altitude and enjoy the spectacular scenery.\nYou can combine this wonderful day trip with a stay in the      nearby city of Salzburg , which is just across      the German border with Austria .  Or you may want      to visit other World War II historical sights in the area, such      as the Hofbrï¿½uhaus and Dachau Concentration      Camp in Munich .\nTOUR:\nTickets to the Eagle's Nest can be purchased at Obersalzberg.  Busses leave for the Eagle's Nest every 20-30 minutes from 8:00am to               4:00pm daily from May to October.  For more information, call              +49 8652 2969 from May - October, or +49 8652 61244 from November -              April.\nQuestion:\nWhere was Hitler's mountain hideout?\nAnswer:\nBerchtesgaden\nPassage:\nPresidents Cup\nThe Presidents Cup is a series of men's golf matches between a team representing the United States and an International Team representing the rest of the world minus Europe. Europe competes against the United States in a similar but considerably older event, the Ryder Cup.\n\nThe Presidents Cup has been held biennially since 1994. Initially it was held in even numbered years, with the Ryder Cup being held in odd numbered years. However, the cancellation of the 2001 Ryder Cup due to the September 11 attacks pushed both tournaments back a year, and the Presidents Cup is now held in odd numbered years. It is hosted alternately in the United States and in countries represented by the International Team.\n\nFormat\n\nThe scoring system of the event is match play. The format is drawn from the Ryder Cup and consists of 12 players per side. Each team has a non-playing captain, usually a highly respected golf figure, who is responsible for choosing the pairs in the doubles events, which consist of both alternate shot and best ball formats (also known as \"foursome\" and \"fourball\" matches respectively). Each match, whether it be a doubles or singles match, is worth one point with a half-point awarded to each team in the event of a halved match.\n\nThere have been frequent small changes to the format, although the final day has always consisted of 12 singles matches. The contest was extended from 3 days to 4 in 2000. In 2015 there were a total of 9 foursome doubles matches, 9 fourball doubles matches and 12 singles matches. With a total of 30 points, a team needed to get 15.5 points to win the Cup.\n\nTies\n\nUntil the 2005 event, prior to the start of the final day matches, the captains selected one player to play in a tie-breaker in the event of a tie at the end of the final match. Upon a tie, the captains would reveal the players who would play a sudden-death match to determine the winner. In 2003, however, the tiebreaker match ended after three holes because of darkness, and the captains, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. agreed that the Cup would be shared by both teams.  \n\nFrom 2005 to 2013, singles matches ending level at the end of the regulation 18 holes were to be extended to extra holes until the match was won outright. All singles matches would continue in this format until one team reaches the required point total to win the Presidents Cup.  Remaining singles matches were only to be played to the regulation 18 holes and could be halved.  Although this rule was in force for 5 Presidents Cup contests, no matches actually went beyond 18 holes.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was created and is organized by the PGA Tour.\n\nEach contest has an Honorary Chairman. These have been 1994: Gerald Ford, 38th United States President, 1996: George H. W. Bush, 41st United States President, 1998: John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, 2000: Bill Clinton, 42nd United States President, 2003: Thabo Mbeki, President of South Africa, 2005: George W.

They're dull greyish-green with a pale belly and a black and yellow stripe on their heads, which has an orange centre in males. Their thin beak is ideally suited for picking insects out from between pine needles.\nIllustrations\nWarblers and allies (Sylviidae)\nWhere to see them\nPine forests are the best places to see goldcrests, but they range around in flocks of other small birds during autumn and winter. They're widespread and common across the whole of the UK; in autumn, large numbers arrive on the east coast from Scandinavia and make their way across dunes to more suitable habitat.\nWhen to see them\nQuestion:\nWhich is the smallest British bird?\nAnswer:\nGoldcrests\nPassage:\nJeeves and Wooster\nJeeves and Wooster is a British comedy-drama series adapted by Clive Exton from P. G. Wodehouse's \"Jeeves\" stories. The series was a collaboration between Brian Eastman of Picture Partnership Productions and Granada Television.\n\nIt aired on the ITV network from 1990 to 1993, with the last series nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. It starred Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, a young gentleman with a \"distinctive blend of airy nonchalance and refined gormlessness\", and Stephen Fry as Jeeves, his improbably intelligent and bold valet. Wooster is a bachelor, a minor aristocrat   and member of the idle rich. He and his friends, who are mainly members of The Drones Club, are extricated from all manner of societal misadventures by the indispensable valet (\"gentleman's personal gentleman\") Jeeves. The stories are set in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1936.\n\nWhen Fry and Laurie began the series they were already a popular double act (see Fry and Laurie) due to regular appearances on Channel 4's Friday Night Live and their own show A Bit of Fry & Laurie (BBC, 1987–95).\n\nIn the television documentary Fry and Laurie Reunited (2010), upon reminiscing about their involvement in the series, it was revealed that they were initially reluctant to play the part of Jeeves and Wooster but decided to do so in the end because the series was going to be made with or without them and they felt no one else would do the parts justice.\n\nTheme and opening credits \n\nThe theme (called \"Jeeves and Wooster\") is an original piece of music in the jazz/swing style written by composer Anne Dudley for the programme. Dudley uses variations of the theme as a basis for all of the episodes' scores and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for her work on the third series. \n\nCharacters \n\nMany of the programme's supporting roles—including significant characters such as Aunt Agatha, Madeline Bassett and Gussie Fink-Nottle—were played by more than one actor. One prominent character, Aunt Dahlia, was played by a different actress in each of the four series. Conversely, Francesca Folan played two very different characters: Madeline Bassett in series one and Lady Florence Craye in series four.\n\nEpisodes \n\nFour series were produced, with 23 episodes in total; each series but the first consisted of six episodes, with all being broadcast each spring from 1990–93. The five episodes of the first series were directed by Robert Young and first aired in April and May 1990. The second series, directed by Simon Langton, aired in April and May 1991. The third series, directed by Ferdinand Fairfax, aired from March to May 1992. Fairfax also directed the six episodes of the fourth and final series, which initially aired in May and June 1993.\n\nReception \n\nThe third series of Jeeves and Wooster won a British Academy Television Award for Best Design for Eileen Diss. The final series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Graphics for Derek W. Hayes and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series; it also earned a British Academy Television Award for Best Original Television Music for Anne Dudley and a British Academy Television Award for Best Costume Design for Dany Everett.\n\nIn retrospect, Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline called screenwriter Clive Exton \"the series' real star\", saying his \"adaptations come surprisingly close to capturing the flavour of the originals\" by \"retaining many of Wodehouse's most inspired literary similes.\"\n\nDVD releases \n\nGranada Media released all four series on DVD in Region 2 between 2000 and 2002. On 1 September 2008, ITV Studios Home Entertainment released Jeeves and Wooster: The Complete Collection, an eight-disc box set featuring all 23 episodes of the series.\n\nIn Region 1, A&E Home Video released the entire series on DVD in the US and Canada.\n\nIn Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released the entire series on DVD in Australia.

He took up the opportunity to succeed E. E. Baldwin as the Smith of Dunesk Missioner at Beltana, a tiny settlement 500 kilometres north of Adelaide. He was ordained in Adelaide for this work in January 1911. The missioners visited the station properties in a wide radius of Beltana, and their practical and spiritual service was valued in the isolated localities. Flynn used it as an opportunity to look at the potential for something bigger.  By 1912, after writing a report for his church superiors on the difficulties of ministering to such a widely scattered population, Flynn was made the first superintendent of the Australian Inland Mission.  As well as tending to spiritual matters, Flynn quickly established the need for medical care for residents of the vast Australian outback, and established a number of bush hospitals. \n\nBy 1917, Flynn was already considering the possibility of new technology, such as radio and aircraft, to assist in providing a more useful acute medical service, and then received a letter from an Australian pilot serving in World War I, Clifford Peel, who had heard of Flynn's speculations and outlined the capabilities and costs of then-available planes.  This material was published in the church's magazine, the start of Flynn turning his considerable fund-raising talents to the task of establishing a flying medical service.  The first flight of the Aerial Medical Service was in 1928 from Cloncurry, Queensland. A museum commemorating the founding of the Royal Flying Doctor Service is located at John Flynn Place in Cloncurry. \n\nMarriage\n\nFlynn married the secretary of the AIM, Jean Baird, in 1931 at the relatively advanced age of 51.  \n\nDeath\n\nHe finally retired and died in Sydney. He was cremated and his remains placed under a large boulder from the Devils Marbles. The Northern Territory Department of Public Works had taken the rock from a site sacred to its traditional owners, but after many years of negotiations the rock was returned to its original location in 1998. It was replaced with one acceptable to the Aboriginal people, both of the original rock's home and the people on whose land his grave lies.\n\nAwards\n\nFlynn was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1933. \n\nCommemoration\n\nFlynn is featured on one side of the current Australian 20 dollar note.\n\nFlynn's name has also been adopted in commemoration of him, including:\n* The Canberra suburb of Flynn honours his memory\n* The federal electorate of Flynn in Queensland was created by the Australian Electoral Commission in 2006.\n* Qantas has announced that they intend naming one of their Airbus A380s after Flynn in recognition of his contribution to the aviation industry and particularly to his achievement of founding the Royal Australian Flying Doctors Service. \n* The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine has also created a John Flynn Placement Program, which is a scholarship for medical students wanting to experience medical practice in the outback\n\nBooks about Flynn include: \n*Ion Idriess wrote Flynn of the Inland in 1932.

It was founded by three people, Leslie Illsley, Jan Thompson and Benny Sirota who took over the Powell and Wells Pottery at Wheal Dream, where Sirota had previously worked as a decorator and driver. The name is from the Russian , meaning \"a set of three\", or triumvirate.\n\nHistory\n\nTroika was set up in February 1962 by Leslie Illsley, Jan Thompson and Benny Sirota who took over the Powell and Wells Pottery at Wheal Dream, St Ives, Cornwall, where Sirota had previously worked.  They wanted to pursue their vision of pottery as art, without regard to function. This ran counter to the aims of much of the studio pottery movement at the time, as epitomised by the work of Bernard Leach.\n\nThe venture rapidly became successful, gaining both critical praise and high sales through a combination of the summer tourist trade and contracts with department stores such as Heals and Libertys in London. Vases, lamp bases and tableware were made using plaster moulds; tiles and wall plaques were also made in the early years. \n\nThe Troika pottery was based at the Wheal Dream site in St Ives, Cornwall from 1962 to 1970, when it moved to Fragden Place in Newlyn. Benny Sirota left in 1980, and with declining sales the business closed in 1983.  \n\nFrom 19 January to 9 March 2013 an exhibition, \"Troika 1963-1983\" was held at the Penlee House Gallery and Museum Penzance,  celebrating 50 years since the inception of Troika, which included a number of prototypes by Leslie Illsley. Benny Sirota attended the opening and explained the origin of the company's name \"my grandfather escaped from Russia dressed as a woman on a troika – a sledge with three horses...there were three of us who started the firm – and it just gelled.\" \n\nRanges\n\nTroika had two main ranges of ceramics — the rough textured range and the smooth glazed ranges. Although there was some crossover in shapes and styles between the ranges, they each had different characters and different successes. Today the rough glazed wares are more popular and numerous, although the smooth glazed wares are rarer and amongst some collectors, more sought-after.\nA number of examples can be found in the V&A collection.\nQuestion:\nFrom which county does Troika pottery originate?\nAnswer:\nCurnow\nPassage:\nVolkswagen Eos\nThe Volkswagen Eos is a sport compact car produced by the German manufacturer Volkswagen from 2006 to 2015. It has a retractable hardtop coupé convertible body style and was introduced as the successor of the Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet. It was Volkswagen's first production coupé since the Volkswagen Corrado, which ended production in 1995.\n\nThe name Eos is derived from Eos, the Greek goddess of the dawn. \n\nThe Eos production run ended in 2015.  However, a limited number of the base model were sold as 2016 models in the US.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to production, the Eos was shown as the Concept C concept car at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show — designed by a team headed by Peter Schreyer, Head of Volkswagen Design in Wolfsburg.   Other sources attribute the design of the Eos specifically to Slovenian Robert Lešnik.\n\nThe production Eos, produced at the AutoEuropa plant in Portugal, was presented in September 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, with the North American introduction at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January, 2006.\n\nUnlike the Cabrio, which was a convertible version of the Golf hatchback, the Eos is a standalone model with all-new body panels, although it shares the platform and components from the Volkswagen Golf (Mk5). The wheelbase matches the Golf Mk5 and Jetta.\n\nRoof design\n\nThe Eos incorporates into its five-piece folding roof an integrated and independently sliding glass sunroof — making the Eos the only retractable hardtop of this kind.  The roof folds automatically into the trunk in 25 seconds, thereby reducing trunk space from \n\nThe roof was designed and is built by OASys, a subsidiary of Webasto Germany.  The design of the roof system is complex with its own hydraulic control system and numerous rubber seals.   Major maintenance is best left in the hands of specially trained, qualified technicians, which are usually associated with VW dealerships.   Some qualified non-dealer shops have techs that were trained by VW on top maintenance, but major repairs are often considered expensive regardless of who does the work.  Periodic maintenance must be done to keep the seals conditioned so that they function properly, but fortunately this is fairly straight forward to carry out and can easily be accomplished by owners who are maintenance savvy.   Early models had a different seal design that was prone to leaking, but these were updated in the 2009/2010 timeframe.  Proper body alignment is critical for proper top function, so cars that have accident damage (especially in the rear or rear side panels) should be closely inspected.\n\nFacelift\n\nA facelifted Volkswagen Eos appeared in late 2010, and went on sale as a 2012 model outside Europe. This facelift includes a revised front and rear fascias, headlights and tail lights, side mirrors, as well as new wheel designs.\n\nEos White Night\n\nThe White Night edition was a special edition with custom wheels, custom black interior and a black and white colour scheme package. It includes Candy White-coloured body, Deep Black Pearlescent-coloured roof, cherry-red LED tail lights, 18-inch Budapest wheels. Other features include black mirror covers, radiator grille and trim strips, black nappa leather seats, door and side trim and black steering wheel with light-coloured seams, trim strips and radio trim in Candy White, Sill panel strips with White Night letters. Other features include Climatronic climate control system, sports chassis lowered  and heated front seats. This option is available with all non-V6 models. \n\nU.S. Final Edition \n\nSales of the EOS steadily declined as hardtop convertibles fell out of favor with buyers.  In addition the EOS was based on the Mk5 platform and by 2014 had become the last model produced on it.  With sales declining, VW elected to not migrate the model to a more current platform as a redesign would have proven costly.  In mid-2014, VW announced that the model would be discontinued with close of the 2015 model year and VW produced a Final Edition trim to mark the occasion.  This 2015 only version slotted into a mid-trim range in the US market and replaced the Sport trim previously sold there.   The Final Edition was basically a Sport trim with special two tone beige/black leather upholstery and a back-up camera with park distance control added.   The Final Edition was available in 3 basic colors: black, brown and white.\n\n2016 U.S. Wrap-up \n\nIn early August of 2015, VW surprised the North American market by saying that there would be a very limited run of 2016 EOS cars in the basic Komfort trim only.   In October 2015, at least one dealer was quoted as saying only 1,300 cars were made available for the US market in four colors: Black, Brown, Red and White.  Since 2014, the Komfort trim had developed to include a fairly rich complement of standard features to include in-dash navigation.  These cars were far from being consider 'basic' and in fact were quite well equipped.   Interestingly, these final 2016 cars carried a MSRP a good bit below what the exact same trim line had commanded a year or two earlier, making them a relative bargain as the model finally closed out.  By May of 2016, the cars were all but gone from dealer lots.\n\nDrivetrain\n\nInternational markets\n\nThe Eos was released in Europe in the first quarter of 2006, and in North America in the third quarter of 2006. Right-hand drive market Japan began sales in October 2006 followed by New Zealand and Australia in January 2007. It was released in South Africa in the second quarter of 2007.\nQuestion:\nThe Up! and Eos and CC are models of which car brand?\nAnswer:\nFolksvagon\nPassage:\nGuitarist\nA guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.\n\nTechniques\n\nThe guitarist may employ any of several methods for playing the guitar, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers or a guitar pick, melodic flatpicking, and finger-picking.\n\nArt\n\nWhile music is an art form in itself, playing an instrument such as the guitar has long been a popular subject for painters. One of the more famous examples is the painting Degas's Father Listening to Lorenzo Pagans Playing the Guitar by Edgar Degas, which was painted sometime between 1869–72 and is currently owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \n\nNotable guitarists\n\nDespite perceived tendencies in mainstream music diffusion, to Rock music and electric guitar, notable guitarists arrived from other genres and different variations of the guitar instrument.\n\nRock , Heavy metal and jazz\n\nSeveral magazines and websites have compiled what they intend as lists of the greatest guitarists—for example The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine, or 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World magazine.\n\n;Rolling Stone: In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine published a list called The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. This list included 100 guitarists whom the magazine editor David Fricke considered the best, with a brief introduction for each of them.  The first in this list is the American guitarist Jimi Hendrix introduced by Pete Townshend, guitarist for The Who, who was, in his turn, ranked at #50 in the list.\n\nIn describing the list to readers, Paul MacInnes from British newspaper The Guardian wrote, \"Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks,\" though he also noted three exceptions in the top 10.  The online magazine Blogcritics criticized the list for introducing some  allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as Johnny Marr, Phil Keaggy or John Petrucci. \n\nIn 2011, Rolling Stone updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 5 consisting of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Jeff Beck. Artists who had not been included in the previous list were added. Rory Gallagher, for example, was ranked in 57th place.   \nThe 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list.   \n\n;Guitar World: Guitar World, a monthly music magazine devoted to the guitar, also published their list of 100 greatest guitarists in the book Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine.  Different from the Rolling Stone list, which listed guitarists in descending order, Guitar World divided guitarists by music genre—such as \"Lords of Hard Rock\" for hard rock artists or \"Jazzmen\" for jazz players. Despite the appearance in other magazines like Billboard,  this publication by Guitar World was criticized for including no female musicians within its selection.  However, Guitar World recently published a list of \"Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players,\" including Kaki King, Muriel Anderson and Sharon Isbin. \n\n;TIME and others: Following the death of Les Paul, TIME website presented their list of 10 greatest artists in electric guitar. As in Rolling Stone magazine's list, Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the greatest guitarist followed by Slash from Guns 'N' Roses, B.B. King, Keith Richards,  Jimmy Page,and Eric Clapton.  Gigwise.com, an online music magazine, also ranks Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever, followed by Jimmy Page, B.B. King, Keith Richards and Kirk Hammett. \n\nOther genres\n\nThere are many classical guitarists listed as notable in their respective epochs.\n\nIn recent decades, the most \"notable classical and cross genre\" guitarist was Paco de Lucía, one of the first flamenco guitarists to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Lucía as a \"titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar\",  and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Lucía as \"one of history's greatest guitarists.\".\nQuestion:\nName the famous guitarist whose collaboration with the Gibson company produced their first and eponymous solid electric guitar in 1952?\nAnswer:\nLes Paul\nPassage:\n\"World Soccer\" Football of the Year 1984 - Infostrada Sports\n\"World Soccer\" Football of the Year 1984\n\"World Soccer\" Football of the Year 1984\nEvery year the English magazine World Soccer has its readers select winners for its World Footballer of the Year award.

{"input": "Passage:\nHolidays in Wales\nThese are the main holidays traditionally celebrated in Wales that are not shared with the rest of the United Kingdom.  Except for those that fall at the same time as UK public holidays, none of these holidays are bank holidays. There is, however, much support for the recognition of St David's Day as a bank holiday in Wales, in the same way as St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland, and St Andrew's Day in Scotland.\n\nMany of the seasoned festivals originate in the Celtic culture of Wales, as does the manner of their celebration.\n\nHistoric Practice\n\nAs recorded in the Laws of Hywel Dda, the three main holidays (gwyliau) of the medieval Welsh kingdoms were Christmas (Nadolig), Easter (Pasg), and Whitsuntide (Sulgwyn). \n\nOther important holidays were the feasts of St Patrick (Gwyl Badric) on 17 March; St. Quiricus (Gwyl Giric) on 16 June; the Beheading of John the Baptist (called in Welsh Gwyl Ieuan y Moch  St. John of the Swine  as it was the day the pigs were turned out into the woods to forage through the winter ) on 29 August; St Michael (Gwyl Fihangel) on 29 September; and the Calends of Winter (Calan Gaeaf) on 1 November, All Saints' Day (yr Holl Saint).  A special drink called the \"liquor of the Apostles\" (gwirawd yr ebestyl) was brewed for and distributed on these saints' days. \n\nSaints' Days\n\nSt. David's Day\n\nThe patron saint, of Wales is St David, . St. David's Day (') is celebrated on 1 March, which some people argue should be a designated national holiday.\n\nGŵyl Mabsant\n\nOn a more localised level, each parish celebrated a Gŵyl Mabsant in commemoration of its native saint.

The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but has shifted meaning over time. \n\nMany condiments are available packaged in single-serving packets, like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals. They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce,  compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples.\n\nThe term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin condere, meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". \n\nDefinition\n\nThe exact definition of what is and is not a condiment varies. Some definitions include spice and herbs, including salt and pepper,  using the term interchangeably with seasoning.  Others restrict the definition to including only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce. Cheese is also considered a condiment in some European countries.\n\nHistory\n\nCondiments were known in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China, and were often used to improve the taste of spoiling food; before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable.  The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by , leading to a flourishing condiment industry. Apicius, a cookbook based on 4th and 5th century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.\n\nList of condiments\n\nCondiment market in the United States \n\nThe condiment market refers to the marketing and consumer purchase of condiments.\n\nIn the United States, condiment market was valued at USD 5.6 billion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to USD 7 billion by 2015. The condiment market is the second largest in specialty foods behind that of cheese.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Dijon mustard on a spoon - 20051218.jpg|Dijon mustard\nImage:Chrain3.jpg|Chrain (horseradish sauce)\nImage:Oeufsmayo.JPG|Mayonnaise\nImage:Ketchup-01.jpg|Tomato Ketchup\nImage:BasilkumPesto.jpg|Pesto genovese\nImage:Chutneys.jpg|Chutneys\nImage:HAT YAI MARKET 2.jpg|Curry powder or paste\nImage:Megrelian ajika.jpg|Ajika, spicy sauce in Caucasian cuisine\nImage:Tkemali.JPG|Tkemali (Georgian sauce made of sour cherry plums)\nImage:Chinese condiments at the restaurant by bhollar in Nerima, Tokyo.jpg|Common Chinese condiments: soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, white pepper\nImage:Duck sauce packets.jpg|Packets of duck sauce\nImage:Carrburritos salsas and chips.jpg|Salsa\nImage:Worcester Sauce 001.jpg|Worcestershire sauce\nImage:Marmite thick spread toasted bread.jpg|Marmite\nImage:Relish.jpg|Gentleman's Relish\nImage:Flying goose sriracha th.jpg|Sriracha (type of Hot sauce)\nImage:Shichimi tougarashi.JPG|Shichimi\nImage:HK 北角 North Point 和田 Wada Japanese Restaurant 放題 Buffet dinner 山葵 green Wasabi Mar-2013.JPG|Wasabi\nQuestion:\nIn cooking, Senf is German for which condiment?\nAnswer:\nMustards\nPassage:\nÆthelthryth\nÆthelthryth (or Æþelðryþe; about 636 – 23 June 679) is the name for the Anglo-Saxon saint known, particularly in a religious context, as Etheldreda or Audrey. She was an East Anglian princess, a Fenland and Northumbrian queen and Abbess of Ely.\n\nLife \n\nÆthelthryth was probably born in Exning, near Newmarket in Suffolk.  She was one of the four saintly daughters of Anna of East Anglia, all of whom eventually retired from secular life and founded abbeys.\n\nÆthelthryth made an early first marriage in around 652 to Tondberct, chief or prince of the South Gyrwe.  She managed to persuade her husband to respect her vow of perpetual virginity that she had made prior to their marriage. Upon his death in 655, she retired to the Isle of Ely, which she had received from Tondberct as a morning gift.\n\nÆthelthryth was subsequently remarried for political reasons in 660, this time to Ecgfrith of Northumbria.  Shortly after his accession to the throne in 670, Æthelthryth became a nun. This step possibly led to Ecgfrith's long quarrel with Wilfrid, bishop of York.  One account relates that while Ecgfrith initially agreed that Æthelthryth should continue to remain a virgin, in about 672 he wished to consummate their marriage and even attempted to bribe Wilfrid to use his influence on the queen to convince her.  This tactic failed and the king tried to take his queen from the cloister by force.  Æthelthryth then fled back to Ely with two faithful nuns and managed to evade capture, thanks in part to the miraculous rising of the tide. Another version of the legend related that she halted on the journey at 'Stow' and sheltered under a miraculously growing ash tree which came from her staff planted in the ground. Stow came to be known as 'St Etheldred's Stow', when a church was built to commemorate this event. It is more likely that this 'Stow' actually refers to another fair,   near Threekingham.   Ecgfrith later married Eormenburg and expelled Wilfrid from his kingdom in 678. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æthelthryth founded a double monastery at Ely in 673, which was later destroyed in the Danish invasion of 870.\n\nLegacy \n\nBede told how after her death, Æthelthryth's bones were disinterred by her sister and successor, Seaxburh and that her uncorrupted body was later buried in a white, marble coffin. In 695, Seaxburh translated the remains of her sister Æthelthryth, who had been dead for sixteen years,  from a common grave to the new church at Ely. The Liber Eliensis describes these events in detail.  When her grave was opened, Æthelthryth's body was discovered to be uncorrupted and her coffin and clothes proved to possess miraculous powers. A sarcophagus made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for Æthelthryth.  Seaxburh supervised the preparation of her sister's body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied.  She apparently oversaw the translation of her sister's remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge of procedures gained from her family's links with the Faremoutiers Abbey as a basis for the ceremony. \n\nAfter Seaxburh, Æthelthryth's niece and her great-niece, both of whom were royal princesses, succeeded her as abbess of Ely.\n\nSt Etheldreda's Church in Ely Place in Holborn is dedicated to the saint.  It was originally part of the palace of the bishops of Ely. After the English Reformation, the palace was used by the Spanish ambassadors, enabling Roman Catholic worship to continue in the church.\n\nSt Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield is 13th century and was originally Saxon. It was named for Saint Etheldreda because it was adjacent to the Palace of the Bishops of Ely who held her as their patron saint.\n\nSt Etheldreda's is a Roman Catholic parish church in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is part of the Diocese of East Anglia within the Province of Westminster. The church contains the shrine and relics of Æthelthryth, including her hand.\n\nSt.Etheldreda's Church in White Notley, Essex, is a Church of England parish church, of Saxon construction, built on the site of a Roman temple, with a large quantity of Roman brick in its fabric. The church has a small Mediaeval English stained glass window, depicting St. Etheldreda, which is set in a stone frame made from a very early Insular Christian Roman Chi Rho grave marker.\n\nThe common version of Æthelthryth's name was St. Audrey, which is the origin of the word tawdry, which derived from the fact that her admirers bought modestly concealing lace goods at an annual fair held in her name in Ely. By the 17th century, this lacework had become seen as old-fashioned, or cheap and of poor quality, at a time when the Puritans of eastern England looked down on any form of lacy dressiness. \n\nHagiography \n\nThere are a number of accounts of Æthelthryth's life in Latin, Old English, Old French, and Middle English. According to Jocelyn Wogan-Browne, \"more medieval vernacular lives [about Æthelthryth] were composed in England than any other native female saint\".  Æthelthryth appears in Bede's Historia ecclesiastia, Ælfric's Lives of Saints, Goscelin of Saint-Bertin's Lives of Female Saints, the Liber Eliensis, Marie de France's La vie seinte Audree, the South English Legendary, and a Middle English life in BL Cotton Faustina B.iii, among others. A modern fictional account has been written by Moyra Caldecott.\nQuestion:\nWhat word that means 'cheap' or 'gaudy' is derived from the practice of trinkets sold at St. Audrey's fair in England?\nAnswer:\nTawdriness\nPassage:\nPreston | Wallace and Gromit Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nPreston | Wallace and Gromit Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\nTimmy Time\nPreston is a non-speaking character in Wallace and Gromit and the main antagonist of A Close Shave . He is actually a robotic cyber-dog who is a fearsome looking one. He appears in A Close Shave as a deuteragonist. He was left to Wendolene by her father ( Mr. Ramsbottom ). He forced her into starting an illegal sheep rustling scam for wool for her shop during the wool shortage but soon after pilfering Wallace's blueprints for the Wash-o-matic and adapting them for his own ends, he turned to making his own dog food. Unfortunately for him, his plans failed as Shaun swung in and knocked him flying into the Mutton-o-matic dog food making machine. He was then reassembled on a trolley and behaves like a normal dog.\nAppearance in \"The Curse of the Ramsbottoms\"\nIn \"The Curse of the Ramsbottom\" comic strip from the book Wallace and Gromit and the Lost Slipper, he is now a cyber-butler under the employ of Wendolene and her evil fiance, the cheese magnate Rhett Leicester with his army of gnomes.\npersonality (or lack of one)\nPreston was build to be a freindly, and helpful aid, but unfortunately, the end product was anything but. Preston is a pitiless thug and criminal, obsessed with wealth. He was willing to sink to the lowest depths to complete his agenda, willing to dispose of anyone or anything that interfered. He'd also be willing to brutally mince up sheep or humans to make more valuable dog food.\nTrivia\nPreston is named after the lancashire town of Preston, which Nick Park comes from.\nPreston might be a parody of The Terminator due to being covered in skin and is an robot. Also both Preston's and first Terminator's fates were similar: Preston was crushed by a machine and the terminator was crushed by a hydraulic press.\nHe resembles several different breeds of dog, but he mostly looks like an anthromoporthic presa canario.\nThe Preston also shares similarities with the robots from the simpsons episode, itchy and scratchy land, as well as the animatronics from the indie survival horror game, five nights at freddy's.\nApart from growling and roaring, preston is silent.\nUnlike the penguin, who threatened to kill Wallace, preston has killed many sheep very inhumanely, and because of this, he is probably the darkest character aardman has created, alongside misses tweedy.\nThis article is a stub .

He is born to a family in Nottinghamshire, the third of five sons. Although he studies at Cambridge as a teenager, his family is too poor to keep him there, so he is sent to London to be a surgeon’s apprentice. There, under a man named James Bates, he learns mathematics and navigation with the hope of traveling. When his apprenticeship ends, he studies physics at Leyden.\nHe then becomes a surgeon aboard a ship called the Swallow for three years. Afterward, he settles in London, working as a doctor, and marries a woman named Mary Burton. His business begins to fail when his patron dies, so he decides to go to sea again and travels for six years. Although he has planned to return home at the end of this time, he decides to accept one last job on a ship called the Antelope.\nIn the East Indies, the Antelope encounters a violent storm in which twelve crewmen die. Six of the crewmembers, including Gulliver, board a small rowboat to escape. Soon the rowboat capsizes, and Gulliver loses track of his companions. They are never seen again. Gulliver, however, swims safely to shore.\nGulliver lies down on the grass to rest, and soon he falls asleep. When he wakes up, he finds that his arms, legs, and long hair have been tied to the ground with pieces of thread. He can only look up, and the bright sun prevents him from seeing anything. He feels something move across his leg and over his chest. He looks down and sees, to his surprise, a six-inch-tall human carrying a bow and arrow. At least forty more little people climb onto his body. He is surprised and shouts loudly, frightening the little people away. They return, however, and one of the little men cries out, “Hekinah Degul.”\nGulliver struggles to get loose and finally succeeds in breaking the strings binding his left arm. He loosens the ropes tying his hair so he can turn to the left. In response, the little people fire a volley of arrows into his hand and violently attack his body and face. He decides that the safest thing to do is to lie still until nightfall. The noise increases as the little people build a stage next to Gulliver about a foot and a half off the ground. One of them climbs onto it and makes a speech in a language that Gulliver does not understand.\nGulliver indicates that he is hungry, and the little people bring him baskets of meat. He devours it all and then shows that he is thirsty, so they bring him two large barrels of wine. Gulliver is tempted to pick up forty or fifty of the little people and throw them against the ground, but he decides that he has made them a promise of goodwill and is grateful for their hospitality. He is also struck by their bravery, since they climb onto his body despite his great size.\n1\nQuestion:\nWhat was Gulliver's ship called\nAnswer:\nBotswanan Antelopes\nPassage:\nCholecystectomy - Mayo Clinic\nOverview - Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) - Mayo Clinic\nCholecystectomy (gallbladder removal)\nPrint\nA cholecystectomy (koh-luh-sis-TEK-tuh-me) is a surgical procedure to remove your gallbladder — a pear-shaped organ that sits just below your liver on the upper right side of your abdomen. Your gallbladder collects and stores bile — a digestive fluid produced in your liver.\nA cholecystectomy may be necessary if you experience pain from gallstones that block the flow of bile. A cholecystectomy is a common surgery, and it carries only a small risk of complications. In most cases, you can go home the same day of your cholecystectomy.\nA cholecystectomy is most commonly performed by inserting a tiny video camera and special surgical tools through four small incisions to see inside your abdomen and remove the gallbladder. Doctors call this a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nIn some cases, one large incision may be used to remove the gallbladder. This is called an open cholecystectomy.\nGallstones.

{"input": "Passage:\nAndrea Gail\nF/V Andrea Gail was a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands during the \"Perfect Storm\" of 1991. The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North Atlantic Ocean out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her last reported position was 180 mi northeast of Sable Island on October 28, 1991. The story of Andrea Gail and her crew was the basis of the 1997 book The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, and a 2000 film adaptation of the same name.\n\nF/V Andrea Gail\n\nAndrea Gail was a 72 ft commercial fishing vessel constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1978, and owned by Robert Brown. Her home port was Marblehead, Massachusetts. She also sailed from Gloucester, Massachusetts, where she would offload her catch and reload food, fuel, and stores for her next run. She was originally named Miss Penny.\n\nLost at sea\n\nFinal voyage\n\nAndrea Gail began her final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, bound for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland off the coast of eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. headed east to the Flemish Cap where he believed they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26–27. It is known that the ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and unable to maintain the catch for much longer. \n\nDisappearance\n\nThe last reported transmission from Andrea Gail was at about 6:00 p.m. on October 28, 1991. Captain Tyne radioed Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the Hannah Boden, owned by the same company, and gave his coordinates as , or about 162 mi east of Sable Island. He also gave a weather report indicating 30 ft seas and wind gusts up to 80 knots (150 km/h). Tyne's final recorded words were \"She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong.\" Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of 100 ft in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of 39 ft, and so waves of 100 ft were deemed \"unlikely\" by Science Daily.  However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding 60 ft in height from October 28 through 30, 1991.\n\nSearch\n\nOn October 30, 1991, the vessel was reported overdue. An extensive air and sea search was launched by the 106th Rescue Wing from the New York Air National Guard, United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard forces. The search would eventually cover over 186000 sqnmi.\n\nOn November 6, 1991, Andrea Gail's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was discovered washed up on the shore of Sable Island. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon \"did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position\".  Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.\n\nFuel drums, a fuel tank, the EPIRB, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever found. The ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the continental shelf near Sable Island.\n\nCrew\n\nAll six of the crew were lost at sea.\n\n* Frank William \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. (Captain), aged 37 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* Michael \"Bugsy\" Moran, aged 36 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Dale R. \"Murph\" Murphy, aged 30 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Alfred Pierre, aged 32 New York City\n* Robert F. \"Bobby\" Shatford, aged 30 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* David \"Sully\" Sullivan, aged 28 New York City\n\nIn the media\n\n*The story of Andrea Gail and her crew inspired Sebastian Junger's 1997 book, The Perfect Storm, and a 2000 film of the same name, distributed by Warner Brothers.

According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied.

Eda LeShan? Alan Ashley-Pitt? Francis Phillip Wernig? Anonymous?\nDear Quote Investigator: The following quote has been credited to Albert Einstein and posted on Facebook and various websites:\nThe one who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. Those who walk alone are likely to find themselves in places no one has ever been before.\nHere is an alternative version I have seen:\nThe woman who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The woman who walks alone is likely to find herself in places no one has ever been before.\nIs this a sample of Einstein’s wisdom?\nQuote Investigator: Probably not. It does not appear in the comprehensive collection of quotations “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein” from Princeton University Press. 1\nThe earliest evidence of the saying that QI has located appeared in the 1970s. The 1973 self-help book “The Wonderful Crisis of Middle Age” by Eda LeShan contained a discussion about creativity that included a version of the saying, and the author did not attribute the words to Albert Einstein. She stated that the quotation was from a poster she had seen, and in a footnote she identified Alan Ashley-Pitt as the creator: 2\nThe man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The man who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been before.\nCreativity in living is not without its attendant difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt. And the unfortunate thing about being ahead of your time is that when people finally realize you were right, they’ll say it was obvious all along. You have two choices in your life; you can dissolve into the mainstream, or you can be distinct. To be distinct, you must be different. To be different, you must strive to be what no one else but you can be . . . *\n* By Alan Ashley-Pitt (Aardvarque Enterprises, 116 W. Arrellaga Street, Santa Barbara, California 93104).\nHere are additional selected citations in chronological order.\nA “Catalog of Copyright Entries” from the United States Copyright Office for the time period January-June 1971 listed a poster titled “On creativity” by Alan Ashley-Pitt: 3\nOn creativity. [Girl in bandstand in park; poster] PP3. By Alan Ashley-Pitt, pseud. of Francis Phillip Wernig. Print. © Aardvarque Enterprises; 15Jul70; K92106.\nNote that the entry gave a copyright date of July 15, 1970 for the poster and also indicated that Ashley-Pitt was a pseudonym for Francis Phillip Wernig. It is not certain that this copyright entry referred to the poster seen and written about by Eda LeShan in 1973, but the creator was the same.\nIn 1977 a column in the Chicago Metro News weekly newspaper mentioned the quotation. It was seen by the columnist in an office, and no attribution was given: 4\n“The man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The man who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no man has ever been before.”\nThis profound axiom hangs on the wall in the attractive, fashionable office of “Mr. Ebony”, Joseph Owens’ office and although it is rarely seen by those who enter Mr. Ebony’s Boutique, it is an apt and descriptive analogy of this daring clothing entrepreneur and his philosophy.\nIn 1987 a version of the statement appeared in a paper at an academic conference on “Creativity and Innovation: Towards a European Network”. The words were indented indicating they were part of a quotation, but no ascription was given. The word “person” was used instead of ‘man, “woman”, or “one”: 5\nThe person who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The person who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been before.\nThe GoodReads website included a version of the expression with the word “woman” in their database. The number of members who liked the quote exceeded 500: 6\n“The woman who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The woman who walks alone is likely to find herself in places no one has ever been before.”\n― Albert Einstein\nIn conclusion, based on current evidence this saying was probably crafted by Francis Phillip Wernig who was using the pseudonym Alan Ashley-Pitt.  The earliest known version referred to a “man”, and later versions switched to “one”, “person”, or “woman”.\n(Thanks to Amar Singh Saksena whose inquiry inspired QI to construct this question and perform this exploration.)\nNotes:\n2010, The Ultimate Quotable Einstein, Edited by Alice Calaprice, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.

He won the Nevada Republican caucus and primaries in both New Hampshire and South Carolina . Whether his victory is now inevitable , as some observers think, should become more obvious on Super Tuesday.\nThe party's other contenders aren't giving up, though. Trump lost the Iowa Republican caucus to Cruz , who, along with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, hit Trump hard at the GOP debate on February 25 . For Ben Carson and John Kasich, though, low poll numbers on Super Tuesday could signal the end. (Last week, Kasich even suggested that, \"nobody's going to win but Trump.\") For more information on which states each Republican candidate needs to carry to win the party's nomination, check out this graphic from The New York Times .\nAdvertisement\nHow about the Democrats?\nAccording to Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight , Bernie Sanders needs to win Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Vermont on Super Tuesday to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. \"Underperforming his targets on Super Tuesday would mean that Sanders would have to make up more ground later on with less time left on the clock,\" Silver says. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina Democratic primary by a large margin. So if Silver's estimates hold true, Sanders needs to secure some major wins on Super Tuesday to stay in the race.\nWhat about the other states?\nThere's a lot more left to this election season, with other primaries scattered throughout the remaining months. Kansas caucuses and Louisiana primaries, for example, will be held on March 5. Ten days later, voters in several states with large populations — Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio — will get their chance to pick their party's candidate.\nEven if you don't live in one of the states voting on Super Tuesday, the day's events could definitely foreshadow the choice you're likely to face at the ballot box in November. And as the list of Republican candidates narrows, get ready for even more intense debates as the election season rolls on.\nAdvertisement\nQuestion:\nWhat weekday is traditionally called 'Super...' in the election of US presidential candidates?\nAnswer:\nDay of Tīwaz\nPassage:\nHamish Macbeth (TV series)\nHamish Macbeth is a comedy-mystery-drama series made by BBC Scotland and first aired in 1995. It is loosely based on a series of mystery novels by M. C. Beaton (Marion Chesney). The series concerns a local police officer, Constable Hamish Macbeth in the fictitious town of Lochdubh on the west coast of Scotland. The title character was played by Robert Carlyle.  It ran for three series from 1995 to 1997, with the first two series having six episodes and the third having eight.\n\nPlot\n\nMacbeth, accompanied by his dog, a West Highland Terrier named Wee Jock, keeps the peace in the small town of Lochdubh (pronounced with the guttural 'ch' sound, LoCH-DOO).  Macbeth does this in his own way, without undue reliance on the letter of the law and with every intention of avoiding being promoted out of what is his ideal job. He strongly dislikes involvement from Inverness police, and sometimes his main work doesn't seem to be the capture of local very petty criminals, but to keep them away from prison and penalties.\n\nThe major running theme of the series is the tension caused by Hamish's attraction to both the journalist of the local newspaper, Isobel Sutherland (Shirley Henderson) and the aristocratic author Alexandra Maclean (Valerie Gogan). Other themes include the clairvoyance of Hamish's friend and co-worker \"TV John\", John McIver (Ralph Riach), the not-so-secret romance between the school-teacher Esme Murray and the shopkeeper Rory Campbell, the volatile marriage of the publican Barney Meldrum and his wife Agnes, the schemes of the two Lachie MacCraes, father and son, the laid-back, pipe smoking Doc Brown (Duncan Duff), and Major Peregrine Mclean (David Ashton), father of Alexandra and aristocratic penniless bachelor.\n\nThe series had a slightly surreal quality to it, drawing on the superstitious natures of some of the characters and the somewhat eerie beauty of the remote and misty location, and enhanced by the Gaelic music of John Lunn.\n\nProduction\n\nThe series was filmed on location in the village of Plockton, the town of Kyle of Lochalsh and the surrounding area. A map of the Lochdubh area shown in the episode \"In Search of a Rose\" places Lochdubh close to Toscaig, just to the north of Kyle of Lochalsh, which Lochdubh Island being part of the Crowlin Islands.\n\nThe series was directed mainly by Nicholas Renton, with Mandie Fletcher directing four episodes and Jonas Grimas directing two episodes in 1997.\n\nDVD\n\nThe series were released on DVD in the UK and the US in 2005 and 2006 with the exception of the first series episode West Coast Story. This was due to rights issues surrounding the episode's extensive use of excerpts from West Side Story. The third and final series was released in April 2006.\n\nCast\n\nPrincipal characters\n\nWith occasional exceptions, these key characters appear in every episode.\n\nRegular supporting characters\n\nThese characters do not form the centre of any storyline, and appear infrequently, although each may be seen in multiple episodes, as a regular part of village background life.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries 1\n\nSeries 2\n\nSeries 3\nQuestion:\nWho played the title role in ‘Hamish Macbeth’?\nAnswer:\nRobert Carlyle filmography\nPassage:\nDuke of Wellington (title)\nDuke of Wellington is a hereditary title of the senior rank in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It derived from Wellington in Somerset, and was created for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington (born The Hon. Arthur Wesley) (1769–1852), the Anglo-Irish Army leader who is distinguished for leading the decisive victory with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher over Napoleon Bonaparte's forces at Waterloo in Brabant (now Walloon Brabant, Belgiumand); Wellesley later served twice as British Prime Minister. General references to \"the Duke of Wellington\" usually refer to Arthur Wellesley as the 1st Duke of Wellington, unless the context suggests a later date.\n\nThe first duke's father was created the 1st Earl of Mornington and their male-line ancestors were wealthy agricultural and urban landowners in both countries, among the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy.\n\nThe dukedom has descended to heirs male of the body with 11 other titles in various jurisdictions.\n\nHistory\n\nThe titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess of Douro were bestowed upon  Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, on 11 May 1814 after he returned home a hero following Napoleon's abdication.  He fought some 60 battles in his military career, and never lost a single one. He was considered 'the conqueror of Napoleon'. He stands as one of the two finest soldiers Britain has ever produced, the other being the Duke of Marlborough.\n\nThe subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are: Marquess of Wellington (1812), Marquess of Douro (1814), Earl of Mornington (1760 – but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), Earl of Wellington (1812), Viscount Wellesley (1760 – inherited in 1863), Viscount Wellington (1809), Baron Mornington (1746 – also inherited in 1863), and Baron Douro (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n\nApart from the British titles the Dukes of Wellington also hold the titles of Prince of Waterloo (Prins van Waterloo, 1815) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo, 1812) of the Kingdom of Spain, and Duke of Victoria (Duque da Vitória, 1812), with the subsidiary titles Marquess of Torres Vedras (Marquês de Torres Vedras, 1812) and Count of Vimeiro (Conde de Vimeiro, 1811) of the Kingdom of Portugal. These were granted to the first Duke as victory titles for his distinguished services as victorious commanding general in the Peninsular War (in Spain and Portugal) and at the Battle of Waterloo (in what is now Belgium).\n\nThe family seat is Stratfield Saye House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. Apsley House, in London, is now owned by English Heritage, although the family retain an apartment there.\n\nDukes of Wellington (1814)\n\n*Heir apparent: Arthur Gerald Wellesley, Marquess of Douro (born 1978), eldest son of the present Duke\n**His heir apparent: Arthur Darcy Wellesley, Earl of Mornington (born 2010), elder son of Lord Douro\n\nTitle succession\n\nLine of succession\n\n#Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Douro (born 1978) (elder son of the present Duke)\n#Arthur Darcy Wellesley, Earl of Mornington (born 2010) (elder son of Lord Douro)\n#Lord Alfred Wellesley (born 2014) (younger son of Lord Douro)\n#Lord Frederick Charles Wellesley (born 1992) (second and younger son of the present Duke)\n#Lord Richard Gerald Wellesley (born 1949) (second son of the 8th Duke)\n#Lord John Henry Wellesley (born 1954) (third son of the 8th Duke)\n#Gerald Valerian Wellesley (born 1981) (only son of Lord John)\n#Lord James Christopher Douglas Wellesley (born 1956)  (fourth and youngest son of the 8th Duke)\n#Oliver Valerian Wellesley (born 2005) (only son of Lord James)\n#Thomas Richard Henry Wellesley (born 2000) (great-grandson of Lord George Wellesley, fourth and youngest son of the 4th Duke)\n\nShould the direct male line of succession from the first Duke of Wellington become extinct, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles in the British peerage will become extinct, as will the titles of Prince of Waterloo in the Dutch peerage and the dukedom of the Victory and its subsidiary titles in the Portuguese peerage. The dukedom of Ciudad Rodrigo in the Spanish peerage, together with its subsidiary titles, will continue to be held in the female line of descendants of the first Duke. The earldom and barony of Mornington, along with the viscountcy of Wellesley, which are all titles in the Irish peerage, will revert to the line of the Earl Cowley, a male-line descendant of a younger brother of the first Duke of Wellington.\nQuestion:\nThe Dukedom of Wellington takes its title from a town in what county?\nAnswer:\nTown of Somerset\nPassage:\nPDSA Animal Honours - PDSA\nPDSA Animal Honours - PDSA\nPDSA Animal Honours\nExtraordinary bravery and exceptional devotion to duty\nThe PDSA Awards Programme recognises the role of animals in society\nShare\nPDSA Dickin Medal\nUniversally acknowledged as the animals’ Victoria Cross. Instituted in 1943, it recognises animals that display conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty in the field of military conflict. The Medal has been awarded 68 times since 1943. The recipients comprise 32 pigeons, 31 dogs, 4 horses and 1 cat.\nPDSA Commendation\nThe PDSA Commendation was instituted in 2001 to recognise acts of animal devotion  or bravery. Recipients include pets  that have provided great help and companionship, supported their owners through difficult periods, raised the alarm in times of need, or simply made life better through their love and loyalty.\nSince the award was instituted, 67 dogs, seven cats and three horses have been awarded the PDSA Commendation.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the medal known internationally as the animals Victoria Cross?\nAnswer:\nThe (PDSA) Dickin Medal\nPassage:\nTallest Mountains in the World - Famous Wonders\nTallest Mountains in the World\nSouth America\nTallest Mountains in the World\nThe world’s tallest mountains are some of the most majestic and beautiful things that one can be blessed enough to witness in their lifetime. They are all located in Asia and each reach an altitude of over eight thousand meters in height. There are only fourteen mountains in the world that can boast such a height. Below are the ten highest of these fourteen mountains.\nMount Everest. Standing at about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters), Everest boasts the top spot for the tallest mountain in the world. It is located on the border between Sagarmatha Zone, Nepal, and Tibet, China and is part of the Himalayan Mountain Range. Although it is the tallest mountain and attracts many climbers of both advanced and limited climbing skill, it is one of the easier mountains to climb. Don’t be mistaken by what we mean by easier, there is still the danger  posed by weather changes, winds, temperature and altitude sickness that can make such a long climb difficult, but the terrain is a lot more simple to take than some of the other tallest mountains like K2 or Nanga Parbat.\nK2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) is located on the border between Pakistan and China and is part of the Himalayan Mountain Range. It is the second highest mountain in the world and is a far more treacherous climb than Everest. In fact, one of every four people that attempts to reach the summit at about 28,251 feet (8,611 meters), dos not live to see the bottom again. Of all of the highest mountains, above eight thousand meters, K2 has the third highest mortality rate.\nKangchenjunga, once thought to be the tallest mountain in the world, was stated as the third highest mountain at 28,169 feet (8,586 meters) in 1848. Its name translates to “The Five Treasures of the Snow” and each of these peaks is said to represent the five repositories of God: gold, silver, gems, grain and holy books. This mountain is sacred to Kirant religion and because of this when the first expedition to the summit occurred in 1955; the British exploration team stopped a few feet away from the actual summit out of respect. A tradition which most teams that have successfully reached the summit have honorably followed.\nLhotse is the fourth highest mountain on Earth and is connected to Everest at the South Col. It is located on the boarder between Nepal and China and at it highest peak is about 27,940 feet (8,516 meters) high. This mountain is best known for its close proximity to Everest but is special in own right because it is the home of the steepest face of a mountain that is approximately 1.98×1.4 miles in size. This southern face has been the setting for any failed attempts, some notable fatalities and very few successful summit reaches.\nMakalu is the fifth highest mountain in the world and is located about 14 miles east of Everest. It is located on the boarder of Nepal and China. It is an isolated peak that has the unique shape of a four-sided pyramid.  There is another subsidiary peak that doesn’t quite meet up to the “eight-thousander” reputation called Kangchungtse, or Makalu II. It lies northeast of the main summit and is connected to it by a arrow saddle called Chomo Lonzo.\nCho Oyu is the sixth highest mountain in the world and stands at about 26,906 feet (8,201meters) high. Like most of the other Himalayan Mountains, it lies between Nepal and China (Tibet). Its name in Tibetan means “Turquoise Goddess”.  It was used as a warm up for climbing Mount Everest when people were first exploring the Himalayan Mountains and today it is considered the easiest of al of the “eight-thousander” mountains to climb.\nDhaulagiri is the seventh highest mountain in the world and is about 26,795 feet (8,167 meters) tall. It is located just north of central Nepal. Its name means “White Mountain”. The South and West faces of Dhaulagiri both feature massive drops; each rises over 4000 meters from its base, and each has been the site of epic climbs. This mountain, along with Annapurna, is home to a more dramatic scene than most of the other mountains, for they face each other while separated by a valley. This is an amazing sight to see, and one of the main reasons why, for thirty years, it was thought to be the highest mountain in the world.\nManaslu, when translated means “Mountain of the Spirit” and is the eighth highest mountain in the world. It is a part of the Nepalese Himalayans and stands at about 26,759 feet (8,156 meters) high. The mountain’s long ridges and valley glaciers offer feasible approaches from all directions, and culminate in a peak that towers steeply above its surrounding landscape. This is the most dominant feature when viewed from far way.\nNanga Parbat is the world’s ninth tallest mountain and stands at about 26,660 feet (8,126 meters) in height. Although the name is Urdu for “Naked Mountain”, for first half of the twentieth century it was known as “Killer Mountain”. It was called this because it used to be an incredibly dangerous climb to the top. Now however, it is less dangerous to climb, but still very difficult. This mountain is an immense and dramatic peak that rises above its surrounding area in Pakistan.\nAnnapurna is a series of peaks, the highest of which is called Annapurna I, which is the tenth highest mountain in the world. It is located in central Nepal and is approximately 26,545 feet (8,091 meters) tall. Its peaks are some of the world’s most dangerous to climb. In fact, they have a fatality rate of about forty percent.\n33 responses to “Tallest Mountains in the World”\nQuestion:\nEight of the world's ten highest mountains are wholly or partly in which country?\nAnswer:\nNepol\nPassage:\nBlanket stitch\nThe blanket stitch is a stitch used to reinforce the edge of thick materials.  Depending on circumstances, it may also be called a whip stitch or a crochet stitch. It is defined as \"A decorative stitch used to finish an unhemmed blanket. The stitch can be seen on both sides of the blanket.\" \n\nHistory\n\nThis stitch has long been both an application by hand and as a machine sewn stitch.  When done by hand, it is sometimes considered a crochet stitch, used to join pieces together to make a blanket or other larger item. It is used in sewing leather pieces together, as traditionally done by indigenous American cultures,  and even for weaving basket rims. The whipstitch is also a type of surgical suturing stitch. \n\nWhen done by machine, it may be called a whip stitch or, sometimes, a Merrow Crochet Stitch, after the first sewing machine that was used to sew a blanket stitch.  This machine was produced and patented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1877. The defining characteristic of the crochet machine is its ability to sew with yarn and stitch thick goods with a consistent overlock edge. From 1877-1925 the machine evolved dramatically, and consequently so did the capacity of manufacturers to produce goods with the whip stitch.\n\nStyle\n\nThe blanket stitch is commonly used as a decorative stitch on an array of garments.  Besides blankets, it is used on sweaters, outerwear, swimsuits, home furnishings, and much more.  There are many styles of production blanket stitching, including rolled, narrow, with elastic, and traditional (see photos below).\n\nAdditionally, the term \"blanket stitch\" has become a verb, describing the application of the stitch.\nQuestion:\nWhat stitch, also called a whip stitch (when done by machine) or a crochet stitch (when done by hand), is used to reinforce the edge of thick materials?\nAnswer:\nBlanket stitch\nPassage:\n5 Star Parents Who Removed or Altered Their Tattoos ...\n5 Star Parents Who Removed or Altered Their Tattoos | Celebrity Baby Scoop\n> 5 Star Parents Who Removed or Altered Their Tattoos\n5 Star Parents Who Removed or Altered Their Tattoos\nPosted: February 19, 2014\nThink before you ink!\nSome of our favorite celebrity parents have regretted their tattoos.\nFrom Angelina Jolie ‘s ‘Billy Bob’ tat, to Mark Wahlberg‘s multiple markings, let’s take a look at 5 celebrity parents who have altered or removed their ink.\nMalin Akerman:\nNew mom Malin Akerman turned the permanent reminder of her failed marriage to Roberto Zincone into a tribute for her 10-month-old son Sebastian.\nZincone filed for divorce from the Trophy Wife star, 35, just seven months after the couple welcomed their first child.\nPrior to the split, Malin had a large ‘Z’ tattooed onto her wrist in honor of her husband’s last name. But she altered the ink on February 15 during a trip to Jose Cordova at Miami Ink.\n“@josecordova thx for the beautiful tattoo 😉 #miamiink,” Malin captioned her new tattoo via Instagram .\nThe Rock of Ages actress added an ‘S’ over the ‘Z’ to represent her son’s initials.\nJohnny Depp:\nPirates of the Caribbean star and father-of-two, Johnny Depp , once dated actress Winona Ryder. During their whirlwind romance, the actor famously tattooed the words ‘Winona Forever’ to his right upper arm.\nUnfortunately the relationship did not last forever and when they split in 1993, Johnny changed the tattoo to read ‘Wino Forever.’\nAngelina Jolie:\nAcademy Award-winning actress Angelina Jolie had ‘Billy Bob’ tattooed on her left shoulder. Prior to her engagement to Brad Pitt, the Salt actress was wed to Billy Bob Thornton from 2000 to 2003.\nShe has since had the tattoo removed and covered with the coordinates of the birth places of their six children, adding an additional line with Brad’s birthplace. In turn, Billy Bob turned his ‘Angelina’ tattoo into an angel.\nDenise Richards:\nMom-of-three Denise Richards once had ‘Charlie’ tattooed on the inside of her left ankle, in honor of her then-husband, Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen.\nAfter their divorce, ‘Charlie’ was transformed into a colorful fairy.\nMark Wahlberg:\nWhile many enjoy looking at  Mark Wahlberg ‘s muscular and inked body, the Ted actor had the “six or seven” tattoos he’s gotten over the years removed. And the actor is taking things a step further – he’s including his two eldest children Ella, 10, and Michael, 7, in the process.\n“[All the tattoos] have meaning to me, but it’s both personal and professional,” Mark, also dad to Brendan, 5, and Grace, 3,  said .\n“I don’t want my kids getting tattoos,” he added. “And I wanted them to be [removed] by the time I did ‘The Fighter’ because putting make-up on and covering them up has always been a pain in the butt.”\nHe added: “I’ve taken my two older kids to the procedure so they see how painful it is and what I have to go through.”\nQuestion:\n\"What actress once had \"\"Billy Bob\"\" tattooed on her arm?\"\nAnswer:\nAngelina jolie\nPassage:\nFilly\nA filly is a young female horse that is too young to be called a mare.

It included the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido which changed its name from Ezo to Hokkaido in 1869,  and sometimes included Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. The word \"Ezo\" can also refer to the peoples that the Japanese encountered in these lands, referred to in modern times as the Ainu people. \n \nEtymology\n\nEzo is a Japanese word meaning \"foreigner\" and referred to the Ainu lands to the north, which the Japanese named Ezo-chi.Editors: David N. Livingstone and Charles W. J. Withers (1999) \"Geography and Enlightenment\", University of Chicago Press, page 206 [https://books.google.com.au/books?id\nf0K1W_HhGTYC&pgPA206&lpg\nPA206&dqezo+meaning&source\nbl&ots6T9yIu1k9a&sig\nPnz68GfMz-OZRXAX6C56xwz5Omc&hlen&sa\nX&ved0ahUKEwj0uKq_0JrMAhXBxqYKHXYqCIU4ChDoAQg9MAc#v\nonepage&qezo%20meaning&f\nfalse] The spelling \"Yezo\" reflects its pronunciation c. 1600, when Europeans first came in contact with Japan. It is this historical spelling that is reflected in the scientific Latin term yezoensis, as in Fragaria yezoensis and Porphyra yezoensis.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first published description of Ezo in the West was brought to Europe by Isaac Titsingh in 1796. His small library of Japanese books included  by Hayashi Shihei.  This book, which was published in Japan in 1785, described the Ezo region and people. \n\nIn 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh's French translation of Sankoku Tsūran Zusetsu.  Julius Klaproth was the editor, completing the task which was left incomplete by the death of the book's initial editor, Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat.\n\nSubdivisions\n\nEzo was divided into several districts. The first was the Wajinchi, or Japanese Lands, which covered the Japanese settlements on and around the Oshima Peninsula. The rest of Ezo was called the Ezochi, or Ainu Lands. Ezochi was in turn divided into three sections: North Ezochi covered southern Sakhalin; West Ezochi included the northern half of Hokkaido; and East Ezochi included the populous southern Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands.\nQuestion:\nPreviously called Ezo/Yezo/Yeso/Yesso, what is Japan's north and second-largest island?\nAnswer:\nHokkaidou prefecture\nPassage:\nA Devil with Women\nA Devil with Women is a 1930 American Pre-Code film starring Victor McLaglen, Mona Maris, and Humphrey Bogart, and directed by Irving Cummings.  Set in a Central American country, adventurer McLaglen and sidekick Bogart find themselves in a fierce competition for a luscious young woman's attentions.  Notable for being among Bogart's earliest large film roles. \n\nCast\n\n*Victor McLaglen\n*Mona Maris\n*Humphrey Bogart\nQuestion:\n\"Which 1951 Oscar winning actor made his cinema debut in the 1930 film \"\"A Devil with Women\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nHumphrey boggart\nPassage:\nGuitarist\nA guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.\n\nTechniques\n\nThe guitarist may employ any of several methods for playing the guitar, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers or a guitar pick, melodic flatpicking, and finger-picking.\n\nArt\n\nWhile music is an art form in itself, playing an instrument such as the guitar has long been a popular subject for painters. One of the more famous examples is the painting Degas's Father Listening to Lorenzo Pagans Playing the Guitar by Edgar Degas, which was painted sometime between 1869–72 and is currently owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \n\nNotable guitarists\n\nDespite perceived tendencies in mainstream music diffusion, to Rock music and electric guitar, notable guitarists arrived from other genres and different variations of the guitar instrument.\n\nRock , Heavy metal and jazz\n\nSeveral magazines and websites have compiled what they intend as lists of the greatest guitarists—for example The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine, or 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World magazine.\n\n;Rolling Stone: In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine published a list called The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. This list included 100 guitarists whom the magazine editor David Fricke considered the best, with a brief introduction for each of them.  The first in this list is the American guitarist Jimi Hendrix introduced by Pete Townshend, guitarist for The Who, who was, in his turn, ranked at #50 in the list.\n\nIn describing the list to readers, Paul MacInnes from British newspaper The Guardian wrote, \"Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks,\" though he also noted three exceptions in the top 10.  The online magazine Blogcritics criticized the list for introducing some  allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as Johnny Marr, Phil Keaggy or John Petrucci. \n\nIn 2011, Rolling Stone updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 5 consisting of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Jeff Beck. Artists who had not been included in the previous list were added. Rory Gallagher, for example, was ranked in 57th place.   \nThe 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list.   \n\n;Guitar World: Guitar World, a monthly music magazine devoted to the guitar, also published their list of 100 greatest guitarists in the book Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine.  Different from the Rolling Stone list, which listed guitarists in descending order, Guitar World divided guitarists by music genre—such as \"Lords of Hard Rock\" for hard rock artists or \"Jazzmen\" for jazz players. Despite the appearance in other magazines like Billboard,  this publication by Guitar World was criticized for including no female musicians within its selection.  However, Guitar World recently published a list of \"Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players,\" including Kaki King, Muriel Anderson and Sharon Isbin. \n\n;TIME and others: Following the death of Les Paul, TIME website presented their list of 10 greatest artists in electric guitar. As in Rolling Stone magazine's list, Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the greatest guitarist followed by Slash from Guns 'N' Roses, B.B. King, Keith Richards,  Jimmy Page,and Eric Clapton.  Gigwise.com, an online music magazine, also ranks Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever, followed by Jimmy Page, B.B. King, Keith Richards and Kirk Hammett. \n\nOther genres\n\nThere are many classical guitarists listed as notable in their respective epochs.\n\nIn recent decades, the most \"notable classical and cross genre\" guitarist was Paco de Lucía, one of the first flamenco guitarists to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Lucía as a \"titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar\",  and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Lucía as \"one of history's greatest guitarists.\".\nQuestion:\nName the famous guitarist whose collaboration with the Gibson company produced their first and eponymous solid electric guitar in 1952?\nAnswer:\nLes Paul\n", "answers": ["Perfect storm (disambiguation)", "The Perfect Storm", "Perfect Storm"], "length": 7944, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fd0480424369d3ea8d6b3958bde1a23a75980cf3413f7164"}

He is also one of Tintin 's closest friends. Haddock is highly addicted to whiskey but he also likes other spirits like rum. He first appeared in The Crab with the Golden Claws and had been in every Tintin  book since then. \nContents\n[ show ]\nHistory\nCaptain Haddock sailed over twenty years with his old friend, Captain Chester , before becoming commander of the Karaboudjan where his alcoholism was taken advantage of by his crooked first mate Allan Thompson . Tintin rescued him from the ship and the two friends were barely ever parted again. He is a direct descendant of the 17th century seafarer Sir Francis Haddock , a sea captain under Charles II. He was the captain for two expeditions during his adventures with Tintin, commanding the Aurora in The Shooting Star during the expedition to find the meteorite and the Sirius , Captain Chester's ship that he lent to Haddock to find Red Rackham's treasure. At the end of the latter adventure, Haddock acquired with the proceeds of the sale of his friend Cuthbert Calculus ' patent for the Shark-proof submarine , Marlinspike Hall , which once belonged to Captain Haddock's ancestor Francis. Haddock retired from sailing there and invited Tintin and Calculus to indefinitely live there with him.\nName\nAs for the origin of the name of Captain Haddock's name, who first appeared in Hergé 's notes in 1938 , according to Philippe Goddin , author of Chronology of a work, it is inspired by Captain Craddock, Franco-German film Hanns Schwarz and Max Vaucorbeil (1931), of which Hergé was a big fan. In the original french version of The Crab with the Golden Claws, Captain Haddock even sings a song in the film: Guys navy. However, according to the first wife of Hergé, Germaine Kiekens , the name \"Haddock\" comes from the English fish dish, the smoked haddock. However, the name Haddock is a real surname in English, examples such as Sir Richard Haddock (1629-1715) ordered the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay. His second son, Nicholas Haddock followed the career of his father. In addition, Herbert James Haddock (1861-1946) was commander of the White Star Line and the Titanic among others in the technical tests before delivery to the transatlantic company, and then the sister ship of the Titanic, the Olympic.\nDrunkness\nCaptain Haddock was a drunkard, Which is one of his weaknesses. He hates drinking anything that doesn´t contain alcohol, like water. He did make attampts to shake this habit, even becoming the president of the Society of Sober Sailors , a seafarers equivalent to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Professor Calculus invented the pills to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant in Tintin and the Picaros , this weakness was gone.\nNames\nCaptain Haddock has a large amount of names hne isyvocabularyells many when he wishes to insult.\nBianca's Names\nBianca Castafiore has trouble remembering Haddock's last name and has created many new names, below is a list:\nAddock, Capslock, Kapok, Bangkok, Bartok, Fatstock, Drydock, Hopscotch, Stopcock, Hammock, Paddock, Hassock, Havoc, Maggot, Bootblack, Balzac, Bedsock, Padlock, Hatbox, Stockpot, Harrock, and Hemlock.\nOne reason why Bianca Castafiore always has trouble saying Haddock's last name correctly may be because when they first met in the book The Calculus Affair, Haddock was unable to say his name correctly:\nCastafiore: Aha, you little flatterer, so you've come to congratulate me, with this... fisherman...

James Beck died suddenly in 1973, and is featured in just under three-quarters of the episodes. Despite this, the character of Walker was possibly one of the most prominent and popular in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \"The Recruit\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas) who had made a previous cameo appearance in My British Buddy.\n\nPersonality\n\nWalker was the second youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Pike. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Mainwaring's side as he doesn't share his idealism and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, due to his many \"business\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that is rationed or no longer in the shops due to the War - and he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). \n\nPrivate Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \"business\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \"essential supplies\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \"a couple of bottles of scotch\" to a high-ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \"essential supplies\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker).\n\nWalker considers himself a ladies' man, and his recurring girlfriend Shirley (played by Wendy Richard) is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in If the Cap Fits..., he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \"Taffy\", and occasionally calling Jones a \"silly old duffer\" when they have the odd disagreement.\n\nHe is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat.  Although a superficially implausible explanation for Walker's discharge it is actually possible to have an [http://www.livestrong.com/article/525254-corned-beef-allergy/ allergy to certain types of corned beef] but not beef itself as a result of various antioxidants that may be used in the curing process.\n\nWalker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next, The Recruit, in which the story suggested that Walker had \"gone to the smoke\" (a slang term for London) to \"do a deal\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring, now an alderman, launches his \"I'm Backing Britain\" campaign - Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch).\n \nIn the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. In 1976 John Bardon played Walker in the stage production. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode Absent Friends and starred in Are You Being Served?).\nQuestion:\nWho played Private Joe Walker in Dad’s Army?\nAnswer:\nJimmy Beck\nPassage:\nGrapheme\nIn linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.  An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols.\n\nThe word grapheme, coined in analogy with phoneme, is derived , and the suffix -eme, by analogy with phoneme and other names of emic units. The study of graphemes is called graphemics.\n\nThe concept of graphemes is an abstract one and similar to the notion in computing of a character. By comparison, a specific shape that represents any particular grapheme in a specific typeface is called a glyph. For example, the grapheme corresponding to the abstract concept of \"the Arabic numeral one\" has two distinct glyphs (allographs) in the fonts Times New Roman and Helvetica.\n\nNotation\n\nGraphemes are often notated within angle brackets, as , , etc.  This is analogous to the slash notation (/a/, /b/) used for phonemes, and the square bracket notation used for phonetic transcriptions ([a], [b]).\n\nGlyphs\n\nIn the same way that the surface forms of phonemes are speech sounds or phones (and different phones representing the same phoneme are called allophones), the surface forms of graphemes are glyphs (sometimes \"graphs\"), namely concrete written representations of symbols, and different glyphs representing the same grapheme are called allographs. Hence a grapheme can be regarded as an abstraction of a collection of glyphs that are all semantically equivalent.\n\nFor example, in written English (or other languages using the Latin alphabet), there are many different physical representations of the lowercase letter \"a\", such as a, ɑ, etc. But because the substitution of any of these for any other cannot change the meaning of a word, they are considered to be allographs of the same grapheme, which can be written . Italic and bold face are also allographic.\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether capital and lower-case letters are allographs or distinct graphemes. Capitals are generally found in certain triggering contexts which do not change the word: When used as a proper name, for example, or at the beginning of a sentence, or all caps in a newspaper headline. Some linguists consider digraphs like the  in ship to be distinct graphemes, but these are generally analyzed as sequences of graphemes. Ligatures, however, such as , are distinct graphemes, as are various letters with distinctive diacritics, such as .\n\nTypes of graphemes\n\nThe principal types of phonographic graphemes are logograms, which represent words or morphemes (for example Chinese characters, the ampersand \"&\" representing the word and, Arabic numerals); syllabic characters, representing syllables (as in Japanese kana); and alphabetic letters, corresponding roughly to phonemes (see next section). For a full discussion of the different types, see .\n\nNot all graphemes are phonographic (write sounds). There are additional graphemic components used in writing, such as punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, word dividers such as the space, and other typographic symbols.\n\nRelationship between graphemes and phonemes\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, in languages that use alphabetic writing systems, many of the graphemes stand in principle for the phonemes (significant sounds) of the language. In practice, however, the orthographies of such languages entail at least a certain amount of deviation from the ideal of exact grapheme–phoneme correspondence. A phoneme may be represented by a multigraph (sequence of more than one grapheme), as the digraph sh represents a single sound in English (and sometimes a single grapheme may represent more than one phoneme, as with the Russian letter я). Some graphemes may not represent any sound at all (like the b in English debt), and often the rules of correspondence between graphemes and phonemes become complex or irregular, particularly as a result of historical sound changes that are not necessarily reflected in spelling. \"Shallow\" orthographies such as those of standard Spanish and Finnish have relatively regular (though not always one-to-one) correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, while those of French and English have much less regular correspondence, and are known as deep orthographies.\n\nMultigraphs representing a single phoneme are normally treated as combinations of separate letters, not as graphemes in their own right. However, in some languages a multigraph may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of collation; for example, in a Czech dictionary, the section for words that start with  comes after that for .

It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. \n\nDuring the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag.   However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners.  \n\nHistory\n\nWhen the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on April 25, 1962 the newly elected Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC– a tricolor having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this design before the country's independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa's sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).   The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country.  \n\nOther flags\n\nFile:Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Flag of the Uganda Protectorate (1914-March, 1962)\nFile:Standard of the Governor of the Uganda Protectorate.svg|Standard of the Governor of Uganda (1914 - March, 1962)\nFile:Flag of Uganda 1962.svg|National flag (March - October 9, 1962) \nFile:Presidential Standard of Uganda.svg|Presidential Standard of Uganda\n\nSimilar Flags\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of bird appears on the flag of Uganda?\nAnswer:\nCrowned crane (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nTriops cancriformis\nTriops cancriformis, or tadpole shrimp, is a species of tadpole shrimp found in Europe to the Middle East and India.\n\nDue to habitat destruction, many populations have recently been lost across its European range, so, the species is considered endangered in the United Kingdom and in several European countries.  In captivity they commonly grow up to 6 cm; in the wild they can achieve sizes of 11 cm.\n\nIn the UK, there are just two known populations: in a pool and adjacent area in the Caerlaverock Wetlands in Scotland, and a temporary pond in the New Forest.  The species is legally protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).\n\nThis species is considered to be one of the oldest living species on the planet at around 200 million years old. Fossils of this species from the Upper Triassic (Norian) period appear virtually unchanged compared to modern day members of the species. \n\nLife cycle\n\nTriops cancriformis has a very fast life cycle, and individuals become mature in about two weeks after hatching. Their populations can be gonochoric, hermaphroditic or androdioecious. The latter is a very rare reproductive mode in animals, in which populations are made of hermaphrodites, with a small proportion of males. Due to this lack of males, early researchers thought Triops were parthenogenetic. The presence of testicular lobes scattered amongst their ovaries confirmed they were in fact hermaphroditic. Fertilized females of hermaphrodites produce diapausing eggs or cysts, able to survive decades in the sediment of the ponds and lakes they inhabit. These eggs are resistant to drought and temperature extremes.\n\nTaxonomic history\n\nIn 1801, Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc made the first officially recognised species description of Triops cancriformis.  He named this species Apus cancriformis. Other authors used the name Apus cancriformis over the years but often with the wrong original author of this name.\n\nIn 1909, Ludwig Keilhack used the correct name \"Triops cancriformis (Bosc)\" in a field identification key of the freshwater fauna of Germany. He took up the genus name proposed by Schrank and suggested that the genus name Apus be replaced with Triops Schrank. However, other authors disagreed with him and the controversy continued until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1955, Alan Longhurst provided the original author of T. cancriformis as \"Triops cancriformis (Bosc, 1801)\" with a full history of synonymy to support it.  This was in a taxonomic review of the Notostraca that also supported using the genus name Triops instead of Apus. In 1958, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) recognised the name Triops cancriformis (Bosc, 1801–1802) (ICZN name no. 1476) as officially the oldest. They also recognised the genus name Triops Schrank instead of Apus. They followed Longhurst in these decisions.\n\nHuman uses\n\nThough members of the Triops genus usually have no economic importance the Beni-kabuto ebi albino variant of Triops cancriformis has been used to control mosquitoes and weeds in Asian rice fields.\n\nTriops cancriformis is the second most common species raised by hobbyists next to Triops longicaudatus. They are particularly valued for their lower hatching temperature and somewhat longer lifespan as well as potentially larger size.\nQuestion:\nTriops Cancriformis, discovered in Scotland in July 2010 and said by scientists to have the oldest pedigree (over 200m years) of any living animal on Earth is what type of creature?\nAnswer:\nQueen prawns\nPassage:\nImago\nIn biology, the imago is the last stage an insect attains during its metamorphosis, its process of growth and development; it also is called the imaginal stage, the stage in which the insect attains maturity. It follows the final ecdysis of the immature instars.Carpenter, Geo. H., The Life-Story of Insects. Cambridge University Press 1913. May be downloaded from: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410 or https://archive.org/details/thelifestoryofin16410gut\n\nIn a member of the Ametabola or Hemimetabola, in which metamorphosis is \"incomplete\", the final ecdysis follows the last immature or nymphal stage.\nIn members of the Holometabola, in which there is a pupal stage, the final ecdysis follows emergence from the pupa, after which the metamorphosis is complete, although there is a prolonged period of maturation in some species.\n\nThe imago is the only stage during which the insect is sexually mature and, if it is a winged species, has functional wings. The imago often is referred to as the adult stage.\n\nMembers of the order Ephemeroptera (mayflies) do not have a pupal stage, but they briefly pass through an extra winged stage called the subimago. Insects at this stage have functional wings but are not yet sexually mature.\n\nThe Latin plural of imago is imagines, and this is the term generally used by entomologists –\nhowever, imagoes is also acceptable. \n\nEtymology\n\nImago is Latin for \"image\".\nQuestion:\nThe state in some insects between the larva and the imago is known as what?\nAnswer:\nSuper Grub Disk\nPassage:\nDisaster\nA disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society  to cope using its own resources.\n\nIn contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.Quarantelli E.L. (editor) \"Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go\", What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question, London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146-159\n\nDeveloping countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of GDP) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.  \n\nEtymology\n\nThe word disaster is derived from Middle French désastre and that from Old Italian disastro, which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek pejorative prefix δυσ-, (dus-) \"bad\"  and ἀστήρ (aster), \"star\".  The root of the word disaster (\"bad star\" in Greek) comes from an astrological sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets. \n\nClassifications\n\nResearchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years disaster research. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate disaster management measures.Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner. At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters, Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-415-25216-4 Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in developing countries. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an earthquake that causes a tsunami, resulting in coastal flooding.\n\nNatural hazard\n\nA natural hazard is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.  \n\nVarious phenomena like earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable land forms, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions which make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable, tardy communication, and poor or no budgetary allocation for disaster prevention, developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters. Asia tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.\n\nHuman-instigated disasters\n\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include stampedes, fires, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.\nQuestion:\nThe catastrophic disaster at a plant in Chernobyl in the Ukraine in April 1986 is described as what kind of accident?\nAnswer:\nNuclear (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nThe 19th-Century British Poet Laureates\nLouisiana Tech University - Frellsen Fletcher Smith - The 19th-Century British Poet Laureates\nThe 19th-Century British Poet Laureates\nDocuments by the 19th-Century British Poet Laureates\nThe post of British Poet Laureate has existed in some form since 1189, and though it was traditionally a position held for life, it is now held for a period of ten years. During the 19th century, five different men held the post, though Henry James Pye was appointed in the late 18th century and served until 1813, and Alfred Austin was appointed in 1896 and served most of his term during the early 20th century. The three men who served in between those two, and who indeed served for 83 of the years of the 19th century, were Robert Southey (served 1813-1843), William Wordsworth (served 1843-1850), and Alfred, Lord Tennyson (served 1850-1892). At Louisiana Tech we are fortunate to have documents by all three of these men in The Frellsen Fletcher Smith Collection, including handwritten poems by all three men.

The show transferred to television in 1955 with the launch of ITV, where it continued until 1968. As it was the first game show broadcast on commercial television in the UK (and the BBC did not at that point offer monetary prizes on its game shows), it was also by default the first British game show to offer cash prizes.The programme was later revived from 24 February 1992 to 28 August 1998.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first television version was produced by Associated-Rediffusion (later Rediffusion London), while the revival was made by Thames Television (whose arrival as the new London weekday ITV company had led to the original show's demise).\n\nIf they got through the \"Yes-No Interlude\" (in which they had to answer a series of questions without using the words \"yes\" or \"no\" or be gonged off the stage), contestants would answer questions to win modest monetary prizes and at the climax of the show had to decide whether to \"take the money\" or \"open the box\". The box could contain good prizes (for the time), such as a holiday or a washing machine, but could also contain booby prizes such as a mousetrap or a bag of sweets.\n\nThe first version was hosted by Michael Miles (after its demise, Miles hosted a similar show for Southern Television called Wheel of Fortune, not to be confused with the later Wheel of Fortune of the same title). Bob Danvers-Walker, the voice of Pathé News from 1940 until its demise in 1970, was the show's announcer, and Alec Dane was on hand to bang the gong. At the electronic organ was Harold Smart.\n\nDes O'Connor became the host for the second version in the 1990s. His future wife Jodie Wilson was one of the hostesses; she would later be replaced by Neighbours twins Gayle and Gillian Blakeney.\n\nIt was revived again for one night only as part of Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon in 2005, a series of the Geordie duo presenting classic ITV gameshows as part of the channel's 50th anniversary in their own style.\n\nA similar formula was used for Pot of Gold, another game show, hosted by O'Connor.\n\nThe Des O'Connor series is currently being repeated on Challenge.\n\nThe game was played during the ninth series of Britain's Got More Talent.\n\nYes/No interlude\n\nIn this opening game, the host asked the contestant a series of questions for 60 seconds and the contestant could not say yes, no, nod or shake their heads. If they did, the co-host would bang the gong and the contestant would be eliminated (unless other contestants did the same).\n\nBox numbers and the prizes\n\nThere were 10 boxes numbered from 1 to 10 and an additional Box 13. Of the former, there were 3 boxes containing booby prizes, 1 containing a star prize (e.g. a small car) and 6 containing other prizes (of which 1 was a \"treasure chest\" of cash). One box also included the option to choose Box 13. The host offered an alternative prize of up to about £50 (or, in the revival, a number of hundreds of pounds) in cash and the contestant had to choose between \"taking the money\" and \"opening the box\".\n\nIn this game, the contestant might answer 3 out of 4 questions correctly before the contestant picks the boxes from 1 to 10 and activating box 13 within the 10 boxes like cinema tickets, baby food,cowboy hats or pork pies which relates to a prize, but also with larger prizes containing such as television sets, video players, cash, karaoke machines, double beds, music vouchers & sofas and booby prizes containing nose hair trimmers, last night's cold food, a box of chocolates, breakfast cereals, rotten tomatoes, cat food and dog food and the star prizes containing kitchen appliances, cars, motorbikes, jet skis, hotels, computers and holidays.\n\nCultural references\n\nA sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus (called \"Spot the Brain Cell\" in a later audio version) has John Cleese  playing an \"evil\" game show host, hitting contestants over the head with a giant hammer, which is clearly a wildly exaggerated version of Michael Miles (the game he is hosting is a parody of the \"Yes-No Interlude\" from Take Your Pick!). An early version of this sketch appeared in At Last the 1948 Show. For a time after Miles' death the sketch was not shown by the BBC, but it has since been reinstated.\n\nAlso, in the Hungarian Tourist sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus, a prosecutor (played by Eric Idle) plays the game with Alexander Yalt (played by Michael Palin). The prosecutor manages to gong Yalt \"out\" for answering a question with \"yes\" (although, Yalt was probably unaware of playing the game in the first place).\n\nA sketch in the BBC Radio comedy series The Burkiss Way featured a \"Dinosaur-Cheese Interlude\", in which contestants were required to answer questions without mentioning any species of dinosaur or any variety of cheese (besides Edam, which was \"made\" backwards). Naturally, all the contestants did accidentally mention them.\n\nA fifth season episode of the radio show Hancock's Half Hour (broadcast May 1958) had Tony Hancock appear on the (unnamed) show and win £4,000.\n\nThe British progressive rock band Hatfield and the North named one of their songs \"The Yes No Interlude\". It is included in their second LP, The Rotters' Club.\n\nThe 1970s radio programme I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again made frequent references to Take Your Pick with phrases such as \"Stake the bunny!\" \"Open the box!\"\n\nTransmissions\n\nAssociated-Rediffusion\n\nOnly 6 out of the 494 episodes from the Associated-Rediffusion era survived from the archives including Episode 2 of Series 1, Episode 39 of Series 10, Episodes 1-2 of Series 12 and Episodes 18 & 44 of Series 13. \n\nThames\nQuestion:\n\"What was the three word name of the manwith the gong in the \"\"yes or no\"\" interlude in the 1960s game show Take Your Pick?\"\nAnswer:\nBOB DANVERS WALKER\nPassage:\nOn the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates\nOn the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates () is Søren Kierkegaard's 1841 doctoral thesis under .  This thesis is the culmination of three years of extensive study on Socrates, as seen from the view point of Xenophon, Aristophanes, and Plato. \n\nHis thesis dealt with irony, and in particular, Socratic irony.  In Part One, Kierkegaard regards Aristophanes' portrayal of Socrates, in Aristophanes' The Clouds to be the most accurate representation of the man.  Whereas Xenophon and Plato portrayed Socrates seriously, Kierkegaard felt that Aristophanes best understood the intricacies of Socratic irony.\n\nIn the shorter Part Two of the dissertation, Kierkegaard compares Socratic irony with contemporary interpretations of irony. Here he offers analysis of major 19th century writers and philosophers including Fichte, Schlegel, and Hegel.

The majority of Canada's population is concentrated in the areas close to the U.S. border. Its four largest provinces by area (Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta) are also its most populous; together they account for 86% of the country's population. The territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon) account for over a third of Canada's area but are home to only 0.3% of its population, which skews the national population density value.\n\nCanada's population grew by 5.9% between the 2006 and 2011 censuses. All territories and provinces, excluding the Northwest Territories, increased in population from 2006 to 2011. In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was Yukon with an increase of 11.6% between 2006 and 2011, followed by Alberta with 10.8% growth. The Northwest Territories experienced a net loss of two people between 2006 and 2011.\n\nCanada's population has increased every year since Confederation in 1867 (see List of population of Canada by years).\n\nListing \n\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 3.1%\n| 6.7%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 1.8\n| 14\n| 4.1%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|3.2%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 2.8%\n| 0.9%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 17.4\n| 11\n| 3.3%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 2.6%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 8\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 2.2%\n| 2.9%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 10.5\n| 10\n| 3.0%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 2.1%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 9\n| align=\"left\" nowrap | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 1.5%\n| 1.8%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 1.4\n| 7\n| 2.1%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|1.5%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 10\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.42%\n| 3.2%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 24.7\n| 4\n| 1.2%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|0.41%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 11\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.12%\n| −0.005%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.04\n| 1\n| 0.3%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|0.12%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 12\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.10%\n| 11.6%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.07\n| 1\n| 0.3%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|0.10%\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 13\n| align=\"left\" | \n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.10%\n| 8.3%\n| align=\"right\" | \n| 0.02\n| 1\n| 0.3%\n| align=\"right\" | \n|0.10%\n|- class\"sortbottom\" bgcolor\n\"white\" align=\"center\"\n|bgcolor=\"white\"| Total\n|bgcolor\"white\" align\n\"left\"| \n|bgcolor\"white\" align\n\"right\"| \n|bgcolor=\"white\"|100%\n|bgcolor=\"white\"|5.9%\n|bgcolor\"white\" align\n\"right\"| \n|bgcolor=\"white\"| 3.7\n|bgcolor=\"white\"| 338\n|bgcolor=\"white\"| 100%\n|bgcolor\"white\" align\n\"right\"| \n|bgcolor=\"white\"|100%\n|}\nQuestion:\nWhat is Canada's most populous province?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nDuffel coat\nA duffel coat, is a coat made from duffel, a coarse, thick, woollen material. The name derives from Duffel, a town in the province of Antwerp in Belgium where the material originated. Duffel bags were originally made from the same material. The duffel coat may have initially come from the Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. The hood and toggle fastenings proved popular and it spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was being supplied to the British Royal Navy, and Field Marshal Montgomery was a famous wearer of the coat in World War II. After the war, the coats became available as government surplus stock and became popular, especially with students.\n\nThe coat is made of dense woollen cloth, and distinctive features include a capacious hood that can be worn over a uniform cap, three or four wood or horn toggles with leather loops for ease of fastening when wearing gloves, a buttonable strap neck and two large outside patch pockets. Early versions were knee-length but later ones were shorter. Modern coats are made in a softer woollen material. The coat has had many notable wearers and is associated with left-wing politics.\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many varying styles to the duffel coat, although the original British style would be composed of the following features:\n* Made of genuine double weave Duffel, lined with a woolly tartan pattern, or self-coloured on the wartime version.\n* A buttonable neck strap.\n* Three or later, four front wooden or horn toggle-fastenings with rope or leather loops to attach them to, thus also known as a \"toggle coat,\" especially in the United States.\n* Two large outside patch pockets, with covering flaps on post-war versions.\n* Originally knee length, shorter on later versions.\n* Bucket hood with press stud adjustment. Later versions feature a neater \"pancake\" hood.\n\nThe wooden toggle-fastenings were made to be easily fastened and unfastened while wearing gloves in cold weather at sea. Current designs often have toggles made of buffalo horn, or plastic. The oversized hood offered enough room to wear over a Naval cap.\n\nAfter rain, a duffle coat has a characteristic smoky smell.\n\nHistory\n\nThe initial influence of what became the duffle coat, may have been the hooded Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. It had the unusual features of a toggle closure and an integrated hood,  and by 1850 had spread through Europe.[http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/duffle-coat-guide-history-details/ \"Duffle coat history\"] Gentleman's Gazette In the 1850s, outerwear manufacturer John Partrige developed the first version of the duffle coat.[http://angelasancartier.net/duffle-coat \"Duffle coat\"], Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion\n\nIn the 1890s the British Admiralty chose a number of manufacturers to produce duffle coats for the British Royal Navy,  where it was referred to as the \"convoy coat\"  The navy issued a camel-coloured variant of it as an item of warm clothing during World War I,\n\nThe design of the coat was modified slightly and widely issued during World War II. Field Marshal Montgomery was a famous wearer of the coat,  as a means of identifying himself with his troops, leading to another nickname, \"Monty coat\".\n\nLarge stocks of post-war military surplus coats available at reasonable prices to the general public meant that these coats became a ubiquitous and popular item of clothing in the 1950s and 1960s especially among students. The British firm Gloverall purchased surplus military supply of coats after World War II, and in 1954 started producing their own version of the Duffle coat using leather fastenings and Buffalo horn toggles with a double-faced check back fabric, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features. \n\nModern times\n\nIn modern times, the type of fabric used to make duffel coats is known as Melton cloth, as opposed to modern duffel cloth which is a softer wool fabric with a distinct nap, used for high-end coats and parkas.\n\nNoted wearers\n\nIn the 1949 movie The Third Man, a main character, British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), wears a duffle coat in nearly all of his scenes.\n\nFor many years they were seen in the popular press as a form of uniform for stereotyped supporters of the left wing, as characterised by Labour leader Michael Foot. Other famous duffle coat wearers include members of Scottish band Belle and Sebastian, American businessman David Woodard, English actor Dudley Moore, television character Jonathan Creek, children's book and television character Paddington Bear, Ed Helms as Andy Bernard in the American version of the popular British television comedy show The Office, and all members of the English rock music group Oasis on the cover of their 1995 hit single \"Roll with it\".\nQuestion:\nDuffel coats were named after a town in which country?\nAnswer:\nBelguim\nPassage:\nSpanish Civil War (1936-1939) - History of Spain | don Quijote\nSpanish Civil War (1936-1939) - History of Spain | don Quijote\nRead the Spanish version\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) broke out when the Spanish army in Morocco when a few of the most influent generals of the Spanish Army, led by General Francisco Franco, rose up against the democratically elected Republican government , presided over by Manuel Azaña. Allegiances were not always clear-cut during this conflict. Essentially, the ranks of the Left (also known as Loyalist and Republican) comprised workers, peasants and trade unions, but also the Spanish government, Socialists, Communists and Anarchists. The Right (also known as Nationalist), was supported by rebellious factions of the army, industry, landowners, the middle classes and the Catholic Church. For various and somewhat contradictory reasons, the Loyalists received the support of the Soviet Union and European democracies, while the Nationalists were armed and equipped by the Fascist governments of Germany and Italy.\nThe Spanish Civil War would prove to be both fierce and bloody. Although the resources of the two sides were not that unequal, the Nationalists were better organized and received extensive material aid from Germany. The Loyalists received very little assistance from the Soviet Union and, moreover, were divided by internal conflicts between Communist, Socialist and Anarchist factions.\nWhile European and North American volunteers fought for the Republic in the framework of the International Brigades, and a number of foreign artists and intellectuals supported the Loyalist cause, including Ernest Hemingway (who was working as a reporter and photographer) and George Orwell (who fought on the Republican side only to be prosecuted later on and thus becoming profoundly disillusioned by the rivalry in the ranks of the Left), the Nationalists were finally triumphant.\nGeneral Franco's victory marked the beginning of a forty-year dictatorship in Spain (1939-1975). In the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Hitler sought Franco's support for his own military campaign, but Spain was in no position to provide either financial or human aid. Although the Spanish Civil War had been a training field for the battles to be waged in the Second World War, Spain would play no part in the latter but agred to sponsor a small army of volunteers known as La División Azul.\nUnder the Franco regime Spain suffered international isolation, although in varying degrees. In 1955 the country was accepted as a member of the United Nations, and in 1970 General Franco named prince Juan Carlos his successor as the future king of Spain, thereby re-establishing the monarchy. Upon the dictator's death in 1975 King Juan Carlos I was crowned and the country set out on the long journey back to full democracy in Spain .\nQuestion:\nWho led Spain from 1939 to 1975?\nAnswer:\nGeneralísimo Francisco Franco\nPassage:\nJimmy Anderson become fourth English bowler to take 300 ...\nJimmy Anderson become fourth English bowler to take 300 Test wickets | Daily Mail Online\ncomments\nJimmy Anderson today became only the fourth Englishman and the first since Sir Ian Botham 29 years ago to take 300 Test wickets.\nAnderson, in his 81st Test and back at the scene of his debut at Lord’s, snaffled the first two wickets of the New Zealand innings to reach a landmark that only Botham, Fred Trueman and Bob Willis among Englishmen have reached.\nIt is a fabulous achievement for the Lancastrian, who has developed into the best swing bowler in the world and, at 30, should have enough time to go on to surpass Sir Ian’s record of English record of 383. Indeed, Botham said on Sky TV immediately after Anderson’s landmark wicket that he expects him to become the first Englishman to reach 400.\n \nWelcome: Anderson (with his back to camera) is greeted by England's surviving members of the 300 club, Sir Ian Botham and Bob Willis\nJust done it: James Anderson (right) celebrates after reaching 300 Test wickets, becoming the fourth Englishman to do it, after dismissing Peter Fulton\nHaving a ball: Anderson salutes the crowd after reaching 300 Test wickets\nMob rule: England players converge on Anderson after he broke his record\nCongratulations: The England slip cordon, led by Graeme Swann, engulf Anderson\nOn the board: The scoreboard shows Anderson's feat\nSalute: Anderson raises his arm in acknowledgement of his 300th Test wicket\nTWITTER TRIBUTES\nSir Ian Botham: 'Well done Jimmy.... 300 club and many more to come..!!!!!'\nKevin Pietersen: 'Ooh Jimmy Jimmy, Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Anderson.. #300  #boom @JimmyAnderson9'.\nMark Ramprakash: 'Congrats to Jimmy Anderson on 300 Test wickets!!! :-)'\nAnderson was thrown into international  cricket almost straight from club cricket with Burnley but had his  problems in the early years of his career which included 12 months out  of the game with a serious back injury.\nYet once he and Stuart Broad were  preferred to Ashes heroes Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard for the  second Test of England’s New Zealand tour of 2008 there has been no  looking back for Anderson, who has become indisputably the leader of the  England attack.\nHis early strikes here in the first  Test at Lord’s today were sorely needed after England had been bowled  out for 232, the last six wickets falling for 40 as New Zealand swung  the Duke ball in helpful overcast conditions.\nAnderson dismissed Hamish Rutherford  with a beauty, well caught at slip by Alastair Cook, and then saw his  great friend Graeme Swann snaffle another catch to see the back of Peter  Fulton. Anderson raised the ball to the Lord’s crowd who acclaimed the  accolade with a long ovation.\nAnd the seamer took New Zealand's third wicket of Ross Taylor.\nBringing New Zealand to their knees: Anderson celebrates Taylor's wicket and (right) a breakdown of his 300\nJoining the elite: James Anderson celebrates the wicket of Hamish Rutherford to move on to 299 - before getting Peter Fulton and reaching 300\nJimmy's first Test wicket\nFirst blood: Anderson (centre) celebrates after taking the wicket of Zimbabwe's Mark Vermeulen in 2003, his first scalp in Test cricket\nAnd the trio who were already part of the 300 club\nMilestones: Fred Trueman is congratulated on taking his 300th Test wicket in 1964\nDeadly duo: Bob Willis and Ian Botham both reached the 300 wicket landmark in the 1980s\nFIVE OF THE BEST FROM AWESOME ANDERSON\nMAY 2003, v Zimbabwe, Lord's - Having made his name with some superb displays in the one-day side, Anderson found himself thrust into the Test arena at the age of just 20.\nAlthough the opposition were an unfancied Zimbabwe side, Anderson's performance did little to counteract the growing hype. He took five for 73 in the first innings to put his name on the ground's famous honours board, clean bowling four of his victims.\nMARCH 2008, v New Zealand, Wellington - Despite his superb start to his Test career, Anderson's stock fell off dramatically due to issues of form and fitness and he was in and out of the side as he worked on a remodelled action.\nHis breakthrough moment came on tour in New Zealand when England surprisingly dropped Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison. Anderson relished being given the new ball and took five for 73 followed by two for 57 in a heavy win, once more cementing his place in the attack.\nJUNE 2008, v New Zealand, Trent Bridge - Having enjoyed a successful return to the side in Wellington, Anderson underlined his increasing influence when the Black Caps visited England later that summer.\nIn the third Test of the series he ripped through the tourists at a Trent Bridge ground that provided the perfect setting for his brand of swing bowling. He claimed career-best figures of seven for 43 in the first innings - the first seven batsmen in the order, no less - before adding two more in the second.\nJULY 2010, v Pakistan, Trent Bridge - Another trip to Nottingham and another devastating display of movement through the air from Anderson.\nHaving watched another master of the craft, Mohammad Asif take five wickets, Anderson matched him with five for 54 in the first dig and followed with incredible figures of six for 17 in 15 overs to bundle Pakistan out for just 80 and seal the win. Remarkably, this remains Anderson's only 10-wicket match.\nJANUARY 2011, v Australia, Sydney - Much of the talk prior to the 2010/11 Ashes had focused on how Anderson would fare Down Under - where the combination of the Kookaburra ball, different conditions and a forgettable personal record were thought to make Anderson vulnerable.\nInstead he showed mighty control throughout the series success, chipping in with important wickets and signing off with match figures of seven for 127 in the fifth Test. His efforts helped deliver a third innings success of the series.\n(from PA Sport)\nQuestion:\nIn 1964, which English cricketer became the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets?\nAnswer:\nFiery Fred\nPassage:\nNursery Rhymes with StoryTime on the App Store\nNursery Rhymes with StoryTime on the App Store\nI used to like it\n     \nby                    JudiPP\nI bought this ages ago.

I found it both compelling and entertaining, a perfect introduction to a topic that nowadays is rarely heard about (sometimes, it seems, for good reason!).\nPaxman is a perfect choice for our host: he's enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and he has a way of asking his interviewees cutting questions that get to the heart of the matter. Another reviewer describes his presence as 'celebrity casting' but misses the point: Paxman not only presented but wrote this series, a real labour of love for him.\nThe documentary features mucho globe-trotting, with plenty of beautifully-shot locations around the world. The topics covered explore all of the main aspects of Empire: warfare, suppression, family life, exploration. Paxman treats his subject in a balanced way; there's no sneering at all, instead he looks at the topic from every viewpoint. I'm as patriotic as the next Brit, and I found EMPIRE a thoroughly splendid show.\n5 of 9 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the book and presented the recent t.v. series 'Empire'?\nAnswer:\nJEREMY PAXMAN\nPassage:\nGreat Yorkshire Show\nThe Great Yorkshire Show (GYS) is an agricultural show which takes place on the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate, North Yorkshire in the North of England annually from the second Tuesday of July until the following Thursday. It is organised and run by the Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS). Since the demise of the Royal Show the GYS has been the largest agricultural show in England, however within the UK it is surpassed by both the Royal Welsh Show and the Royal Highland Show.\n\nHistory \n\nThe history of the GYS is intimately connected with that of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS). At its foundation in 1837, the primary aim of the YAS was stated as \"... to hold an Annual Meeting for the Exhibition of Farming Stock, Implements &c., and for the General Promotion of Agriculture.\" \n\nThe first YAS Show was held in 1838 in the Barrack Yard at Fulford, near York. Though the numbers attending were not recorded the event was counted a success; police had to use their batons to restore order among the large numbers of visitors when they began to force their way in without paying. \n\nOriginally intended as a peripatetic event, the Show moved to Leeds, Northallerton and Hull in subsequent years, before returning to York in 1842. This is the first year for which attendance figures are available — the Show in 1842 had a paid attendance of 6,044.  By 1843 the YAS Show had become known as the \"Great Yorkshire Show\", apparently by popular acclamation rather than in any official sense. \n\nThe GYS continued to be held in various places around Yorkshire until 1950.\n* 1915-1919: Cancelled due to the First World War.\n* 1920: The GYS was held jointly with the Royal Agricultural Society of England in Darlington.\n* 1940-1948: Cancelled due to the Second World War.\n* 1948: By now the YAS was coming to the conclusion that the expenses involved in setting up a new showground every year were becoming prohibitive. \n* 1949: It was decided that a permanent showground be acquired.\n* 1950: The last peripatetic show, in Malton. The YAS bought a site at Hook Oval in Harrogate for £16,500.\n* 1951: From here on, Hook Oval in Harrogate has been the permanent site for the GYS. The 1951 the attendance figure was nearly 54,000.\n* 2001: Cancelled due to the outbreak of Foot and mouth disease in Britain.\n* 2006: The most successful show so far in terms of attendance figures, with 135,111 visitors.\n* 2008: The show was attended by the Queen to celebrate the 150th occasion on which the Show had been held. \n* 2011: The show came close to the record with 135,086 visitors. \n*2012: This show (the 154th) was cancelled on Tuesday 10 July 2012 after only one day due to exceptional rain which had made the showground car parks unsafe. Organisers stated that the decision had been taken \"reluctantly\".  This was the first cancellation due to weather. (Earlier cancellations had been due to war or foot and mouth disease.)  An old bulldozer (probably there in the \"old equipment\" display) towed horse boxes out of muddy ground.\n\nThe Showground \n\nThe Great Yorkshire Showground is situated off Railway Road, on the outskirts of Harrogate. The site is 250 acre in area, and consists mainly of grassland with several permanent structures. These include\n\n* Main grandstand and show-ring\n* Country Pursuits arena (featuring Hounds and Birds of Prey)\n* Flower Show\n* \"White Rose\" grandstand and show-ring\n* Housing for cattle, sheep, pigs and other livestock\n* Multi-purpose conference and exhibition halls (known as the \"Yorkshire Event Centre\"  )\n* Dining and function facilities (known as \"Pavilions of Harrogate\"   and \"Fodder\"  )\n* Office accommodation for the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, which has its headquarters at the showground\n\nThe showground facilities are used all the year round for various functions and events ranging from the Great Yorkshire Show itself to antiques fairs, trade shows, business conferences and wedding receptions. It is estimated that some 1 million people visit the showground per year.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nThe Great Yorkshire Show has been held where since 1952?\nAnswer:\nHARROGATE\nPassage:\nWhat a Year\nWhat a Year was an Australian television documentary series, hosted by former ACA host Mike Munro and supermodel Megan Gale in 2006 and Bert Newton and Julia Zemiro in 2007. What a Year looked at the news, events, sporting achievements, entertainment and fads of a selected year in each episode. The hosts spoke to people who witnessed and experienced the particular events first-hand.\n\nHistory\n\nMike Munro and Megan Gale presented the 2006 series. They successfully hosted nine episodes and it attracted a lot of viewers. In 2007, Gale and Munro's show contracts expired, so Newton and Zemiro replaced them as presenters. However, it was cancelled by the Nine Network after coming last place in the nightly ratings on 6 August 2007 due to the big win for Channel Seven..\n\nIn a November issue of a TV Week magazine in 2007, Munro claimed he and Gale left the show because the programmers wanted to lighten up the show and make it more fun. Munro explained that he disliked wearing fashionable clothes for that era. But Newton loved wearing them, so he was hired instead of Munro.\n\nThe episodes that remained unaired after the show's axing were broadcast by Channel Nine over the summer non-ratings period, beginning the unaired episodes on 27 December 2007. The new episodes replaced plans to screen repeats of Australian travel series, Things To Try Before You Die.\n\nDuring March 2011, the Nine Network replayed the 1980 and 1999 themed episodes, on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm on their HD digital multi channel GEM after being abruptly cancelled and replaced with filler shows.\n\nAfter \"What A Year\"\n\n# Gale continued her modelling career and has also done some acting.\n# Munro hosted Missing Persons Unit from 2006 to 2008 and is now working on Sunday Night for Channel Seven.\n# Newton hosted 20 to 1 from 2006 to 2011.\n# Zemiro went to host Rockwiz on SBS.\n\nList of episodes\n\n2006\n\n# What a Year - 1975 - 2 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1983 - 9 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1997 - 16 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1969 - 23 October 2006\n# What a Year - 1986 - 30 October 2006\n# What a Year - 2001 - 6 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1991 - 13 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1977 - 20 November 2006\n# What a Year - 1989 - 27 November 2006\n\n2007\n\n# What a Year - 1980 - 30 July 2007\n# What a Year - 1999 - 6 August 2007\nQuestion:\nWhat year saw the abolition of the death penalty for murder in Britain?\nAnswer:\none thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine\nPassage:\nRobbie Williams (footballer, born 1984)\nRobert Ian \"Robbie\" Williams (born 2 October 1984) is an English footballer who plays as a left back for Limerick. Born in Pontefract, he has made 225 Football League appearances for Barnsley, Blackpool, Huddersfield Town, Stockport County, Rochdale and Plymouth Argyle.\n\nCareer\n\nBarnsley\n\nWilliams came through the youth ranks with Barnsley, playing over fifty first-team games. He made his debut on 5 October 2002, against Brentford. On 22 March 2007, Williams joined Blackpool on loan until the end of the season.  He scored on his debut for the Seasiders, in a 3–1 win at Bradford City two days later.  Williams scored the first goal in the 2007 Football League One play-off Final against Yeovil Town at Wembley Stadium.  The goal was part of a 2–0 win for Blackpool and saw them promoted to the Championship.\n\nHuddersfield Town\n\nHe was set to join Huddersfield Town in July 2007 before sustaining a hairline fracture to his shin.  The transfer was completed the following month, with Williams signing a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.  He made his debut for the club in December at Leeds United, and scored his first goal against Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2008. He made 28 appearances during his first season with Huddersfield,  and 39 in the 2008–09 campaign. The following season, he played in both legs of the League One play-off semi-final defeat to Millwall. Williams was released in the summer of 2010 when his contract expired and spent time on trial at Aberdeen. \n\nStockport County\n\nWilliams joined Stockport County in August 2010 on non-contract terms.   He signed a full-time contract at the end of the month,  and scored his first goal for the club against Barnet in October.  Williams made 25 appearances for Stockport before leaving for Rochdale in January 2011. \n\nRochdale\n\nHaving joined Rochdale on a free transfer, Williams made his debut in March against Notts County. He was released at the end of the season after the club decided against offering him a new contract.  He made nine appearances for Rochdale.\n\nPlymouth Argyle\n\nWilliams signed a one-year contract with Plymouth Argyle in July 2011.   He made his debut in a 1–1 draw at Shrewsbury Town in August,  and scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win against Macclesfield Town in September.  In his first season, Williams made 30 appearance in league and cup competition, scoring two goals.  Williams signed a new one-year contract in June 2012,   and began the new season with three goals in his first five appearances, against Oxford United, Burnley and Port Vale. A stomach injury he sustained in October kept him out of the team for two months.  Williams left the club in January 2013 when his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.  In his two seasons with the club, Williams played in 42 league games, made four appearances in cup competitions and scored five goals. \n\nLimerick\n\nIn February 2013, Williams joined League of Ireland Premier Division club Limerick.   \"We are delighted to get a player of Robbie's talent and experience on board,\" said manager Stuart Taylor. Ahead of the new season, Williams said that \"I'm not really familiar with the standard but the way people are talking it's looking positive.\" \n\nWilliams is currently entering his 4th season with Limerick, and has made more appearances for the Shannonsiders than for any other club.\n\nHonours\n\n;Barnsley\n*Football League One play-offs winner: 2005–06\n\n;Blackpool\n*Football League One play-offs winner: 2006–07\nQuestion:\nWhich football club does Robbie Williams make much of supporting?\nAnswer:\nPort Vale F.C\nPassage:\nButtonhole\nButtonholes are holes in fabric which allow buttons to pass through, securing one piece of the fabric to another. The raw edges of a buttonhole are usually finished with stitching. This may be done either by hand or by a sewing machine.  Some forms of button, such as a frog, use a loop of cloth or rope instead of a buttonhole.  Buttonholes can also refer to flowers worn in the lapel buttonhole of a coat or jacket, which are referred to simply as \"buttonholes\" or boutonnières.\n\nHistory \n\nButtonholes for fastening or closing clothing with buttons appeared first in Germany in the 13th century.  However it is believed that ancient Persians used it first.  They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting garments in 13th- and 14th-century Europe.\n\nAspects of buttonholes\n\nButtonholes often have a bar of stitches at either side of them. This is a row of perpendicular hand or machine stitching to reinforce the raw edges of the fabric, and to prevent it from fraying.\n\nTraditionally, men's clothing buttonholes are on the left side, and women's clothing buttonholes are on the right.  The lore of this 'opposite' sides buttoning is that the practice came into being as 'women of means' had chamber maids who dressed them.  So as not to confuse the poor chamber maids, the wealthy began having women's garments made with the buttons and holes 'switched'; the birth of the modern ladies' blouse.  It is interesting to note that the chamber maids themselves, as did most all the common class, both male and female, actually wore 'shirts' with buttons and holes placed as on men's clothing.  There appears to be no concrete reference to prove or disprove this story, but its plausibility bears noting.\n\nThere is also the theory that if a man is driving his ox cart or carriage or car, he can see inside her blouse and she can see inside of his. (Of course this assumes the driver is on the left hand side.)\n\nTypes of buttonholes\n\nHand stitching\n\n*A plain buttonhole, by far the most common type. In plain buttonholes, the raw (cut) edges of the textile are finished with thread in very closely spaced stitches (if made by hand, often the buttonhole stitch) with a gimp cord at the edges to act as a reinforcement. When stitched by hand, a slit is made in the fabric first and the result is called a worked buttonhole.\n\nMachined stitching\n\nSewing machines offer various levels of automation to creating plain buttonholes.  When made by machine, the slit between the sides of the buttonhole is opened after the stitching is completed.\n\n*A machine-made buttonhole is usually sewn with two parallel rows of machine sewing in a narrow zig-zag stitch, with the ends finished in a broader zig-zag stitch. (One of the first automatic buttonhole machines was invented by Henry Alonzo House in 1862.)\n*A bound buttonhole is one which has its raw edges encased by pieces of fabric or trim instead of stitches.\n*A keyhole buttonhole is a special case of a thread-finished buttonhole that is normally machine-made due to the difficulty of achieving it by hand working. It is characterized by a round hole at the end of the slit.  Because a button-closed gap in a garment is normally under some stress, the button will tend to move towards the end of the buttonhole closest to the gap in the garment.  A keyhole at the end of the buttonhole closest to the gap will accommodate the button's shank without distorting the fabric.\n\nKeyhole buttonholes are most often found on tailored coats and jackets.\nQuestion:\nBlanket, cross, and buttonhole are all types of what?\nAnswer:\nStitches (band)\nPassage:\nHP-35\nThe HP-35 was Hewlett-Packard's first pocket calculator and the world's first scientific pocket calculator  – a calculator with trigonometric and exponential functions. \n\nHistory\n\nIn about 1970 HP co-founder Bill Hewlett challenged his co-workers to create a \"shirt-pocket sized HP-9100\". At the time, slide rules were the only practical portable devices for performing trigonometric and exponential functions, as existing pocket calculators could only perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Introduced at US$395,  like the HP-9100 it used RPN. The \"35\" in the calculator's name came from the number of keys. \n\nThe original HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975 but in 2007 HP announced the release of the \"retro\"-look HP 35s in commemoration of the original HP-35.  \n\nThe HP-35 was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009. \n\nDescription\n\nThe calculator used a traditional floating decimal display for numbers that could be displayed in that format, but automatically switched to scientific notation for other numbers. The fifteen-digit LED display was capable of displaying a ten-digit mantissa plus its sign and a decimal point and a two-digit exponent plus its sign. The display used a unique form of multiplexing, illuminating a single LED segment at a time rather than a single LED digit, because HP research had shown that this method was perceived by the human eye as brighter for equivalent power.  Light emitting diodes were relatively new at the time and were much dimmer than high efficiency diodes developed in subsequent decades.\n\nThe calculator used three \"AA\"-sized NiCd batteries assembled into a removable proprietary battery pack.  Replacement battery packs are no longer available, leaving existing HP-35 calculators to rely on AC power, or their users to rebuild the battery packs themselves using available cells. An external battery charger was available and the calculator could also run from the charger, with or without batteries installed.\n\nInternally, the calculator was organized around a serial (one-bit) processor chipset made under contract by Mostek, processing 56-bit floating-point numbers, representing 14-digit BCD numbers.\n\nDescendants\n\nThe HP-35 was the start of a family of related calculators with similar mechanical packaging:\n* The HP-45 added many more features, including the ability to control the output format (rather than the purely automatic format of the HP-35). It also contained an undocumented timer feature.  The timer worked, but was not accurate enough to use as a stopwatch due to lack of a crystal oscillator.\n* The HP-65 added programmability, with program storage on magnetic cards.\n* The HP-55, a less expensive follow-on to the HP-65, provided storage for smaller programs, but didn't provide any external storage. The timer that was already present on the HP-45 was now crystal-controlled to achieve the needed accuracy and explicitly documented.\n* The HP-67 expanded on the programmability of the HP-65, and added fully merged keycodes\n* The HP-80 and cheaper HP-70 provided financial, rather than scientific functions, such as future value and net present value.\n\nFollow-on calculators used varying mechanical packaging but most were operationally similar. The HP-25 was a smaller, cheaper model of a programmable scientific calculator without magnetic card reader, with features much like the HP-65. The HP-41C was a major advance in programmability and capacity, and offered CMOS memory so that programs were not lost when the calculator was switched off. It was the first calculator to offer alphanumeric capabilities for both the display and the keyboard. Four external ports below the display area allowed memory expansion (RAM modules), loading of additional programs (ROM modules) and interfacing a wide variety of peripherals including HP-IL (\"HP Interface Loop\"), a scaled-down version of the HPIB/GPIB/IEEE-488 instrument bus. The later HP-28C and HP-28S added much more memory and a substantially different, more powerful programming metaphor.\n\nCalculator trivia \n\n* The HP-35 was  long and  wide, said to have been designed to fit into one of William Hewlett's shirt pockets.\n* Is the first scientific calculator to fly in space in 1972 \n* Is the first pocket calculator with a numeric range that covered 200 decades (more precise 199, 10+/-99)\n* The LED display power requirement was responsible for the HP-35's short battery life between charges — about three hours.  To extend operating time and avoid wearing out the on/off slide switch, users would press the decimal point key to force the display to illuminate just a single LED junction.\n* The HP-35 calculated arithmetic, logarithmic, and trigonomic functions but the complete implementation used only 767 carefully chosen instructions (7670 bits).\n* Introduction of the HP-35 and similar scientific calculators by Texas Instruments soon thereafter signaled the demise of the slide rule as a status symbol among science and engineering students.  Slide rule holsters rapidly gave way to \"electronic slide rule\" holsters, and colleges began to drop slide-rule classes from their curricula.\n* 100,000 HP-35 calculators were sold in the first year, and over 300,000 by the time it was discontinued in 1975—3½ years after its introduction. \n* In 2007 HP introduced a revised HP 35s calculator in memory of the original.\n* An emulation of the HP-35 is available for the Apple iPhone and iPad.\nQuestion:\nThe HP-35, launched in 1972, was Hewlett-Packard’s first what?\nAnswer:\nMath calculators\nPassage:\nIndonesia Map - Maps of World\nIndonesia Map, Map of Indonesia\nRivers in Indonesia\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been inhabited up to 1.5 million years ago by Homo erectus, and 45,000 years ago by Homo sapiens. Modern Indonesians arrived in the region from Taiwan in about 2000 BC, replacing the Melaneasians.\nWith the strategic location of the Indonesian islands, they became important in the international trade with India. This trade brought cultural exchanges as well, namely the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism expanded to Indonesia in the 4th century.\nThe archipelago was ruled by the Srivijaya kingdom beginning around the 7th century, which grew as a trade power with Buddhist and Hindu communities. Over the 13th century, the Hindu kingdom of Majapahit stretched across the islands.\nThe Muslims arrived in the 13th century, and the islands had mostly adopted the religion by the 16th century. Europeans arrived, with the Portuguese, in 1512, in search of the spices of Indonesia. The Dutch East India Company became a major power in the region from about 1602 to 1800. The Dutch colonized parts of Indonesia, expanding to cover modern-day boundaries, which it held until World War II when the Japanese occupied the country. When Japan surrendered in 1945, Indonesia declared independence, though the Dutch attempted to regain control.\nAfter achieving independence, Indonesia became ruled by a Communist party, but democratic processes were later strengthened and Indonesia held its first elections in 2004.\nNeighboring Countries : \nThough it is an island nation, Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia, and is close to Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, and Palau.\nMajor Cities : \nJayapura\nGeography : \nIndonesia is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia and Oceania, straddling the equator. Indonesia is made up of 17,508 islands and islets. Of the 6,000 inhabited islands, the largest include Java, Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, and Sulawesi. The island of Borneo is also shared with neighboring nations, Brunei and Malaysia, while New Guinea is also home to the country of Papua New Guinea. The island of Timor was once completely included within Indonesia's territory, but East Timor seceded from the country.\nIndonesia has a equatorial tropical climate, and 150 active volcanoes, including Krakatoa, Tambora, and Toba. As a region with volcanic activity, Indonesia has mountain ranges, with its highest peak on Papua, with Puncak Jaya, standing 4,884 meters (16,024 feet) above sea level. Major rivers in Indonesia include the Mahakam and Barito rivers, and the country's largest lake is Lake Toba in Sumatra.\nPoints of Interest : \nIndonesia is known for its culture, influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism, Islam, Chinese, and Dutch cultures, reflecting its varied historical influences. The markets of Indonesia are a great place to explore Indonesian culture, with handicrafts and local foods.\nThe capital, Jakarta, is a bustling and crowded city with architectural wonders like its old town, the national monument, Monas, government buildings like the Presidential Palace, and several major theme parks, including the country's largest, Jungleland Sentul City. Jakarta has cultural sites like museums, mosques, churches, and open air markets.\nNatural sites in Indonesia include the second largest tropical forests in the world, including those on Sumatra, Borneo and Papua. The rainforests on Borneo are 130 million years old, and are some of the oldest in the world. The beaches of Bali are the most popular destination in Indonesia, with water recreation like surfing, and historical and architectural sites.\nTransportation : \nIndonesia has three major airports: Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta, Ngurah Rai, and East Java's Juanda. These international airports offer service to major cities all around the world. Domestic flights are the best way to get around Indonesia, as they are fast and inexpensive, getting across the islands quickly for under $100.\nAs an island nation, boat is an important way of getting around, and can be used to travel from Singapore or Malaysia. Ferries are also available for island hopping. Cars can be used to get around and between some of the islands as well, and can be used to travel to East Timor, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.\nTo get around cities, a few options are the Becak, or pedicab, and ojek, which are motorcycle taxis. Buses and taxis are available in many cities in Indonesia.\nACOD~20131120\nQuestion:\nWhat is the largest and most populous country in the world situated only on islands?\nAnswer:\nUnitary state of republic of indonesia\n", "answers": ["Ontario (canada)", "Ontario", "Ontario Canada", "ON, Canada", "Canada Ontario", "Ontairo", "Ontarian", "Climate of Ontario", "Ontario, Canada", "Province of Ontario", "CA-ON", "Ontario (Canada)"], "length": 7505, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "20a3700899015182a533e684e40a3220bb3f00dc86cf72cb"}

In Wales, laver is used for making laverbread, a traditional Welsh dish. Laver as food is also commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland along the Irish Sea, where it is also known as slake. \nIt is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli, often clinging to rocks. The principal variety is purple laver (Porphyra umbilicalis).  Purple laver is classified as a red alga, tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared.  It is unusual amongst seaweeds because the fronds are only one cell thick.    Laver has a high content of dietary minerals, particularly iodine and iron. The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters. \n\nPorphyra is also consumed in East Asia, where it is known as zicai (紫菜) in China,  in Japan, and gim (김) in Korea.\n\nUlva lactuca, a green alga, also known as sea lettuce, is occasionally eaten as green laver, which is regarded as inferior to the purple laver. \n\nCultivation\n\nLaver cultivation as food is thought to be very ancient, though the first mention was in Camden's Britannia in the early 17th century.  It is plucked from the rocks and given a preliminary rinse in clear water. The collected laver is repeatedly washed to remove sand and boiled for hours until it becomes a stiff, green mush.  In this state, the laver can be preserved for about a week. Typically during the 18th century, the mush was packed into a crock and sold as \"potted laver\".\n\nCultivation of laver is typically associated with Wales, and it is still gathered off the Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire coasts,  although similar farming methods are used at the west coast of Scotland.\n\nLaver can be eaten cold as a salad with lamb or mutton. A simple preparation is to heat the laver and to add butter and the juice of a lemon or Seville orange. Laver can be heated and served with boiled bacon. It is used to make the Welsh dish known as laverbread.\n\nLaverbread\n\nLaverbread ( or ') is a traditional Welsh delicacy made from laver. To make laverbread, the seaweed is boiled for several hours, then minced or pureed. The gelatinous paste that results can then be sold as it is, or rolled in oatmeal; it is generally coated with oatmeal prior to frying.\n\nLaverbread is traditionally eaten fried with bacon and cockles as part of a Welsh breakfast. It can also be used to make a sauce to accompany lamb, crab, monkfish, etc., and to make laver soup (').  Richard Burton has been quoted as describing laverbread as \"Welshman's caviar\". \n\nLaver is often associated with Penclawdd and its cockles, being used traditionally in the Welsh diet and is still eaten widely across Wales in the form of laverbread. In addition to Wales, laverbread is eaten across the Bristol Channel in North Devon, especially around the Exmoor coast around Lynmouth, Combe Martin and Ilfracombe.  In North Devon it is generally not cooked with oatmeal and it is simply referred to as 'Laver' (lay-ver).\n\nLaver is highly nutritious because of its high proportions of protein, iron, and especially iodine. It also contains high  levels of vitamins B2, A, D and C. Dried purple laver contains high amounts of vitamin B12.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main ingredient of Laverbread?\nAnswer:\nMacroalgal\nPassage:\nAlbatross (instrumental)\n\"Albatross\" is a guitar-based instrumental by Fleetwood Mac, released as a single in November 1968, later featuring on the compilation albums The Pious Bird of Good Omen (UK) and English Rose (US). It was a major hit in several countries and became Fleetwood Mac's only Number 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart, spending one week at the top. It was re-released in the UK as a single in 1973, and peaked at Number 2 in the charts. The piece was composed by Peter Green. The single has sold over 900,000 copies in the UK. \n\nComposition\n\nSanto & Johnny's \"Sleep Walk\" (1959) reportedly inspired Peter Green for his 1968 instrumental \"Albatross\",   although the composition also resembles Chuck Berry's 1957 instrumental \"Deep Feeling\", itself derivative of the 1939 recording \"Floyd's Guitar Blues\" by Andy Kirk and his 12 Clouds of Joy, featuring guitarist Floyd Smith. \n\nThe composition and its arrangement suggest a relaxing sea setting, with cymbals imitating the sound of waves (Mick Fleetwood played his drum kit using timpani mallets to give a muted sound) and a dreamy solo from Green's guitar. It contains four chords, E, Emaj7, A, and F#m, played by Green on his Fender Stratocaster into an Orange Matamp OR100.    Green had been working on the piece for some time before the addition to the band of 18-year-old guitarist Danny Kirwan. Slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer was not generally inclined to work with Green, who had felt unable to realise the overall effect that he wanted. With Kirwan's input, Green completed the piece and it was recorded just two months after Kirwan joined, without Spencer present.  Although he was not a part of the recording sessions, Spencer was shown in video material miming to Green's slide guitar parts. Kirwan's instrumental \"Jigsaw Puzzle Blues\" was chosen for the B-side in most territories. \"Albatross\" has been re-released many times as a single in various countries, with many different B-sides.\n\nThis composition is one of only a few tracks by the original line-up of Fleetwood Mac that is included on their later \"greatest hits\" and \"best of\" compilations. Many of their compilations only focus on hits from the 1970s and 1980s. However, other compositions from that period have gone on to become classic recordings in the hands of other performers – \"Black Magic Woman\" as recorded by Santana for example.  Another example, \"Oh Well\" has gone on to become a rock standard. \"Albatross\" is the only Fleetwood Mac composition with the distinction of having inspired a Beatles song, \"Sun King\" from 1969's Abbey Road. \n\nOne of the earliest uses of the tune was on the soundtrack for the Rainer Werner Fassbinder sci-fi virtual reality film Welt am Draht (usually translated as World on a Wire). It was featured (along with \"Jigsaw Puzzle Blues\") in 1979's Rock 'n' Roll High School. It was also used by the BBC as the theme music to a long running travel programme in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nThe piece was used as the background music to Marks & Spencer's 2005 advertising campaign. In March of that year, Q magazine placed it at number 37 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nApart from being used in Welt am Draht (World on a Wire), the track can also be heard in the film Man on Wire about Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center.\n\nThe distinctive slide guitar motif is a recurring theme on The KLF's 1990 album Chill Out.\n\nThe tune was covered by a German ambient musical project B-Tribe on their album Suave Suave in 1995.\n\nSide notes\n\nFleetwood Mac became associated with this piece in the British public consciousness despite having numerous other well-received singles. In other territories, however, the greater iconic body of Fleetwood Mac hits came after the departure of Peter Green in 1970 and other line-up changes took place (including the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham in 1975).  This is particularly true of North America, where \"Albatross\" was a minor hit.\n\nWhile the tune influenced an entire generation of guitarists, \"Albatross\" was a clear influence on Pink Floyd's David Gilmour's playing style, from the single-string three note bends, the rhythmic pulsing bass and harmony guitars, to its spacey ambience. On numerous occasions Gilmour has acknowledged the influence of Green on his style, and performed \"Albatross\" on Jools Holland's BBC Radio 2 show on 10 November 2008.\n\nChart positions\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Peter Green – guitar\n*Danny Kirwan – guitar\n*John McVie – bass guitar\n*Mick Fleetwood – drums\nQuestion:\nAlbatross was Fleetwood Mac's only No. 1 single hit.

A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.\n\nMountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys. Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology. They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes, for example thrust sheets, uplifted blocks, fold mountains, and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types.\n\nMajor ranges \n\nMost geologically young mountain ranges on the Earth's land surface are associated with either the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide Belt. The Pacific Ring of Fire includes the Andes of South America, extends through the North American Cordillera along the Pacific Coast, the Aleutian Range, on through Kamchatka, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, to New Zealand.  The Andes is 7000 km long and is often considered the world's longest mountain system. \n\nThe Alpide belt includes Indonesia and southeast Asia, through the Himalaya, and ends in the Alps, Spain and Atlas Mountains.  The belt also includes other European and Asian mountain ranges. The Himalayas contain the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, which is 8848 m high and traverses the border between China and Nepal. \n\nMountain ranges outside of these two systems include the Arctic Cordillera, the Urals, the Appalachians, the Scandinavian Mountains, the Altai Mountains and the Hijaz Mountains. If the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains, then the Ocean Ridges form the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of . \n\nDivisions and categories\n\nThe mountain systems of the earth are characterized by a tree structure, where mountain ranges can contain sub-ranges. The sub-range relationship is often expressed as a parent-child relationship. For example, the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Blue Ridge Mountains are sub-ranges of the Appalachian Mountains. Equivalently, the Appalachians are the parent of the White Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains, and the White Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains are children of the Appalachians.\n\nThe parent-child expression extends to the sub-ranges themselves: the Sandwich Range and the Presidential Range are children of the White Mountains, while the Presidential Range is parent to the Northern Presidential Range and Southern Presidential Range.\n\nClimate\n\nThe position of mountains influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools producing orographic precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (in accordance with the adiabatic lapse rate) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will affect the leeward side of a range.\n\nErosion\n\nMountain ranges are constantly subjected to erosional forces which work to tear them down. Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted and long after until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains. The rugged topography of a mountain range is the product of erosion. The basins adjacent to an eroding mountain range are filled with sediments which are buried and turned into sedimentary rock.\n\nThe early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado provides an example. As the uplift was occurring some 10000 ft of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east.  This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from the core of the range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted isostatically in response to the removed weight.\n\nExtraterrestrial \"Montes\"\n\nMountains on other planets and natural satellites of the Solar System are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts, though there are examples of mountain ranges (or \"Montes\") somewhat similar to those on Earth. Saturn's moon Titan  and Pluto,  in particular exhibit large mountain ranges in chains composed mainly of ices rather than rock. Examples include the Mithrim Montes and Doom Mons on Titan, and Norgay Montes and Hillary Montes on Pluto. Some terrestrial planets other than Earth also exhibit rocky mountain ranges, such as Maxwell Montes on Venus taller than any on Earth  and Tartarus Montes on Mars,  Jupiter's moon Io has mountain ranges formed from tectonic processes including Boösaule Montes, Dorian Montes, Hi'iaka Montes and Euboea Montes.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the longest exposed mountain range in the world?\nAnswer:\nThe

He is widely considered one of the founding members of the Chinese Contemporary art movement, and continues to produce work that reflects the concerns of a highly socially engaged artist through historical references and satire of reality.\n\nLife and work\n\nHuang Rui was born in Beijing in 1952. During the Cultural Revolution, he was sent at the age of 16 to Inner Mongolia where he worked as a farmer. He later returned to Beijing, working in a leather company until 1979.  There, he studied art briefly at Beijing Worker's Cultural Center.\n\nHuang Rui was a founding member of the Chinese avant-garde art group the \"Stars,\" which included artists Wang Keping, Ai Weiwei, Ma Desheng and Li Shuang and was active in from 1979 to 1983.   This groundbreaking group of amateur artists was the first publicly active art collective to protest government censorship after the Cultural Revolution.   The group made headlines in 1979 when, under the direction of Huang Rui and Ma Desheng, they held an exhibition outside the China Arts Gallery (now the National Art Museum of China). On the third day of the exhibit, the police shut it down, stating that these activities \"affect the normal life of the public and the social order.\"  Before this, the majority of their exhibits were held secretly in private homes, where the artists would participate in lively debates about topics ranging from Western art trends to artistic freedom. \n\nIn 1978, Huang Rui co-published the literary journal Today (今天), which was thought to be \"one of the most radical publications in circulation after the Cultural Revolution.\"   The journal, which was in circulation for three years, included both the poetry and prose of such writers as Bei Dao, Gu Cheng, Mang Ke, Shu Ting, and Yang Lian. \n\nEarly on, Huang Rui mostly created paintings that referenced various Western artistic styles such as Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism, Fauvism and Cubism.  However, as his style developed, he became more experimental and began exploring different mediums including photography, printmaking, installation art and performance art.   As a result, his work is not easily classified.\n\nHuang Rui's work is characterized by symmetry and simplicity of form, as well as by the use of primary colors. His work stands alone as aesthetically pleasing; however, he is recognized as a socially minded, and thus often controversial, artist. Throughout his career, he has continued to be vocal about his belief in the importance of free expression—and as a result, he has faced a large amount of censorship from the government. \n\nA major theme of Huang Rui's work is the use of language. He uses texts, often Chinese political slogans, in a playful manner; however, his implications are far from comical. One of his most powerful pieces is \"Charmain Mao 10,000 RMB\" where he uses 10,000 RMB worth of banknotes to spell out the political slogan \"Mao Zhuxi Wan Sui\" which translates to \"10,000 years for Chairman Mao.\"  This work in effect links the politics of Mao with the economic efforts of Deng Xiaoping, and acknowledges the contradiction that lies in the use of Chairman Mao's image on money.  While Mao used his image to push the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping used Mao's image to push his own economic revolution.\n\nHuang Rui also often plays with the relationship between English and Chinese words, most notably in his piece \"Chai-na/China\" where he relates the Chinese characters \"chai\" and \"na\" (which mean \"destroy here\") to images from the demolition that occurred in Beijing in preparation for the Olympics.   This is a theme that Huang Rui has explored in many of his works, including performance pieces. Chinese history is riddled with this idea of \"Chai-na/China,\" as each dynasty would begin with building and creating, only to be destroyed and rebuilt by the next dynasty.\n\nCurator and writer Berenice Angremy notes, \"In Huang Rui's case, text is an environment that shapes our political outlook on a daily basis. His job is to position text to solicit reflection and provide viewers with elements of debate.\" \n\n798 Art Zone\n\nMost recently, Huang Rui has been considered the major vocal advocate of the 798 Art Zone in Beijing. He was instrumental in the establishment of the art district in 2002, and in efforts to protect the area from demolition in 2004 and 2005.  In 2006, 798 became the first state recognized and protected art district in China.  This success was due in a large part to Huang Rui's efforts to promote the district through the Dashanzi International Art Festivals (DIAF) and his book 798 in Beijing.\n\nExhibitions\n\nHuang Rui's work has been widely exhibited, both in China and abroad, over the last three decades. Recent group exhibitions include Reshaping History: 2002-2009 Chinese Contemporary Art at the China National Convention Center in Beijing, and China Avant-Garde at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands. Recent solo exhibitions include Texts are the Legacy of Great Thought! at Chinese Contemporary in New York City, Les Rencontres d'Arles festival in France (2007), Comerchina at 10 Chancery Lane in Hong Kong, Animal Time in Chinese History at the Museo delle Mura in Rome and Huang Rui—The Stars' Time, 1977-1984 at He Xiang Ning Art Museum in Shenzhen, China.\n\nPublications\n\n*1989: 365 Art Days in China and Germany, 2009\n*798 in Beijing, 2004, 2008\n*The Stars' Times, 2007\n*Huang Rui, 2006\nQuestion:\nArtists Ma Desheng, Wang Keping, Huang Rui, Li Shuang, Zhong Acheng, Ai Weiwei and Qu Leilei are associated with which avant-garde art group?\nAnswer:\nStellar diameter\n", "answers": ["James bLUNT", "James blunt", "JAMES BLUNT", "Blunty", "James Blunt", "James Hillier Blount", "Blunt, James"], "length": 4726, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "179d557aab9ff286290d8435b55a322856d73ad12f69d556"}

In the 1990s, the beer was promoted as The Cream of Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester's profile. Boddingtons became one of the city's most famous products after Manchester United and Coronation Street. Whitbread bought Boddingtons Brewery in 1989 and Boddingtons Bitter received an increased marketing budget and nationwide distribution. Boddingtons achieved its peak market share in 1997 and at the time was exported to over forty countries. Boddingtons beer brands are now owned by the global brewer Anheuser–Busch InBev which acquired the Whitbread Beer Company in 2000. Strangeways Brewery closed in 2004 and production of pasteurised (keg and can) Boddingtons was moved to Samlesbury in Lancashire. Production of the cask conditioned beer moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side, Manchester, until it was discontinued in 2012, ending the beer's association with the city.\n(en)\nQuestion:\n\"According to an advertising campaign in the 1990s, what beer was \"\"The cream of Manchester\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nPisiform bone\nThe pisiform bone ( or), also spelled pisiforme (from the Latin pisifomis, pea-shaped), is a small knobbly, pea-shaped bone that is found in the wrist. It forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel.\n\nStructure\n\nThe pisiform bone is a small bone found in the proximal row of the wrist (carpus). It is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. \n\nIt only has one side that acts as a joint, articulating with the triquetral bone. It is on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones and is spheroidal in form.\n\nThe pisiform bone has four surfaces:\n# The dorsal surface is smooth and oval, and articulates with the triquetral: this facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior border of the bone.\n# The palmar surface is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the abductor digiti quinti.\n# The lateral and medial surfaces are also rough, the former being concave, the latter usually convex.\n\nFunction\n\nUnlike the other carpal bones, the pisiform is not involved in movement of the wrist.  \n\nHistory\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin pīsum which means \"pea\".\n\nOther animals\n\nAs compared with apes, which have an elongated Pisiform, humans have a shorter pisiform bone. This is due to the loss of the single growth plate typically found in other mammalian pisiforms. This may be because of evolutionary benefits from having a shorter pisiform bone, including facilitating ulnar deviation of the hand, and preventing hyperextension of the wrist, actions that improve the action of clubbing.\nQuestion:\nPisiform and hamate are bones in which part of the human body?\nAnswer:\nWrist injuries\nPassage:\nPedology (soil study)\nPedology (from Greek: πέδον, pedon, \"soil\"; and λόγος, logos, \"study\") is the study of soils in their natural environment.  It is one of two main branches of soil science, the other being edaphology. Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification, while edaphology studies the way soils influence plants, fungi, and other living things.\n\nOverview\n\nSoil is not only a support for vegetation, but it is also the zone beneath our feet (the pedosphere) of numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals) and its residues,  the mineral material of the original and added rock, and its position in the landscape. During its formation and genesis, the soil profile slowly deepens and develops characteristic layers, called 'horizons', while a steady state balance is approached.\n\nSoil users (such as agronomists) showed initially little concern in the dynamics of soil.  They saw it as medium whose chemical, physical and biological properties were useful for the services of agronomic productivity  \n.  On the other hand, pedologists and geologists did not initially focus on the agronomic applications of the soil characteristics (edaphic properties) but upon its relation to the nature and history of landscapes. Today, there's an integration of the two disciplinary approaches as part of landscape and environmental sciences.\n\nPedologists are now also interested in the practical applications of a good understanding of  pedogenesis processes (the evolution and functioning of soils), like interpreting its environmental history and predicting consequences of changes in land use, while agronomists understand that the cultivated soil is a complex medium, often resulting from several thousands of years of evolution. They understand that the current balance is fragile and that only a thorough knowledge of its history makes it possible to ensure its sustainable use.\n\nConcepts\n\nImportant pedological concepts include:   \n* Complexity in soil genesis is more common than simplicity.\n* Soils lie at the interface of Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soils requires some knowledge of meteorology, climatology, ecology, biology, hydrology, geomorphology, geology and many other earth sciences and natural sciences.\n* Contemporary soils carry imprints of pedogenic processes that were active in the past, although in many cases these imprints are difficult to observe or quantify. Thus, knowledge of paleoecology, palaeogeography, glacial geology and paleoclimatology is important for the recognition and understanding of soil genesis and constitute a basis for predicting future soil changes.\n* Five major, external factors of formation (climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time), and several smaller, less identifiable ones, drive pedogenic processes and create soil patterns.\n* Characteristics of soils and soil landscapes, e.g., the number, sizes, shapes and arrangements of soil bodies, each of which is characterized on the basis of soil horizons, degree of internal homogeneity, slope, aspect, landscape position, age and other properties and relationships, can be observed and measured.\n* Distinctive bioclimatic regimes or combinations of pedogenic processes produce distinctive soils. Thus, distinctive, observable morphological features, e.g., illuvial clay accumulation in B horizons, are produced by certain combinations of pedogenic processes operative over varying periods of time.\n* Pedogenic (soil-forming) processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils; these processes can proceed simultaneously. The resulting soil profile reflects the balance of these processes, present and past.\n* The geological Principle of Uniformitarianism applies to soils, i.e., pedogenic processes active in soils today have been operating for long periods of time, back to the time of appearance of organisms on the land surface. These processes do, however, have varying degrees of expression and intensity over space and time.\n* A succession of different soils may have developed, eroded and/or regressed at any particular site, as soil genetic factors and site factors, e.g., vegetation, sedimentation, geomorphology, change.\n* There are very few old soils (in a geological sense) because they can be destroyed or buried by geological events, or modified by shifts in climate by virtue of their vulnerable position at the surface of the earth. Little of the soil continuum dates back beyond the Tertiary period and most soils and land surfaces are no older than the Pleistocene Epoch. However, preserved/lithified soils (paleosols) are an almost ubiquitous feature in terrestrial (land-based) environments throughout most of geologic time. Since they record evidence of ancient climate change, they present immense utility in understanding climate evolution throughout geologic history.\n* Knowledge and understanding of the genesis of a soil is important in its classification and mapping.\n* Soil classification systems cannot be based entirely on perceptions of genesis, however, because genetic processes are seldom observed and because pedogenic processes change over time.\n* Knowledge of soil genesis is imperative and basic to soil use and management. Human influence on, or adjustment to, the factors and processes of soil formation can be best controlled and planned using knowledge about soil genesis.\n* Soils are natural clay factories (clay includes both clay mineral structures and particles less than 2 µm in diameter). Shales worldwide are, to a considerable extent, simply soil clays that have been formed in the pedosphere and eroded and deposited in the ocean basins, to become lithified at a later date.\n\nFamous pedologists\n\n* Olivier de Serres\n* Vasily V.

On the Day of Atonement, a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth – representing the sins of the community – and be driven off.\n\nHe started painting on the shore of the Dead Sea, and continued in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in Manchester Art Gallery, and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight.  Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as \"preliminary\" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited. \n\nHistory\n\nIn the Royal Academy exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that \"the scene was painted at Oosdoom, on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the Dead Sea. The mountains beyond are those of Edom.\"Bronkhurst, Judith, Wiliam Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné, vol. 1, p.180. He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.\"\n\nThe painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in Jerusalem, Hunt had met Henry Wentworth Monk, a millenarian prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the Last Judgement. Monk was particularly preoccupied with Christian Zionism.\n\nHunt chose a subject derived from the Torah as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend Millais, \"I am sanguine that that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King.\" \n\nThe Book of Leviticus describes a \"scapegoat\" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the Messiah described in Isaiah as a \"suffering servant\" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations \"Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted.\" (Isaiah 53:4) and \"And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited.\" (Leviticus 16:22)\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer Ernest Gambart:\n\nDante Gabriel Rossetti, in a letter to William Allingham in 1856, called the painting \"a grand thing, but not for the public\". Ford Madox Brown wrote in his diary: \"Hunt's Scapegoat requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.\". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: \"I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat.\"  The Art Journal in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple, was to characterise the painting as \"having disappointed even his warmest admirers\".\n\nAt the time of the exhibition of The Scapegoat itself, in 1856, The Art Journal questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of Edom, seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted – which Matthew Dennison, writing in The Spectator in 2008 described the Manchester version as \"Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow\". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it. Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that \"never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting – No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God.\" Art critic Peter Fuller, in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as \"a terrible image […] of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats\".\nQuestion:\nWhich British artist's most famous works are The Shadow of Death and The Scapegoat?\nAnswer:\nW Holman Hunt\nPassage:\nPelagie Islands\nThe Pelagie Islands (, ), from the Greek  meaning \"open sea\", are the three small islands of  Lampedusa, Linosa, and Lampione, located in the Mediterranean Sea between Malta and Tunisia, south of Sicily. To the northwest lie the island of Pantelleria and the Strait of Sicily. Geographically part of the archipelago (Lampedusa and Lampione) belongs to the African continent;   politically and administratively the islands fall within the Sicilian province of Agrigento and represent the southernmost part of Italy.\n\nDespite pockets of agriculture, the islands are unnaturally barren due to wanton deforestation and the disappearance of the native olive groves, juniper and carob plantations. Fifty years ago much of the landscape was farmland bounded by dry stone walls but today, the local economy is based on fishing – sponge fishing and canning – supplemented by tourism in Lampedusa.\n\nMarine protected area \n\nOf particular ecological concern in the islands is the protection of the Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) which is endangered throughout the Mediterranean as a result of its nesting sites being taken over by tourism. In Italy the beaches of ' on Linosa and ' on Lampedusa are two of the last remaining sites where the turtle regularly lays its eggs, the others (larger) being in southern Calabria (close to Reggio Calabria). The ' nature reserve, covering all three islands, was instituted in 2002.\nQuestion:\nRecently in the news, which is the largest of the Italian Pelagie islands in the Mediterranean Sea\nAnswer:\nLampedusa\nPassage:\nAndrew Scott Waugh\nMajor General Sir Andrew Scott Waugh (3 February 1810 – 21 February 1878) was a British army officer and surveyor now remembered as the man who named the highest mountain in the world after Sir George Everest, his predecessor in the post of Surveyor-General of India.\n\nEarly life\n\nWaugh was born in 1810 and joined the Bengal Engineers.\n\nCareer\n\nWaugh began work on the Great Trigonometric Survey of India as a young officer in 1832, two years after Everest had been appointed Surveyor-General. When Everest retired in 1843, Waugh replaced him as Surveyor-General and continued his work from the area he had reached, the Himalayas.\n\nThe great height of this area, however, combined with its unpredictable weather, meant that few useful sightings were obtained before 1847. In an era before the electronic computer, it then took many months for a team of humans to calculate, analyze and extrapolate the trigonometry involved. According to accounts of the time, it was 1852 when the team's leader Radhanath Sikdar came to Waugh to announce that what had been labeled as \"Peak XV\" was the highest point in the region and most likely in the world. None of the observers involved had suggested the peak might be the highest, although this is understandable as each of the six separate points from which it had been sighted were at least 100 miles (160 kilometres) distant.\n\nIn case of error, Waugh did not publish this result until 1856, when he also proposed that the peak be named Mount Everest in honor of his predecessor.  This was (and has since been) controversial, as Everest had always used local names for the features he surveyed, a practice Waugh had continued. Waugh claimed, however, that no local name for the mountain could be ascertained  and he was unaware of its Tibetan name, Chomolungma (\"Goddess Mother of the World\"). Ironically, though Everest himself was one of those who objected at the time,  the name \"Mount Everest\" was officially adopted a few years later.\n\nThe height of Mount Everest was calculated to be exactly 29000 ft high, but was publicly declared to be 29002 ft in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29000 ft was nothing more than a rounded estimate.Letters to the Editor, The American Statistician, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Feb. 1982), pp. 64–67 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2684102 JSTOR] Waugh is therefore wittily credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".\n\nPlaudits followed soon after Waugh's identification of Mount Everest. In 1857, the Royal Geographic Society awarded him its Patron's Medal and the following year he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. Three years later, in 1861, he attained the rank of Major General and was replaced as Surveyor-general by Henry Thuillier.\n\nLater life\n\nWaugh died in 1878 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery midway along the eastern wall. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHis first wife, Lady Waugh, died 22 February 1866, aged 42.\n\nHis second wife was Cecilia Eliza Adelaide, who died 9 February 1884.\n\nFootnotes \n\nBibliography \n\n* John Keay, The Great Arc: The Dramatic Tale of How India was Mapped and Everest was Named, HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 2000 (ISBN 0-00-257062-9).\n* Andrew Scott Waugh:\n** \"Papers relating to the Himalaya and Mount Everest\", Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London, no.IX pp. 345–351, April–May 1857.\n** \"Mounts Everest and Deodanga\", Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London, vol.2, 1858, featuring the first printed map to identify Peak XV as \"Mount Everest\".\n** Instructions for Topographical Surveying, Roorkee: Thomason College Press, 1861 (LoC ctrl# 05033399).\nQuestion:\nWho did Andrew Waugh succeed as Surveyor General of India, Waugh naming Peak XV in the Himalayas after him?\nAnswer:\nGeorge Everest\nPassage:\nGolden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\nThe Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama was first awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as a separate category in 1951.

The lyrics are sung from the perspective of someone who finds drinking red wine the only way to forget his woes.\n\nWhen Neil left the Bang Records label in 1968, Bang continued to release Neil Diamond singles, often adding newly recorded instruments and background vocals to album tracks from the two Neil Diamond albums that Bang had issued. For the \"Red Red Wine\" single, Bang added a background choir without Neil's involvement or permission. Diamond's version reached number sixty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1968. The original album version was released on Diamond's The Greatest Hits (1966–92) but the 1968 single version has never been issued on a vinyl album or CD. \n\nThe song was covered by several artists, shortly after Diamond's recording was released. Tony Tribe covered the song in 1969 in a reggae-influenced style. UB40 recorded it in 1983 in a lighter reggae style; a version which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Diamond later performed a UB40-inspired version of the song on tour. \n\nChart performance\n\nUB40 version\n\nUB40 made their rendition for their cover versions album, Labour of Love. According to the band, they were only familiar with Tony Tribe's version (they apparently didn't realise that the writer, credited simply as \"Diamond\", was in fact Neil Diamond), and their version featured a lighter, reggae-style flavour compared to Diamond's sombre, acoustic ballad. The UB40 version adds a toasted verse by UB40 member Astro, opening: \"Red Red Wine, you make me feel so fine/You keep me rocking all of the time\" — which was edited from the single that reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in August 1983, and number 34 in the United States in March 1984.\n\nIn 1988, the song was re-released as a single in the U.S., this time including the toast from Astro as he performed it at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert a few months prior to its release. The single climbed to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In September 2014 the Official Charts Company announced that sales in the UK had reached 1 million. \n\nSongwriter Neil Diamond has stated this as one of his favourite covers of his songs.  During his 2015 concert tour, he performed the song similarly to the UB40 reggae version, complete with rap in the middle (but with different lyrics).\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\n| United Kingdom (BPI)\n| Platinum\n| 1,000,000\n\nChart successions\n\nOther cover songs\n\nJimmy James and The Vagabonds released a cover version the same year as Diamond's version (1968), for the UK market. It charted at number thirty-six.\n\nTony Tribe, a Jamaican singer, recorded a reggae-influenced version in 1969 which reached number forty-six in the UK Singles Chart.  The song was also covered in 1969 by singer Charles Mann.\n\nIn 1970, a remake by Vic Dana became a minor Billboard Hot 100 hit, peaking at number 72 and reached number 30 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In early 1972, singer Roy Drusky enjoyed a top 20 hit with his version, reaching number 17 in Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and number 16 in Canada Country chart.\n\nThe Hobos included the song on their 2004 double studio album, Radio Jah Jah. \"Red Red Wine\" was also performed by Peter Tetteroo, former singer of Tee Set, a Dutch band, in 1968. The song has also been performed by Cas Haley along with UB40 on the last episode of the season 2 show America's Got Talent.\n\nIn 2001, singer Elan Atias released a dancehall version on the Buy Out Riddim instrumental, best known performed by Sean Paul, with the song entitled, \"Like Glue\". This was the first time the song was performed on a totally different instrumental tracking. The lyrics were also re-written. In 2008, Sizzla also released a dancehall single (\"No Time To Gaze\") based on the UB40 version.\n\nIn August 2012, Ballyhoo!'s lead singer was requested to perform an acoustic version based on the UB40 version, and posted it on [https://soundcloud.com/ballyhoo/red-red-wine-cover SoundCloud].\nQuestion:\n\"The record \"\"Red Red Wine\"\" was a huge hit for the group UB40 reaching number one in the charts in both the UK and USA. Which singer wrote the song ?\"\nAnswer:\nNeil Diamond\nPassage:\nHeptathlon\nA heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.\n\nThere are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.\n\nWomen's heptathlon\n\nWomen's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:\n\n* 100 metres hurdles\n* High jump\n* Shot put\n* 200 metres\n* Long jump\n* Javelin throw \n* 800 metres\n\nThe heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.\n\nThere is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.\n\nPoints system\n\nThe heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated \"standard\" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.\n\nThe events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: \n\nRunning events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):\n:P = a \\cdot (b - T)^c\nJumping events (high jump and long jump):\n:P = a \\cdot (M - b)^c\nThrowing events (shot put and javelin):\n:P = a \\cdot (D - b)^c\n\nP is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).\n\nBenchmarks\n\nThe following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:\n\nWomen's world records compared to heptathlon bests\n\nMen's heptathlon\n\n \n\nThe other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:\n\n* 60 metres\n* long jump\n* shot put\n* high jump\n* 60 metres hurdles\n* pole vault\n* 1000 metres\n\nThe scoring is similar for both versions.

Formerly placed in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae, it is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae.\n\nThe species is one of several plovers doubtfully associated with the \"trochilus\" bird mentioned in a supposed cleaning symbiosis with the Nile crocodile.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Egyptian plover is a striking and unmistakable species. The 19–21 cm long adult has a black crown, back, eye-mask and breast band. The rest of the head is white. The remaining upperpart plumage is blue-grey, and the underparts are orange. The longish legs are blue-grey.\n\nIn flight, it is even more spectacular, with the black crown and back contrasting with the grey of the upperparts and wings. The flight feathers are brilliant white crossed by a black bar. From below, the flying bird is entirely white, apart from the orange belly and black wing bar. After landing, members of a pair greet each other by raising their wings in an elaborate ceremony that shows off the black and white markings.  The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller and the black marking are intermixed with brown.\n\nHabitat and range\n\nThe Egyptian plover is a localised resident in tropical sub-Saharan Africa. It breeds on sandbars in very large rivers.\n\nBehaviour\n\nThis usually very tame bird is found in pairs or small groups near water. It feeds by pecking for insects. The call is a high-pitched krrr-krrr-krrr.\n\nBreeding\n\nIts two or three eggs are not incubated, but are buried in warm sand, temperature control being achieved by the adult sitting on the eggs with a water-soaked belly to cool them. If the adult leaves the nest, it smooths sand over the eggs, though if it is frightened the job may be hasty. The chicks are precocial, and can run as soon as they are hatched and feed themselves shortly afterwards.  The adults cool the chicks in the same way as with the eggs. The chicks may drink water from the adult's belly feathers.  The adults bury the chicks in the sand temporarily if danger threatens.\n\nSupposed relationship with crocodiles\n\nThe bird is sometimes referred to as the crocodile bird for its alleged symbiotic relationship with crocodiles.National Geographic Magazine, 1986. According to Herodotus, the crocodiles lie on the shore with their mouths open, and a bird called \"trochilus\" flies into the crocodiles' mouths so as to feed on decaying meat lodged between the crocodiles' teeth.  The identification of the trochilus with any particular plover is doubtful, as is the cleaning symbiosis itself; no known photographic evidence exists, and the written accounts are considered suspect by the biologist Thomas Howell. \n\nFile:Pluvianus aegyptius 1 Luc Viatour.jpg\nFile:Pluvianus aegyptius 2 Luc Viatour.jpg\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhich creature has a symbiotic relationship with the Egyptian plover?\nAnswer:\nCrocodylid\nPassage:\nBad Moon Rising (song)\n\"Bad Moon Rising\" is a song written by John Fogerty and performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969 (see 1969 in music). It was CCR's second gold single. \n\nThe song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.\n\nIn 2010, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.\n\nComposition \n\nFogerty reportedly wrote \"Bad Moon Rising\" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane, Fogerty claims the song is about \"the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us.\" \n\nCover versions\n\nJerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album, The Session.   Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album, Mean Old Man. \n\nEmmylou Harris included a cover of the song on her 1981 Evangeline album.\n\nA 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts. \n\nBritish Psychobilly band The Meteors recorded for their album Bad Moon Rising.\n\nEnglish singer Thea Gilmore recorded an acoustic, folk version for her 2005 Loft Music album.\n\nAnn Wilson of Heart and American country singer Gretchen Wilson covered the song on Ann Wilson's 2007 album Hope & Glory.\n\nA cover of the song by rock band Mourning Ritual was used in a promotional video for  season 4 of AMC's The Walking Dead,  the season 2 premiere of The Following, the season 3 finale of Teen Wolf, a trailer for the video game Lords of the Fallen, and a red-band trailer for  Green Room.\n\nA trailer for Netflix's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny used a cover by Palestra.   \n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe song has been used in a number of films, including An American Werewolf in London, My Fellow Americans, Twilight Zone: The Movie, Blade, Sweet Home Alabama,  My Girl, Man of the House, Mr. Woodcock, and The Big Chill.\n\nIt has also appeared in many television programs, including Supernatural, Cold Case, Northern Exposure, The Following, The Walking Dead, Teen Wolf, and Alvin and the Chipmunks, in which it is performed by the title characters. A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.\n\nThe song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.\n\nRock Band music gaming platform\n\nThe song was made available to download on March 1, 2011, for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode, which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.  \n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe last line of the chorus, \"there's a bad moon on the rise,\" is sometimes misheard as \"there's a bathroom on the right\". Fogerty occasionally sings the misheard lyric in concert.   In 2013, WatchMojo.com ranked the mishearing #5 on Top 10 Misheard Lyrics.  \n\nThe song has become notably popular in Argentina as a soccer (fútbol) chant, sung by fans at the stadium to support their teams during soccer matches. Different versions of the lyrics exist for different local teams, and even political parties.  \n\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, a modified version, titled \"Brasil, decime qué se siente\" (\"Brazil, Tell Me How It Feels\") with Spanish lyrics that taunted Brazil, Argentina's traditional rival, went viral and became very popular in Argentina.   It was adopted as the unofficial anthem for the Argentinian team by its fans, and was sung by fans and players alike.    After Brazil lost 7–1 in the semi-final against Germany, the song was again adapted.\n\nThe song has been adapted by fans of Manchester City with the title \"Argentinian Blues\" referencing the six Argentinian players in Manchester City's ranks.\n\nThe song has also been used by UFC fighter Jim Miller as a walkout song.\n\nThe first lines of the song are quoted as an epigraph to the chapter 22 of The Shining.\n\nChart peaks\nQuestion:\nWhich American band had hits with Bad Moon Rising and Proud Mary?\nAnswer:\nCreedence clearwater revival\n", "answers": ["Boddington's", "Boddingtons Brewery", "Boddingtons", "Boddington Group"], "length": 6383, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "87cbaa751a783b3da883c30dd314f044b283782710bd980d"}
{"input": "Passage:\nHeadingley railway station\nHeadingley railway station (formerly known as Headingley and Kirkstall railway station until some point early in the 20th century) is off Kirkstall Lane in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England on the Harrogate Line 3 mi north west of Leeds. The station was opened in 1849 by the Leeds & Thirsk Railway, later part of the Leeds Northern Railway to Northallerton.\n\nLocation and areas served\n\nThe station is halfway between Headingley centre and Kirkstall, just down the road from the Headingley Stadium's rugby and cricket grounds. It is over half a mile from the centre of Headingley itself, but close to local bus routes on Kirkstall Hill, Kirkstall Road and Kirkstall Lane. It is also close to local shops and services in Kirkstall, including Kirkstall Leisure Centre.  The station also serves the West Park and Queenswood Drive areas, which it is linked to by a pedestrian footpath through the Headingley Station allotments.  The predominantly student occupied houses between Kirkstall Lane and St. Ann's Drive are also within a short walk.  It is the closest railway station to Leeds Beckett University's Beckett Park campus.\n\nServices\n\nMonday to Saturday daytimes, is generally a half-hourly service southbound to Leeds and a half-hourly service northbound to Knaresborough with one train per hour onwards to York. In peak hours, there are extra services to and from Leeds. \n\nIn the evening there is an hourly service in each direction, whilst on Sundays there are two departures per hour to Leeds & Horsforth and one per hour through to Harrogate & York.\n\nServices are generally operated by Class 142, 144, 150 and 155 diesel multiple units.\n\nDaily return expresses between Harrogate and London operated by Virgin Trains East Coast pass through the station but do not stop.\n\nParking\n\nThe station has a small car park which is free to use for rail users, although no form of proof of travel or ticket is required.\n\nFuture\n\nRolling stock\n\nIn 2014 the replacement of the Pacers that were developed from the Leyland National buses in the 1980s was raised with Chancellor George Osborne; both the 142s and 144s that serve this line are both Pacers.  New Northern franchise operator Arriva Rail North has since agreed to withdraw the Pacers by 2019 and replace them with either cascaded stock or new DMUs.   A contract for new diesel & electric units was agreed with Spanish train builder CAF and rolling stock leasing company Eversholt in January 2016. \n\nElectrification\n\nIn July 2011, Harrogate Chamber of Commerce proposed to electrify the line with 750 V DC third rail, using D Stock of the London Underground, to substantially increase capacity.  This idea has not been backed by Metro, Northern Rail or National Rail and seems unlikely to garner support given the age of the D stock, the need to adapt the D stock to third rail as it runs with a fourth and the preference for overhead electrification.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Headingley railway station (12th April 2014) 004.JPG|Ticket machine and station sign with the Queenswood Drive area behind.\nFile:Headingley railway station (12th April 2014) 001.JPG|Now redundant station buildings\nQuestion:\nIn which UK city is Headingley railway station?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nLaughing policemen in trouble for sledging – using a riot ...\nLaughing policemen in trouble for sledging – using a riot shield | UK news | The Guardian\nLaughing policemen in trouble for sledging – using a riot shield\nThames Valley officers reprimanded after fun video posted on YouTube\nLaughing policemen in trouble for sledging – using a riot shield\nThames Valley officers reprimanded after fun video posted on YouTube\nThursday 14 January 2010 10.42 EST\nFirst published on Thursday 14 January 2010 10.42 EST\nPinterest\nWe all know the feeling. The snowy slopes beckon and the urge to hurtle down them takes over but there is no sledge available. So you grab a tea tray, an old bag, a coat – or, if you are a police officer, a riot shield.\nA group of officers from Thames Valley police have been reprimanded after one showed his ability to improvise by using a shield to fly down a hill in Oxfordshire.\nUrged on by colleagues, he sat on the riot shield, grabbed on to the handles that could have been designed for this purpose and shot down the hill to hoots of laughter. Unfortunately for the officers, the escapade was filmed by an onlooker and posted on YouTube . The officers' bosses were not amused.\nSuperintendent Andrew Murray, Oxford city commander, said: \"The snow has a habit of bringing out the child in all of us. I have spoken to the officers concerned and reminded them in no uncertain terms that tobogganing on duty, on police equipment and at taxpayers' expense, is a very bad idea should they wish to progress under my command.\"\nThe incident happened on Boars Hill in Oxford. The 41-second clip shows five or six officers, some also recording the adventure on their own cameras, in the snowy field, a police van parked in the background. One of the officers plonks the shield on the slope and is advised by another to hold on to the handles. He settles himself, holds tight and then two pals give him an almighty push.\nSquealing, the officer slides off, one of his colleagues advising him: \"Whatever happens, keep smiling.\" The shield proves to be an effective sledge, even skipping over a ditch at the foot of the hill.\nRick Latham, who filmed the clip on Tuesday, initially thought police were going to tell him off for attempting to get down the slope in a kayak. \"They pulled up and we thought they were going to give us a hard time. Then they asked how slippery the snow was and one of them grabbed the shield. I asked if I could film it and they said that was fine. They said something like 'We're only human'.\"\nLatham said he hoped the officers were not severely reprimanded. \"You don't always build up the most positive image of the police but they broke the mould. They were chatty and pleasant. It was just nice to see them in that situation.\"\nWeather forecasters warn of heavy rain in western England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland\nPublished: 14 Jan 2010\nWhere do all those thousands of tonnes of rock salt end up, asks Leo Hickman\nPublished: 13 Jan 2010\nEditorial: Feeding birds this month offers a rare chance to see redpolls, yellowhammers and tree sparrows among the robins, finches and tits that more often make up backyard populations.

A large weapon, the arbalest had a steel prod (\"bow\"). Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) of force and be accurate up to 100 m. A skilled arbalestier (arbalester) could loose two bolts per minute.\n\nNomenclature \n\nThe term \"arbalest\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"crossbow\". \n\"Arbalest\" is a Medieval French word originating from the Roman name ' (from ' ‘bow’ + ' ‘missile-throwing engine’),  which was then used for crossbows, although originally used for types of artillery. \nModern French uses the word ', which is linguistically one step further from the stem (disappearance of the s phoneme in the last syllable, before t). \n\nThe word applies to both crossbow and arbalest (the latter may be referred to as a heavy crossbow, but an actual heavy crossbow may not be the same as an arbalest). In some cases, the word has been used to refer to arbalists, the people who actually used the weapon.\nQuestion:\nThe arbalest/arblast is a medieval more powerful developed version of which weapon?\nAnswer:\nStonebows\nPassage:\nWhat Becomes of the Brokenhearted\n\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" is a hit single recorded by Jimmy Ruffin and released on Motown Records' Soul label in the summer of 1966. It is a ballad, with lead singer Jimmy Ruffin recalling the pain that befalls the brokenhearted, who had love that's now departed. The song essentially deals with the struggle to overcome sadness while seeking a new relationship after the passing of a loved one.\n\nThe tune was written by William Weatherspoon, Paul Riser, and James Dean, and the recording was produced by Weatherspoon and William \"Mickey\" Stevenson. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" remains one of the most-revived of Motown's hits.\n\nComposers Weatherspoon and Riser and lyricist Dean had originally written \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" with the intention of having The Spinners, then an act on Motown's V.I.P. label, record the tune. Jimmy Ruffin, older brother of Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, persuaded Dean to let him record the song, as its anguished lyric about a man lost in the misery of heartbreak resonated with the singer.\n\nRuffin's lead vocal on the recording is augmented by the instrumentation of Motown's in-house studio band, The Funk Brothers, and the joint backing vocals of Motown session singers The Originals and The Andantes. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number six on the Billboard R&B Singles chart.  In Britain, it originally reached No. 8, and on reissue in 1974 No. 4, thus making it his highest-placed chart single in the UK.\n\nThe song originally featured a spoken introduction by Ruffin, similar in style to many of Lou Rawls' performances at the time. The spoken verse was removed from the final mix, hence the unusually long instrumental intro on the released version. The spoken verse is present on the alternate mix from the UK 2003 release Jimmy Ruffin - The Ultimate Motown Collection, and as a new stereo extended mix on the 2005 anthology, The Motown Box:\n\nA world filled with love is a wonderful sight.\nBeing in love is one's heart's delight.\nBut that look of love isn't on my face.\nThat enchanted feeling has been replaced.\n\nChart performance\n\nWeekly singles charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Lead vocals by Jimmy Ruffin\n* Background vocals by the Originals (Freddie Gorman, Walter Gaines, Hank Dixon, C.P.

Liszt also arranged versions for orchestra, piano duet and piano trio.  \n\nSome are better known than others, with Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 being particularly famous. No. 10 and No. 6 are also well known.\n\nIn their original piano form, the Hungarian Rhapsodies are noted for their difficulty (Liszt was a virtuoso pianist as well as a composer).\n\nForm\n\nLiszt incorporated many themes he had heard in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written by members of the Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits,  often played by Roma (Gypsy) bands. The large scale structure of each was influenced by the verbunkos, a Hungarian dance in several parts, each with a different tempo.  Within this structure, Liszt preserved the two main structural elements of typical Gypsy improvisation—the lassan (\"slow\") and the friska (\"fast\"). At the same time, Liszt incorporated a number of effects unique to the sound of Gypsy bands, especially the pianistic equivalent of the cimbalom. He also makes much use of the Hungarian gypsy scale. \n\nExtant versions\n\nNos. 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 14 were arranged for orchestra by Franz Doppler, with revisions by Liszt himself.  These orchestrations appear as S.359 in the Searle catalogue; however, the numbers given to these versions were different from their original numbers.  The orchestral rhapsodies numbered 1-6 correspond to the piano solo versions numbered 14, 2, 6, 12, 5 and 9 respectively.\n\nIn 1874, Liszt also arranged the same six rhapsodies for piano duet (S.621).  In 1882 he made a piano duet arrangement of No. 16 (S.622), and in 1885 a piano duet version of No. 18 (S.623) and No. 19 (S.623a).  Liszt also arranged No. 12 (S.379a) and No. 9 (S.379) for piano, violin and cello.\n\nNo. 14 was also the basis of Liszt's Hungarian Fantasia for piano and orchestra, S.123. \n\nList of the Hungarian Rhapsodies\n\nThe set is as follows:\n\nThe first two were published in the year 1851, nos. 3–15 in 1853, and the last four were published in 1882 and 1886.\nQuestion:\nWho composed ‘The Hungarian Rhapsodies’?\nAnswer:\nFranz Liszt\nPassage:\nPetrology\nPetrology (from the Greek πέτρος, pétros, \"rock\" and λόγος, lógos, \"subject matter\", see -logy) is the branch of geology that studies the origin, composition, distribution and structure of rocks.\n\nLithology was once approximately synonymous with petrography, but in current usage, lithology focuses on macroscopic hand-sample or outcrop-scale description of rocks while petrography is the speciality that deals with microscopic details.\n\nIn the petroleum industry, lithology, or more specifically mud logging, is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through, and drawn on a log called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.\n\nMethodology\n\nPetrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.\n\nBranches \n\nThere are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques:\n\n*Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks.\n*Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material).\n*Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist which started out as sedimentary or igneous rocks but which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to extremes of pressure, temperature or both)\n*Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks such as those in the Earth's lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.\nQuestion:\nWhat is petrology the study of?\nAnswer:\nStones\nPassage:\nTiger, tiger, moving right: Pioneering hip operation gives ...\nTiger, tiger, moving right: Pioneering hip operation gives Girl a new start | Environment | The Guardian\nWildlife\nTiger, tiger, moving right: Pioneering hip operation gives Girl a new start\nMalayan tiger suffering arthritis in her right hip gets prosthetic hip in world first operation by Leipzig vets\nMalaysian tiger Girl is given a replacement hip by vets at the University of Leipzig.

The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but has shifted meaning over time. \n\nMany condiments are available packaged in single-serving packets, like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals. They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce,  compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples.\n\nThe term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin condere, meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". \n\nDefinition\n\nThe exact definition of what is and is not a condiment varies. Some definitions include spice and herbs, including salt and pepper,  using the term interchangeably with seasoning.  Others restrict the definition to including only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce. Cheese is also considered a condiment in some European countries.\n\nHistory\n\nCondiments were known in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China, and were often used to improve the taste of spoiling food; before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable.  The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by , leading to a flourishing condiment industry. Apicius, a cookbook based on 4th and 5th century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.\n\nList of condiments\n\nCondiment market in the United States \n\nThe condiment market refers to the marketing and consumer purchase of condiments.\n\nIn the United States, condiment market was valued at USD 5.6 billion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to USD 7 billion by 2015. The condiment market is the second largest in specialty foods behind that of cheese.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Dijon mustard on a spoon - 20051218.jpg|Dijon mustard\nImage:Chrain3.jpg|Chrain (horseradish sauce)\nImage:Oeufsmayo.JPG|Mayonnaise\nImage:Ketchup-01.jpg|Tomato Ketchup\nImage:BasilkumPesto.jpg|Pesto genovese\nImage:Chutneys.jpg|Chutneys\nImage:HAT YAI MARKET 2.jpg|Curry powder or paste\nImage:Megrelian ajika.jpg|Ajika, spicy sauce in Caucasian cuisine\nImage:Tkemali.JPG|Tkemali (Georgian sauce made of sour cherry plums)\nImage:Chinese condiments at the restaurant by bhollar in Nerima, Tokyo.jpg|Common Chinese condiments: soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, white pepper\nImage:Duck sauce packets.jpg|Packets of duck sauce\nImage:Carrburritos salsas and chips.jpg|Salsa\nImage:Worcester Sauce 001.jpg|Worcestershire sauce\nImage:Marmite thick spread toasted bread.jpg|Marmite\nImage:Relish.jpg|Gentleman's Relish\nImage:Flying goose sriracha th.jpg|Sriracha (type of Hot sauce)\nImage:Shichimi tougarashi.JPG|Shichimi\nImage:HK 北角 North Point 和田 Wada Japanese Restaurant 放題 Buffet dinner 山葵 green Wasabi Mar-2013.JPG|Wasabi\nQuestion:\nWhat condiment is made of boiled beans, roasted grain and brine?\nAnswer:\nKancang\nPassage:\nThe Literary Digest\nThe Literary Digest was an American influential general interest weekly magazine published by Funk & Wagnalls. Founded by Isaac Kaufmann Funk in 1890, it eventually merged with two similar weekly magazines, Public Opinion and Current Opinion.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginning with early issues, the emphasis was on opinion articles and an analysis of news events. Established as a weekly newsmagazine, it offered condensations of articles from American, Canadian and European publications. Type-only covers gave way to illustrated covers during the early 1900s. After Isaac Funk's death in 1912, Robert Joseph Cuddihy became the editor. In the 1920s, the covers carried full-color reproductions of famous paintings. By 1927, The Literary Digest climbed to a circulation of over one million. Covers of the final issues displayed various photographic and photo-montage techniques. In 1938, it merged with the Review of Reviews, only to fail soon after.  Its subscriber list was bought by Time. \n\nA column in the Digest, known as \"The Lexicographer's Easy Chair\", was produced by Frank Horace Vizetelly.  Ewing Galloway as assistant editor at the publication.\n\nPresidential poll\n\nThe Literary Digest is best-remembered today for the circumstances surrounding its demise. As it had done in 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1932, it conducted a straw poll regarding the likely outcome of the 1936 presidential election. Before 1936, it had always correctly predicted the winner.\n\nThe 1936 poll showed that the Republican candidate, Governor Alfred Landon of Kansas, was likely to be the overwhelming winner.  This seemed possible to some, as the Republicans had fared well in Maine, where the congressional and gubernatorial elections were then held in September, as opposed to the rest of the nation, where these elections were held in November along with the presidential election, as they are today. This outcome seemed especially likely in light of the conventional wisdom, \"As Maine goes, so goes the nation\", a saying coined because Maine was regarded as a \"bellwether\" state which usually supported the winning candidate's party.\n\nIn November, Landon carried only Vermont and Maine; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt carried the 46 other states. Landon's electoral vote total of eight is a tie for the record low for a major-party nominee since the American political paradigm of the Democratic and Republican parties began in the 1850s. The Democrats joked, \"As goes Maine, so goes Vermont.\"  The magazine was so discredited by this discrepancy that it soon folded.\n\nIn retrospect, the polling techniques employed by the magazine were to blame. Although it had polled ten million individuals (of whom about 2.4 million responded, an astronomical total for any opinion poll),  it had surveyed its own readers first, a group with disposable incomes well above the national average of the time, shown in part by their ability still to afford a magazine subscription during the depths of the Great Depression, and then two other readily available lists: that of registered automobile owners and that of telephone users, both of which were also wealthier than the average American at the time.  Research published in 1972 and 1988 concluded that non-response bias was the primary source of this error, although their sampling frame was also quite different from the vast majority of voters.\n\nGeorge Gallup's American Institute of Public Opinion achieved national recognition by correctly predicting the result of the 1936 election and by also correctly predicting the quite different results of the Literary Digest poll to within about 1%, using a smaller sample size of 50,000. Gallup's last poll before the election predicted Roosevelt would receive 56% of the popular vote. The official tally gave Roosevelt 61%.  \n\nThis debacle led to a considerable refinement of public opinion polling techniques and later came to be regarded as ushering in the era of modern scientific public opinion research.\nQuestion:\nDuring the US presidential elections of 1936, the magazine The Literary Digest conducted an opinion poll using millions of people but still ended up being wrong. Who bested the magazine with his scientific technique using only a small percentage of what the magazine had used?\nAnswer:\nGeorge H. Gallup\nPassage:\nArkell's Brewery\nArkell's Brewery was established in Swindon, England in 1843, and has been owned by members of the Arkell family since its establishment.

Many feel that it was Sibelius rather than Mahler who was the last master in the grand Beethoven symphonic tradition.\nLife and Music\nAlthough Sibelius displayed an affinity for music from an early age, he was hardly a prodigy. He didn't start formal piano lessons until he was nine, although it was the violin that fired his enthusiasm.\nHe became obsessed with the idea of becoming a world-class virtuoso. His failure to do so struck a big emotional blow - he got as far as an audition with the Vienna Philharmonic.\nSibelius received a thorough training in composition, but what really set him on the road as a composer was the Berlin premiere of his conductor-composer friend Robert Kajanu's Aino Symphony.\nThe fearsomely nationalistic young Finn's immediate response was a massive five-movement symphonic poem entitled Kullervo composed in 1892, the year he married Aino Jarnefelt. This was swiftly followed by En Saga, the Karelia Suite, a series of four orchestral Legends (including the much-loved Swan of Tuonela) and Finlandia.\nBetween 1899 and 1926 Sibelius composed seven symphonies which tantalisingly balance to varying degrees his Classicist roots and Romantic inclinations.\nUntil the outbreak of the First World War, Sibelius was in demand throughout Europe as a conductor.\nSibelius's last major work was the orchestral tone-poem Tapiola, which points towards the possibility of a new period of creative mastery. However, with over 30 years of his life remaining, Sibelius virtually laid his composing pen to rest.\nFor several years he worked secretively on an Eighth Symphony, but this was later consigned to the fire.\nHe remains one of the few 20th-century composers to have become a legend within his own lifetime.\nDid you know?\nSibelius was actually given the first name Johan when he was born; that is the Finnish version of the English name John. But when he found out his uncle had turned his name into Jean, which is the French version of John, Sibelius decided to do the same.\nSibelius: 15 facts about the great composer\nToday his name is used for music composing software, but the Finnish composer Sibelius deserves our attention – not least for his Finlandia and Violin Concerto.\nQuestion:\nHow many symphonies did Jean Sibelius compose?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nWisconsin Athletics - This Week in Badger Athletics\nThere are many activities and promotions taking place in Wisconsin sports this        weekend.\nFINAL FOOTBALL GAME TIMES SET\nStarting times for the final two football games of the regular season        have been set.

What action begins a hockey match?\nAnswer:\nDraw (hockey)\nPassage:\nDulcinea del Toboso\n\"Dulcinea del Toboso\" is a fictional character who is unseen in Miguel de Cervantes' novel Don Quixote. Don Quixote describes her appearance in the following terms: \"... her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.\" [Volume 1/Chapter XIII]\n\nIn the Spanish of the time, Dulcinea means something akin to an overly elegant \"sweetness\". In this way, Dulcinea is an entirely fictional person for whom Quixote relentlessly fights. To this day, a reference to someone as one's \"Dulcinea\" implies hopeless devotion and love for her, and particularly unrequited love.\n\nThe Jules Massenet opera Don Quichotte depicts Dulcinée as a major character, the local queen who sends the knight on a quest to retrieve her jewels.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n*\"Dulcinea\" is referred to in US TV series Ally McBeal as a song her father sings to her as a child. In the final season 5 in episode 10 Ally defends a man who thinks he can fly, and pursued Ally to be his criminal defense lawyar after seeing her in court and thinking she looks like \"Dulcinea\".\n*Dulcinea is the 2008 album by the band Tremoloco\n*Dulcinea appears in the Japanese series Zukkoke Knight - Don De La Mancha. Her real name is Fedora (in the English dub). She is daughter of the bandit king, Poormouth. Her role is to help her bankrupt father by stealing, but she fails almost every time. She fools Don Quixote into helping her. She is voiced by Mami Koyama.\n*\"Dulcinea\" is the title of the first episode of the Syfy television show, The Expanse. \n*\"Dulcinea\" is the name of the third track on the album In the Absence of Truth by Isis (band).\nQuestion:\nDulcinea was the love of which fictional character?\nAnswer:\nAlonso Quijano\nPassage:\nGymnophobia\nGymnophobia is a fear (phobia) of nudity.  \n\nTerminology\n\nThe term gymnophobia comes from the Greek γυμνός - gumnos, \"naked\"  and  φόβος - phobos, \"fear\".  A phobia that has a significant amount of overlap with gymnophobia is dishabiliophobia, which is the fear of undressing in front of others. \n\nSymptoms\n\nGymnophobics experience anxiety from nudity, even if they realize their fear is irrational. They may worry about seeing others naked, being seen naked, or both. Their fear may stem from a general anxiety about sexuality, from a fear that they are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves them exposed and unprotected.  \n\nGymnophobia should not be confused with avoidance or shunning of many forms of nudity on modesty or other rational or moral grounds. Many people avoid public nudity as well as nudity in private situations, and some have an aversion to nudity as an aspect of prudishness or body shame.  \n\nGymnophobia refers to an actual fear of nudity, but most sufferers with the condition learn how to function in general society despite the condition. They may, for example, avoid  changing rooms, washrooms, showers, and beaches. However, the condition can be regarded as an anxiety disorder if the person cannot control the phobia or it is interfering with their daily life.  Gymnophobia is common among children, especially those undergoing puberty. Child gymnophobia is common due to peer pressure, bullying, and a fear of exposing sexual organs.\n\nGymnophobia has been likened to the fictional condition \"never-nude\" portrayed in the comedy series Arrested Development.\nQuestion:\nIf you suffered from gymnophobia what would your fear be?\nAnswer:\nStarkers\nPassage:\nCrooner\nCrooner is an American epithet given to male singers of jazz standards, mostly from the Great American Songbook, either backed by a full orchestra, a big band or by a piano. Originally it was an ironic term denoting an emphatically sentimental, often emotional singing style made possible by the use of microphones. Some performers, such as Russ Columbo, did not accept the term:  Frank Sinatra once said that he did not consider himself or Bing Crosby \"crooners\". \nHistory\n\nThis dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and electrical recording. Before the advent of the microphone, popular singers like Al Jolson had to project to the rear seats of a theater, as did opera singers, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made possible the more personal style.  Al Bowlly, Gene Austin and Art Gillham are often credited as inventors of the crooning style but Rudy Vallée became far more popular, beginning from 1928.  He could be heard by anyone with a phonograph or a radio.  \n\n\"In his popular radio program, which began with his floating greeting, 'Heigh ho, everybody,' beamed in from a New York City night club, he stood like a statue, surrounded by clean-cut collegiate band musicians and cradling a saxophone in his arms.\"\n\nHis first film, The Vagabond Lover, was promoted with the line, \"Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!\" while his success brought press warnings of the \"Vallee Peril\": this \"punk from Maine\" with the \"dripping voice\" required mounted police to beat back screaming, swooning females at his vaudeville shows. \n\nBy the early 1930s the term \"crooner\" had taken on a pejorative connotation, both Cardinal O'Connell of Boston and the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) publicly denouncing the vocal form, O'Connell calling it \"base\", \"degenerate\", \"defiling\" and un-American and NYSTA adding \"corrupt\".  Even The New York Times predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper printed, \"They sing like that because they can’t help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion…. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf.\" Voice range shifted from tenor (Vallée) to baritone (Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby). Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robinson, Crosby, Columbo & Vallee, called upon men to fight \"these public enemies\" brought into homes via radio.\n\nThere were female crooners, including Annette Hanshaw, Mildred Bailey (at the beginning of her career) and Helen Rowland.\n\nThe genre enjoyed popularity within the former Soviet Union with Mark Reizen, Leonid Utyosov, Sergey Lemeshev, Ivan Kozlovsky, Pyotr Leshchenko, Pavel Lisitsian, Georg Ots, Oleg Anofriyev, Muslim Magomayev, and Joseph Kobzon leading the way. Their performances had a variety of influences including ballads and swing and was included in popular film soundtracks.\n\nDecline \n\nAfter 1954 popular music became dominated by other styles, especially rock 'n' roll, while the music of latter-day crooners such as Perry Como and Matt Monro was recategorized by radio stations as easy listening or adult contemporary. Crooners have remained popular among fans of traditional pop music, with contemporary performers such as Tony Bennett, Barry Manilow, Brian Evans, Richard Hawley, Harry Connick, Jr., Michael Bublé, Neil Hannon, Peter Cincotti, Matteo Brancaleoni and Engelbert Humperdinck keeping the form alive. The term is rarely used to describe a female singer, although Mildred Bailey's pre-swing records as well as Helen Rowland are often considered part of the \"crooning\" style. Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dick Powell, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, Bobby Darin and Jimmy Durante incorporated other popular styles into their music, such as blues, dixieland and even native Hawaiian music.\n\nCountry crooners\n\nDue to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became a remaining part of country music.  Bing Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song  San Antonio Rose, originally recorded by Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys. In 1942 Perry Como had a smash hit with Deep in the Heart of Texas; Bing Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Perry Como, covered this song and took it to the #3 position in the US chart that same year. Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves and Ray Price are especially well known for their country crooner standards.    Also Dean Martin is rather famous for the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records. Fellow Italian-American crooner Perry Como recorded several albums with country producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners scored hits with pop versions of country-songs: Tony Bennett had a Billboard #1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams' Cold, Cold Heart, which was also performed by Louis Armstrong; Perry Como had a Billboard #1 hit in 1953 with his version of Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes, a #1 country hit for its author Slim Willet and a #4 country hit forRay Price; Guy Mitchell scored a Billboard #1 in 1959 with Heartaches by the Number, a country-hit for Ray Price; Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK #1 hit with Release Me, another song already made famous by Ray Price in 1954. In 1970 Ray Price had a #1 U.S. country hit and a #11 Billboard Hot 100 hit with the song For the Good Times written by Kris Kristofferson; subsequently Perry Como's rendition reached #7 in 1973 U.K. singles chart.\n\nList of famous crooners\n\nRay Eberle\nQuestion:\nWhich crooner’s only UK No.1 was Memories Are Made Of This in 1956?\nAnswer:\nDino Paul Crocetti\nPassage:\nBlack Lady\nBlack Lady is an extremely combative variant of the card game Whist that is popular in the United Kingdom and is similar to the North American game Hearts. It is commonly played among large groups of players, typically 8 to 10, using two decks of cards, or it can be played by as few as three players using a single deck.\n\nMain rules\n\n#The game proceeds by trick-taking in the standard way, and there are no trumps.\n#Certain cards are listed as penalty cards, and have assigned penalty values.  When a trick is taken which contains any penalty cards, the winner of the trick is penalised by the total number of these penalty points.  Penalty points are counted at the end of each hand, and each player's running total of penalty points is adjusted as appropriate.\n#If one player takes every penalty card in the pack, called 'going for the lot', he can choose to do one of two things; either zeroise his running penalty total, or double everyone else's.\n\nThe penalty cards are :\n*Queen of Spades: 50 points (hence 'Black Lady')\n*Ace of Spades: 40 points\n*Ten of Spades: 20 points\n*Heart face cards: 10 points (this includes the Ace)\n*All other Hearts: face value\n\nThere are therefore 205 points to be taken per deck, per hand. One variant makes the 10 worth 15 points, so the total is exactly 200.\n\nOther rules\n\nThe cards are dealt out evenly among all the players, using standard Whist conventions for rotating dealership and lead.  This requires that the number of cards in play is divisible by the number of players, so before any hands are dealt, the pack(s) is inspected and the appropriate number of innocuous cards of trivial denomination (low Diamonds/Clubs) are extracted and discarded.\n\nWhen multiple packs are in use, there are multiple cards of each face. When the winning card face in a trick is played multiple times to that trick, the first such card played is the one which takes the trick.\n\nAfter the deal and before the first lead, each player must select three of his dealt cards and pass them covertly to his left-hand neighbour, and then accept three cards from his right-hand neighbour.  The selection of the pass-on cards is a science in itself, given issues such as suit distribution, ability to lead through a passed-on danger card, hands which may be suited to going for the lot, and so forth. There is also the problem of disguising your intentions from your left-hand neighbour, especially when going for the lot.\n\nThe play proceeds, hand by hand, until the allotted time span has expired. The winner is the player with the smallest running penalty score.\n\nAn alternative called Dirty Liz proceeds in a similar fashion to Black Lady except:\nThere is a trump suit each hand in the order Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Spades. \n1-10 of Hearts score 1 point each, J2, Q\n3, K4, A\n5 and the Queen of Spades is 13 points as normal. \nAt the start of each hand, after the deal, each player passes three cards to their left.\nQuestion:\nWhich playing card is sometimes called 'The Black Lady'?\nAnswer:\nQueen of spades\nPassage:\nRecto and verso\nThe terms recto and verso refer to the text written on the \"front\" and \"back\" sides of a leaf of paper in a bound item such as a codex, book, broadsheet, or pamphlet. \nThe terms are shortened from Latin rectō foliō and versō foliō, translating to  \"on the right side of the page\" and \"on the turned side of the page\", respectively.\nThe page faces themselves are called folium rectum and folium versum in Latin, and the ablative recto, verso already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to. \n\nIn codicology, each physical sheet (folium, abbreviated fol. or f.) of a manuscript is numbered and the sides are referred to as rectum and folium versum, abbreviated as r and v respectively.\nEditions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form  fol. 1r, sometimes with the r and v in superscript, as in 1r, or with a superscript o indicating the ablative recto, verso, as in 1ro.\ne.g.\nRoberts, Longinus on the Sublime: The Greek Text Edited After the Paris Manuscript (2011),  [https://books.google.ch/books?idU-JBqP0i2hcC&pg\nPA170#vonepage&q&f\nfalse 170];\nWijngaards, The Ordained Women Deacons of the Church's First Millennium (2012), [https://books.google.ch/books?idqHKGVQbVEmIC&pg\nPA232#vonepage&q&f\nfalse 232];\netc.\n\nTylus, Manuscrits français de la collection berlinoise disponibles à la Bibliothèque Jagellonne de Cracovie (XVIe-XIXe siècles) (2010)[https://books.google.ch/books?idv4TaJu_ErioC&pg\nPA274#vonepage&q&f\nfalse]\n\nThis terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century.\n\nLyons (2011) argues that the term rectum \"right, correct, proper\" for the front side of the page derives from the use of papyrus in Late Antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually, papyrus would carry writing only on the \"correct\", smooth side (and only in the most exceptional of cases would there be writing on the \"turned\" side of the page). \n\nThe use of the terms 'recto' and 'verso' are also used in the codicology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew. However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right. The reading order of each folio remains 'first recto, then verso' regardless of writing direction.\n\nThe terms are carried over into printing; recto-verso  is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the printing-press over the much older Asian woodblock printing method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper. The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the annotation of scholarly books, particularly in bilingual edition translations.\n\nThe \"recto\" and \"verso\" terms can also be employed for the front and back of a one-sheet artwork, particularly in drawing.  A recto-verso drawing is a sheet with drawings on both sides, for example in a sketchbook—although usually in these cases there is no obvious primary side.  Some works are planned to exploit being on two sides of the same piece of paper, but usually the works are not intended to be considered together.  Paper was relatively expensive in the past; indeed good drawing paper still is much more expensive than normal paper.\n\nBy book publishing convention, the first page of a book, and sometimes of each section and chapter of a book, is a recto page,  and hence all recto pages will have odd numbers and all verso pages will have even numbers.  \n\nIn some early printed books (e.g. João de Barros's Décadas da Ásia), it is the folia (\"leaves\") rather than the pages, that are numbered. Thus each folium carries a consecutive number on its recto side, while on the verso side there is no number.\nQuestion:\nIf verso is the left side page of a book, what name is given to the right?\nAnswer:\nVerso and recto\nPassage:\nAction painting\nAction painting, sometimes called \"gestural abstraction\", is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.  The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.\n\nBackground \n\nThe style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms \"action painting\" and \"abstract expressionism\" interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French tachisme.\n\nThe term was coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952,  in his essay \"The American Action Painters\",   \nand signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was \"an arena in which to act\". While abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like Clement Greenberg, focused on their works' \"objectness.\" To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. \"Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like \"informel\" and \"Action Painting,\" definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd.\" – Clement Greenberg, \"Post Painterly Abstraction\".\n\nRosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist Wolfgang Paalen in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term \"action\" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist \"acts\" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of quantum mechanics, as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay Totem Art(1943) had considerable influence on such artists as Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual \"action\" with psychic links to generic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship. \n\nOver the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from Happenings and Fluxus to Conceptual, Performance art, Installation art and Earth Art.\n\nHistorical context \n\nIt is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context. A product of the post-World War II artistic resurgence of expressionism in America and more specifically New York City, action painting developed in an era where quantum mechanics and psychoanalysis were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization’s understanding of the world through heightened self-consciousness and awareness.\n\nThe preceding art of Kandinsky and Mondrian had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. Action painting took this a step further, using both Jung and Freud’s ideas of the subconscious as its underlying foundations. The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the primeval and tapping the collective sense of an archetypal visual language. This was done by the artist painting \"unconsciously,\" and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the surrealist emphasis on automatism which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the subconscious mind. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters Joan Miró and André Masson. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.\n\nNotable action painters \n\n*Karel Appel\n*Frank Avray Wilson\n*Norman Bluhm\n*James Brooks\n*Nicolas Carone\n*Elaine de Kooning\n*Willem de Kooning\n*Perle Fine\n*Sam Francis\n*Michael Goldberg\n*William Green\n*Ismail Gulgee\n*Philip Guston\n*Grace Hartigan\n*Franz Kline\n*Albert Kotin\n*Lee Krasner\n*Alfred Leslie\n*Conrad Marca-Relli\n*Georges Mathieu\n*Joan Mitchell\n*Jackson Pollock\n*Milton Resnick\n*Joe Stefanelli\n*Jack Tworkov\nQuestion:\n\"Which 20th century painter claimed to have invented a new technique called \"\"action painting\"\" and was called by the contemporary press \"\"Jack The Dripper\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPaul Jackson Pollock\nPassage:\nEurotunnel\nGroupe Eurotunnel SE manages and operates the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France including the vehicle shuttle services, and earns revenue on other trains (DB Schenker freight and Eurostar passenger) through the tunnel. It is listed on both the Euronext London and Euronext Paris markets, and was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 19 July 2012.   The company is based in Paris.\n\nThe railway operation has  of double track railway in the main tunnels, plus extensive surface-level terminal facilities at Folkestone in the UK and at Coquelles near Calais in France; the operation is entirely self-contained, with connections near the two terminals to the respective national railway networks. Signalling and electric traction supply at 25 kV AC are also under Eurotunnel control.\n\nTrain operation consists of shuttle trains conveying cars and coaches and other trains conveying heavy goods vehicles between the two terminals. Other trains using Eurotunnel infrastructure are operated by the respective owners.\n\nHistory\n\nThe company was formed on 13 August 1986 with the objective of financing, building and operating a tunnel between Great Britain and France.\n\nThe company awarded a contract for the construction of the tunnel to TransManche Link (TML). The tunnel cost around £9.5bn to build, about double TML's original estimate of £4.7bn.  The tunnel was financed partly from investment by shareholders and partly from £8bn of debt, and was officially opened on 6 May 1994 by HM Queen Elizabeth II and President François Mitterrand. In its first year of operation the company lost £925m because of disappointing revenue from passengers and freight, together with heavy interest charges on its £8bn of debt. \n\nIn April 2004, a dissident shareholder group led by Nicolas Miguet succeeded in taking control of the board. However, in February 2005 Jean-Louis Raymond, the Chief Executive appointed after the boardroom coup, resigned and Jacques Gounon took complete control becoming Chairman and Chief Executive. \n\nIn July 2006, shareholders voted on a deal which would have seen half the debt, by then reduced to £6.2bn, exchanged for 87% of the equity.   However this plan failed and on 2 August 2006 the company was placed into bankruptcy protection by a French court for six months. \n\nIn May 2007 a new restructuring plan was approved by shareholders whereby Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup agreed to provide £2.8bn of long-term funding, the balance of the debt being exchanged for equity, and the shareholders agreed to waive the unlimited free travel and other perks that they had enjoyed. \n\nIn June 2007 the company entered into a partnership through subsidiary Europorte 2 with the Port of Dunkirk relating to rail freight traffic; the company was to operate trains from Dunkirk to the Delta 3 logistics terminal at Dourges, and collaborate on container shipments to the UK using the port of Dunkirk via the tunnel.  \n\nFollowing the restructuring, Eurotunnel was able to announce a small net profit in 2007, of €1 million, for the first time in its existence.   Half-year earnings for 2008 rose to €26 million (£20.6m). The net profit for 2008 was €40 million, despite the costs associated with traffic loss from September 2008 to February 2009 following a fire in the tunnel, and this allowed Eurotunnel to issue its first-ever dividend of €0.04 per euro value.  \n\nThe return to financial health allowed the company to announce on 28 October 2009 the anticipated voluntary redemption of some of its convertible debt. By anticipating to November 2009 the reimbursement of debt due in July 2010, it aimed to issue up to 119.4 million new ordinary shares and thus shore up its capital while reducing its debt load. \n\nIn late 2009 the company and SNCF acquired Veolia Cargo, splitting the business between them. The company took over French operations: Veolia Cargo France, Veolia Cargo Link and CFTA Cargo are expected to be rebranded Europorte France, Europorte Link and Europorte proximity and become part of its Europorte freight business. Socorail has not been announced as being rebranded. \n\nIn January 2010 the Port of Dunkirk awarded the company a seven-year concession to operate its 200 km railway system. \n\nIn June 2010 the company acquired British railfreight company FirstGBRf for £31 million, to be merged into its Europorte.   On 11 June 2012 a bid by the company for three Channel ferries belonging to the former operator SeaFrance (in liquidation) for lease to another operator was accepted. \n\nOn the 11 June 2012 Eurotunnel acquired the assets of SeaFrance ferries Berlioz, Rodin and Nord Pas-de-Calais. They were chartered to start the MyFerryLink ferry company on 20 August 2012, owned by Eurotunnel.\n\nOperations and services\n\nCar shuttle\n\nThe company operates shuttle services with Eurotunnel Class 9 locomotives.\n\nFreight\n\nEuroporte operates freight trains in France, as well as the cross-channel freight services performed by Europorte 2 before 2009. Since the part acquisition of Veolia Cargo in 2009 it also provides rail transport services to industrial locations through Socorail.\n\nPassenger services\n\nPassenger services are operated by Eurostar, who has a practical monopoly on tunnel passenger services. Eurotunnel levies charges on Eurostar (currently £25 per passenger per return journey) and other operators for use of the tunnel. \n\nDeutsche Bahn planned to operate passenger trains between London and Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Cologne using the tunnel; planning started around 2005, \nbut the plans were shelved in 2014, because of the special safety and security requirements in the tunnel. \n\nRolling stock\nQuestion:\nIn which town would you find the English entrance to the 'Channel Tunnel (Eurotunnel)?\nAnswer:\nFolkestone, Kent\nPassage:\nSimon & Garfunkel - The Sounds of Silence Lyrics\nLyrics containing the term: the sounds of silence by simon garfunkel\nLyrics.com »\nSearch results for 'the sounds of silence by simon garfunkel'\nYee yee!

Nobody’s counting. And the Match Of The Day host is happy to keep on munching.\nGary might have lost count of the crisps, but not the years.\n“It’s getting close to 20 years I’ve been doing these ads,” he says\n“It’s absurd! Who would have thought when I did the first one as a one-off, I’d still be going now?”\nIn fact, the 52-year-old former England star has been making the promos for 19 years. So what’s his favourite? Gary doesn’t hesitate. It was the one he filmed with Paul Gascoigne.\n“It was only a one-day shoot and it was based on Italia 90 when he cried,” Gary explains.\n“I would squeeze his hand while he was trying to get in my packet of crisps and he cried.\n“They used this contraption that spurted water out of his eyes and it was so funny doing it that we couldn’t keep a straight face for hours.\n“We had to have a serious word with each other and tell each other if we didn’t sort it out, we’d be there for days. It was hilarious.” Gary reckons he is happy to clown around for the popular ads, which see him send up his nice-guy image.\n“I don’t mind making a fool of myself as I think it’s important not to take yourself too seriously,” he says.\n“I don’t have any input into the ads but I do try telling them we should film in sunnier climes. It tends to fall on deaf ears though.\n“There have been a couple of ads I wasn’t so keen on, such as the one where I was dancing in the rain.\n“I had three days of shooting with freezing cold water poured on me – deeply unpleasant on a cold day.”\nThe latest ad sees Gary tracking down ingredients to make his favourite snack as they now include real home-grown British ingredients.\nHis quest sees him collecting cheese in Somerset, chasing chickens in Devon and tracking down tomatoes in the Vale of Evesham, Worcs, before being soaked by sprinklers.\nBut there is one real ingredient that will not be appearing any time soon.\n“There’s no horse,” he laughs. “And no plans to bring out horse-flavoured crisps.\n“Seriously though, from the scandal we’ve seen in recent weeks, it shows that people like to know what’s going in their food. So it makes sense to use home-grown produce, like the chicken.”\nLeicester, Everton, Barcelona and Tottenham striker Gary got in a flap when there was a massive outcry after he quit Twitter in January this year.\nHe went back on the social network site just eight days later after the story made headlines.\nGary says: “I was just going to have a break from Twitter as I was on it a bit too much, but you can’t be on it and just stop tweeting as you’ll be tempted to look. I deleted my account because I knew I’d just keep looking otherwise.\n“Then there was this furore, it was just mad. So I just went back on quicker than I anticipated because I’d had enough of the fuss. I should have kept my gob shut. Next time I won’t mention it, I’ll just disappear.”\nAs filming comes to an end, talk turns back his old pal Gazza, 45, currently battling his drink and drug demons at a clinic in Arizona.\nGary says: “I understand Gazza is stable and we all wish him well.\n“There’s a lot of love for Gazza which he can hopefully take some comfort from.”\n● Gary channels his inner farmer on a tractor in the new Walkers Home Grown advert.

{"input": "Passage:\nAcmeist poetry\nAcmeism, or the Guild of Poets, was a transient poetic school, which emerged in 1910 in Russia under the leadership of Nikolay Gumilev and Sergei Gorodetsky. Their ideals were compactness of form and clarity of expression.  The term was coined after the Greek word akme, i.e., \"the best age of man\".\n\nThe acmeist mood was first announced by Mikhail Kuzmin in his 1910 essay \"Concerning Beautiful Clarity\". The acmeists contrasted the ideal of Apollonian clarity (hence the name of their journal, Apollon) to \"Dionysian frenzy\" propagated by the Russian symbolist poets like Bely and Vyacheslav Ivanov. To the Symbolists' preoccupation with \"intimations through symbols\" they preferred \"direct expression through images\". \n\nIn his later manifesto \"The Morning of Acmeism\" (1913), Osip Mandelstam defined the movement as \"a yearning for world culture\". As a \"neo-classical form of modernism\", which essentialized \"poetic craft and cultural continuity\", the Guild of Poets placed Alexander Pope, Théophile Gautier, Rudyard Kipling, Innokentiy Annensky, and the Parnassian poets among their predecessors. \n\nMajor poets in this school include Osip Mandelstam, Nikolay Gumilev, Mikhail Kuzmin, Anna Akhmatova, and Georgiy Ivanov. The group originally met in The Stray Dog Cafe, St. Petersburg, then a celebrated meeting place for artists and writers. Mandelstam's collection of poems Stone (1912) is considered the movement's finest accomplishment.\n\nAmongst the major acmeist poets, each interpreted acmeism in a different stylistic light, from Akhmatova's intimate poems on topics of love and relationships to Gumilev's narrative verse.\nQuestion:\nAcmeism relates to poetry from the early 20th Century in which country?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\n15 minutes of fame\n15 minutes of fame is short-lived media publicity or celebrity of an individual or phenomenon. The expression is credited to Andy Warhol, who included the words \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\" in the program for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.  Photographer Nat Finkelstein claims credit for the expression, stating that he was photographing Warhol in 1966 for a proposed book. A crowd gathered trying to get into the pictures and Warhol supposedly remarked that everyone wants to be famous, to which Finkelstein replied, \"Yeah, for about fifteen minutes, Andy.\" \n\nThe phenomenon is often used in reference to figures in the entertainment industry or other areas of popular culture, such as reality television and YouTube.\n\nThe statement may be an adaptation of an idea by Marshall McLuhan explaining how TV differs from other media using contestants. An older version of the same concept in English is the expression \"nine days' wonder\", which dates at least as far back as the Elizabethan era.\n\nInterpretation\n\nGerman art historian Benjamin H. D. Buchloh suggests that the core tenet of Warhol's aesthetic, being \"the systematic invalidation of the hierarchies of representational functions and techniques\" of art, corresponds directly to the belief that the \"hierarchy of subjects worthy to be represented will someday be abolished,\" hence anybody, and therefore \"everybody,\" can be famous once that hierarchy dissipates, \"in the future,\" and by logical extension of that, \"in the future, everybody will be famous,\" and not merely those individuals worthy of fame. \n\nOn the other hand, wide proliferation of the adapted idiom \"my fifteen minutes\"     and its entrance into common parlance have led to a slightly different application, having to do with both the ephemerality of fame in the information age and, more recently, the democratization of media outlets brought about by the advent of the internet.Frederick Levy, 15 Minutes of Fame: Becoming a Star in the YouTube Revolution, Penguin Group, 2008, ISBN 978-1-59257-765-1. In this formulation, Warhol's quote has been taken to mean: \"At the present, because there are so many channels by which an individual might attain fame, albeit not enduring fame, virtually anyone can become famous for a brief period of time.\"\n\nThere is a third and even more remote interpretation of the term, as used by an individual who has been legitimately famous or skirted celebrity for a brief period of time, that period of time being his or her \"fifteen minutes.\" \n\nJohn Langer suggests that 15 minutes of fame is an enduring concept because it permits everyday activities to become \"great effects.\"John Langer, Tabloid television: popular journalism and the \"other news\", Routledge, 1998, ISBN 978-0-415-06636-5, page 51, 63, 73 Tabloid journalism and the paparazzi have accelerated this trend, turning what may have before been isolated coverage into continuing media coverage even after the initial reason for media interest has passed.\n\nDerivative phrases\n\nIn the song \"I Can't Read\", released by David Bowie's Tin Machine in their 1989 debut album and re-released by Bowie in 1997 for the soundrack of the movie The Ice Storm, the phrase is used in direct reference to Andy Warhol: \"Andy, where's my 15 minutes?\" \nThe age of reality television has seen the comment wryly updated as: \"In the future, everyone will be obscure for 15 minutes.\"  The British artist Banksy has made a sculpture of a TV that has, written on its screen, \"In the future, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes,\"  which was later used in the lyrics of Robbie Williams' song \"The Actor\" from his 2006 album Rudebox.\n\nA more recent adaptation of Warhol's quip, possibly prompted by the rise of online social networking, blogging, and internet celebrity, is the claim that \"In the future, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\" or, in some renditions, \"On the Web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\".  This quote, though attributed to David Weinberger, was said to have originated with the Scottish artist Momus.\n\nThe Marilyn Manson song \"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\", released on his 1998 album Mechanical Animals, alludes to the term in the line \"We're rehabbed and we're ready for our fifteen minutes of shame\", as part of the song's theme of unrepentant escapism through drugs.\n\nAlso the group Queensryche uses the words \"I guess Warhol wasn't wrong / Fame fifteen Minutes Long\" in their famous 1988 anti-hero telltale album Operation: Mindcrime song, as a way of showing the deterioration of society to reach its aim.\nQuestion:\nWho said that in the future everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes?\nAnswer:\nAndy Warhaul\nPassage:\nmap coordinates News and Photos | Perez Hilton\nmap coordinates News and Photos | Perez Hilton\nFiled under: Brad Pitt • Angelina Jolie • Love Line\nJust as we suspected!\nWhen Angelina Jolie recently debuted her latest tattoo, which is a new set of coordinates under the list of those she already has inked on her arm which represent the birthplaces of her children, many speculated that the actress was once again adopting, but actually, it's just in honor of her man!\nShe explains:\n\"Well if they know that it's latitude and longitude they would have figured out quickly that it was Brad 's birthplace.

The plot involves a grandson switching souls with his grandfather by means of an accident.\n\nPlot\n\nJack Watson (George Burns) is a millionaire playboy and businessman who is about to turn 81 years old just as his grandson David (Charlie Schlatter) is about to turn 18, but Jack laments his old age and wishes to get back to his teens once more. When an accident switches their souls, Jack gets to live his grandson's life and all that it entails: school, sports and romance. Unfortunately, David gets the \"short end of the deal,\" as not only is he trapped in his grandfather's 81-year-old body, but he is also in a coma. The only one who knows the truth is his longtime friend Charlie (Red Buttons), whom Jack was able to convince by recounting experiences only they knew.\n\nJack gets to approach his family from a fresh point of view and doesn't always like what he sees: he's been a distant parent for his son Arnie (Tony Roberts) and has repeatedly disregarded his ideas for improving the family company. The college fraternity that he coerced David into joining (his old alma mater) is bullying him on a regular basis and forcing him to write their test finals for them. He also finds out that his trophy wife Madeline (Anita Morris) is unfaithful when she tries to seduce him, whom she thinks is her young step-grandson. Deciding to set things right, Jack in David's body decides to take charge by convincing his father (or rather, Jack's son) to implement his ideas on the family business and uses his poker playing skills to beat the frat boys while betting $1000 that he will beat the lead frat boy Russ in the upcoming track meet. Jack also impresses a girl named Robin, who is taken with David's old-fashioned style with bow ties and his vividly recounting the Second World War and meeting President Truman.\n\nHowever, Jack realizes too late that he has willed everything to Madeline, who convinces Arnie and his wife to disconnect Jack's 81-year-old body from life support. Knowing that this will kill David, Jack and Charlie rush to the hospital to prevent this,wheeling Jack's body away. When they crash in the hospital chapel, Jack and David's minds are returned to their rightful bodies, and Jack awakens. Jack still has unfinished business, as in David's body he challenged the fraternity president to a race, and now David must face him. Jack gives David a pep talk, and David beats the frat president. Jack then encourages David to pursue an interested Robin. In private, Jack tells Arnie that his greatest mistake was trying to get him and David to relive his own life, and encourages Arnie to nurture David's interest in art, which Jack will do as well by getting David involved in the graphic design aspect of the family business. Finally, Jack confronts Madeline by saying he knows that she made a pass at David, and that he has rewritten his will to include his family and his faithful butler Horton (Bernard Fox), whom he promptly orders to have Madeline thrown out. Robin and David start their relationship\n\nCast\n\n* Charlie Schlatter as David Watson/Jack Watson\n* George Burns as Jack Watson\n* Tony Roberts as Arnold 'Arnie' Watson\n* Miriam Flynn as  Betty Watson\n* Red Buttons as Charlie\n* Anita Morris as Madeline\n* Pauly Shore as Barrett\n* Jennifer Runyon as Robin Morrison\n\nReception \n\nRoger Ebert gives the film a score of 1 and a half out of 4. He compares it to Like Father Like Son and Vice Versa, calling Vice Versa the best of the three, by far. \nJanet Maslin was critical of the film for leaving George Burns in a coma when he is who the audience came to see, and says that it \"isn't successfully aimed at anyone in particular\". \n\nNote \n\n*The movie plays on a musical hit George Burns had in 1980 entitled \"I wish I was eighteen again\".\n*This movie makes many references to Harry Truman, who was Jack Watson's friend.  Truman was born in 1884 and died in 1972.  Assuming the movie took place in the same year it was released (1988), Jack Watson would have been born in 1907, a good 23 years after Truman.\nQuestion:\n\"Which US actor/comedian originally sung \"\"I Wish I Was Eighteen Again\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nGeorge Burns\nPassage:\nList of cities in the United Kingdom\nThis is a list of official cities in the United Kingdom as of 2015. It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).\n\nHistory\n\nThe initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the \"28 Cities\" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after  830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.\n\nThe title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional \"cities\" still not formally chartered as such.\n\nBeginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal \"cities\" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a \"local metropolitan character\"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester's successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor's status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester's title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add \"city\" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority. \n\nThe cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities \"by ancient usage\" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891. Dundee was granted letters patent in 1889 and Elgin and Perth were recognized as cities by the Home Office in 1972, before the privilege was removed by the Scottish Local Government Act of 1973.Clark, M. Lynda & al. [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10811.htm \"Committee on Privileges Second Report\", Appendix 3, ss58]. Parliament of the United Kingdom (London), 1999.\n\nIn Ireland, only the seat of the primate at Armagh was accorded city status by ancient usage, and this status was abolished by the Irish Municipal Corporations Act of 1840. All other cities have been those explicitly recognized as such.\n\nList of cities\n\nMap of the cities\n\nBritish Overseas Territories\n\nThere are a number of cities in the British Overseas Territories, such as the City of James Town on Saint Helena.

By war's end, the B-17 Flying Fortress was a mainstay in both the Pacific and European Theaters of War. The system became the symbol of American bomber might in the Second World War and continues with its legendary status even today. Incidentally, the name \"Flying Fortress\" is purported to have come from one of the reporters present during the unveiling of the machine at the Boeing plant, remarking as to how the aircraft looked like a 15-ton \"flying fortress\".\nDesigned to a US requirement for a four-engine bomber capable of long distance travel with a full 2,000lb bombload and reach speeds between 200 and 250 miles per hour. The result was the Boeing Model 229 which first flew in 1934, though was later lost to pilot error. Nevertheless, the US Army Air Corps pursued the design with an order for further developmental models fitted with differing powerplants. Early B-17 models were mostly developmental production variants that included the additions of seal-sealing fuel tanks, better armor protection and a redesigned tail. The initial definitive Flying Fortress model would arrive with 512 examples of the B-17E model which were the first to incorporated the twin .50 caliber tail armament for defense. This model was followed by the similar B-17F models of which 3,405 were produced. This latter model featured revised defensive armament positions. Often regarded as the ultimate B-17 production model, the B-17G featured the identifiable and effective Bendix powered chin turret fitted with 2 x 12.7mm machine guns under the nose. Revised turbochargers and an increase to 13 .50 caliber machine guns also arrived with this G model. In the end, the B-17G would account for over 8,600 units with production split between Boeing (4,035 samples), Douglas (2,395 samples) and Lockheed Vega (2,250 samples).\nB-17 Flying Fortresses followed common practice in that they flew in what was known as the \"box formation\". This formation allowed every gunner on board the aircraft to bring their guns to bear to any position needed. Gunner positions on the B-17 included a top turret gunner manning 2 x 12.7mm machine guns, a tail gunner manning 2 x 12.7mm machine guns, a belly gunner manning 2 x 12.7mm machine guns, 2 x cheek gun emplacements, staggered waist gunner positions each manning a single 12.7mm machine gun and the Bendix chin turret. A limited-arc-of-fire, single 12.7mm machine gun position at the radio operators area was available in early models but later removed. The flight engineer doubled as the top turret gunner while the bombardier and navigator in the nose section doubled as front gunners. The belly turret gunner was generally of a small stature to be able to fit into the limited-space turret system.  All positions were afforded some type of built-in armor protection but this varied extensively by position.\nThe bombardier and navigator were awarded the best views of the sky through the large plexiglas nose. The bombardier sat on a type of swiveling stool with the fabled Norden Bombsight before him. The navigator sat off-set to his rear at a small map-filled desk. Both were supplied with defensive .50 caliber machine guns with the Bendix chin turret under the bombardiers control in the G model and onwards. Access to the nose was accomplished through a smallish passage way underneath the main flight deck.\nQuestion:\nName the manufactureers of the American World war II bomber the Flying Fortress\nAnswer:\nBoeing Aircraft of Canada\nPassage:\nLonely This Christmas\n\"Lonely This Christmas\" is a popular Christmas song by the English glam rock band Mud, that \ntopped the UK Singles Chart in 1974,  selling over 750,000 copies and reached Christmas number one.\n\nSong\n\nWritten and produced by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, \"Lonely This Christmas\" was Mud's second number one single in the UK, spending four weeks at the top in December 1974 and January 1975.  It was the third number one single that year for the ChinniChap writing and production team, and was performed in the style of Elvis Presley's slower songs from his later career.\n\nPerformances\n\nThe song is noted for a performance on Top of the Pops in which guitarist Rob Davis was covered in tinsel and wore Christmas baubles as earrings, while vocalist Les Gray sang to a ventriloquist's dummy.\n\nVersions\n\nThe song has been covered by Lucky Soul, Blue, Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine (fan club limited edition Xmas 7 inch), Little Man Tate, KT Tunstall and Los Campesinos!.

They compete in the Belarusian Premier League, of which they are the reigning champions, and are the league's most successful club with 12 titles, ten consecutively. They have also won 3 Belarusian Cups and 4 Belarusian Super Cups.\n\nBATE are the only Belarusian team to have qualified for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League (2008–09, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2014–15 and 2015–16) and one of two to qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League (2009–10 and 2010–11) along with Dinamo Minsk.\n\nTheir home stadium is Borisov Arena, which was opened in 2014. \n\nHistory \n\nBATE is an acronym of Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electronics. The team was founded in 1973 and managed to win Belarusian SSR league three times (1974, 1976 and 1979) before being disbanded in 1984. The club was re-established in 1996. Since then, BATE have won the Belarusian Premier League eleven times and competed in UEFA competitions. \n\nIn 2001, BATE reached the first round of the UEFA Cup, their first appearance in the competition beyond the qualifying rounds. 2008 saw BATE becoming the first Belarusian team to qualify for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League. \nAs of 2015, BATE have played five times in UEFA Champions League group stage, as well as twice in UEFA Europa League group stage, also reaching the knock-out phase of the latter competition in 2010–11 and 2012–13 seasons.\n\nNotable former players of BATE include Alexander Hleb (Stuttgart, Arsenal, Barcelona, and Birmingham City) he has since returned to the club and currently plays for them, Vitali Kutuzov (Milan, Sporting CP, Avellino, Sampdoria, Parma, Pisa, and Bari) and Yuri Zhevnov (FC Moscow, and Zenit St. Petersburg).

The Gideon Bible is not some special version or translation of the Bible that hotels really like (the books are usually plain old King James Versions); they're named for the group that distributes them.\nGideons International got its start in 1898, when two traveling businessmen, John H. Nicholson and Samuel E. Hill, arrived at the crowded Central Hotel in Boscobel, Wisconsin, for the night.\nThe two had never met, but there was only one double room left, so they decided to share it. The men got to talking and found they shared a common faith and had both toyed with the idea of creating an evangelical association for Christian businessmen.\nThey decided to give it a shot together. They called a meeting the following year for men who were interested in joining together for “mutual recognition, personal evangelism, and united service for the Lord.” Only one other person showed up to that meeting—William J. Knights, who suggested they name their organization after Gideon, an Old Testament judge who led a small band of men to defeat a much larger army.\nAs the group expanded in its first few years, most of the new members were men who frequently traveled for work and spent many of their nights in hotel rooms. They wondered how they might be more effective witnesses for Christ on the road, and hit upon the idea of providing Bibles to hotels. They could be used not only by the Gideons’ members as they traveled around the country, but also borrowed by other guests in need of them. They started with the Superior Hotel in Superior, Montana, then set out to put a Bible in every hotel room in America. Since 1908, they’ve distributed more than 1.7 billion Bibles, expanding beyond the U.S. to more than 190 other countries.\nPassing Them Out\nThe Gideons don’t go room to room themselves, slipping the books in nightstands like Bible elves. When a hotel opens, local Gideons members will present a Bible to the hotel's general manager in a small ceremony and then give enough books for each room and some extras to the housekeeping staff for distribution. In addition to hotel rooms, the Gideons also give Bibles to military bases, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and to students on college campuses.\nEach Bible handed out is free of charge, and the project is funded entirely by donations to the group. The Gideons will also replace any books that go missing or get worn out, and the group says that the books have a six-year life expectancy, on average. They don’t get bent out of shape when people ignore the “thou shalt not steal” rule when it comes to the Bibles, either. They’d rather you just take the book if you need it that badly.\nBased on the success of the Gideons’ Bible project -- the group’s own statistics claim 25% of the people who check into a hotel room will read the Bible placed there -- other religious groups have begun distributing their own free literature to hotels. The Marriott hotel chain, founded by a Mormon, places the The Book of Mormon in many of its rooms, and many hotels also offer Buddhist, Hindu, Christian Scientist or Scientologist books along with the standard Gideon Bible.\nQuestion:\nWhat first started appearing in hotel rooms in 1908?\nAnswer:\nGideon Bible\nPassage:\nI'll Never Fall in Love Again\n\"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" is a popular song by the composer Burt Bacharach and the lyricist Hal David. Originally written for the 1968 musical Promises, Promises, the song's narrator ruminates on the various troubles that falling in love brings. The song charted at #93 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 during the summer of 1969.  The song was nominated for Song of the Year in the 1969 Grammy awards.\n\nIn January 1970, the song was a number six hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and a number-one hit for three weeks on the Easy Listening chart for Dionne Warwick.  Warwick's version, arranged and produced by Bacharach and recorded in 1969 with the session musician Gary Chester on drums, also reached number three on the Canadian Chart and crossed over into the Top 20 R&B Chart and became an international million seller. It also spent four weeks at number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.  Warwick's album of the same name containing the single won a 1971 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female.\n\nThe song has charted with various other artists. Bobbie Gentry's reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for a single week in October 1969.  Ella Fitzgerald's became a minor hit in September 1969 and charted briefly.

He was born there on 25 December 1642 (old calendar). At that time it was a yeoman's farmstead, principally rearing sheep.\n\nNewton returned here in 1666 when Cambridge University closed due to the plague, and here he performed many of his most famous experiments, most notably his work on light and optics. This is also said to be the site where Newton, observing an apple fall from a tree, was inspired to formulate his law of universal gravitation.\n\nNow in the hands of the National Trust and open to the public all year round, it is presented as a typical seventeenth century yeoman's farmhouse (or as near to that as possible, taking into account modern living, health and safety requirements and structural changes that have been made to the house since Newton's time).\n\nNew areas of the house, once private, were opened up to the public in 2003, with the old rear steps (that once led up to the hay loft and grain store and often seen in drawings of the period) being rebuilt, and the old walled kitchen garden, to the rear of the house, being restored.\n\nOne of the former farmyard buildings has been equipped so that visitors can have hands-on experience of the physical principles investigated by Newton in the house.\n\nThe village\n\nWoolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth (not to be confused with Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir also in Lincolnshire) has grown from a hamlet of several houses in the seventeenth century to a small village of several hundred houses today; much of the original land once owned by Woolsthorpe Manor was sold to a nearby family, and some of the immediate open land has since been built upon.

It may be named after Philippe, duc de Mornay (1549–1623), Governor of Saumur and seigneur du Plessis-Marly, writer and diplomat, but a cheese sauce at his table would have to have been based on what we would term a velouté sauce, for Béchamel had not yet been concocted.\n\nSauce Mornay does not appear in Le cuisinier Royal, 10th edition, 1820. Perhaps sauce Mornay is not older than the great Parisian restaurant of the 19th century, Le Grand Véfour in the arcades of the Palais-Royal, where sauce Mornay was introduced.  \n\nIn the Tout-Paris of Charles X, the Mornay name was represented by two stylish men, the marquis de Mornay and his brother, styled comte Charles. They figure in Lady Blessington's memoir of a stay in Paris in 1828–29, The Idler in France. They might also be considered, when an eponym is sought for sauce Mornay.\nQuestion:\nIf a dish is described as ‘Mornay’ what is it served with?\nAnswer:\nCheese Sauce\nPassage:\nThe Perfect Fool\nThe Perfect Fool is an opera in one act with music and libretto by the English composer Gustav Holst. Holst composed the work over the period of 1918 to 1922. The opera received its premiere at the Covent Garden Theatre, London on 14 May 1923. Holst had originally asked Clifford Bax to write the libretto, but Bax declined. \n\nIn the score, Holst pokes fun at the works of Verdi, Wagner's Parsifal  and Debussy. In the opera, the part of the Fool consists of only one word. One interpretation of possible symbolism of the opera, from Donald Tovey, is that the Princess symbolises the world of opera and the Fool represents the British public.\n\nThe opera was not a success, and audiences had found the story confusing.  Although the opera did receive a live BBC broadcast a year after its premiere,  revivals of the work have been rare. In 1995, Vernon Handley conducted a performance of the complete opera for the BBC, broadcast on 25 December. \n\nBallet music\n\nThe introductory ballet music is much more often performed, separately as a suite. The ballet music falls into the following sections:\n* Andante (invocation)\n* Dance of Spirits of Earth (Moderato – Andante)\n* Dance of Spirits of Water (Allegro)\n* Dance of Spirits of Fire (Allegro moderato – Andante)\nThemes from the ballet music recur throughout the remainder of the opera. \n\nRoles\n\nInstrumentation\n\n*Woodwind: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, english horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons and a contrabassoon\n*Brass: 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in C, 3 trombones (2 tenor and 1 bass) and a tuba\n*Keyboards: a celesta\n*Percussion: 3 timpani, a bass drum, cymbals (suspended and clash), a tam-tam, sleigh bells, a tambourine and a xylophone.\n*Strings: a harp, 1st and 2nd violins, violas, violoncellos, and double basses\nQuestion:\n\"Which English composer wrote \"\"The Planets\"\", \"\"Somerset Rhapsody\"\" and the ballet \"\"The Perfect Fool\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nGustav von holst\nPassage:\nCastro sworn in - Feb 16, 1959 - HISTORY.com\nCastro sworn in - Feb 16, 1959 - HISTORY.com\nCastro sworn in\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nOn February 16, 1959, Fidel Castro is sworn in as prime minister of Cuba after leading a guerrilla campaign that forced right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile. Castro, who became commander in chief of Cuba’s armed forces after Batista was ousted on January 1, replaced the more moderate Miro Cardona as head of the country’s new provisional government.\nCastro was born in the Oriente province in eastern Cuba, the son of a Spanish immigrant who had made a fortune building rail systems to transport sugar cane. He became involved in revolutionary politics while a student and in 1947 took part in an abortive attempt by Dominican exiles and Cubans to overthrow Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo . In the next year, he took part in urban riots in Bogota, Colombia. The most outstanding feature of his politics during the period was his anti-American beliefs; he was not yet an overt Marxist.\nIn 1951, he ran for a seat in the Cuban House of Representatives as a member of the reformist Ortodoxo Party, but General Batista seized power in a bloodless coup d’etat before the election could be held.\nVarious groups formed to oppose Batista’s dictatorship, and on July 26, 1953, Castro led some 160 rebels in an attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba–Cuba’s second largest military base. Castro hoped to seize weapons and announce his revolution from the base radio station, but the barracks were heavily defended, and more than half his men were captured or killed.\nCastro was himself arrested and put on trial for conspiring to overthrow the Cuban government. During his trial, he argued that he and his rebels were fighting to restore democracy to Cuba, but he was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\nTwo years later, Batista felt confident enough in his power that he granted a general amnesty for all political prisoners, including Castro. Castro then went with his brother Raul to Mexico , and they organized the revolutionary 26th of July Movement, enlisting recruits and joining up with Ernesto “Che” Guevara, an idealist Marxist from Argentina.\nOn December 2, 1956, Castro and 81 armed men landed on the Cuban coast. All of them were killed or captured except for Castro, Raul, Che, and nine others, who retreated into the Sierra Maestra mountain range to wage a guerrilla war against the Batista government. They were joined by revolutionary volunteers from all over Cuba and won a series of victories over Batista’s demoralized army. Castro was supported by the peasantry, to whom he promised land reform, while Batista received aid from the United States, which bombed suspected revolutionary positions.\nBy mid-1958, a number of other Cuban groups were also opposing Batista, and the United States ended military aid to his regime. In December, the 26th of July forces under Che Guevara attacked the city of Santa Clara, and Batista’s forces crumbled. Batista fled for the Dominican Republic on January 1, 1959. Castro, who had fewer than 1,000 men left at the time, took control of the Cuban government’s 30,000-man army. The other rebel leaders lacked the popular support the young and charismatic Castro enjoyed, and on February 16 he was sworn in as prime minister.\nThe United States initially recognized the new Cuban dictator but withdrew its support after Castro launched a program of agrarian reform, nationalized U.S. assets on the island, and declared a Marxist government. Many of Cuba’s wealthier citizens fled to the United States, where they joined the CIA in its efforts to overthrow Castro’s regime.\nIn April 1961, with training and support by the CIA, the Cuban exiles launched an ill-fated and unsuccessful invasion of Cuba known as the “Bay of Pigs.” The Soviet Union reacted to the attack by escalating its support to Castro’s communist government and in 1962 placed offensive nuclear missiles in Cuba. The discovery of the missiles by U.S. intelligence led to the tense “ Cuban Missile Crisis ,” which ended after the Soviets agreed to remove the weapons in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba.\nCastro’s Cuba was the first communist state in the Western Hemisphere, and he would retain control of it into the 21st century, outlasting 10 U.S. presidents who opposed him with economic embargoes and political rhetoric. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Castro lost a valuable source of aid, but he made up for it by courting European and Canadian investment and tourism. In July 2006, Castro temporarily ceded power to his brother Raul after undergoing intestinal surgery. His struggles with illness continued, and he officially stepped down in February 2008. Castro died on November 25, 2016, at 90.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nFrom whom did Castro seize power in 1959?\nAnswer:\nFulgencio Batista y Zaldívar\nPassage:\nNightjar\nNightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is Caprimulgus). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground.\n\nThe English word 'nightjar' originally referred to the European nightjar.\n\nNightjars are found around the world. They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, and feed predominantly on moths and other large flying insects.\n\nMost have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves. Some species, unusual for birds, perch along a branch, rather than across it. This helps to conceal them during the day.  Bracken is their preferred habitat.\n\nThe common poorwill,  Phalaenoptilus nuttallii is unique as a bird that undergoes a form of hibernation, becoming torpid and with a much reduced body temperature for weeks or months, although other nightjars can enter a state of torpor for shorter periods. \n\nNightjars lay one or two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground. It has been suggested that nightjars will move their eggs and chicks from the nesting site in the event of danger by carrying them in their mouths. This suggestion has been repeated many times in ornithology books, but while this may accidentally happen, surveys of nightjar research have found very little evidence to support this idea.  \n\nConservation challenge \n\nWorking out conservation strategies for some species of nightjar presents a particular challenge common to other hard-to-see families of birds; in a few cases, humans do not have enough data on whether a bird is rare or not. This has nothing to do with any lack of effort. It reflects, rather, the difficulty in locating and identifying a small number of those species of birds among the 10,000 or so that exist in the world, given the limitations of human beings. A perfect example is the Vaurie's nightjar in China's south-western Xinjiang. It has been seen for certain only once, in 1929, a specimen that was held in the hand. Surveys in the 1970s and 1990s failed to find it.  It is perfectly possible that it has evolved as a species that can really be identified in the wild only by other Vaurie's nightjars, rather than by humans. As a result, scientists do not know whether it is extinct, endangered, or even locally common.\n\nSystematics\n\nTraditionally, nightjars have been divided into three subfamilies: the Caprimulginae, or typical nightjars with about 80 species, and the Chordeilinae, or nighthawks of the New World with about 19 species. The two groups are similar in most respects, but the typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage.  In their pioneering DNA-DNA hybridisation work, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the genetic difference between the eared nightjars and the typical nightjars was, in fact, greater than that between the typical nightjars and the nighthawks of the New World. Accordingly, they placed the eared-nightjars in a separate family: Eurostopodidae, but the family has not yet been widely adopted.\n\nSubsequent work, both morphological and genetic, has provided support for the separation of the typical and the eared nightjars, and some authorities have adopted this Sibley-Ahlquist recommendation, and also the more far-reaching one to group all the owls (traditionally Strigiformes) together in the Caprimulgiformes. The listing below retains a more orthodox arrangement, but recognises the eared-nightjars as a separate group. For more detail and an alternative classification scheme, see Caprimulgiformes and Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy.\n\nSubfamily Chordeilinae (nighthawks) \n*Genus Nyctiprogne (2 species)\n*Genus Lurocalis (2 species)\n*Genus Chordeiles (6 species)\n\nSubfamily Caprimulginae — (typical nightjars) \n*Genus Nyctipolus – (2 species)\n*Genus Nyctidromus – (2 species)\n*Genus Phalaenoptilus – common poorwill\n*Genus Siphonorhis – (2 living species)\n*Genus Nyctiphrynus – (4 species)\n*Genus Caprimulgus – (40 species, including the European nightjar)\n*Genus Veles – brown nightjar \n*Genus Setopagis – (4 species)\n*Genus Gactornis – collared nightjar\n*Genus Antrostomus – (12 species)\n*Genus Hydropsalis – (4 species)\n*Genus Uropsalis (2 species)\n*Genus Macropsalis – long-trained nightjar\n*Genus Eleothreptus – (2 species)\n*Genus Systellura – band-winged nightjar\n\nSubfamily Eurostopodinae — (eared nightjars) \n*Genus Eurostopodus - (7 species)\n*Genus Lyncornis - (2 species)\n\nAlso see a list of nightjars, sortable by common and binomial names.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Lesser Nighthawk.jpg|Lesser nighthawk\nImage:Mlongipennis.png|Standard-winged nightjar\nImage:Nyctidromus albicollisDF28N04B1.jpg|Pauraque\nFile:Şivanxapînok.jpg|Nightjar\nQuestion:\nThe goatsucker is an alternative name for which bird?\nAnswer:\nNightjar\nPassage:\nHedonophobia\nHedonophobia is an excessive fear or aversion to obtaining pleasure.  The purported background of some such associated feelings may be due to an egalitarian-related sentiment, whereby one feels a sense of solidarity with individuals in the lowest Human Development Index countries.  For others, a recurring thought that some things are too good to be true has resulted in an ingrainedness that they are not entitled to feel too good.  The condition is relatively rare.  Sometimes, it can be triggered by a religious upbringing wherein asceticism is propounded.\nQuestion:\nHedonophobia is the irrational fear of ‘what’ that should be good for people?\nAnswer:\nPleasant\nPassage:\nUllapool\nUllapool (;  ,) \nis a town of around 1,500 inhabitants in Ross-shire, Scottish Highlands. Despite its small size it is the largest settlement for many miles around and a major tourist destination of Scotland.  The North Atlantic Drift passes Ullapool, bringing moderate temperatures. A few Cordyline australis or New Zealand cabbage trees are grown in the town and are often mistaken for palms.\n\nHistory\n\nOn the east shore of Loch Broom, Ullapool was founded in 1788 as a herring port by the British Fisheries Society.  It was designed by Thomas Telford.\nThe harbour is still the edge of the village, used as a fishing port, yachting haven, and ferry port. Ferries sail to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides.\n\nThe town was historically in Cromartyshire, a county made up of many physically-separated parcels of land scattered across northern Ross-shire. Cromartyshire was abolished and combined with surrounding Ross-shire in 1890.\n\nMany of the pivotal discoveries of the Victorian era that contributed to the development of the concept of plate tectonics were made in this area, and there are still regular international geological conferences.\n\nParliament granted permission in the 1890s for a railway from Ullapool to the main Highland network at Garve, but insufficient funds resulted in the scheme being abandoned.\n\nClimate\n\nUllapool has an oceanic climate, with mild temperatures year round.\n\nLandscape\n\nThe region surrounding Ullapool is dominated by rugged mountains, and especially by Bheinn Ghobblach to the west, An Teallach to the south west, Beinn Dearg to the south east close to the head of Loch Broom, and Ben Mhòr na Còigich to the north. An Teallach is a massive mountain which dominates the area and consists of Torridonian sandstone, which is layered nearly horizontally. It is an easy climb but is several miles from the nearest road, so a long trek is needed before the ascent begins. The walker will be rewarded by magnificent views of the surrounds, especially to the sea and the islands to the west, but also to the south, and the desolate Whitbread wilderness.\n\nCulture\n\nUllapool has a strong reputation as a centre for music, the arts and performance.\n\nThe town boasts a small museum housed in a Telford Church, An Talla Solais, an arts centre with frequently changing exhibitions and workshops, a swimming pool and fitness centre, and several pubs, bed and breakfasts, restaurants and hotels. It is a centre for walkers, wildlife enthusiasts and other holidaymakers and is situated in a spectacular and remote part of the United Kingdom. \n\nIn May every year there is the three-day Ullapool Book Festival which attracts a diverse range of writers and with work in both Scottish Gaelic and English. The Macphail Centre has a theatre hosting a regular programme of musical, dance and theatrical performances, many by the Scottish national companies but some work from smaller reps and travelling Edinburgh Fringe performers. Often the number of performances in any week will mean there is overspill to the Village Hall and other venues.\n\nIn July 2011, the Tall Ships visited Ullapool, a major event for the village and the surrounding area.\n\nUllapool is home to the shinty team Lochbroom Camanachd.\n\nMusic\n\nThroughout the year there are many small fèisean and music festivals in the local halls and hotels - especially in the Ceilidh Place and the Arch Inn. The Ullapool Guitar Festival takes place in early October every year, attracting high-calibre performers at several venues over the weekend. The Loopallu Festival, created by the American rockgrass band Hayseed Dixie and local promoter Robert Hicks in 2005,  was very well received and has become a major regional annual event, more than doubling the size of the village during the festival. In 2007 it attracted several bands including the Saw Doctors, Dreadzone and Franz Ferdinand headlining on the second night. There are also fringe events at local bars. The Pigeon Detectives have played the Village Hall. Amy MacDonald in 2008 and Paolo Nutini in 2007 both played the Ceilidh Place. Mumford & Sons have also played in Ullapool twice. \n\nUllapool also has its own radio station called Lochbroom FM on 102.2 and 96.8 FM, with programming provided mostly by Two Lochs Radio in Gairloch.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nUllapool is referenced in the multiplayer video game Team Fortress 2 as the hometown of the Demoman. \n\nIn the various X-men series of Marvel comics, the mutant werewolf Rahne Sinclair is from Ullapool.\nQuestion:\nThe port of Ullapool, in the Scottish highlands, lies on which loch?\nAnswer:\nLittle Loch Broom\nPassage:\nCahora Bassa Dam\nThe Cahora Bassa Dam is a dam in Mozambique. It is one of the three major dams on the Zambezi river system, the others being the Kariba and the Itezhi-Tezhi, the latter on the Kafue River, a tributary of the Zambezi.\n\nHistory\n\nThe dam began to fill in December 1974 after construction was commenced in 1969 by the Portuguese colonial government of Mozambique (Portugal), and is 171 m high by 303 m wide at the crest. Built in the first half of the 1970s when Mozambique was still a Portuguese territory, long stretches of the power transmission lines were sabotaged during 16 years of Mozambican Civil War which ended in 1992.\n\nThe lake has reached a maximum length and width of approximately 250 km and 38 km respectively, flooding an area of 2700 km2 with an average depth of . \n\nPower stations\n\nThe Cahora Bassa system is the largest hydroelectric scheme in southern Africa with the powerhouse containing five 415 MW turbines. Most of the power generated is exported to South Africa, which is done by the Cahora Bassa HVDC system, a set of High voltage direct current lines. The system includes two converter stations, one at Songo in Mozambique and the other at Apollo in South Africa. There are two parallel power lines between these two stations, covering 1,400 km, of which 900 km is in Mozambican territory. These HVDC lines work at 533 kV and in Mozambique territory only have about 4,200 towers.\nQuestion:\nOn which river is the Cabora Bassa dam situated?\nAnswer:\nZambesi\nPassage:\nBassist\nA bass player, or bassist, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for rock and roll, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country, reggae and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.\n\nDespite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some 1990s and 2000s rock and pop bands use a double bass, such as both Andrew Jackson Jihad, Barenaked Ladies; Indie band The Decemberists; and punk rock/psychobilly groups such as The Living End, Nekromantix, The Horrorpops, and Tiger Army. Some fusion jazz groups use a lightweight, stripped-down electric upright bass rather than a double bass. Some composers of modern art music use the electric bass in a chamber music setting. Some jazz big bands use electric bass. Some fusion, R&B and house music groups use synth bass or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. Some Dixieland bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba. In some jazz groups and jam bands, the basslines are played by a Hammond organ player, who uses the bass pedal keyboard or the lower manual for the low notes.\n\nElectric bass players \n\nElectric bassists play the bass guitar. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the bass line outlines the harmony of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.). Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each chord being used in a given song. In addition, pedal tones (repeated or sustained single notes), ostinatos, and bass riffs are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play chords (two or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially jazz, Latin and heavy metal music.\n\nA shortlist of some of the notable bassists includes: \n* Victor Bailey (Weather Report)\n* Michael \"Flea\" Balzary (Red Hot Chili Peppers)\n* Jo Bench (Bolt Thrower)\n* Jeff Berlin\n* Roger Waters (Pink Floyd)\n* John Deacon (Queen)\n* Nicky Wire (Manic Street Preachers)\n* Mike Dirnt (Green Day)\n* Jack Bruce (Cream)\n* Colin Greenwood (Radiohead)\n* Cliff Burton (Metallica)\n* Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse)\n* Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath, GZR, Ozzy Osbourne)\n* Nathan East (Eric Clapton, Fourplay, Phil Collins, Philip Bailey)\n* John Entwistle (The Who)\n* Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth)\n* Murdoc Niccals (Gorillaz)\n* Chris Squire (Yes)\n* Larry Graham (Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station)\n* Stuart Hamm (Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Frank Gambale)\n* James Jamerson (The Funk Brothers)\n* Joan Jett (The Runaways, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts)\n* Darryl Jones (Miles Davis, Peter Gabriel, Madonna, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton)\n* John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin, Them Crooked Vultures)\n* Peter Hook (Joy Division) (New Order) (Peter Hook and The Light)\n* Carol Kaye\n* Mark King\n* Mikey Way (My Chemical Romance)\n* Geddy Lee (Rush)\n* Paul McCartney (The Beatles, Wings)\n* Monk Montgomery (Wes Montgomery, Lionel Hampton, The Crusaders, Art Farmer)\n* Jason Newsted (Voivod, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne)\n* Pino Palladino (The Who, Roy Hargrove, Steve Gadd, Tony Bennett, Manu Katché)\n* Jaco Pastorius (Pat Metheny, Weather Report, Joni Mitchell)\n* John Patitucci (Chick Corea)\n* Pino Presti (Gerry Mulligan, Astor Piazzolla, Quincy Jones, Wilson Pickett, Shirley Bassey, Mina)\n* Chuck Rainey\n* Paul Simonon (The Clash)\n* Billy Sheehan (Niacin, Mr. Big, Steve Vai, David Lee Roth)\n* Sting (The Police)\n* Sid Vicious (Sex Pistols)\n* Bill Wyman (The Rolling Stones)\n* Steve Harris (Iron Maiden)\n\nDouble bass players\n\nClassical double bass players\n\nFor a long list, see the List of contemporary classical double bass players.\n\nA shortlist of notable double bass players includes:\n* Johannes Matthias Sperger (1750–1812) bassist, composer\n* Domenico Dragonetti (1763–1845) bassist, composer, conductor\n* Giovanni Bottesini (1821–1889) bassist, composer, conductor\n* Franz Simandl (1840–1912) bassist, composer, pedagogue\n* Edouard Nanny (1872–1943) bassist, composer, pedagogue\n* Serge Koussevitzky (1874–1951) bassist, conductor, composer\n* Gary Karr (1941–present) \n* Edgar Meyer (1960–present)\n\nJazz double-bass players\n\nFor a long list, see the List of jazz bassists, which includes both double bass and electric bass players.\n\nA shortlist of notable jazz bassists includes:\n\n* Jimmy Blanton\n* Paul Chambers\n* Jimmy Garrison\n* Ron Carter\n* Scott La Faro\n* Richard Davis\n* Ray Brown\n* George Mraz\n* Eddie Gómez\n* Terry Plumeri\n* Milt Hinton\n* Sam Jones\n* Charles Mingus\n* Esperanza Spalding\n* Billy Peterson\n\nPopular music double bass players\n\nFor a longer list, see the List of double bassists in popular music, which includes blues, folk, country, etc.\n\nA shortlist of the notable bassists in these genres includes:\n*Barry Bales\n*Herbie Flowers\n*Willie Dixon\n*Danny Thompson\n\n=\nQuestion:\nWho was the bass player and youngest member of the original line-up of Queen?\nAnswer:\nJohn Deacon\nPassage:\nLiberalization\nLiberalization  (or liberalisation) is a relaxation of government restrictions, usually in such areas of social, political and economic policy. This may be similar to deregulation.  Liberalization of autocratic regimes may precede democratization (or not, as in the case of the Prague Spring).\n\nIn law\n\nIn social policy, liberalization may refer to a relaxation of laws restricting, for example, divorce, abortion, or psychoactive drugs. Regarding civil rights, it may refer to the elimination of laws prohibiting homosexuality, property rights, private ownership of firearms, same-sex marriage, inter-racial marriage, or inter-faith marriage.\n\nIn economy and trade\n\nEconomic liberalization is often associated with privatization, which is the process of transferring ownership or outsourcing of a business, enterprise, agency, public service or public property from the public sector to the private sector. For example, the European Union has liberalized gas and electricity markets, instituting a competitive system. Some leading European energy companies such as France's EDF and Sweden's Vattenfall remain partially or completely in government ownership. Liberalized and privatized public services may be dominated by big companies, particularly in sectors with high capital, water, gas, or electricity costs. In some cases they may remain legal monopolies, at least for some segments of the market like consumers. Liberalization, privatization and stabilization are the Washington Consensus's trinity strategy for economies in transition.\n\nThere is also a concept of hybrid liberalization as, for instance, in Ghana, cocoa crops can be sold to competing private companies, but there is a minimum price for which it can be sold and all exports are controlled by the state. \n\nComparison with democratization\n\nThere is a distinct difference between liberalization and democratization. Liberalization can take place without democratization, and deals with a combination of policy and social change specialized to a certain issue, such as the liberalization of government-held property for private purchase. Democratization is politically specialized; it can arise from a liberalization but works on a broader level of governmental liberalization.\nQuestion:\nThe era of political liberalisation in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was called what?\nAnswer:\nThe Prague Spring\nPassage:\nBasilisk Mythology - The King of Serpents\nBasilisk Mythology - The King of Serpents\nContact\nBasilisk Mythology\nBasilisk mythology describes this \"king of serpents\" as a reptilian creature with sometimes rooster-like qualities who is famous for its ability to kill with a single glance.  Like its bird-lizard cousin, the Cockatrice, basilisks are said to be born from a union of serpents and roosters. \nPliny the Elder pretty much creates basilisk mythology altogether in his work \"Natural History\" from 79 A.D.  He describes a \"serpent called the basilisk\" of which \"all who behold its eyes, fall dead upon the spot\".\n \n \n[The basilisk] is produced in the province of Cyrene, being not more than twelve fingers in length. It has a white spot on the head, strongly resembling a sort of a diadem. When it hisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not advance its body, like the others, by a succession of folds, but moves along upright and erect upon the middle. It destroys all shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that it has breathed upon; it burns up all the grass too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerly a general belief that if a man on horseback killed one of these animals with a spear, the poison would run up the weapon and kill, not only the rider, but the horse as well. To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.\nQuestion:\nWhich mythological reptilian creature could kill with a single glance?\nAnswer:\nBasilisk\nPassage:\nPropolis\nPropolis or bee glue is a resinous mixture that honey bees produce by mixing saliva and beeswax with exudate gathered from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources. It is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Propolis is used for small gaps (approximately 6 mm or less), while larger spaces are usually filled with beeswax.  Its color varies depending on its botanical source, the most common being dark brown. Propolis is sticky at and above room temperature, 20 C. At lower temperatures, it becomes hard and very brittle.\n\nPurpose\n\nFor centuries, beekeepers assumed  that bees sealed the beehive with propolis to protect the colony from the elements, such as rain and cold winter drafts. However, 20th-century research has revealed that bees not only survive, but also thrive, with increased ventilation during the winter months throughout most temperate regions of the world.\n\nPropolis is now believed to: \n#reinforce the structural stability of the hive;\n#reduce vibration;\n#make the hive more defensible by sealing alternative entrances;\n#prevent diseases and parasites from entering the hive, and to inhibit fungal and bacterial growth; \n#prevent putrefaction within the hive. Bees usually carry waste out of and away from the hive. However, if a small lizard or mouse, for example, finds its way into the hive and dies there, bees may be unable to carry it out through the hive entrance. In that case, they would attempt instead to seal the carcass in propolis, essentially mummifying it and making it odorless and harmless.\n\nComposition\n\nThe composition of propolis varies from hive to hive, from district to district, and from season to season.  Normally, it is dark brown in color, but it can be found in green, red, black, and white hues, depending on the sources of resin found in the particular hive area. Honey bees are opportunists, gathering what they need from available sources, and detailed analyses show that the chemical composition of propolis varies considerably from region to region, along with the vegetation. In northern temperate climates, for example, bees collect resins from trees, such as poplars and conifers (the biological role of resin in trees is to seal wounds and defend against bacteria, fungi and insects). \"Typical\" northern temperate propolis has approximately 50 constituents, primarily resins and vegetable balsams (50%), waxes (30%), essential oils (10%), and pollen (5%). Propolis also contains persistent lipophilic acaricides, a natural pesticide that deters mite infestations. \n\nIn neotropical regions, in addition to a large variety of trees, bees may also gather resin from flowers in the genera Clusia and Dalechampia, which are the only known plant genera that produce floral resins to attract pollinators.  Clusia resin contains polyprenylated benzophenones.    In some areas of Chile, propolis contains viscidone, a terpene from Baccharis shrubs,  and in Brazil, naphthoquinone epoxide has recently been isolated from red propolis,  and prenylated acids such as 4-hydroxy-3,5-diprenyl cinnamic acid have been documented.  An analysis of propolis from Henan, China found sinapinic acid, isoferulic acid, caffeic acid, and chrysin, with the first three compounds demonstrating antibacterial properties.  Also, Brazilian red propolis, largely derived from Dalbergia ecastaphyllum plant resin, has high relative percentages of the isoflavonoids 3-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxypterocarpan and medicarpin.  Other flavonoids commonly present include galangin and pinocembrin.  Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is also a component of some varieties of propolis from New Zealand. \n\nOccasionally, worker bees will  even gather various caulking compounds of human manufacture, when the usual sources are more difficult to obtain. The properties of the propolis depend on the exact sources used by each individual hive; therefore any potential medicinal properties that may be present in one hive's propolis may be absent from another's, or from another sample in the same hive.\n\nMedical uses \n\nPropolis has been used in traditional medicines for thousands of years.  \n\nThe National Institutes of Health rates propolis as \"possibly effective\" for treating cold sores, genital herpes, and post-surgery mouth pain.  Propolis is also used to make cough drops for cough and throat irritation.  Currently, there is \"insufficient evidence\" to rate the effectiveness of propolis in treating other conditions. \n\nBiomedical research\n\nPropolis is being researched for the potential development of new drugs focusing on a variety of its properties, including those for possible immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic and anti-ulcer applications.\n\nOther uses \n\nMusical instruments\n\nPropolis is used by some string instrument makers (violin, viola, cello and bass) as a varnish ingredient. Some workers use it to seal the surface of newly made bridges. Propolis was purportedly used by Antonio Stradivari in the varnish of his instruments. \n\nFood\n\nPropolis is used by some chewing gum manufacturers to make propolis gum.\n\nCar wax\n\nPropolis is used to bring about a chemical reaction to convert fats and oils into automobile wax during application.\nQuestion:\nThe substance propolis is also known as ‘what’ glue?\nAnswer:\nAnthophila\nPassage:\nThe Midlands\nThe Midlands is an area spanning central England that broadly corresponds to the early medieval Kingdom of Mercia. It borders South East England, South West England, North West England, Yorkshire and Humber, East of England and Wales. Its largest city is Birmingham, and it was an important location for the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. The greater part of the area is now administered as the Government Office Regions of the West Midlands and East Midlands.\n\nExtent\n\nThe Midlands does not correspond to any current administrative area, and there is therefore no strict definition. However, it is generally considered to include the counties of Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, the West Midlands metropolitan boroughs and Worcestershire.\n\nWith more restricted boundaries than the traditional area known as the Midlands, two modern Government Office Regions together represent the latter: West Midlands and East Midlands. These are also constituencies of the European Parliament.\n\nThe West Midlands region comprises the shire counties of (1) Staffordshire, (2) Warwickshire and (3) Worcestershire (with their respective districts), the unitary counties of (4) Herefordshire and (5) Shropshire, the metropolitan boroughs of (6) Birmingham, (7) Coventry, (8) Dudley, (9) Sandwell, (10) Solihull, (11) Walsall and (12) Wolverhampton, and the unitary boroughs of (13) Stoke-on-Trent and (14) Telford and Wrekin. The East Midlands region comprises the shire counties of (15) Derbyshire, (16) Leicestershire, (17) Lincolnshire, (18) Northamptonshire and (19) Nottinghamshire (with their respective districts) and the unitary county of (20) Rutland. The two regions have a combined population of 10,135,000 (2011 census), and an area of 11,053 sq mi (28,631 km²).\n\nThe largest Midlands conurbation, which includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton, is approximately covered by the metropolitan county (which also includes the city of Coventry) of the West Midlands. Parts of the East Midlands are also densely populated, particularly the triangle formed by the cities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, which also includes sizeable towns such as Loughborough and the Long Eaton–Beeston–Stapleford subconurbation.\n\nVarious part of the Midlands (particularly Warwickshire and Leicestershire) are somewhat poetically referred to as the Heart of England, especially in tourist literature.\n\nThe various areas of the Midlands have their own distinctive character, giving rise to a high number of local history and industrial heritage groups. Nottingham played a notable part in the English Civil War, which is commemorated in a number of place names (Parliament Terrace, Parliament Street, Standard Hill). Areas such as Derbyshire's Amber Valley  and Erewash combine attractive countryside with industrial heritage and are home to historic canals and sites associated with the mining industry. The Black Country, broadly the boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton and Walsall, played an important part in the Industrial Revolution. \n\nGeography\n\nThe Midlands are predominantly low-lying and flat in character, although isolated hills such as Turners Hill have extensive views. Upland areas lie in the west and north of the region with the Shropshire Hills to the west, close to the Welsh border, and the Peak District area of the southern Pennines in the north of the region. The Shropshire Hills reach heights of over 500 m, including the Long Mynd, Clee Hills and Stiperstones ridge. Wenlock Edge, running through the middle of the Shropshire Hills AONB, is a long, low ridge, which extends for over 15 mi.  The Peak District reaches heights of between 300 m and 600 m with Kinder Scout being the highest point at 636 m.  Further south, the Welsh border reaches over 700 m high, at Black Mountain, which is thus the highest point in Herefordshire.\n\nOther small areas of lower hills in the Midlands include Cannock Chase in the Staffordshire, the Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire and the Lincolnshire Wolds in Lincolnshire.\n\nThe Cotswolds extend over 90 mi, and over six counties (Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Warwickshire and Worcestershire), but centred on Gloucestershire. They reach 330 m high at Cleeve Hill, and were designated an AONB in 1966. \n\nThe Malverns are made from some of the oldest rock in England (around 680 million years old) and extend some 13 km (8 miles) through two West Midlands counties Worcestershire and Herefordshire as well as northern Gloucestershire in the southwest. The highest point of the hills is the Worcestershire Beacon at 425 metres (1,394 ft) above sea level (OS Grid reference SO768452). \n\nClimate\n\nThe Midlands has a temperate maritime climate, with cold, cloudy, wet winters and comfortable, mostly dry, mostly sunny summers.  The temperature usually ranges from  during winter nights to  during summer days. Due to its geographical location, which is furthest away from the coast than anywhere else in England, it typically receives mostly light winds, with warm days and cold nights. Sometimes the Midlands can have very colds nights such as a minimum of  in Pershore on 20 December 2010. The previous day had a maximum of only , also in Pershore. Hot days are also possible, such as a maximum of 34 C in Pershore on 19 July 2006. There can also be very mild winters nights, such as in Bidford-on-Avon when the temperature at 6 pm was as high as  on the 9 January 2015. At 8 am the following morning the temperature was still at 13 C.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the largest city in the Midlands region of England?\nAnswer:\nCounty Borough of Birmingham\nPassage:\nSara Keays\nSara Keays (pron. \"Keys\", born 1 June 1947) was the personal secretary of British Conservative politician Cecil Parkinson. The two became lovers, and Keays' public revelation of her pregnancy and of their twelve-year-long affair led to his resignation as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the government of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nParkinson's resignation\n\nParkinson was forced to resign on 14 October 1983 after it was revealed that Keays was bearing his child, Flora Keays.  Subsequently, as a result of a dispute over child maintenance payments, Parkinson (with Keays' initial consent) was able to gain an injunction in 1993, forbidding the British media from making any reference to their daughter.\n\nAt the time of the revelation of Parkinson's relationship with Sara Keays in 1983, Parkinson made much of what he described as the volume of supportive letters which he had received. Keays was attacked by many in the Conservative Party, such as Edwina Currie, who branded Keays \"a cow\" for destroying Parkinson's ministerial career.  By 2001, however, the media focused more upon Flora and her difficulties than in protecting Parkinson's reputation, so more voices were raised in criticism of Parkinson. \n\nKeays published her own book about the controversy, A Question of Judgement, in 1985.\n\nDaughter\n\nFlora Keays (born 31 December 1983 in Merton, Greater London) has learning disabilities and Asperger syndrome, and had an operation to remove a brain tumour when she was four.\n\nThe court order was the subject of some controversy until its expiry when Flora Keays turned 18 at the end of 2001. It was noted in the press that Parkinson had never met her and presumably had no intention of doing so. While he had financially assisted with Flora's education and upkeep, it was publicly pointed out that he had never sent her a birthday card and that her mother assumed that Flora could never expect to receive one. \n\nIn January 2002, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary film on Sara and Flora Keays.  In it Flora said: “I would like to see him. If he loved me, he would want to see me and be in my everyday life... I think my father has behaved very badly towards me. I feel jealous that my mother has known him but I haven’t, and jealous of other people who go on holiday with their fathers, when I don’t.” Sara Keays is shown telling her daughter that her father has never seen her because \"he didn't want anything to do with us.\"\n\nSara Keays, who was forced to educate her daughter at home, and encouraged her in ballet, gymnastics, horseriding and trampolining, said Lord Parkinson's reappointment by William Hague as Tory party chairman caused the youngster problems when she finally secured a place at a secondary school: \"It was torture for her. She was bullied, just because somebody thought it was necessary for him to have his job back, basically\", she said. \n\nSpeaking ahead of the film, Sara Keays angrily denied that she fell pregnant to trap her lover and attacked Downing Street and Conservative Central Office for conducting a \"very powerful and all pervasive disinformation campaign\" to discredit her at the time.\n\nPublications\n\nMemoirs\n\n*\n\nFiction\n\n*\nQuestion:\nWhich Cabinet minister fathered Flora Keays by his secretary?\nAnswer:\nCecil Parkinson\n", "answers": ["Richard Burton", "Richard Walter Jenkins", "Richard Burton (actor)"], "length": 7151, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f1cf5033f1022a49b43c20ceacd71cd7f02011b455420013"}

Known for his signature raspy voice, Stewart performed in several U.K. bands in the 1960s. Embarking on a solo career, \"Maggie May\" became his first hit single in 1971. Moving to the U.S. in 1975, Stewart's hit songs included \"Tonight's the Night\" (1976) and \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" (1978). He experienced a career lull during the 1980s and only had a few hits in the 1990s, but came back strong singing the classics in the 2000s, winning a Grammy Award for best traditional pop vocal album in 2004.\nEarly Life and Career\nSinger-songwriter Rod Stewart was born Roderick David Stewart on January 10, 1945, in London, England. Born into a working-class family, Stewart excelled at soccer. He worked a series of odd jobs, including working as a grave digger, before his singing career took off.\nDuring the 1960s, Stewart was a part of several different bands. In 1966, he joined the blues-influenced Jeff Beck Group and experienced his first taste of success. The group toured the United Kingdom and the United States and released two hit albums. In 1969, he joined what became known as the Faces. Ron Wood was one of his bandmates and became a member of the Rolling Stones. Stewart also performed as a solo artist and scored his first big solo success with the album Every Picture Tells A Story, which featured the hit single \"Maggie May\" in 1971. That same year, the Faces had a hit with the song \"Stay With Me.\"\nCareer Highlights\nStewart moved to the United States in 1975. The next year, he reached the top of the U.S. charts with \"Tonight's the Night\" from A Night on the Town. Stewart continued to have a slicker, more pop sound as the decade progressed. He also developed a reputation for his partying lifestyle and for dating numerous actresses and models. With 1978's Blondes Have More Fun, he had another smash hit single with \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\"\nThe 1980s proved to be more challenging for Stewart. While 1981's Tonight I'm Yours went platinum, the albums that followed did not fare as well. He ended the decade on a positive note, however. His remake of the Tom Waits song \"Downtown Train\" in 1989 received a lot of radio play. A few years later, he released Unplugged and Seated (1993), which was recorded at MTV Unplugged concert and featured the hit \"Have I Told You Lately.\"\nWith his distinctive throaty, almost scratchy-sounding voice, Stewart decided to take on some of the classic songs and make them his own with It Had to be You: The Great American Songbook (2002). He recorded four volumes of the Great American Songbook series, and won his first Grammy Award (best traditional pop vocal album) for Stardust: The Great American Songbook, Volume III in 2004.\nLater Years\nAt the age of 60, Stewart became a father for seventh time. His son, Alastair Wallace Stewart, was born on November 27, 2005. This was his first child with then fiancée Penny Lancaster. The couple married in 2007 and welcomed a second son, Aiden, in 2011. He also has a daughter, Kimberly, and a son, Sean, from his first wife Alana Stewart and a daughter named Ruby with former girlfriend Kelly Emberg. He also has two children from his marriage to model Rachel Hunter—Renee and Liam. Stewart publicly acknowledged his oldest daughter, Sarah Streeter, in 2013. Streeter was born when Stewart was only 18 years old, and he and the girl's mother had decided to put their baby up for adoption. Stewart and Streeter first met in 2008.\nIn 2006, Stewart returned to rock music with Still The Same: Great Rock Classics of Our Time. The album reached the top of the pop charts in October of that year. Stewart put down the microphone and picked up a pen to write his 2012 memoir Rod: The Autobiography. The following year, he made an impressive return to songwriting with his album Time. Stewart co-wrote of many of the record's songs as well as serving as a co-producer on the project.\nFact Check\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

Bay comes from  \"Old French baee,\" meaning an opening or hole. \n\nExamples \n\n# The spaces between posts, columns, or buttresses in the length of a building, the division in the widths being called aisles. This meaning also applies to overhead vaults (between ribs), in a building using a vaulted structural system. For example, the Gothic architecture period's Chartres Cathedral has a nave (main interior space) that is  \"seven bays long.\"  Similarly in timber framing a bay is the space between posts in the transverse direction of the building and aisles run longitudinally.\"Bay\", n.3. def. 1-6 and \"Bay\", n.5 def 2. Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009\n# The openings for windows in a wall. For example, in Georgian style, at Mulberry Fields, the building is described as a  \"5 bay by 2 bay facade,\"  meaning a  \"5 windows by 2 windows\"  exterior.\n# A recess in a wall, such as a bay window.\n# A division of space such as an animal stall, sick bay, or bay platform.\n# The space between joists or rafters, a joist bay or rafter bay.\nQuestion:\nJalousie, Bay and Palladian are all types of what?\nAnswer:\nWindows (operating system)\nPassage:\nNetto (store)\nNetto is a Danish discount supermarket operating in Denmark, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and, via joint venture, in the United Kingdom. In August 2016, the venture will end, as cooperation has ended with Sainsbury's. Netto is owned by Dansk Supermarked Group, which in turn is 19% owned by the Maersk Group.   Netto also operates an express version of the store in Denmark, known as \"Døgn Netto\" (\"(24 hour) Day Netto\"). Døgn stores offer the same service as regular Netto stores, with longer opening hours and higher prices.\n\nGeographic coverage\n\nAs of November 2014, Netto had stores in the following countries: \n\nDenmark\n\nThe first Netto store opened in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1981. At first, the items sat in boxes and on pallets, but the chain quickly expanded, and the service level increased as well. Today, there are 442 stores.\n \n\nGermany\n\nIn September 1990, Netto started an internationalisation process, and Germany was the second country to gain Netto stores. The first store was opened in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, not long after the Fall of the Wall.\n\nNetto has since expanded in the states of Brandenburg, Berlin, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein, and there are an total of more than 340 stores by December 2014.In Germany, a second chain of stores (with over 4100 stores), called Netto Marken-Discount and owned by EDEKA has also been in operation since 1984. The two chains are unrelated to each other.\n\nPoland\n\nThe first Netto store in Poland opened in Szczecin in 1995. The expansion of the branch is concentrated in the west part of the country from Szczecin to Gdańsk (for example in Police and Stargard Szczeciński), and through the country to Bydgoszcz, Poznań, and Zielona Góra, and the country has 323 stores today.\n\nSweden\n\nThe Swedish part of Netto was founded in 2002, as an joint venture between Dansk Supermarked and ICA called Netto Marknad AB. The co operation was granted by the European Commission in 2001. The headquarters were established in Halmstad in March 2002, and the first store was opened in Trelleborg on 8 May 2002.\n\nA week later, two stores were opened in Lund. In the beginning, Netto kept their stores in the Götaland region. In August 2004, the first stores in Stockholm were opened. In October 2003, the head office moved to Falkenberg. By 2003, there were 28 stores. In 2004, there were 58 stores. In December 2007, there were 84, and in May 2009, there were 107.\n\nIn November 2006, ICA announced it was pulling out of the joint venture, reducing its stake from 50% to 5%, today ICA no longer have any stake in the company. 21 stores in the Stockholm and Västerås regions would transfer to ICA ownership with most being rebranded to ICA's own formats during 2007.\n\nThe reasons for the change were problems in supplying the stores based on Netto's more southern base as well as ICA's desire to focus investment on its own formats.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nNetto began operating in England in Leeds, on 13 December 1990, with the company's United Kingdom headquarters being based in the ex-mining village of South Elmsall, West Yorkshire. Netto primarily expanded in central England, before moving into Southern England, namely London.\n\nIn January 2005, plans for an £200 million investment in South Wales were announced, only to be cancelled. This was all due to logistical issues, resulting in the sell-off of stores in Barry and Caerphilly. 1,700 jobs were promised in the expansion, with only a few being created.\n\nIn May 2010, Netto UK was sold to Asda for £778 million, in order that Asda could increase its smaller store portfolio. The rebranding of 147 former Netto stores, under the Asda brand was complete by November 29, 2011. Competition laws required Asda to sell the remaining 47 stores to other companies, such as Morrisons, new convenience store UGO, and other retailers.\n\nIn June 2014, Dansk Supermarked returned Netto to the United Kingdom, as a 50:50 joint venture with Sainsbury's. Plans called for one store will be combined with a Sainsbury's. \n\nIn July 2016, the two companies announced they were ending the joint venture, and closing the stores. Mike Coupe, chief executive, said: \"we have made the difficult decision not to pursue the (Netto) opportunity further, and instead focus on our core business and on the opportunities we will have, following our proposed acquisition of Home Retail Group\". \n\nOther countries\n\nThe Netto name is also used in other countries, such as Spain and France, but these stores are independent from the Scandinavian Netto. The Spanish Netto is a chain of convenience stores owned by DinoSol, and the French Netto is a discount chain owned by Les Mousquetaires.\nQuestion:\nIn which country are the headquarters of the supermarket chain 'Netto'?\nAnswer:\nEastern Denmark\nPassage:\nCabinet of Israel\nThe Government of Israel (officially:  Memshelet Yisrael) exercises executive authority in the State of Israel. It consists of ministers who are chosen and led by the prime minister. In choosing ministers, the prime minister must appoint members based on the distribution of votes to political parties during parliamentary elections, and the composition of the government must be approved by a vote of the Knesset (the Israeli parliament). Under Israeli law, the prime minister may dismiss members of the government, but must do so in writing, and new appointees must be approved by the Knesset. Most ministers lead ministries, though some are ministers without portfolio. Most ministers are members of the Knesset, though only the Prime Minister and the \"designated acting prime minister\" are actually required to be Knesset members. Some ministers are also called deputy and vice prime ministers. Unlike the designated acting prime minister, these roles have no statutory meanings. The government operates in accordance with the Basic Law. It meets on Sundays weekly in Jerusalem. There may be additional meetings if circumstances require it. The prime minister convenes these meetings.\n\nUse of terms \n\nThe body discussed in this article is referred to in Israeli official documents as the Government of Israel. This is in accordance to the normal translation of its Hebrew name, (, Memshala). In Israel, the term cabinet () is generally used for the Political-Security Cabinet ( HaKabinet haMedini-Bitachoni), a smaller forum of cabinet members that decides on defense and foreign policy issues and may consist of up to half of the (full) cabinet members. Another term in use is the Kitchen Cabinet (, HaMitbahon, lit. \"The kitchenette\"), a collection of senior officials, or unofficial advisers to the Security Cabinet of Israel.\n\nProvisional and first governments of Israel\n\nThe first government was the provisional government of Israel (HaMemshala HaZmanit) which governed from shortly before independence until the formation of the first formal government in March 1949 following the first Knesset elections in January that year. It was formed as the People's Administration (Minhelet HaAm) on 12 April 1948, in preparation for independence just over a month later. All its thirteen members were taken from Moetzet HaAm, the temporary legislative body set up at the same time.\n\nCurrent government\n\nThis government (the Fourth Netanyahu Government) has 21 ministers and seven deputy ministers. Prime Minister is Benjamin Netanyahu. The most prominent figures of the new government include: Minister of Interior Moshe Yaalon of the Likud party, Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon of the Kulanu party, Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked of the Bayit Yehudi party, Minister of Development of the Negev and Galilee Aryeh Deri of the Shas movement, Minister of Education and Minister of Diaspora Affairs Naftali Bennet of the Bayit Yehudi party, Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman of the United Torah Judaism, Minister of Internal Security and Minister of the Strategic Affairs Gilad Erdan of the Likud party.\n\nDeri resigned his post as economy minister reportedly in protest of a gas monopoly deal. Netanyahu took the portfolio himself and promised to speed up the deal.https://www.rt.com/news/321196-israel-protest-gas-deal/\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the Israeli parliament?\nAnswer:\nIsraeli parliament\nPassage:\nEvergreen\nIn botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include:\n*most species of conifers (e.g., hemlock, blue spruce, red cedar, and white/scots/jack pine), but not all (e.g., larch)\n*live oak, holly, and \"ancient\" gymnosperms such as cycads\n*most angiosperms from frost-free climates, such as eucalypts and rainforest trees\n*clubmosses and relatives\n\nThe Latin binomial term sempervirens (literally, \"always green\") refers to the evergreen nature of the plant, for instance:\nAcer sempervirens (a maple)\nCupressus sempervirens (a cypress)\nLonicera sempervirens (a honeysuckle)\nSequoia sempervirens (a sequoia)\nUlmus parvifolia 'Sempervirens' (an elm)\n\nLeaf persistence in evergreen plants varies from a few months (with new leaves constantly being grown as old ones are shed) to several decades (over thirty years in the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine ).\n\nReasons for being evergreen or deciduous\n\nDeciduous trees shed their leaves, usually as an adaptation to a cold or dry/wet season. Evergreen trees do lose leaves, but each tree loses its leaves gradually and not all at once. Most tropical rainforest plants are considered to be evergreens, replacing their leaves gradually throughout the year as the leaves age and fall, whereas species growing in seasonally arid climates may be either evergreen or deciduous. Most warm temperate climate plants are also evergreen. In cool temperate climates, fewer plants are evergreen, with a predominance of conifers, as few evergreen broadleaf plants can tolerate severe cold below about .\n\nIn areas where there is a reason for being deciduous (e.g., a cold season or dry season), being evergreen is usually an adaptation to low nutrient levels. Deciduous trees lose nutrients whenever they lose their leaves. In warmer areas, species such as some pines and cypresses grow on poor soils and disturbed ground. In Rhododendron, a genus with many broadleaf evergreens, several species grow in mature forests but are usually found on highly acidic soil where the nutrients are less available to plants. In taiga or boreal forests, it is too cold for the organic matter in the soil to decay rapidly, so the nutrients in the soil are less easily available to plants, thus favouring evergreens.\n\nIn temperate climates, evergreens can reinforce their own survival; evergreen leaf and needle litter has a higher carbon-nitrogen ratio than deciduous leaf litter, contributing to a higher soil acidity and lower soil nitrogen content. These conditions favour the growth of more evergreens and make it more difficult for deciduous plants to persist. In addition, the shelter provided by existing evergreen plants can make it easier for younger evergreen plants to survive cold and/or drought.\nQuestion:\nWhich evergreen trees belong to the genus Picea?\nAnswer:\nSpruce fir\nPassage:\nTypes of Brick Bonds | The Construction Civil\nTypes of Brick Bonds | The Construction Civil\nTypes of Brick Bonds\nFor English and Flemish bond refer in our website.\n3. Stretching bond:\nIn this arrangement of bonding, all the bricks are laid as stretchers. The overlap, which is usually of half brick, is obtained by commencing each alternate course with a half brick bat. Stretching bond is used for half brick wall only. This bond is also termed as running bond and is commonly adopted in the construction of half brick thick leaves of cavity walls, partition walls, etc. Since there are no headers, suitable reinforcement should be used for structural bond.\n4. Heading bond :\nIn this type of bonding all the bricks are laid as headers on the faces. The overlap, which is usually-of half the width of the brick is obtained by introducing a three-quarter bat in each alternate course at quoins. This bond permits better alignment and  as such it is used for walls curved on plan. This bond is chiefly used for footings in foundations for better transverse distribution of load.\n5.Garden wall bond:\nThis type of bond is suitably adopted for one brick thick wall which may act as a garden wall or a boundary wall. In garden wall bond, it is possible to build uniform faces for a wall without much labour or expense. This type of bond is not so strong as English bond and its use is restricted to the construction of dwarf walls or other similar types of walls which are not subjected to large stresses. On accounts of its good appearance, this bond is sometimes used for the construction of the outer leaves of cavity walls.\nThere are two types of garden wall bond,\n(a) English garden wall bond\n(b) Flemish garden wall bond\n(a) English garden wall bond. The general arrangement of bricks in this type of bonding is similar to that of English bond except that the heading courses are only inserted at every fourth or sixth course. Usually the arrangement consists of one course of headers to three courses of stretchers. A queen closer is placed next to the quoin header of the heading course to give the necessary lap.\n(b) Flemish garden wall bond. This consists of alternate course composed of one header to three or sometimes even five stretchers in series throughout the length of the courses. Each alternate course contains a three quarter bat placed next to the quoin header and a header is laid over the middle of each central stretcher.\n6.Facing bond:\nThis arrangement of bricks is adopted for thick walls, where the facing and backing are desired to be constructed with bricks of different thickness. This bond consists of heading and stretching courses so arranged that one heading course comes after several stretching courses. Since the number of joints in the backing and the facing differ greatly, the load distribution is not uniform. This may sometimes lead to unequal settlement of the two thickness of the wall.\n7.Raking bond:\nThis is a bond in brick work in which the bonding bricks are laid at any angle other than zero or ninety degrees. This arrangement helps to increase the longitudinal stability of thick walls built in English bond. In this arrangement of bonding, the space between the external stretchers of a wall is filled with bricks inclined to the face of the wall. This bond is introduced at certain intervals along the height of a wall.\nThere arc two common forms of raking bond ;\n(a) Herring hone bond\n(b) Diagonal bond.\n(a) Herring-bone bond. This type of bond is best suited for very thick walls usually not less than four bricks thick. In this arrangement of brick work, bricks are laid in course inclined at 45° in two directions from the centre. This bond is also commonly used for brick pavings.\n(b) Diagonal bond. This bond is best suited for walls which are 2 to 4 brick thick. This bond is usually introduced at every fifth or seventh course along the height of the wall. In this bond, the bricks arc placed end to end in such a way that extreme corners of the series remain in contact with the stretchers.\n8.Dutch bond:\nThis bond is a modification of the old English cross bond and consists of alternate courses of headers and stretchers. In this arrangement of brick work, each stretching course starts at the quoin with a three-quarter bat and every alternate stretching course has a header placed next to the three-quarter brick bat provided at the quoin.\n9.English cross-bond:\nThis is similar to English bond and consists of alternate course of headers and stretchers. However, in this bond, queen closer are introduced next to quoin headers and each alternate stretching course has header placed next to quoin stretcher. This bond is sufficiently strong and bears a good elevation.\n10. Zig-Zag bond:\nThis is similar to herring-bone bond with the only difference that in this case the bricks are laid in a zig-zag fashion. This is commonly adopted in brick paved flooring.\n11. Silverlock’s bond:\nThis is a form of bonding brick-work in which bricks are laid on edge. It is economical but weak in strength and hence it is only recommended for garden walls or partition walls. In this bond, the bricks are laid as headers and stretchers in alternate courses in such a way that headers are laid on bed aid the stretchers are laid on edge forming a continuous cavity.\nQuestion:\nFlemish, English Cross and Garden Wall are all bonds used in what?\nAnswer:\nRunning bond\nPassage:\nMark Gatiss | BBC Sherlock | Sherlockology\nMark Gatiss | BBC Sherlock | Sherlockology\n \nTrained at Bretton Hall Drama College\nAs an actor, Mark Gatiss is best known as a member of the award-winning comedy team 'The League of Gentlemen'.

It takes its name from a part of the River Dove on the Derbyshire and Staffordshire border known as Dovedale.\n\nDovedale is a full-fat semi-soft blue-veined cheese made from cow's milk. It was formerly produced only in the Hartington Creamery in Derbyshire which closed in 2009. There are plans to restart production at the Staffordshire Cheese Company in Leek.  It has a creamy texture and a relatively mild flavour for a blue cheese; unusually for British cheeses, it is brine-dipped instead of being dry-salted.  It has been granted Protected Designation of Origin by the EU. \n\nThe Product Authentication Inspectorate Ltd has set a standard for Dovedale, referred to as PAI Specification AS06.\nQuestion:\nNamed after the river by which it is made, 'Dovedale' cheese is produced only in which county?\nAnswer:\nDerbys\nPassage:\nAs Long as He Needs Me\n\"As Long as He Needs Me\" is a torch song sung by the character of Nancy in the musical film Oliver!, and originally introduced in the 1960 musical by Georgia Brown, who was the first actress to play Nancy. It is a love ballad expressing Nancy's love for her criminal boyfriend Bill Sikes, despite his mistreatment of her.\n\nA reprise of this song towards the end of the show expresses Nancy's affection for young Oliver Twist, implying that she now feels that the child also needs her. This reprise was omitted from the film version.\n\nThe song has also been sung as \"As Long as She Needs Me\", when sung by a male singer. Its popularity grew by virtue of renditions by several popular singers, including Lionel Bart and Shirley Bassey who reached number two for 5 weeks on the United Kingdom charts with the song. Bassey's recording became one of the highest sellers of 1960 staying on the UK charts for 30 weeks, and is still heard regularly playing in the background on the TV show EastEnders.

The badge is a gold disc with a native black swan, the swan is facing towards the hoist.  The black swan has long been a symbol of Western Australia.  The original colony was called the Swan River Colony at the location which is now Perth.\n\nPrevious flag\n\nThe first flag of Western Australia was adopted in 1870  and is almost identical to the current flag of Western Australia.  The only difference is that the swan was facing the opposite direction towards the fly rather than towards the hoist.  The direction of the swan was changed to conform to the vexillological guideline that animals on flags must face the hoist, so when carried on a pole, the animal faces the same direction of the bearer.\n\nFile:Flag of the Western Australia Fire and Rescue Service.svg|Flag of the Western Australia Fire and Rescue Service\nFile:Flag of the Governor of Western Australia.svg|Standard of the Governor of Western Australia\nFile:Flag of the Governor of Western Australia 1953-1988.svg|Standard of the Governor 1953-1988\nFile:Flag of the Governor of Western Australia 1870-1953.svg|Standard of the Governor 1870-1953\nFile:Flag of Dominion of Westralia (secession movement).svg|Flag of the \"Dominion of Westralia\", the secessionist movement in Western Australia in the 1920s-mid 1930s\nQuestion:\nWhich creature features on the flag of Western Australia?\nAnswer:\nChenopis atratus\nPassage:\nHM Prison Frankland\nHM Prison Frankland is a Category A men's prison located in the village of Brasside in County Durham, England. Frankland is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.\n\nHistory\n\nFrankland was originally opened in 1980 with four wings each holding 108 in single cells. A further two wings opened in 1998 to an open gallery design to hold an additional 206. A specialist Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) unit opened at the prison in May 2004. \n\nThe prison has increased in size in recent years following major redevelopment work including the construction of the new DSPD 'Westgate Unit'. In March 2008 the Ministry of Justice announced that Frankland would be expanded again, with planning permission granted for an extra 120 places at the prison. \n\nIn 2010, Ian Huntley, a psychopathic pedophile who is currently serving 40 years to life upon being convicted of the Soham Murders, had his throat slashed by a psychopathic inmate Damien Fowkes who got a life sentence for the attack as well as killing another pedophile at HMP Full Sutton.\n\nIn 2011, two convicted prisoners, Nathan Mann and Michael Parr disemboweled 23-year-old Mitchell Harrison, who had been convicted for raping a 13-year-old girl. \n\nThe prison today\n\nFrankland holds male prisoners who are over 21 years old and whose sentence is four years or more, life sentences and high-risk remand prisoners. Prison accommodation is divided between wings, with wings A to D holding 108 inmates each, and wings F and G holding an additional 206. All cells are single occupancy.\n\nThe Healthcare Centre at the prison consists of a 4-bedded ward and 10 furnished rooms, a dental suite, X-ray and a Suicide Crisis Suite. A number of clinics are held, many conducted by visiting specialists. There are also telehealth services and wing-based treatment rooms. Primary care is contracted to the County Durham Primary Care Trust. \n\nEducation at the prison is provided by The Manchester College,  with a range of courses provided - from basic skills to higher education level. Frankland also runs workshops in furniture production, a charity workshop and a sight-and-sound workshop. The prison has a library and gym to support inmate's learning and recreation. \n\nFrankland Prison has a visitors' centre. Facilities include a canteen and children's play area, all with disabled access.\n\nNotable inmates\n\nFormer inmates\n\n* Charles Bronson\n* Paul John Ferris\n* Michael Lupo\n* Dominic Noonan\n* Colin Pitchfork\n* Harold Shipman\n* John Straffen\n* Kamel Bourgass\n\nCurrent inmates\n\n*David Bieber\n*Robert Lesarian Howard\n*Dhiren Barot\n*Mel Broughton\n*Ian Huntley\n*Michael Stone\n*Peter Chapman\n*Delroy Grant\n*Colin Norris\n*Yusuf Jama\n*Muzzaker Shah\n*Hussain Osman\n*Charles Taylor\nQuestion:\nIn which English county is Frankland Prison?\nAnswer:\nDurham (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nCouvade syndrome\nCouvade syndrome, also called sympathetic pregnancy, is a proposed condition in which a partner experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior of an expectant mother.  These most often include minor weight gain, altered hormone levels, morning nausea, and disturbed sleep patterns. In more extreme cases, symptoms can include labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds.  The labor pain symptom is commonly known as sympathy pain. \n\nCouvade syndrome is not recognized as a real syndrome by many medical professionals. Its source is a matter of debate. Some believe it to be a psychosomatic condition, while others believe it may have biological causes relating to hormone changes.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms experienced by the partner can include stomach pain, back pain, indigestion, changes in appetite, weight gain, acne, diarrhea, constipation, headache, toothache, cravings, nausea, breast augmentation,breast growth, dry naval, hardening of the nipple, excessive earwax, and insomnia. A qualitative study listed 35 symptoms from Couvade literature, including gastro-intestinal, genito-urinary, respiratory, oral or dental, stiffening of the glutes, generalized aches and pains, and other symptoms. \n\nPsychological theories\n\nPsychological causes suggested have included anxiety, pseudo-sibling rivalry, identification with the fetus, ambivalence about fatherhood, or parturition envy.  According to Osvlosky and Culp (1989), pregnancy causes the male counterpart to experience an emergence of ambivalence as well as a recurrence of Oedipal conflict.  In 1920s France, Couvade was claimed to be more common in conditions where sex roles are flexible and the female is of a dominant status. \n\nPhysiological theories\n\nStudies have shown that the male partner cohabitating with a pregnant female will experience hormonal shifts in his prolactin, cortisol, estradiol, and testosterone levels, typically starting at the end of the first trimester and continuing through several weeks post-partum.\nQuestion:\nDerived from the French word meaning to brood or hatch, what term refers to a male phantom or sympathetic pregnancy syndrome in response to a wife or partner's real pregnancy?\nAnswer:\nCouvade\nPassage:\nForefathers' Day\nFourfathers' Day is a holiday celebrated in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on December 22. It is a commemoration of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on December 21, 1620. It was introduced in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1769.\n\nForefathers Day' is celebrated every year by the Old Colony Club, established in 1769 \"to honor the forefathers\". The celebration begins at 6:00 AM with a march by members to the top of Cole's Hill next to Massasoit's statue, followed by a reading of a proclamation honoring the forefathers and a ritual firing of the club's cannon. \n \nThe Old Colony Club and the Mayflower Society both include a succotash dinner as part of their celebration. Sauquetash was recorded as a part of the first Thanksgiving. Unlike later versions of succotash, in Plymouth succotash is served as a broth containing large pieces of fowl and meat that are sliced at the table.   \n\nWhen the 22nd falls on a Sunday, the Old Colony Club celebrates Forefathers Day' on the following Monday. \n\nThere is some good-hearted dispute between the Old Colony Club and the Mayflower Society. The simple fact of the celebration falling on separate days permits members of both societies to participate in both celebrations.  In adjusting the date to the Gregorian calendar, the anniversary was erroneously established on December 22 instead of December 21.\nQuestion:\nForefathers Day is celebrated in the US on which date?\nAnswer:\nDecember 21st\nPassage:\nPaddington (1975 TV series)\nPaddington Bear is a series of British animated shorts based on the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond produced by FilmFair. This was the first television series based on the popular children's book Paddington Bear. In the United States it was usually shown on pay television as filler in between programmes. Its narrator was actor Michael Hordern. The series has a very distinctive art style. Paddington himself is a stop-motion animated puppet who moves within a 3-dimensional space and interacts with 2-dimensional animated drawings of the human characters, buildings, etc.\n\nBroadcast\n\nSeries One (episodes 1 to 30, entitled Paddington) was aired on the BBC1 in 1976 (having been produced the previous year), and Series Two (episodes 31 to 56, entitled The Adventures of Paddington) between 1978 and 1979, with specials airing in 1980, 1984 and 1986. Internationally, episodes of the series aired in the United States on PBS, on the syndicated series Romper Room, on Nickelodeon as a segment on the programme Pinwheel and on USA Network as a segment on the Calliope (TV series) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as in between preschool programming on The Disney Channel as a segment on the programme Lunch Box from the late 1980s into the 1990s.   The series also aired on HBO in between features, usually when they were airing children's programmes. It was also aired on the ABC in Australia in the early 1980s.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSpecials\n\n*  Paddington Goes To The Movies (1980)\nA 21-minute special in which Paddington goes to the movies.

Peter and published in 1969 in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and \"managers rise to the level of their incompetence.\"\n\nOverview\n\nThe Peter principle is a special case of an ubiquitous observation: Anything that works will be used in progressively more challenging applications until it fails. This is the \"generalized Peter principle\". There is much temptation to use what has worked before, even when this might not be appropriate for the current situation. Laurence J. Peter observed this about humans. \n\nIn an organizational structure, assessing an employee's potential for a promotion is often based on their performance in the current job. This eventually results in their being promoted to their highest level of competence and potentially then to a role in which they are not competent, referred to as their \"level of incompetence\". The employee has no chance of further promotion, thus reaching their career's ceiling in an organization.\n\nPeter suggests that \"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties\"  and [the corollary] that \"work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.\" He coined the term hierarchiology as the social science concerned with the basic principles of hierarchically organized systems in the human society.\n\nHe noted that their incompetence may be because the required skills are different, but not more difficult. For example, an excellent engineer may be a poor manager because they might not have the interpersonal skills necessary to lead a team.\n\nRather than seeking to promote a talented \"super-competent\" junior employee, Peter suggested that an incompetent manager may set them up to fail or dismiss them because they are likely to \"violate the first commandment of hierarchical life with incompetent leadership: the hierarchy must be preserved\".\n\nResearch\n\nAlessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo used an agent-based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true. They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly, or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group, from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly. For this work, they won the 2010 edition of the parody Ig Nobel Prize in management science. \n\nComparable texts\n\nJosé Ortega y Gasset suggested that: \"All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level, as they have been promoted until turning incompetent\".  Ortega died in 1955, about 14 years before Peter published The Peter Principle.\nQuestion:\nWhich theory states that 'people tend to rise to their own level of incompetence'?\nAnswer:\nHierarchiology\n", "answers": ["Sunday Post", "The Sunday Post"], "length": 7310, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "623b035273f966a7dff623055b9bbd23e485210a92e92ec7"}
{"input": "Passage:\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man - Inventors\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer and the Production of Steel\nBy Mary Bellis\nUpdated August 18, 2016.\nSir Henry Bessemer, an Englishman, invented the first process for mass-producing steel inexpensively in the 19th century. It was an essential contribution to the development of modern day skyscrapers.\nThe First System for Manufacturing Steel\nAn American, William Kelly, initially held a patent for \"a system of air blowing the carbon out of pig iron,\" a method of steel production known as the pneumatic process. Air was blown through molten pig iron to oxidize and remove unwanted impurities.\nThis was Bessemer’s starting point. When Kelly went bankrupt, Bessemer – who had been working on a similar process for making steel – bought his patent. Bessemer patented \"a decarbonization process utilizing a blast of air\" in 1855.\nModern Steel\nModern steel is made using technology based on Bessemer's process. On the making of the first steel ingot, Bessemer said:\n\"I well remember how anxiously I awaited the blowing of the first 7-cwt. charge of pig iron. I had engaged an ironfounder's furnace attendant to manage the cupola and the melting of the charge. When his metal was nearly all melted, he came to me and said hurriedly, \"Where be going to put the metal, maister?\" I said, \"I want you to run it by a gutter into that little furnace,\" pointing to the converter, \"from which you have just raked out all the fuel, and then I shall blow cold air through it to make it hot.\"\nThe man looked at me in a way in which surprise and pity for my ignorance seemed curiously blended, and he said, \"It will soon be all of a lump.\" Notwithstanding this prediction, the metal was run in, and I awaited with much impatience the result. The first element attacked by the atmospheric oxygen is the silicon, generally present in pig iron to the extent of 1 1/2 to 2 percent; it is the white metallic substance of which flint is the acid silicate. Its combustion furnishes a great deal of heat, but it is very undemonstrative, a few sparks and hot gases only indicating the fact that something is going quietly on.\nBut after an interval of 10 or 12 minutes, when the carbon contained in grey pig iron to the extent of about 3 percent is seized on by the oxygen, a voluminous white flame is produced which rushes out of the openings provided for its escape from the upper chamber, and it brilliantly illuminates the whole space around. This chamber proved a perfect cure for the rush of slags and metal from the upper central opening of the first converter. I watched with some anxiety for the expected cessation of the flame as the carbon gradually burnt out. It took place almost suddenly, and thus indicated the entire decarburisation of the metal.\nThe furnace was then tapped, when out rushed a limpid stream of incandescent malleable iron, almost too brilliant for the eye to rest upon. It was allowed to flow vertically into the parallel undivided ingot mould. Then came the question, would the ingot shrink enough, and the cold iron mould expand enough, to allow the ingot to be pushed out? An interval of eight or 10 minutes was allowed, and then, on the application of hydraulic force to the ram, the ingot rose entirely out of the mould and stood there ready for removal.\"\nBessemer was knighted in 1879 for his contributions to science. The \"Bessemer Process\" for mass-producing steel was named after him.\nRobert Mushet is credited with inventing tungsten steel in 1868, and Henry Brearly invented stainless steel in 1916.\nQuestion:\nWhich metal is produced by the Bessemer Process?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nNo More Heroes (The Stranglers song)\n\"No More Heroes\" is a single by The Stranglers from the eponymous album No More Heroes. It is one of the Stranglers' most successful singles (featuring regularly both in greatest hits and punk/New Wave compilation albums), peaking at No. 8   in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nThe lyrics refer to several historical figures, including Elmyr de Hory, Leon Trotsky, Lenny Bruce, Sancho Panza\nand William Shakespeare. \n\nAt the time of the single's release, the B-side \"In the Shadows\" was a non-album track, but it appeared on the Stranglers' next studio album, Black and White. In 1995 the band's publishers threatened legal action against Elastica, arguing that their single \"Waking Up\" borrowed elements of \"No More Heroes\". Elastica eventually settled out of court. \n\nA cover of the song by Violent Femmes featured in the movie Mystery Men, and was also heard in two episodes of the BBC show Ashes to Ashes: Episode 1 of Series 1 and Episode 4 of Series 3; it was included in the soundtrack to Series 1.\nQuestion:\nWho is the first ‘hero’ mentioned in the Stranglers hit single ‘No More Heroes’?\nAnswer:\nTrockij\nPassage:\nCondiment\nA condiment is a spice, sauce, or, preparation that is added to food to impart a particular flavor, to enhance its flavor,  or in some cultures, to complement the dish. The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but has shifted meaning over time. \n\nMany condiments are available packaged in single-serving packets, like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals. They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce,  compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples.\n\nThe term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin condere, meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". \n\nDefinition\n\nThe exact definition of what is and is not a condiment varies. Some definitions include spice and herbs, including salt and pepper,  using the term interchangeably with seasoning.  Others restrict the definition to including only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce. Cheese is also considered a condiment in some European countries.\n\nHistory\n\nCondiments were known in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China, and were often used to improve the taste of spoiling food; before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable.  The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by , leading to a flourishing condiment industry. Apicius, a cookbook based on 4th and 5th century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.\n\nList of condiments\n\nCondiment market in the United States \n\nThe condiment market refers to the marketing and consumer purchase of condiments.\n\nIn the United States, condiment market was valued at USD 5.6 billion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to USD 7 billion by 2015. The condiment market is the second largest in specialty foods behind that of cheese.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Dijon mustard on a spoon - 20051218.jpg|Dijon mustard\nImage:Chrain3.jpg|Chrain (horseradish sauce)\nImage:Oeufsmayo.JPG|Mayonnaise\nImage:Ketchup-01.jpg|Tomato Ketchup\nImage:BasilkumPesto.jpg|Pesto genovese\nImage:Chutneys.jpg|Chutneys\nImage:HAT YAI MARKET 2.jpg|Curry powder or paste\nImage:Megrelian ajika.jpg|Ajika, spicy sauce in Caucasian cuisine\nImage:Tkemali.JPG|Tkemali (Georgian sauce made of sour cherry plums)\nImage:Chinese condiments at the restaurant by bhollar in Nerima, Tokyo.jpg|Common Chinese condiments: soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, white pepper\nImage:Duck sauce packets.jpg|Packets of duck sauce\nImage:Carrburritos salsas and chips.jpg|Salsa\nImage:Worcester Sauce 001.jpg|Worcestershire sauce\nImage:Marmite thick spread toasted bread.jpg|Marmite\nImage:Relish.jpg|Gentleman's Relish\nImage:Flying goose sriracha th.jpg|Sriracha (type of Hot sauce)\nImage:Shichimi tougarashi.JPG|Shichimi\nImage:HK 北角 North Point 和田 Wada Japanese Restaurant 放題 Buffet dinner 山葵 green Wasabi Mar-2013.JPG|Wasabi\nQuestion:\nWhat condiment is made of boiled beans, roasted grain and brine?\nAnswer:\nKancang\nPassage:\nMalia Obama - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nMalia Obama - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nFamous Birthdays\nCancer\nABOUT\nOldest daughter of the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama .

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) at the age of 25.\n\nBiography\n\nGray was born in Belgravia, London, in 1827   and lived most of his life in London. In 1842, he entered as a student at St. George’s Hospital, London (then situated in Belgravia, now moved to Tooting), and he is described by those who knew him as a most painstaking and methodical worker, and one who learned his anatomy by the slow but invaluable method of making dissections for himself.\n\nWhile still a student, Gray secured the triennial prize of Royal College of Surgeons in 1848 for an essay entitled The Origin, Connexions and Distribution of nerves to the human eye and its appendages, illustrated by comparative dissections of the eye in other vertebrate animals. In 1852, at the early age of 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year he obtained the Astley Cooper prize of three hundred guineas for a dissertation “On the structure and Use of Spleen.”\n\nIn 1858, Gray published the first edition of Anatomy, which covered 750 pages and contained 363 figures. He had the good fortune of securing the help of his friend Henry Vandyke Carter, a skilled draughtsman and formerly a demonstrator of anatomy at St. George’s Hospital. Carter made the drawings from which the engravings were executed, and the success of the book was, in the first instance, undoubtedly due in no small measure to the excellence of its illustrations. This edition was dedicated to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, Bart, FRS, DCL. A second edition was prepared by Gray and published in 1860.  The book is still published under the title Gray's Anatomy and is widely appreciated as an extraordinary and authoritative textbook for medical students.\n\nGray held successively the posts of demonstrator of Anatomy, curator of the museum and Lecturer of Anatomy at St. George’s Hospital and was in 1861 a candidate for the post of assistant surgeon.\n\nDeath \n\nGray was struck by an attack of confluent smallpox, the most deadly type of the disease where individual lesions become so numerous that they join as a continuous, \"confluent\" sheet. He is assumed to have been infected due to his extended and meticulous caring for his ten-year-old nephew, Charles Gray, who did eventually recover. On the day he was to appear for an interview as a final candidate for a prestigious post at the St. George's Hospital, he died in London - 13 June 1861  - at the age of 34. He was buried at St James, Pancras and Highgate Cemetery.   Of note is the fact that Gray had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child with one of the early forms of the vaccine.\nQuestion:\n\"The long-standing textbook, \"\"Anatomy\"\", by Henry Gray (1827-1861) owed much of its effectiveness to the illustrations which were drawn by whom?\"\nAnswer:\nDr Henry Vandyke Carter\nPassage:\nEdinburgh Comedy Awards\nThe Edinburgh Comedy Awards or Eddies (formerly the Perrier Comedy Awards, and also briefly known by other names for sponsorship reasons) are presented to the comedy shows deemed to have been the best at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. Established in 1981, they are the most prestigious comedy prize in the United Kingdom. The awards have been directed and produced by Nica Burns since 1984.\n\nThe most recent awards were given to Sam Simmons, Sofie Hagen and Karen Koren of Gilded Balloon. \n\nFormat\n\nThe main prize, which was for many years the only prize, and is now known as the Best Comedy Show, is awarded \"for the funniest, most outstanding, up-and-coming comic / comedy show / act\" at the Fringe. The winner receives a cash prize of £10,000 and an invitation to perform at the Montreal, Toronto and Chicago Just for Laughs Comedy Festivals. \n\nThe Best Newcomer Award category was introduced in 1992, and is given to the best \"performer or act who is performing their first full-length show (50 minutes or more)\". The prize is £5,000. Newcomers are eligible for the Best Comedy Show Award, but no act is allowed to appear on both shortlists in the same year.\n \nA further prize, the Panel Prize, was inaugurated in 2006. All shows are eligible, and the award may not be awarded at all, if the panel so choose. This has never happened since the prize was founded, although in 2008 it was awarded to \"every comedian on the Fringe\". Like Best Newcomer, the Panel Prize winner receives a cash prize of £5,000.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original award was created by Perrier in 1981 as a way of supporting young talent. The inaugural award was presented to the Cambridge Footlights, a cast that included Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Tony Slattery. Many award winners and nominees have gone on to forge successful careers in comedy and the media industry including Lee Evans, Milton Jones, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace creators Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness, double act Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller, QI panellist Alan Davies, Mock the Week panellist Chris Addison and many others. Australian Comedian Brendon Burns has said that he is \"arguably the least successful winner\" of the award.\n\nA Best Newcomer Award was added in 1992, and in 2006, the inaugural Panel Prize was given out. \n\nIn 2014, John Kearns became the first comedian to win Best Newcomer and Best Comedy Show in consecutive years.\n\nSponsorship\n\nFrom their inception in 1981 until 2005 the awards were sponsored by mineral water brand Perrier, during which time they were known as the Perrier Comedy Awards. Sponsorship then passed to the Scottish-based bank Intelligent Finance and for 2006, the first year of their involvement, the awards were known as the if.comeddies, changing to the if.comedy awards for 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn March 2009 Intelligent Finance announced it would not be renewing its sponsorship deal. The 2009 awards were known as the Edinburgh Comedy Award, sponsored by AbsoluteRadio.co.uk. From 2010, the awards have been sponsored by Foster's Lager.\n\nIn order to avoid confusion due to the frequency of name changes, past winners are now often said to have won \"the Eddie\", a popular colloquial term for the award, rather than referring to a specific year's sponsor.\n\nControversy\n\nNestlé\n\nIn 1995, Perrier was bought by Nestlé, the subject of a long-running boycott based on alleged violations of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, leading to calls to boycott or to eliminate the awards taken up by some Fringe venues and performers, including former winners Emma Thompson, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee and Rob Newman, led a campaign of protest against the award, beginning in 2001, called Baby Milk Action.\n\nThe Nestlé boycott also led to the alternative Tap Water Awards which ran from 2001 to 2006, and aimed to promote access to safe supplies of drinking water and sanitation in developing countries; these awards were suspended for 2007 due to \"having beaten Nestlé\". Multiple winners were chosen each year, including established comedians like Stewart Lee and Robert Newman, and, in the award's final year, promoter Peter Buckley Hill for his Free Fringe initiative.\n\nInclusivity\n\nA Scottish act has never won the award, and no Scottish acts were nominated between 1993, when Phil Kay and Donna McPhail were nominated, and 2009, when Kevin Bridges was nominated for Best Newcomer. Phil Nichol, the winner in 2006, was born in Scotland to a Scottish mother but subsequently grew up in Canada. In 2015, Glaswegian comedian, Larry Dean, was nominated for Best Newcomer for his show Out Now!\n\nThe 2002 awards were criticised because no female acts were shortlisted, the second consecutive year in which that was the case. In 2009, they were again criticised for all the nominees being male, as well as all being white, English and all performing at the same venue, The Pleasance.\nQuestion:\nFrom 1981 to 2005, the Perrier Awards were made at which festival?\nAnswer:\nDun Eideann\nPassage:\nNottingham Goose Fair\nThe Nottingham Goose Fair is an annual travelling funfair held at the Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham, England, during the first week of October, with the next fair starting on the 5 October 2016.  It is largely provided by showmen (travelling fair people). It is one of only three established fairs in the United Kingdom to carry the name, the others being the smaller Goosey Fair in Tavistock, Devon, and the even smaller Michaelmas Goose Fayre in Colyford in East Devon.\n\nHistory\n\nThe fair dates back more than 700 years. The consensus among historians is that the fair probably started just after 1284, when the Charter of King Edward I referred to city fairs in Nottingham.  The Goose Fair was cancelled due to the bubonic plague in 1646 and again during the two World Wars in the 20th century. 1927 was the last year it was held in Old Market Square in Nottingham City Centre; it was then moved to the Forest Recreation Ground because of redevelopment of the Square.\n\nThe Goose Fair started as a trade event and enjoyed a reputation for its high-quality cheese, although it is now known for its rides and games. Its name is derived from the thousands of geese that were driven from Lincolnshire to be sold in Nottingham.\n\nOriginally, the fair was held on 21 September, but in 1752, with the change to the Gregorian calendar, it moved to early October. The duration of the fair was shortened from eight days to three days in the 1800s.\n\nRecent history\n\nNottingham Goose Fair is considered by many people to be one of the most prestigious fairs in the UK. However, in recent years, the dates of the fair have created a problem, as it now overlaps with the Hull Fair. Some of the top rides from the Goose Fair have therefore to travel directly from Nottingham to Hull, not opening at Hull until around the fourth day of the fair. This was averted for 2013 by having Hull Fair start a week later than usual.\n\nIt is now held at the Forest Recreation Ground. After the turn of the 21st century its length was increased again to four days, for the 700th anniversary, and was kept like this afterwards. For 2006, the fair increased to five days with the addition of limited opening hours on the Sunday afternoon. However it proved unprofitable to open on the Sunday, so this was not repeated in 2007 although it was opened for 5 days again from 2009.\n\nGoose Fair has seldom been affected by violence, but in 2004, a girl, Danielle Beccan, 14, was fatally shot as she walked home from the Goose Fair through the St. Ann's estate, over a mile from the fair.  Following the murder, The Guardian reported that the Goose Fair period was traditionally a time of tension between rival groups, but Danielle herself was not in a gang.  Two people were convicted of the murder. \n\nIn art and popular culture\n\nThe painting Nottingham Goose Fair by Noel Denholm Davis (1910) is held by Nottingham City Museums and Galleries. \nThe Nottingham-based artist Arthur Spooner painted The Goose Fair, Nottingham in 1926.   The painting was sold at Christie's in 2004  and is now displayed in Nottingham Castle.\n\nThe book English Journey by J. B. Priestley contains an account of the author's visit to the Goose Fair in 1933. One of Cecil Roberts's books, published in 1928, is called Goose Fair.\n\nThe goose fair has been used in television programmes as well as in films such as The Woman for Joe and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.\n\nThe writer D. H. Lawrence would, while living in London between 1908 and 1912, return home to Nottingham every year to visit the Goose Fair.\n\nThe short story \"Noah's Ark\" by Alan Sillitoe is set in the Goose Fair.\nQuestion:\nIn which month does the Nottingham Goose Fair take place\nAnswer:\nOcotber\nPassage:\nCocktail\nWhen used to refer to any generic alcoholic mixed drink, cocktail may mean any beverage that contains three or more ingredients if at least one of those ingredients is alcohol.\n\nUsage and related terms\n\nWhen a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as soda  or fruit juice, it is a highball; many of the International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs.  When a cocktail contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a duo and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and  various herbs. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the word cocktail is disputed.\n\nThe first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a horse is found in The Morning Post and Gazetteer in London, England, March 20, 1798: \n\nMr. Pitt,\ntwo petit vers of “L’huile de Venus”\nDitto, one of “perfeit amour”\nDitto, “cock-tail” (vulgarly called ginger)\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites the word as originating in the U.S. The first recorded use of cocktail as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in The Farmer's Cabinet, April 28, 1803: \n\nThe first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in The Balance and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, \"What is a cocktail?\":\n\nAnatoly Liberman endorses as \"highly probable\" the theory advanced by  Låftman (1946), which Liberman summarizes as follows: \n\nSeveral authors have theorized that cocktail may be a corruption of cock ale.   \n\nIn his Imbibe! (2007) David Wondrich also speculates that cocktail is a reference a practice for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that the animal would \"cock its tail up and be frisky.\" \n\nDevelopment\n\nThere is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails.  Traditionally cocktails were a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters.  But by the 1860s, a cocktail frequently included a liqueur.  \n\nThe first publication of a bartenders' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 — How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion, by \"Professor\" Jerry Thomas. In addition to recipes for punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks were 10 recipes for \"cocktails\". A key ingredient differentiating cocktails from other drinks in this compendium was the use of bitters. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning of \"cocktail\" include the Old Fashioned whiskey cocktail, the Sazerac cocktail, and the Manhattan cocktail.  \n\nThe ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an Old Fashioned,  which originated as a term used by late 19th century bar patrons to distinguish cocktails made the  “old-fashioned” way from newer, more complex cocktails. \n\nThe term highball appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a distilled spirit and a mixer. \n\nThe first \"cocktail party\" ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri, in May 1917. Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since. \n\nDuring Prohibition in the United States (1919–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as speakeasies. The quality of liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.\n There was a shift from whiskey to gin, which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.   Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment.\n\nCocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with vodka often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the martini. Traditional cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s,  and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional cocktails for inspiration but utilizes novel ingredients and often complex flavors.\nQuestion:\nWhat cocktail consists of 5 parts Rye Whiskey, 2 parts Sweet Red Vermouth, a dash of Angostura Bitters, and garnished with a Maraschino Cherry?\nAnswer:\nManhattan, New York (state)\n", "answers": ["Steel", "Steel workers", "Steel plate", "Steel truss", "Steelworker", "Steel (alloy)", "Steel industry", "STEEL", "Steel (metal)", "Steels", "Titanic steel", "Steelworkers", "Steel in Africa", "Steel sheeting", "Crude steel", "Steel worker", "Unwrapped steel", "Long steel products", "Steel Construction", "Steel manufacture"], "length": 4191, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2766b25313efd8c16c0a519250151c0e23906747b659c1d9"}

The coloring and taste of this cocktail resemble those of ice tea. Long Island Iced Tea also appears in literature in 1961. The drink is believed to be invented either by Robert “Rosebud” Butt, who claimed to have invented the drink as a part of an entry in a contest, or Chris Bendicksen, both of whom were bartenders at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island.

Roy's injury has generally been reported as an attack by a tiger involved in the show, although the two magicians have disputed that account – saying instead that he suffered a stroke and that any injury by the tiger was secondary and accidental. The duo staged a brief comeback performance in 2010 before leaving show business for good. They now run a menagerie at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nSiegfried \n\nSiegfried Fischbacher was born in Rosenheim, Germany on June 13, 1939 to Maria and Martin Fischbacher.  Siegfried's mother was a housewife and his father was a professional painter who was imprisoned by the Soviets during World War II. Siegfried purchased a magic book as a child and began practising tricks. Siegfried moved to Italy in 1956, and began working at a hotel.  He eventually found work performing magic on the ship the TS Bremen under the stage name Delmare. Siegfried and Roy met while Siegfried was performing aboard the ship and asked Roy to assist him during a show.  Siegfried and Roy were fired from the TS Bremen for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a New York-based cruise line and began performing together as a duo. \n\nRoy \n\nRoy Horn was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944 in Nordenham, in the midst of bomb attacks, to Johanna Horn. His biological father fought on the Russian front, and his father and mother divorced after the war ended. Roy's mother remarried a construction worker, and later began work in a factory. Roy had three brothers: Manfred, Alfred, and Werner. Roy became interested in animals at a very young age, and cared for his childhood dog, named Hexe. Roy's mother's friend's husband, Emil, was founder of the Bremen zoo, which gave Roy access to exotic animals from the age of ten.  Roy visited the United States briefly when his ship wrecked and was towed to New York City, and returned home to Bremen before returning to the sea as a waiter, where he met Siegfried and launched his performance career.\n\nCareer\n\nThe owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen, Germany saw Siegfried and Roy's act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and recruited the duo to perform at her nightclub. This launched a career on the European nightclub circuit, and the duo began to perform with tigers. They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967. They spent some time in Puerto Rico, and may have purchased property there. \n\nIn 1981, Ken Feld, of Mattel's Feld Productions started the Beyond Belief show starring Siegfried & Roy at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1982.  In late 1988, Beyond Belief Las Vegas act went on an international tour to Japan then to Radio City ending in 1989. The show returned to Las Vegas in 1990, this time at the Mirage Hotel until the October 2003 accident.\n\nIn 2004, their act became the basis for the short-lived television series Father of the Pride. Right before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Siegfried & Roy urged NBC to continue production after Roy's injury from October 2003 improved.\n\nHorn's injury\n\nOn October 3, 2003, during a show at the Mirage, Roy was apparently bitten in the neck by a 7-year-old male white tiger named Mantecore (but often referred to as Montecore ).  Crew members separated Roy from the tiger and rushed him to University Medical Center. Roy was critically injured and sustained severe blood loss.  Siegfried and Roy have strongly disagreed with the reports that said Roy was attacked by the tiger – saying instead that he had suffered a stroke while on stage and Mantecore responded by picking him up and moving him out of the way to try to protect him, accidentally severing his artery in the process. While being taken to the hospital, Roy said \"Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore.\" \n\nPartially paralyzed, by 2006, Roy was talking and walking (with assistance from Fischbacher), although he has not yet gained use of his left side. On Pat O'Brien's television news program The Insider, he commented about his daily rehabilitation, \"They are slave drivers over there. You'd think they are the KGB from Russia.\" \n\nThe injury to Roy prompted the Mirage to close the show, and 267 cast and crew members were laid off. \n\nIn February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Mantecore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute. This performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's 20/20 program. \n\nOn April 23, 2010, Siegfried & Roy retired from show business. \"The last time we closed, we didn’t have a lot of warning,\" said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. \"This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence.\" \n\nMantecore died on March 19, 2014 at the age of 17 after a short illness.\n\nFilmography\n\n* Bassie & Adriaan: De reis vol verrassingen (children's TV series; 1994)\n* Casino (1995)\n* Siegfried & Roy: Masters of the Impossible (1996)  \n* Vegas Vacation (1997)\n* Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box (1999)\n* Ocean's Eleven (2001)\n* Showboy (2002)\nQuestion:\nWhat is the last name of the performer mauled by Montacore, one of his very special white tigers, in Las Vegas on October 3, 2003?\nAnswer:\nHorn (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nGreat Yorkshire Show\nThe Great Yorkshire Show (GYS) is an agricultural show which takes place on the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate, North Yorkshire in the North of England annually from the second Tuesday of July until the following Thursday. It is organised and run by the Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS). Since the demise of the Royal Show the GYS has been the largest agricultural show in England, however within the UK it is surpassed by both the Royal Welsh Show and the Royal Highland Show.\n\nHistory \n\nThe history of the GYS is intimately connected with that of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society (YAS). At its foundation in 1837, the primary aim of the YAS was stated as \"... to hold an Annual Meeting for the Exhibition of Farming Stock, Implements &c., and for the General Promotion of Agriculture.\" \n\nThe first YAS Show was held in 1838 in the Barrack Yard at Fulford, near York. Though the numbers attending were not recorded the event was counted a success; police had to use their batons to restore order among the large numbers of visitors when they began to force their way in without paying. \n\nOriginally intended as a peripatetic event, the Show moved to Leeds, Northallerton and Hull in subsequent years, before returning to York in 1842. This is the first year for which attendance figures are available — the Show in 1842 had a paid attendance of 6,044.  By 1843 the YAS Show had become known as the \"Great Yorkshire Show\", apparently by popular acclamation rather than in any official sense. \n\nThe GYS continued to be held in various places around Yorkshire until 1950.\n* 1915-1919: Cancelled due to the First World War.\n* 1920: The GYS was held jointly with the Royal Agricultural Society of England in Darlington.\n* 1940-1948: Cancelled due to the Second World War.\n* 1948: By now the YAS was coming to the conclusion that the expenses involved in setting up a new showground every year were becoming prohibitive. \n* 1949: It was decided that a permanent showground be acquired.\n* 1950: The last peripatetic show, in Malton. The YAS bought a site at Hook Oval in Harrogate for £16,500.\n* 1951: From here on, Hook Oval in Harrogate has been the permanent site for the GYS. The 1951 the attendance figure was nearly 54,000.\n* 2001: Cancelled due to the outbreak of Foot and mouth disease in Britain.\n* 2006: The most successful show so far in terms of attendance figures, with 135,111 visitors.\n* 2008: The show was attended by the Queen to celebrate the 150th occasion on which the Show had been held. \n* 2011: The show came close to the record with 135,086 visitors. \n*2012: This show (the 154th) was cancelled on Tuesday 10 July 2012 after only one day due to exceptional rain which had made the showground car parks unsafe. Organisers stated that the decision had been taken \"reluctantly\".  This was the first cancellation due to weather. (Earlier cancellations had been due to war or foot and mouth disease.)  An old bulldozer (probably there in the \"old equipment\" display) towed horse boxes out of muddy ground.\n\nThe Showground \n\nThe Great Yorkshire Showground is situated off Railway Road, on the outskirts of Harrogate. The site is 250 acre in area, and consists mainly of grassland with several permanent structures. These include\n\n* Main grandstand and show-ring\n* Country Pursuits arena (featuring Hounds and Birds of Prey)\n* Flower Show\n* \"White Rose\" grandstand and show-ring\n* Housing for cattle, sheep, pigs and other livestock\n* Multi-purpose conference and exhibition halls (known as the \"Yorkshire Event Centre\"  )\n* Dining and function facilities (known as \"Pavilions of Harrogate\"   and \"Fodder\"  )\n* Office accommodation for the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, which has its headquarters at the showground\n\nThe showground facilities are used all the year round for various functions and events ranging from the Great Yorkshire Show itself to antiques fairs, trade shows, business conferences and wedding receptions. It is estimated that some 1 million people visit the showground per year.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nIn which town is the Great Yorkshire Showground?\nAnswer:\nHARROGATE\nPassage:\nEuropean Senior Tour\nThe European Senior Tour is a professional tour, for male golfers aged 50 and over, run by the PGA European Tour.\n\nThe Tour was founded in 1992. In 2008 it had a total prize fund of €7,729,284, so it is much further behind the U.S.-based Champions Tour in relative prize money than the main European Tour is behind the PGA Tour. The highest profile seniors event in Europe is the Senior British Open Championship, which is co-sanctioned by the Champions Tour. The European Tour co-sanctions the Senior PGA Championship and the U.S. Senior Open. Prize money in latter does not count towards the Order of Merit, but from 2007 the former is an official money event. \n\nSchedule\n\nPast tour schedules\n\nThe table below summarises the development of the tour since 1999, which was the year that the euro became the currency of record for the tour. Individual tournaments have purses fixed in a mixture of British pounds, euros and U.S. dollars, so year on year changes in the total prize fund reflect exchange rate fluctuations as well as prize fund movements in constant currencies.\n\nOrder of Merit winners\n\nLeading career money winners\n\nThe table below shows the top ten career money leaders on the European Seniors Tour as of the end of the 2015 season.\n\nThere is a full list that is updated after each tournament on the European Tour's website [http://www.europeantour.com/seniortour/stats/career/index.html here].\nQuestion:\nWhat is the minimum age for male golfers on the European Seniors tour?\nAnswer:\n50\nPassage:\nQuarter days\nIn British and Irish tradition, the quarter days were the four dates in each year on which servants were hired, school terms started, and rents were due. They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes.\n\nThe significance of quarter days is now limited, although leasehold payments and rents for land and premises in England are often still due on the old English quarter days.\n\nThe quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on. Accounts had to be settled, a reckoning had to be made and publicly recorded on the quarter days. \n\nIn England\n\nThe English quarter days (also observed in Wales and the Channel Islands) are\n* Lady Day (25 March)\n* Midsummer Day (24 June)\n* Michaelmas (29 September)\n* Christmas (25 December)\n\nLady Day was also the first day of the year in British dominions (excluding Scotland) until 1752 (when it was harmonised with the Scottish practice of 1 January being New Year's Day). The British tax year still starts on \"Old\" Lady Day (6 April under the Gregorian calendar corresponded to 25 March under the Julian calendar: 11 days new-style calendar advance in 18th century plus 1 day due to the twelfth skipped Julian leap day in 1800; however it was not changed to 7 April when a thirteenth Julian leap day was skipped in 1900). The dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century were the same as those in Scotland.Fitton, Mike (1994) [http://www.mpsgg.com/WDIM/WDIM_06.html Quarter Days and Courts]\n\nThe cross-quarter days are four holidays falling in between the quarter days: Candlemas (2 February), May Day (1 May), Lammas (1 August), and All Hallows (1 November). The Scottish term days, which fulfil a similar role as days on which rents are paid, correspond more nearly to the cross-quarter days than to the English quarter days.\n\nThere is a mnemonic for remembering on which day of the month the first three quarter days fall (Christmas being easy to recall): Every quarter day is twenty-something, and the second digit of the day of the month is the number of letters in the month's name. So March has five letters and Lady Day is 25 March; similarly June has four letters and September nine, with Midsummer Day and Michaelmas falling on the 24th and 29th respectively.\n\nAt many schools, class terms would begin on the Quarter days; for example, the autumn term would start on September 29, and thus continues to be called the Michaelmas term, especially at more traditional universities. \n\nIn Ireland\n\nPrior to the Christianization of Ireland in the 5th century AD, the Celtic quarter days were observed:\n\n*Lughnasadh (1 August)\n*Samhain (1 November)\n*Imbolc (1 February)\n*Beltaine (1 May)\n\nThese are now called cross-quarter days since they fall about halfway into each of the English quarters.\n\nIn Scotland\n\nThe \"Old Scottish term days\" corresponded approximately to the old Celtic quarter days:\n* Candlemas (2 February)\n* Whitsunday (legislatively fixed for this purpose on 15 May)\n* Lammas (1 August)\n* Martinmas (11 November).\n\nThese were also the dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century.\n\nThe dates for removals and for the employment of servants of Whitsunday and Martinmas were changed in 1886 to 28 May and 28 November respectively.  The Term & Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990 redefined the \"Scottish term days\", in official use, as the 28th of February, May, August and November respectively. The Act specifies that the new dates take effect on 13 June 1991 (12 months from the date it was passed).\nQuestion:\nIn a calendar year what name is given to the final quarter day\nAnswer:\nOrthodox Christmas\nPassage:\nOrgan (anatomy)\nIn biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   \n\nOrgans are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and \"sporadic\" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. \n\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.\n\nOrgan systems \n\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\n* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.\n* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.\n* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.\n* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.\n* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.\n* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.\n* Muscular system: movement with muscles.\n* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.\n* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.\n* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.\n* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nOther animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\nPlants\n\nThe study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\n\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word \"organ\" derives from the Latin ', meaning \"instrument\", itself from the Greek word , ' (\"implement; musical instrument; organ of the body\"). The Greek word is related to , ' (\"work\").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as \"guts\" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, \"innards\".\n\nAristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract \"parts\" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the \"organon\").\n\nThe English word \"organism\" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. \n\nThe adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.\n\nThe term \"visceral\" is contrasted with the term \"\", meaning \"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity\". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.\n\n7 Vital Organs of Antiquity\n\nSome alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhich organ of the body is affected by nephritis ?\nAnswer:\nHuman kidney\nPassage:\nCooperative | Define Cooperative at Dictionary.com\nCooperative | Define Cooperative at Dictionary.com\ncooperative\n[koh-op-er-uh-tiv, -op-ruh-tiv, -op-uh-rey-tiv] /koʊˈɒp ər ə tɪv, -ˈɒp rə tɪv, -ˈɒp əˌreɪ tɪv/\nSpell\nworking or acting together willingly for a common purpose or benefit.\n2.\ndemonstrating a willingness to cooperate :\nThe librarian was cooperative in helping us find the book.\n3.\na cooperative business.\n4.\ninvolving or denoting an educational program comprising both classroom study and on-the-job or technical training, especially in colleges and universities.\nnoun\n5.\na jointly owned enterprise engaging in the production or distribution of goods or the supplying of services, operated by its members for their mutual benefit, typically organized by consumers or farmers.\n6.\nAlso called co-op , cooperative apartment.\na building owned and managed by a corporation in which shares are sold, entitling the shareholders to occupy individual units in the building.\nan apartment in such a building.\nCompare condominium (defs 1, 2).\nOrigin of cooperative\nQuestion:\nAmerican.

It was founded by Pavel Sukhoi in 1939 as the Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB-51, design office prefix Su).\n\nCompany history\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, each of the multitude of bureaus and factories producing Sukhoi components was privatized independently. In 1996, the government re-gathered the major part of them forming Sukhoi Aviation Military Industrial Combine (Sukhoi AIMC). In parallel, other entities, including Ulan Ude factory, Tbilisi factory, Belarus and Ukraine factories, established alternate transnational Sukhoi Attack Aircraft (producing e.g. Su-25 TM).\n\nThe Sukhoi AIMC comprises the JSC Sukhoi Design Bureau located in Moscow, the Novosibirsk Aviation Production Association (NAPO), the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) and Irkutsk Aviation. Sukhoi is headquartered in Moscow. Finmeccanica (since 2016, Leonardo-Finmeccanica) owns 25% + 1 share of Sukhoi's civil division.   The Russian government merged Sukhoi with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, and Yakovlev as a new company named United Aircraft Corporation.   Mikoyan and Sukhoi were placed within the same operating unit. \n\nSukhoi is also working on what is to be Russia's fifth-generation stealth fighter, the Sukhoi PAK FA. The maiden flight took place on the 29 January 2010.[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/2010/01/venajalla_esiteltiin_uusi_havittajakone_1405552.html Venäjällä esiteltiin uusi hävittäjäkone | Ulkomaat | YLE Uutiset | yle.fi]\n\nUsage\n\nSukhoi's Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, Su-30, Su-34, Su-35 and shipborne Su-33 aircraft are in service with the Russian Air Force and Navy as well as foreign armies. The Su-25 is the oldest Sukhoi still in production. Sukhoi attack and fighter aircraft have been supplied to Armenia, India, China, Poland, the Czech Republic, Iraq, Slovakia, Hungary, Georgia, East Germany, Syria, North Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Libya, Iran, Angola, Ethiopia, Peru, Eritrea, and Indonesia. Venezuela signed contracts for the purchase of 30 Su-30 fighter jets in July 2006. More than 2,000 Sukhoi aircraft were supplied to foreign countries on export contracts. With its Su-26, Su-29 and Su-31 models Sukhoi is also a manufacturer of aerobatic aircraft.\n\nU.S. sanctions\n\nOn August 4, 2006, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on Sukhoi for allegedly supplying Iran in violation of the United States Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000.  Sukhoi was prohibited from doing business with the United States Federal Government.   In November 2006, the U.S. State Department reversed its sanctions against Sukhoi.[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/21432/us-lifts-sanctions-on-jet-maker-sukhoi US lifts sanctions on jet maker Sukhoi – World – GMA News Online – Latest Philippine News]\n\nCivilian aircraft\n\nIn September 2007, Russia launched its first modern commercial regional airliner—the Superjet 100, a 78 to 98 seater, built by Sukhoi.

And apparently, that's exactly what a type of lemur known as an aye-aye likes to do. A lot. A new study out of Dartmouth College figured out that the little prosimian likes to gobble up food with the highest alcohol content – but not necessarily for the reasons you think.\nThe aye-aye is the world's largest nocturnal primate and belongs to the group known as prosimians, which also includes the slow loris and bush baby. It is only found on the island of Madagascar and has one long finger that it uses to tap on trees to get grubs scrambling around. It then listens for the insects moving beneath the bark and uses the same long finger to dig them out, making it something of a mammalian woodpecker.\nUnlike other prosimians though, the aye-aye has a genetic mutation in common with humans and great apes that allows it to metabolize alcohol 40 times faster than animals lacking the mutation, meaning that it can take in some hooch and not get too terribly drunk from it. Because alcohol is not only a way to make bad decisions on Tinder, but also a fairly decent source of calories (as any college freshman knows), the Dartmouth team wanted to find out if the aye-aye actually preferred more alcohol in its meals – which it can find in the wild in the form of fermented fruit.\nSo, in a study that seems like it was a lot of fun for both the lemur and the humans, they created a bit of booze by fermenting a nectar-simulating solution of sucrose. During a visit to the Duke University Lemur Center, they placed dishes containing the boozy brew on a table outside, and let two aye-ayes, named Morticia and Merlin go to town. They also invited a slow loris named Dharma to the party.\nThe concentration of alcohol in the dishes varied, but only got as high as five percent, to simulate the alcohol concentrations that might be found in fermented fruit in the wild.\nThe researchers found that they aye-ayes showed a clear preference for the dishes with the most alcohol and that they \"continued to probe the containers with the highest concentrations long after they were emptied, suggesting that they wanted more,\" according to a Dartmouth report. Dharma too seemed to really prefer the high-hooch nectar, although the report says that the loris' behavior wasn't tracked enough to be statistically significant.\n\"None of the animals exhibited signs of impaired coordination or behavior, as intoxication was not part of the study,\" says Dartmouth. While that makes the study authors party poopers, it does point out that the animals are likely seeking out alcohol for its caloric — rather than buzz-inducing — properties. Then again, the critters were trying to get more out of the containers, so who knows how long the drinking session might have gone on.\nThe finding is a bit puzzling for the researchers because it's odd that the aye-aye developed a genetic mutation for rapid alcohol metabolism considering that its primary diet consists of grubs. One reason for this might be because the animals can devote up to 20 percent of their feeding time gulping down nectar from a \"traveler's tree,\" a plant specific to Madagascar.\nBeing that the aye-aye shares the same genetic mutation with humans, the study authors feel that their work could shed light on the booze-consuming habits of our early ancestors.\n\"This project has definitely fueled my interest in human evolution\" said Samuel Gochman, one of the study authors. \"Our results support the idea that fermented foods were important in the diets of our ancestors.\"\nQuestion:\nTo which group of primates do Aye Ayes belong?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nFour-minute mile\nIn the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The \"four-minute barrier\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14 km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).\n\nRecord holders\n\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\n\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\n\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. \n\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. \n\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. \n\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. \n\nPossible other claims \n\nJames Parrott\n\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were – following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison – accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\" \n\nGlenn Cunningham\n\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. \n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone).

The word is built upon Greek βέλος belos, \"arrow, dart\" and μαντεία manteia \"divination\". Belomancy  was anciently practised at least by Babylonians, Greeks, Arabs and Scythians.\n\nThe arrows were typically marked with occult symbols and had to have feathers for every method. In one method, different possible answers to a given question were written and tied to each arrow. For example, three arrows would be marked with the phrases, God orders it me, God forbids it me, and the third would be blank. The arrow that flew the furthest indicated the answer. Another method involves the same thing, but without shooting the arrows. They would simply be shuffled in the quiver, worn preferably on the back, and the first arrow to be drawn indicated the answer. If a blank arrow was drawn, they would redraw. \n\nThis was an ancient practice, and probably that mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel 21:21, shown below in the original Hebrew, and translated to English in the New American Standard Bible,\n\n:\"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.\"\n\nSt. Jerome agrees with this understanding of the verse, and observes that the practice was frequent among the Assyrians and Babylonians. Something like it is also mentioned in Hosea 4:12, although a staff or rod is used instead of arrows, which is rather rhabdomancy than belomancy. Grotius, as well as Jerome, confounds the two together, and shows that it prevailed much among the Magi, Chaldean, and Scythians, from which it passed to the Slavonians, and then to the Germans, whom Tacitus observes to make use of it.\n\nA lost traveller might also use belomancy to find his way, by tossing the arrow into the air, and letting its angle show him the way.\n\nThe Book of Mormon describes an oracle known as the Liahona which consisted of two spindles in a brass ball.  One of the spindles would point the direction of travel.  Writings would also appear on this device.\nQuestion:\nWhat is used to tell the future in belomancy?\nAnswer:\nBroad head\nPassage:\nGeorge Scorey\nGeorge Albert Scorey (30 December 1882 - 14 April 1965) was an English soldier and later policeman. He is best known as the rider of the white horse at the 1923 FA Cup Final, played between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United on 28 April 1923, the first FA Cup final to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, which became known as the \"White Horse Final\".\n\nEarly life and army career\n\nScorey was born in Bristol. His father, a shipping clerk and labourer, died in 1887. His mother worked as a charwoman before remarrying in 1903.\n\nScorey enlisted in the British Army in August 1898, joining the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys). He served as a trumpeter in the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), and remained in South Africa until 1905 as part of the colonial garrison. He was an escort when Tsar Nicholas II and other members of the Russian Royal Family visited England in 1909. Scorey was promoted to the rank of sergeant and trumpet major shortly before his 11-year term of enlistment ended, and he re-enlisted in December 1909.\n\nScorey accompanied his regiment to France as part of the 5th Cavalry Brigade in the British Expeditionary Force when the First World War broke out in 1914. He served in the Battle of Mons and the First Battle of Ypres in 1914, the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, and the Battle of Arras in 1917. He remained in France and Belgium until August 1918. He finally left the British Army at the end of August 1919, after completing 21 years of service.\n\nPolice career\n\nAlthough he was shorter than the required minimum height of 5'8\", Scorey was invited to join the Metropolitan Police by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Percy Laurie, who was in charge of the force's Mounted Branch. Laurie was formerly regimental adjutant in the Scots Greys, and offered positions to many of his former comrades. Scorey became a police constable in November 1919, and was quickly allocated to the mounted branch. He was issued horse no. 62, a seven-year-old grey named Billy (or Billie), in June 1920.\n\n1923 FA Cup Final\n\nThe 1923 FA Cup Final, which was the first played at Wembley Stadium, was contested by Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. There were almost 600 police officers and stewards on duty to supervise the event, with a crowd of around 100,000 expected. Scorey was part of the 200-strong reserve of police officers based at Wembley Park Road. The crowd easily numbered over 200,000, vastly exceeded expectations and the stadium's 125,000 capacity, with some estimates of the attendance reaching 300,000. The crush forced thousands of spectators out of the stands and on to the pitch before the scheduled 3pm kick-off.\n\nScorey, with nine other mounted police officers and the others on foot, were called in to control the crowd and clear the pitch. The encroaching spectators were slowly edged back behind the touchlines. The match eventually began 45 minutes late, after King George V had been escorted to the royal box.\n\nBilly, the only grey horse present, was prominent in black-and-white new photographs and newsreels, and the match became known as the \"White Horse Final\". Scorey and Billy - described as an \"officer on a white charger\" - was singled out for attention in press coverage. The Football Association gave him tickets to each subsequent FA Cup Final, but he had little interest in football and did not attend.\n\nPrivate and later life\n\nScorey had married in Edinburgh in December 1909. The couple lived in York, but their son was born in Edinburgh in June 1912. A second son was born in April 1915. Both sons were raised by Scorey's mother-in-law after his wife died of tuberculosis in November 1915.  Scorey remarried in Chislehurst in September 1922.\n\nAfter the 1923 FA Cup Final, Scorey declined invitations to appear in public, and he resumed normal duties with Billy. He was a trumpeter in the Metropolitan Police band, and he performed at horse shows.  He won the King's Cup at the Royal Tournament at Olympia in 1928. Billy died in December 1930, and Laurie presented Scorey with an inkwell made from one of Billy's hooves mounted with silver, which is now held by the Metropolitan Police mounted branch museum at Imber Court, Surrey.\n\nDeclining eyesight forced Scorey to retire in 1939, and he received an ill-health pension. He and his second wife retired to Hove in Sussex and then returned to Chislehurst. He died from bronchial pneumonia at Brook Hospital in Greenwich. His elder son had died in 1929, but he was survived by his wife and younger son from his first marriage.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the horse ridden by PC George Scorey, who gave his name to the FA Cup's 'White Horse Final' of 1923?\nAnswer:\n'BILLIE'\nPassage:\nVietnam | Define Vietnam at Dictionary.com\nVietnam | Define Vietnam at Dictionary.com\nVietnam\n[vee-et-nahm, -nam, vyet-, vee-it-] /viˌɛtˈnɑm, -ˈnæm, ˌvyɛt-, ˌvi ɪt-/\nSpell\nnoun\n1.\nOfficial name Socialist Republic of Vietnam. a country in SE Asia, comprising the former states of Annam, Tonkin, and Cochin-China: formerly part of French Indochina; divided into North Vietnam and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War but now reunified. 126,104 sq. mi.

While her husband is out all day working, Thérèse spends her days confined behind the counter of a small shop and - every Thursday evening - watching her domineering aunt, Madame Raquin, play dominoes with an eclectic group of ne'er-do-wells. Until the Thursday evening that her husband Camille brings an old friend to the party – the alluring Laurent – and she embarks on an illicit affair that leads Thérèse to abandon all her inhibitions and loyalties as their brutal and overwhelming passion overturns both their lives and has results that nobody could have foreseen... In keeping with the innovative and challenging nature of the original work, this radical new musical adaptation uses music and lyrics to heighten and distil the underlying themes, featuring a company of twelve actors playing the main roles of Thérèse, Laurent, Camille and Madame Raquin, as well as their Thursday night domino playing companions and a watchful and distrustful chorus.\n ★ ★ ★ ★ Evening standard            ★ ★ ★ ★ Independant           \n★ ★ ★ ★ West End Frame             ★ ★ ★ ★ Everything Theatre\n \nSANG ET NERFS / AT THE END.\nCompany\nYOU ARE NOT STILL, THERESE\nOarsman, Chorus, Madame and Camille\nTHURSDAY NIGHTS\nOarsman, Grivet, Michaud, Olivier, Suzanne, Camille, Madame, Laurent and Company\nYOU ARE NOT QUIET, THERESE\nOarsman, Madame, Laurent, Camille, Grivet  and Company\nMAY AS WELL AND WHY NOT\nLaurent, Madame and Camille\nCamille, Laurent, Grivet, Therese and Chorus\nA SUNDAY STROLL\nChorus\nReviews\n\"Good Lord!

The widow Judith first charms the Assyrian general Holofernes, then decapitates him in his tent. The painting was rediscovered in 1950 and is part of the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome.\n\nA painting believed by some to be Caravaggio's second version of Judith Beheading Holofernes was discovered in Toulouse in 2014. An export ban was placed on the painting by the French government while tests were carried out to establish its provenance.\n\nSubject \n\nThe deutero-canonical Book of Judith tells how Judith served her people by seducing and pleasuring Holofernes, the Assyrian general. Judith gets Holofernes drunk, then seizes his sword and slays him: \"Approaching to his bed, she took hold of the hair of his head.\" (Judith, 13:7-8).\n\nCaravaggio's approach was, typically, to choose the moment of greatest dramatic impact, the moment of the decapitation itself. The figures are set out in a shallow stage, theatrically lit from the side, isolated against the inky, black background. Judith and her maid Abra stand to the right, partially over Holofernes, who is vulnerable on his back. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it slightly to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate his mastery of emotion, Judith in particular showing in her face a mix of determination and repulsion. Artemisia Gentileschi and others were deeply influenced by this work, and even surpassed Caravaggio's physical realism, but it has been argued that none matched his capture of Judith's psychological ambivalence. \n\nThe model for Judith is probably the Roman courtesan Fillide Melandroni, who posed for several other works by Caravaggio around this year; the scene itself, and especially the details of blood and decapitation, were presumably drawn from his observations of the public execution of Beatrice Cenci a few years before.\nQuestion:\nWhich painter's works include 'Judith beheading Holofernes' in 1598 and 'Supper at Emmaus' in 1602?\nAnswer:\nMorigi, Michaelangelo (Caravaggio)\nPassage:\nWhy is a rabbit's foot considered good luck? | Reference.com\nWhy is a rabbit's foot considered good luck? | Reference.com\nWhy is a rabbit's foot considered good luck?\nA:\nQuick Answer\nSuperstitious people may consider a rabbit's foot to be a good luck charm due to centuries-old belief that this specific anatomical item provides some sort of totemic protection against harm.

It is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream\".   It is popular throughout India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), and the Middle East, and widely available in Indian restaurants in Australia, Europe, East Asia and North America.\n\nAs popularly understood, Kulfi has similarities to ice cream in appearance and taste; however it is denser and creamier.   It comes in various flavours. The more traditional ones are cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio. There are newer variations such as apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, and avocado. Unlike Western ice creams, kulfi is not whipped, resulting in a solid, dense frozen dessert similar to traditional custard-based ice cream. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert. Due to its density, kulfi takes a longer time to melt than Western ice-cream.\n\nHistory \n\nThe word \"kulfi\" is derived from the Persian word for a covered cup. The dessert likely originated in the Mughal Empire (northern India), in the 16th century. The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in Hindu sweet dishes. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of Kulfi. Ain-i-Akbari, a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar's administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas. \n\nPreparation\n\nKulfi is traditionally prepared by evaporating sweetened and flavoured milk via slow cooking, with almost continuous stirring to keep milk from sticking to the bottom of the vessel where it might burn, until its volume was reduced by a half, thus thickening it, increasing its fat, protein, and lactose density. It has a distinctive taste due to caramelization of lactose and sugar during the lengthy cooking process. The semi-condensed mix is then frozen in tight sealed moulds (often kulhars with their mouths sealed) that are then submerged in ice mixed with salt to speed up the freezing process. The ice/salt mix, along with its submerged kulfi moulds, is placed in a matka or an earthen pot that provides insulation from the external heat and slows down the melting of ice. Kulfi prepared in this manner is hence called Matka Kulfi.  Kulfi, thus prepared by slow freezing, also renders a unique smooth mouth feel that is devoid of ice crystals.\n\nAn easier version is to boil the milk and add bread crumbs, mawa (dried whole milk), and sugar while stirring. The cream layer formed on the boiling milk is scooped initially and added in the end to thicken the milk. More recently Kulfi is prepared from evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and heavy (double) cream.   Then sugar is added and the mixture is further boiled and cornstarch-water paste is added. This paste thickens the mixture, although it is boiled for an additional few minutes. Then flavourings, dried fruits, cardamom, etc. are added. The mixture is then cooled, put in moulds and frozen. If frozen in individual-portion custard bowls for service with a spoon, bowls are removed from the freezer 10–15 minutes before serving to allow for melting at the edges.\n\nIt is garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachio nuts. Kulfi is also served with faloodeh (vermicelli noodles made from starch).  In some places, people make it at home and make their own flavors.\n\nTraditionally in India, kulfi is sold by vendors called kulfiwalas, who keep the kulfi frozen by placing the moulds inside a large earthenware pot called a matka, filled with ice and salt. It is served on a leaf or frozen onto a stick. It can be garnished with pistachios, cardamom, and similar items. Often it is served as falooda kulfi, which is kulfi with rice noodles, rose, or any flavour sugar syrup and other ingredients. Popular flavours include pistachio, mango, vanilla, and rose.\nQuestion:\nThe ice cream known as Kulfi originated in which country?\nAnswer:\nഭാരത മഹാരാജ്യം\nPassage:\nCorgi James Bond Aston Martin | eBay\nCorgi James Bond Aston Martin | eBay\nCorgi James Bond Aston Martin\nCorgi James Bond Aston Martin\nCorgi James Bond Aston Martin\nBrowse Related\nThis is a Corgi James Bond Aston Martin D.B.5 Gold Chase car.\nCondition:\n$35.00\nBuy It Now\nThe plinth is in excellent condition but is missing one of the small inner side flaps with a small piece next to it which can be seen in photos #7 and #8.

Times, a movie critic for Los Angeles magazine and a freelance writer for TV Guide, Modern Maturity, the New York Times and Sports Illustrated.  His latest book is entitled \"\"Barack Obama, You're Fired! (And Don't Bother Asking for a Recommendation).\"\n  Print\nI have to hope for the sake of our country’s future that when people voted for Obama they really had no idea what a disaster he would be, even though I kept warning them that he was a left-wing lug nut.  It seemed to me that his legion of fans had been hypnotized or sprinkled with fairy dust.  They blindly accepted that words like “hope” and “change” were complete sentences that actually added up to a national policy.\nWe, who assumed that a grown-up whose friends and mentors were people like Bill Ayers, Jeremiah Wright, Tony Rezko, Saul Alinsky, the folks at ACORN and the most corrupt of Chicago politicians, believed he was more likely to belong in a square cell than in the Oval Office.\nFor my part, I felt a lot like Kevin McCarthy in the movie, “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” trying to warn my fellow earthlings that the pod people were among us and definitely up to no good.\nIt’s not just the big things the man does, things such as the kazillion dollar bailouts, the trichinosis-infested budget and the threat of the Fairness Doctrine being enacted, that make my blood run cold.  It’s not even the allegedly eloquent orator requiring a teleprompter in order to say, “Hello.” What I’m referring to is the commander in chief’s earmarking $900 million for Hamas and, worse yet, proposing we make veterans financially responsible for their own service-related medical treatments. (That comes under the heading of adding insult to injury.)  And let us not forget Obama’s sending the bust of Winston Churchill back to the English embassy and then, compounding that infantile act of boorishness, treating the prime minister of our staunchest ally like a guttersnipe.\nA leading British commentator’s warning to America: “Welcome to Obamaland: I Have Seen Your Future and It Doesn’t Work”\nFunny, I seem to recall Obama’s partisans insisting that he would personally make the United States popular the world over.  Well, so far, he has certainly reached out to Cuba, Venezuela and Iran, and I suppose if he actually closes Gitmo, Islamics will dance in the street of Tehran just before dropping the bomb on Israel.\nRegarding the recent brouhaha, I’m afraid I’m one of the few people who wasn’t up in arms over the AIG bonuses.  To me, they were just an obvious distraction by the administration, just like the unwarranted attacks on Rush Limbaugh or Clinton’s bombing of the pharmaceutical factory.  I’m not saying I was happy about the bonuses, but a contract is a contract, and I prefer to see a bunch of scumbags collect their undeserved millions than to see the day that contracts in America are no longer worth the paper they’re written on.\nI keep hearing people on the radio and TV going ballistic over the fact that employees at a failed company were collecting as much as 4 million taxpayer dollars for being rotten at their jobs, and I’m sick and tired of it.  How is it that nobody is demanding that 435 self-righteous congressmen and 100 arrogant senators give back their salaries?  They’re the folks who not only oversaw a failing economy, but, thanks to pushing sub-prime home loans on people who didn’t have a pot to pi– in, did the most to cause the financial calamity in the first place.\nOn top of all that, I’ve heard that Obama and his legislative cronies plan to give AIG at least another 30 billion before they’re done.  So how about, instead of having to watch politicians grandstanding over the measly $165 million in bonuses and Charlie Schumer’s threatening to get the money back by having the IRS bludgeon these folks to death, the schmucks in Washington just write the company a check for $29,835,000,000 the next time around?\nI understand that, according to some recent polls, Obama and the Democrats, in spite of a pandering media, are losing some of their allure after a relatively brief honeymoon.  Which can’t help but remind me of a line attributed to Oscar Wilde, that Niagara Falls is only the second biggest disappointment in the life of an American bride.\nSomeone recently suggested that in less than three months, Obama went from being a messiah to being a mess.  However, here in Hollywood, he is still sheer magic.  They utter his name with the same reverence as when Christians refer to Jesus or Bill Maher refers to himself.\nBut, then, Hollywood is a peculiar place where celebrities who treat their own assistants and household help like underpaid coolies are constantly demanding that Washington should do more for the poor and the oppressed.  Hollywood is where actors think God was created in their image, while actresses are so full of plastic and collagen that even their own dogs can’t pick them out of a crowd.\nI’m sure that Sean Penn thinks he should be ambassador to Cuba, and if only he owed back taxes, I’m certain this administration would give him the gig.\nEven as I dream of the day when conservatives take back the reins of government, I worry that in the meantime the liberals will find a way to place a luxury tax on our dreams.\nFinally, in case any of you were wondering, it will be 117,936,218 seconds until Obama’s term ends.

There is also a river winding through the mountains on which boat trips can be taken.\n\nRock formations\n\nAmong other attractions that make the Danxia range interesting, the area has the following characteristic stone formations: \n*Yang Yuan Stone, (' \"male/father stone\") bearing a remarkable resemblance to a phallus\n*Yin Yuan Stone or ' hole, which somewhat resembles the female vulva.\n*Breasts Stone, human breast-shaped rocky outcrops on a cliff hanging 30 m above the ground.  \n*Sleeping Beauty, a rocky range resembling a sleeping maiden. \n\nWorld Heritage Site\n\nIn the 2010 UNESCO list of world heritage sites, Mount Danxia was recorded as a natural World Heritage Site as part of China's Danxia landform. \n\nFeatures\n\nFile:Danxiashan yangyuanshi.jpg|Yang Yuan Stone\nFile:Danxiashan_yinyuandan.jpg|Yin Yuan Stone\nFile:Danxia 0746.JPG|Red cliff\nFile:Danxia 0822.JPG|Craggy face\nFile:Shaoshishan.jpg|Shaoshi rocky summits\nQuestion:\nMount Danxia, the World Heritage Site containing spectacular red-striped sandstone landscape, including two bizarrely realistic (male and female) phallic rock formations, is in which country?\nAnswer:\nChinese People's Republic\nPassage:\nHylophobia\nHylophobia, also known as xylophobia, ylophobia, and dendrophobia, is a psychological disorder defined by an irrational fear of wood, forest or trees.  It is a type of specific phobia.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term hylophobia is derived from the Greek ὕλη hylo-, meaning \"wood or forest\", and phobo- meaning \"fear\".  \n\nCauses and contributing factors\n\nMost phobias start through an incident or memory in childhood, and hylophobia is no different. \n\nTreatments\n\nPhobias such as hylophobia are usually treated by putting the patient in therapy and making them recall the incident in question, and making them see it from an adult perspective. This is often a hard task, as the original incident will have been forgotten, and hypnosis or anti-anxiety medicine may have to be used.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* In the BBC television show New Tricks, Dennis Waterman's character, Gerry Standing, admits to suffering from hylophobia in the second season.  Subsequently, his fear is occasionally mentioned or used as a plot element throughout the series, particularly when the Unsolved Crimes and Open Case squad are required to visit crime scenes in forested areas near London. In the tenth season, the character seeks treatment for hylophobia.\n* In the The Simpsons Episode 21 of Season 20 , \"Coming to Homerica\", Lisa mistakenly says it is the fear of xylophones.\n* In \"Uncle Grandpa\", Hot Dog Person stated that he was afraid of trees but when he climbed a telephone post which he thought of as a tree, he conquered his fear.\n*In Wynonna Earp, TV series, there is reference to Hylophobia in episode 10, first season.\nQuestion:\nOf what is 'dendrophobia' a fear?\nAnswer:\nSapling\n", "answers": ["Lemuroid", "Lemuriens", "LEMURS", "Lemur", "Lemuroidea", "Lemurs", "Lemurs of Madagascar"], "length": 7220, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "565c79f32aac554fabbc844df8702d54322d7b53d3c8eaef"}

During the 19th cent. British art was poorly represented in the national collections. The 1840s and 1850s saw a number of important bequests to the nation, including that of sculptor  Sir  Francis Chantrey , who left his fortune for the purchase of ‘Works of Fine Art … [by] artists resident in Great Britain ’, and the enormous Turner bequest, which the National Gallery was unable to house adequately. In 1890 the sugar magnate  Henry  Tate gave 60 modern English paintings to the National Gallery provided that a gallery was made available. The offer was twice withdrawn as arguments delayed the provision of a suitable site and funding for a new gallery. Eventually the government offered the prison site at Millbank, London, and the Tate Gallery opened in 1897.\nWealthy benefactors have continued to aid expansion; in 1987 the Turner bequest was finally housed as the artist intended, in the extension funded by the Clore Foundation. The Bankside power station was converted into the Tate Modern, opened in 2000, and the original gallery was renamed Tate Britain.\nJune  Cochrane\nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\nMLA\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.\nCopyright The Columbia University Press\nTate Gallery, London, originally the National Gallery of British Art.

The character is a cinematic adaptation of the character Honeychile Rider , who first appeared in Ian Fleming 's 1958 novel of the same name and was subsequently re-imagined for the 2015 mobile game James Bond: World of Espionage . The character was portrayed by Ursula Andress and was voiced by Nikki van der Zyl .\nContents\n[ show ]\nFilm biography\nHaving drawn a link between the murder of British spy John Strangways and radioactive samples he had taken from an island named Crab Key (owned by the reclusive Dr. Julius No ) Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him there by boat. There Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder, dressed only in a white bikini, who is collecting shells. She emerges from the sea, singing. At first she is suspicious of Bond but soon decides to help him after the island's guards destroy her boat. Bond and Quarrel follow her to a hiding place inland. After nightfall they are attacked by the legendary \" dragon \" of Crab Key, which turns out to be an armoured tractor equipped with a flamethrower. In the resulting gun battle, Quarrel is incinerated whilst Bond and Ryder are taken prisoner. They are decontaminated, quartered in Dr. No's lair, and given drugged coffee to render them unconscious. They dress and meet Dr. No in his office, where he invites them to lunch. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards. Later, after killing Dr. No and sabotaging the island's reactor, Bond rescues Honey from being slowly drowned. As the complex explodes, the pair escape by boat until they run out of gas in the middle of the sea, and start kissing.\nBehind the scenes\nAs \"The Original Bond Girl\"\nHoney Ryder emerges from the sea in an iconic scene from Dr. No (1962).\nIn the film series, Ryder is widely regarded as the first Bond girl , although she is not the first woman in the film to be with Bond (that distinction belongs to Sylvia Trench , while Miss Taro was Bond's first mission-related \"conquest\"). Her entrance in the film, emerging from the ocean in a white bikini, striding barefoot over the wet beach sand, with a large sea shell in one hand and a hunting knife in the other, while the sun shines on her wet blonde hair, is considered a classic James Bond moment and is one of the most popular scenes in cinematic history. As a homage, Halle Berry performed a similar scene in an orange bikini in the 20th James Bond film, Die Another Day . Mariah Carey also references this scene in the music video for her song \"Honey\".\nThe character was later mentioned by name in On Her Majesty's Secret Service as a \"beautiful movie star.\" Andress is the first of only two entertainers that have actually starred in a Bond film to be mentioned by Fleming in his James Bond novels. The other is David Niven who co-starred as James Bond in the 1967 film adaptation of Casino Royale along with Andress.\nOmitted scenes\nStill photograph of the original crab torture scene in Dr. No.\nThe 1958 James Bond novel Dr. No by Ian Fleming, Crab Key is named after the thousands of large land crabs – what they call in Jamaica \"black crabs\" – which infest the island. The book features a scene where Dr. No plans to torture Honey to death by tying her naked to the ground in the path of the crabs' migration; mistakenly believing that the animals are carnivorous from the death of an earlier victim. A similar scene was initially replicated for the 1962 film with Honey being tortured by being tied to the ground along with crabs, but since the crabs were sent frozen from the Caribbean, they did not move much during filming, so the scene was altered to have Honey slowly drowning. [1]\nGallery\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of 'Dr. No' in the film of that name?\nAnswer:\n'JULIUS'\nPassage:\nPaprika\nPaprika is a spice made from air-dried fruits of the chili pepper family of the species Capsicum annuum. Although paprika is often associated with Hungarian cuisine, the chilies from which it is made are native to the New World, introduced to the Old World from the Americas. Originating in central Mexico it was brought to Spain in the 16th century. The seasoning is also used to add color and flavor to many types of dishes.\n\nThe trade in paprika expanded from Iberia to Africa and Asia,  and ultimately reached Central Europe through the Balkans, then under Ottoman rule, which explains the Hungarian origin of the modern English term. In Spanish, paprika has been known as pimentón since the 16th century, when it became a typical ingredient of the western region of Extremadura.  Despite its presence in Central Europe since the beginning of Ottoman conquests, it did not become popular in Hungary until the late 19th century. \n\nPaprika can range from mild to hot, and flavors also vary from country to country, but almost all plants grown produce the sweet variety. Sweet paprika is mostly composed of the pericarp, with more than half of the seeds removed, whereas hot paprika contains some seeds, placentas, calyces, and stalks.\n\nEtymology and history \n\nThe plant that makes the Hungarian version of the spice was grown from 1529 by the Turks at Buda  (now part of the capital of Hungary, Budapest). The first recorded use of the word \"paprika\" in English is from 1896, although an earlier reference to Turkish paprika was published in 1831.  The word derives from the Hungarian word paprika, a diminutive of the Serbo-Croatian word papar (meaning \"pepper\"),  which in turn came from the Latin piper or modern Greek piperi. Paprika and similar words, peperke, piperke, and paparka, are used in various Slavic languages in the Balkans for bell peppers.\n\nThe word \"paprika\" entered a large number of languages, in many cases probably via German.  European languages use a similar word, while examples from other languages include the Japanese papurika.\n\nCentral European paprika was hot until the 1920s when a Szeged breeder found one plant that produced sweet fruit, then grafted it onto other plants. \n\nUsage \n\nPaprika is produced in various places including Hungary, Serbia, Spain and some regions of the United States.  It is used as an ingredient in a broad variety of dishes throughout the world. It is principally used to season and color rices, stews, and soups, such as goulash, and in the preparation of sausages as an ingredient mixed with meats and other spices. In the United States, paprika is frequently sprinkled on foods as a garnish, but the flavor is more effectively produced by heating it gently in oil. \n\nSpanish paprika (pimentón) is available in three versions — mild (pimentón dulce), moderately spicy (pimentón agridulce), and very spicy (pimentón picante).  Some Spanish paprika, including pimentón de la Vera has a distinct smoky flavor and aroma, as it is dried by smoking, typically using oak wood. \n\nHungary is a major source of commonly used paprika. It is available in grades (in America) ranging as:\n* Special quality (különleges) the mildest, very sweet with a deep bright red color\n* Delicate (csípősmentes csemege) – color from light to dark red, a mild paprika with a rich flavor\n* Exquisite delicate (csemegepaprika) – similar to delicate, but more pungent\n* Pungent exquisite delicate (csípős csemege, pikáns) – an even more pungent version of delicate\n* Rose (rózsa) – pale red in color with strong aroma and mild pungency\n* Noble sweet (Édesnemes) – the most commonly exported paprika; bright red and slightly pungent\n* Half-sweet (félédes) – a blend of mild and pungent paprikas; medium pungency\n* Strong (erős) – light brown in color, the hottest paprika \n\nHungarian paprika is often specified in recipes, because it is unique. It is bright red and said to be sweeter than the same paprika grown in other soils and climates. Other paprika types have their unique niche, so it is important to use the type of paprika specified in recipes (if specified), unless it is used in small quantities. In \"paprikash\" (paprika gravy, a combination of broth, paprika, and sour cream), paprika is used by the tablespoonful. In such instances, Hungarian paprika is preferred.\n\n\"The Hungarian varieties are more robust and considered superior. The Spanish varieties are sweeter and milder.  Most tables in Hungary are set with salt and hot paprika (not black pepper) shakers. One particular variety, the 'rose', known for its sweet aroma and brilliant color, is prized above all others. Hungarian agricultural authorities fiercely guard their plants and seeds and twice as much acreage is devoted to peppers as any other crop.\" \n\n\"Due to the favourable climate and geographical conditions, Hungarian paprika has a bright red colour and a distinctive rich flavour that allowed Hungary to become one of the leading paprika producers in the world ... Kalocsa and Szeged in the southern part of Hungary are the heart of paprika production in Hungary. These regions have the highest amount of sunny hours a year and paprika plants need lots of sunshine to get ripe and sweet.\" \n\nThe Netherlands is a major production and distribution source of paprika, as well, especially grown in greenhouses.\n\nIn Moroccan cuisine, paprika (tahmira) is usually found augmented by the addition of a small amount of olive oil blended into it.\n\nPaprika can also be used with henna to bring a reddish tint to hair when coloring it. Paprika powder can be added to henna powder when prepared at home.\n\nThe color of paprika is primarily due to zeaxanthin.\n\nNutrition \n\nAccording to information published by the United States Department of Agriculture, 1 tbsp (6.8 g) of paprika has this nutritional content: \n\n* Calories: 19\n* Fat: 0.88 g\n* Carbohydrates: 3.67 g\n* Fiber: 2.4 g\n* Protein: 0.96 g\nQuestion:\nPaprika is the Hungarian word for what?\nAnswer:\nPeppers (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nRay Winstone bet365 Advert Live Odds - YouTube\nRay Winstone bet365 Advert Live Odds - YouTube\nRay Winstone bet365 Advert Live Odds\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nThe interactive transcript could not be loaded.\nLoading...\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

It is also found in Lake Baikal. It normally inhabits slow-moving freshwater habitats, particularly lakes and lowland rivers.B. Whitton (1982). Rivers, Lakes and Marshes p 163. Hodder & Staughton, London. In Germany, the tench is called Schlei.\n\nEcology\n\nThe tench is most often found in still waters with a clay or muddy substrate and abundant vegetation.A. F. Magri MacMahon (1946). Fishlore, pp 156-158. Pelican Books. This species is rare in clear waters across stony substrate, and is absent altogether from fast-flowing streams. It tolerates water with a low oxygen concentration, being found in waters where even the carp cannot survive.\n\nTench feed mostly at night with a preference for animals, such as chironomids, on the bottom of eutrophic watershttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1996.tb01481.x/abstract and snails and pea clams in well-vegetated waters.\n\nBreeding takes place in shallow water usually among aquatic plants where the sticky green eggs can be deposited. Spawning usually occurs in summer, and as many as 300,000 eggs may be produced.A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes, pp 101-105. Frederick Warne & Co. Growth is rapid, and fish may reach a weight of 0.11 kg (0.25 lb) within the first year.\n\nMorphology\n\nTench have a stocky, carp-like shape and olive-green skin, darker above and almost golden below. The caudal fin is square in shape. The other fins are distinctly rounded in shape. The mouth is rather narrow and provided at each corner with a very small barbel. Maximum size is 70 cm, though most specimens are much smaller.G. Sterba (1962). Freshwater Fishes of the World pp 249-250. Vista Books, London. A record fish caught in 2001 in England had a weight of 15 lb 3 oz (6.89 kg). The eyes are small and red-orange in colour.Females can reach weights of around 7 kg, although 4 kg is considered large. Males rarely reach over 3 kg. Sexual dimorphism is weak, limited to the adult females having a more convex ventral profile when compared with males. Males may also possess a very thick and flattened outer ray to the ventral fins. Males are generally smaller than females, but can be recognised by having more curved lower fins and noticeable muscles around the base of the fins generally absent in female.\n\nThe tench has very small scales, which are deeply imbedded in a thick skin, making it as slippery as an eel. Folklore has it that this slime cured any sick fish that rubbed against it, and from this belief arose the name doctor fish.\n\nGolden tench\n\nAn artificially bred variety of tench called the golden tench  is a popular ornamental fish for ponds. This form varies in colour from pale gold through to dark red, and some fish have black or red spots on the flanks and fins. Though somewhat similar to the goldfish, because these fish have such small scales, their quality is rather different.\n\nEconomic significance\n\nTench are edible, working well in recipes that would otherwise call for carp. They are an important target for coarse angling and are used as fodder for predatory species such as bass. Tench, particularly golden tench, are also kept as ornamental fish in ponds and less frequently aquaria.Dick Mills (2000). Understanding Coldwater Fish, p 106. Interpet Publishing. ISBN 1-903098-10-6\n\nAngling\n\nLarge tench may be found in gravel pits or deep, slow-moving waters with a clayey or silty bottom and copious  aquatic vegetation. The best methods and bait to catch tench are float fishing and legering with a swim feeder using maggots, sweetcorn, pellets, bread, and worms. Fish over 1 kg (2 lb) in weight are very strong fighters when caught on a rod.A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes, pp 101-103. Frederick Warne & Co.\nQuestion:\nWhich fish, Tinca tinca, do anglers call the ‘doctor fish’?\nAnswer:\nTincinae\nPassage:\nCharlie Chalk\nCharlie Chalk is a stop motion animation series produced in 1987 in the United Kingdom by Woodland Animations, who also produced the children's television programmes Postman Pat, Gran and Bertha. Reception to the show was mostly positive.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe series tells the story of Charlie Chalk - a jolly clown who, after falling asleep whilst fishing out at sea, ends up on a strange island by the name of Merrytwit (as explained in the title sequence before each episode). Characters had to be aware of coconuts which constantly fell from the trees on the island.\n\nThe pilot episode of the series (entitled 'Shipwrecked Charlie') finds Charlie having just landed on Merrytwit, and after making friends with some of its inhabitants, decides to stay and build a home there. The following episodes follow Charlie and his new friends on various adventures on the island.\n\nMain characters\n\n* Charlie Chalk: A good natured and friendly peaceful clown, he was out on a fishing trip, when he ended up on Merrytwit Island. In the theme tune, he is described as having \"a funny way of walking and a wacky way of chalking\". He was voiced by Michael Williams. His 'funny way of walking' is demonstrated when on occasion he tumbles in an acrobatic circus-style through frames, around obstacles, or just to show folks how happy he is. He also has the ability to do magic tricks.\n* Captain Mildred: The boss, who loves to see everyone hard at work and has the practice of listing things that have to be done: \"a: do this; b: do that\" etc. She lives on the beached ship Buttercup.\n* Mary the Hover Fairy: An old fairy who often proves useful due to her ability to cast spells, provided her magic wand, Houdini, has not wandered off again. She is getting old, so has decided to settle down on Merrytwit. She now lives on Buttercup, serving as Mildred's first mate.\n* Lewis T. Duck: A small duck with a short temper. He is full of ideas, and believes them to be the best, so is quick to inform people that he is \"always right\". He can be quite friendly but lacks patience. The 'T' stands for 'The'.\n* Arnold the Elephant: A pink elephant, who is quite jolly, but also very clumsy, much to the annoyance of Lewis, who always seems to be on the receiving end of Arnold's bouts of clumsiness.\n* Edward: A monkey who spends his time sleeping and has quite a dislike for work.\n* Trader Jones: Trader is the island's odd job man. Not only does he drive a bike which acts as a taxi and a means of transporting goods, he also owns a general supplies store on the island: 'if you want it, he's got it.' He never accepts money, he only trades e.g. a supply of bananas may cost a day's beachcombing.\n* Bert: A giant monster, discovered by Charlie, Arnold and Lewis in The Mountain that Moaned episode. He lives inside a cave, and whilst an extremely friendly monster, he is quite lacking in intelligence.\n* Litterbug: A tiny little bug who is kept busy tidying up litter around the island. He often complains about the amount of litter, but does not realise there would be far less litter if his sack did not have a hole in it. Being so tiny, he is not always noticed, a fact which further frustrates him.\n\nEpisodes\n\nThe series consisted of 13 original episodes, as listed below:\n\nMerchandise\n\n* Charlie Chalk - The Complete Series features all 13 episodes and is currently available in the UK on a single DVD release. It was made by Right Entertainment plc in 2005.\n* In 1994, Redrock Records released a Charlie Chalk LP. It included the several incidental songs played on the show and the full Charlie Chalk theme song which includes some previously unheard lyrics.\n* A new Charlie Chalk CD has been developed in America.\n* The UK based restaurant chain Brewers Fayre originally used Charlie Chalk as their mascot.\n* Charlie Chalk Fun Factory was a play area for little kids, found in large Pubs across the United Kingdom, now only found around Aberdeen.\n\nTrivia\n\n* The show aired on ABC TV in Australia. (1 April 1991 – 28 January 1997)\n\nStarring\n\n* Michael Williams as Charlie Chalk, Louis T Duck, Trader Jones, Litterbug and Rabbit\n* Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Captain Mildred, Mary the Hover Fairy and Ponka the Toucan\n* John Wells as Arnold The Elephant, Edward and Bert\n* Ken Barrie as Song vocals\n\nUK VHS releases\n\nAll 13 episodes were released on three BBC Videos in the UK between 1988 and 1991.\n\nIn 1995, a WHSmith Exclusive Children's Video by Tempo Video/Abbey Home Entertainment was released in store.\n\nAlso in 1995, two 'Tempo Kids Club' videos (each with two stories on each tape) in the Abbey Home Entertainment series were released.\n\nIn 1999 The Contender Group released two videos under the 'Nippers' children's video label.\nQuestion:\n\"Which popular Restaurant chain, launched in 1979 now has over 125 different outlets Originally had a mascot named Charlie Chalk and has the advertising slogan \"\"Pub Food As It Should Be\"\" ?\"\nAnswer:\nBREWER'S FAYRE\nPassage:\nCanaletto | The Stonemason's Yard | NG127 | National ...\nCanaletto | The Stonemason's Yard | NG127 | National Gallery, London\n£ other\nMake this a monthly donation\n[{\"Amount\":2.0000,\"CurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"DonationDate\":\"2016-10-20T16:29:27\",\"DonorDisplayName\":\"Joshua Beaumont Houghton Boston\",\"DonorLocalAmount\":2.0000,\"DonorLocalCurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"EstimatedTaxReclaim\":0.0000,\"ImageUrl\":\"https://www.justgiving.com/content/images/graphics/icons/avatars/facebook-avatar.gif\",\"Message\":\"Thank you for being you!\"},{\"Amount\":2.0000,\"CurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"DonationDate\":\"2016-10-25T09:01:14\",\"DonorDisplayName\":\"Richard Roberts\",\"DonorLocalAmount\":2.0000,\"DonorLocalCurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"EstimatedTaxReclaim\":0.5000,\"ImageUrl\":\"http://images.justgiving.com/image/24d4733d-a317-4e81-8d0c-014c91259172.jpg?template=profilesummary\",\"Message\":\"I hope this small contribution will allow you to continue your excellent work\"},{\"Amount\":20.0000,\"CurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"DonationDate\":\"2016-11-10T19:31:19\",\"DonorDisplayName\":\"Kate English\",\"DonorLocalAmount\":20.0000,\"DonorLocalCurrencyCode\":\"GBP\",\"EstimatedTaxReclaim\":5.0000,\"ImageUrl\":\"https://www.justgiving.com/content/images/graphics/icons/avatars/facebook-avatar.gif\",\"Message\":\"What an amazing institution!

Vidal, looking over the Grand Canal to the church of S. Maria della Carità (Saint Mary of Charity). The square has been temporarily transformed into a workshop for repairing the nearby church (not seen in the picture) of S. Vidal. The blocks of Istrian stone were brought by water to the square. The 'campanile' (bell-tower) of the church of S. Maria della Carità on the far side of the Grand Canal collapsed in 1744, after the painting was made, and was not rebuilt.\nThe painting is not precisely datable but the bold composition , the densely applied paint and the careful execution of the figures are characteristic of Canaletto's works of the mid- to late 1720s. The informal nature of the scene and the unusual view across the Grand Canal suggest that it was made for a local Venetian patron rather than a foreign visitor to Venice.\nThis picture was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8.\nShare this painting\nQuestion:\nWhich Italian artist painted “The Stonemason’s Yard”?\nAnswer:\nAntonio Canal\nPassage:\nKarina Hollekim\nKarina Hollekim (born April 25, 1976) is a Norwegian free skier and BASE jumper.

In Old Grog's day, sailors in the Royal Navy were customarily given a daily ration of rum, but in 1740 the admiral, concerned about the health of his men, ordered that the rum should be diluted with water. The decision wasn't very popular with the sailors, who supposedly dubbed the mixture \"grog\" after Vernon. Today, \"grog\" can be used as a general term for any liquor, even undiluted, and someone who acts drunk or shaky can be called \"groggy.\"\nOrigin and Etymology of grog\nOld Grog, nickname of Edward Vernon †1757 English admiral responsible for diluting the sailors' rum\nFirst Known Use: 1756\ngrog Synonyms\nSynonyms\nQuestion:\nWhich word now used loosely, originally described rum diluted with water?\nAnswer:\nGrog\n", "answers": ["Bankside Power Station", "Bankside Power station", "(Bankside) Power Station"], "length": 4715, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e952d435861e3435ec4744727c161eeabb4f914c56e0a8a1"}
{"input": "Passage:\nBonspiel\nA Bonspiel is a curling tournament, consisting of several games, often held on a weekend. Until the 20th century most bonspiels were held outdoors, on a frozen freshwater loch. Today almost all bonspiels are held indoors on specially prepared artificial ice. Though it is not mandatory, curling teams at bonspiels often wear themed costumes.\n\nBonspiels in North America\n\nCanada\n\nBonspiels originated in Scotland, but the most notable competitive curling tournament in the world nowadays is The Brier, the Canadian Men's Curling Championship. For Canadians, this tournament equals or nearly equals the importance of the Olympics and the World Curling Championship. The Canadian Women's Curling Championship tournament is called Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Several Cashspiels are played in Canada every year. The most important cashspiels are part of the World Curling Tour (WCT). Many local curling clubs and other organizations in Canada also host casual, social bonspiels.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States Curling Association (USA Curling) is the national governing body of the sport in the United States. Many bonspiels are listed on [http://www.usacurl.org/ the USA Curling website].  Most bonspiels in the United States are held indoors in dedicated curling facilities. Bonspiels are popular throughout the United States during curling season, typically October through April. Some special bonspiels are held in the summer as well as some that are hosted by clubs that play on arena ice as there are usually fewer scheduling conflicts with other sports at the area such as hockey and figure skating.\n\nBonspiels in Europe\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, outdoor bonspiels are now very rare; most lochs that formerly hosted bonspiels, such as Loch Earn, rarely freeze over anymore. The word spiel is sometimes used to refer to an informal curling game, as in parish spiel. The most important Cashspiels in Scotland are part of the Curling Champions Tour (CCT), previously known as the World Curling Tour Europe (WCT-E).\n\nOther European countries\n\nDozens of bonspiels are held in European countries every year. Switzerland hosts multiple Curling Champions Tour events.\n\nBonspiels elsewhere\n\nNew Zealand\n\nCurling bonspiels are held when ice conditions permit in the Maniototo, part of Central Otago in the South Island. The region is one of the few in New Zealand to have conditions suitable for outdoor curling, and is also a fitting site for the sport given that Otago's original European settlers were mainly from Scotland. Several artificial and natural lakes around the towns of Oturehua, Naseby and Patearoa provide good conditions, on average every second or third year.\n\nThe national bonspiel has been held when conditions permit since 1879, with Oturehua's Idaburn Dam the venue since 1932.  The most recent national bonspiel, the 65th, was held on 9–10 July 2012.  Owing to the difficulty of getting teams to the relatively inaccessible venue, it is rare for teams to travel from outside the southern South Island to the bonspiel.\n\nIndoor curling rinks exist in Otago's main centre, Dunedin (at the Dunedin Ice Stadium), and in the towns of Naseby, Otago and Gore, Southland, and also further north in the country's largest city, Auckland. Open air ice rinks exist in Naseby and Alexandra. \n\nList of Notable Bonspiels\n\n* The largest outdoor bonspiel in the world, the \"[http://www.ironmancurling.com Ironman Outdoor Curling Bonspiel]\" held on the Assiniboine River in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, has been held at The Forks Historic Port every February since 2002. In 2015 there were 72 teams competing.\n* One of the longest-running outdoor bonspiels in the world, the Bonspiel on the Lake in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, has been held on Lake Windermere every January since 1982.  Each year 64 teams compete.\n* The Bonspiel or the Grand Match, between the north and the south of Scotland, is held on a frozen loch (most recently the Lake of Menteith, Stirling) when the winter is cold enough. It was last held in 1979.\n* The Crush Bonspiel in Placer Valley, California, is notorious for its unique combination of curling tournament play and wine festival.  This tournament originated in Vacaville in 2006 but was moved to Roseville  in 2012 because of its rising popularity in surrounding areas.\n* The Brier (Men's Senior Championship of the Canadian Curling Association) is regarded by most curlers as the world's premier curling championship\n* The Tournament of Hearts (Canadian Ladies Curling Association Championship)\n* The Men's World Curling Championship (Scotch Cup/Silver Broom) WCF WCC\n* The Women's World Curling Championship WCC\n* The World Junior Curling Championship (WJCC) WCF\n* The Winter Olympics\n\nOrigin of the word \"Bonspiel\"\n\nThe origin of the word is primarily Gaelic.\n\nSince curling is believed to have originated in Scotland, it is likely that \"bonspiel\" is a modern adaptation of the Scottish Gaelic words \"bonn\" (coin)  and \"spéil\" (skate)  meaning \"coin skate\" or \"cornerstone skate\" (archaic definition). \n\n\"Spiel\" may also have been a Germanic borrowing, meaning \"game\". In that case, the word may have meant \"cornerstone game\".\nQuestion:\nIf you had two eight enders in one bonspiel what are you playing\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nWawel Castle\nThe Wawel Castle is a castle residency built at the behest of King Casimir III the Great, who reigned from 1333 to 1370, and consists of a number of structures situated around the central courtyard.\n\nIn the 14th century it was rebuilt by Jogaila and Jadwiga of Poland. Their reign saw the addition of the tower called the Hen's Foot (Kurza Stopka) and the Danish Tower.  The Jadwiga and Jogaila Chamber, in which the sword Szczerbiec, was used in coronation ceremonies, is exhibited today and is another remnant of this period. Other structures were developed on the hill during that time as well, in order to serve as quarters for the numerous clergy, royal clerks and craftsmen. Defensive walls and towers such as Jordanka, Lubranka, Sandomierska, Tęczyńska, Szlachecka, Złodziejska and Panieńska were erected in the same period.\n\nThe Wawel Royal Castle and the Wawel Hill constitute the most historically and culturally important site in Poland. For centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, the Castle is now one of the country’s premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith’s work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum’s holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art.\n\nHistory \n\nPeople have lived on Wawel Hill at the site of the Castle as early as fifty thousand years ago, in the Paleolithic Age. The settlement was apparently bustling with trade, assorted crafts and local farming. When more people began to settle down on the Wawel Hill and when trade became more efficient, the rulers of Poland took up their residence at the Hill as well.\n\nDuring the early 16th century King Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I in Polish) and his wife brought in the best native and foreign artists including Italian architects, sculptors, and German decorators, to refurbish the castle into a splendid Renaissance palace.  It soon became a paragon of stately residence in Central and Eastern Europe and served widely as a model throughout the region.\n\nIn the fire of 1595, the northeast part of the castle burned down.  King Sigismund III Vasa rebuilt it, although of his efforts only the Senator Stairs and the fireplace in the Bird Room remain today. In 1609 King Sigismund moved the capital to Warsaw, and tough times for Wawel began. Both the castle and other buildings were neglected despite the concerns of local governors. The Swedish invasions of 1655–1657 and 1702 contributed to the further deterioration of the castle.  \n\nThe Hill was occupied by the Prussian Army in 1794. Royal Insignia were stolen and never retrieved (apart from the Szczerbiec).  After the Third Partition of Poland (1795) Wawel, as an important defensive point, was mostly demolished and the remaining part was modernised by Austrians with defensive walls. The interior of the castle was changed and some of the buildings pulled down. In the second part of the 19th century the Austrians redesigned the defensive walls making them a part of a stronghold. However, in 1905 the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria gave an order for Austrian troops to leave Wawel. Restoration works began, with the discovery of the Rotunda of Virgin Mary as well as other relics of the past. The renovations of the Wawel Hill were financed by public subscriptions.\n\nAfter World War I, the authorities of the newly independent Polish Second Republic decided that Wawel Castle was to become a representative building of the Polish state and would be used by the Governor and later by the President himself. In 1921 the Polish Parliament passed a resolution which gave Wawel official status as the residence of the President of Poland. Following the ravages of World War II, by the decree of the State National Council, Wawel Castle became a national museum.\n\nCrown Treasury and armory \n\nThe Crown Treasury situated in the historic Gothic rooms which were used from the 15th century on for storing the Polish coronation insignia and Crown Jewels, feature on display priceless objects from the former Treasury that survived plunder, among them the memorabilia of Polish monarchs including members of their families and eminent personages, like the hat and sword given to John III Sobieski by the pope after the Battle of Vienna, as well as the coronation sword Szczerbiec.\n\nChambers \n\n* State Rooms\n* Royal Private Apartments\n* Exhibition \"The Lost Wawel\"\n* Exhibition \"Oriental Art\"\n* The Royal Gardens\n* Dragon's Den\n\nFragment in Chicago \n\nA column fragment of Wawel Castle has been incorporated into Chicago's landmark Tribune Tower. Located in its own niche over the upper-left corner of the main entrance, it is a visual tribute to Chicago's large Polish populace, the largest such presence outside of the Republic of Poland.\n\nGallery \n\nFile:Wawel end 16th cent.jpg|A woodcut of Wawel Castle in 1617.\nFile:Wawel z mostu Debnickiego (2007).jpg|The castle seen from the Dębnicki Bridge. \nFile:Krakau - Wawel-Weichsel-Panorama.JPG|Panorama of the Wawel Complex\nImage:Krakow Wawel 20070804 0930.jpg|Sigismund III Vasa Tower (1595) and defensive walls.\nImage:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|St. Leonard's Crypt under the Wawel Castle.\nFile:Wawel Royal Castle Krakow Poland by blaat.jpg | Wawel Royal Castle from the Vistulan Boulevards. \nImage:Rotunda sw.

In general, space stations have the ability for other spacecraft to dock to them.  , the International Space Station and Tiangong 1 are the only operational space stations currently in orbit. Previous stations include the Salyut and Almaz series, Skylab, and, most recently, Mir. \n\nSpace stations are used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body.  They also serve as a platform for extended scientific studies.  All space stations have been designed with the intention of rotating multiple crews, with each crew member staying aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. , Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, and Valeriy Polyakov have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard Mir. \n\nSpace stations have been used for both military and civilian purposes. The first military-use space station was Salyut 2, which was launched by the Soviet Almaz program in 1973.   The Soviet Union also claimed the first civilian space station with the launch of Salyut 1.  , Russia, China, and private companies are building space stations.\n\nPast stations \n\nThese stations have re-entered the atmosphere and disintegrated.\n\nThe Soviet Union ran two programs simultaneously, both of which were known to the outside world as Salyut.  The Long Duration Orbital Station (DOS) program was intended for scientific research into spaceflight.  The Almaz program was a secret military program that tested space reconnaissance tactics. \n\nPrototypes \n\nThese stations are prototypes; they only exist as testing platforms and will never be manned. OPS 0855 was part of a cancelled Manned Orbiting Laboratory project by the United States, while the Genesis stations were launched privately and remain in orbit.\n\nOperational stations \n\nThese stations are currently orbiting Earth.  They have life support systems in place.\n\nPlanned stations \n\nThese space stations have been announced by their host entity and are currently in active development or production.  The launch date listed here may change as more information becomes available.  \n\nCancelled projects \n\nThese projects were canceled by their owner.\n\nTimeline\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of the Soviet space station?\nAnswer:\nMir Space Station\nPassage:\nAmerican Fuzzy Lop\nThe American Fuzzy Lop is a rabbit breed recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). It is similar in appearance to a Holland Lop. However, the American Fuzzy Lop is a wool breed and will have wool similar to the Angora breeds although the wool will be shorter than that of a commercial Angora. The American fuzzy lop has to weigh under 4 pounds in order to be shown.\n\nHistory\n\nThe background of the American Fuzzy Lop is interwoven with the history of the Holland Lop. When first introduced, the Holland Lop rabbit was only available in solid colors, and some breeders wanted to add the broken pattern to the Holland Lop gene pool. To do this, they bred their Holland Lops to English Spots. While they achieved the goal of producing broken pattern rabbits, they failed to keep the rollback fur the Holland must have. The offspring instead had the flyback fur of the English Spot. The breeders then bred Holland Lops to French Angoras, a breed that has a very gentle rollback coat. The result of these manipulations was that the wool gene was also introduced into the Holland Lop gene pool and a Holland with long wool was occasionally found in Holland Lop litters. These were generally sold to people who were enchanted with a small wooled lop-eared rabbit.\n\nThe pioneer American Fuzzy Lop breeders, including Patty Greene-Karl and Gary Fellers of the East Coast and Kim Landry and Margaret Miller of the West Coast, noted the marketability of these fuzzy Hollands. Patty Greene-Karl is credited with realizing that the \"fuzzy\" gene was recessive, so that mating two Holland Lops carrying this gene resulted in a certain percentage of the offspring (theoretically 25%) with wool. Patty decided to develop these rabbits as a new breed, named the American Fuzzy Lop. After working for four years on the development of Fuzzies, she presented her rabbits to the ARBA for the first showing of the new breed at the 1985 ARBA Convention in Houston, Texas. Three separate standards for wooled lops were received from three different individuals. The original standard called for a maximum weight of 4 ¾ lb with the ideal weight of 3 ¾ lb, a rabbit designed to have the body type, ear carriage, and size of a Holland Lop, combined with a short, easily maintained wool. At the 1986 ARBA Convention in Columbus, Ohio, the American Fuzzy Lop was presented for its second showing, and again passed. At its third showing at the 1987 ARBA Convention in Portland, Oregon, the ARBA Standards Committee did not approve the breed. They stated a lack of uniformity from one animal to another. A new working standard was written by Jeff Hardin at the request of Patty, which was accepted. The revised standard basically described a wooled Holland, calling for a maximum weight of 4 pounds, and an ideal weight of 3½ lb In 1988, ARBA requested only the breed sponsor be allowed to bring her Fuzzy Lops to Convention in Madison, Wisconsin because of limited cage space. The American Fuzzy Lop had to pass that year to become a recognized breed or else its proponents would have to start the procedure all over again. Fortunately, Patty’s presentation passed at this Convention, and the American Fuzzy Lop became a new recognized breed. In 1989 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Helen McKie's \"Herbie\" was selected as the first Best of Breed (BOB) American Fuzzy Lop at an ARBA Convention. Herbie’s picture graced the ARBA Standard of Perfection, 1991–95, representing Fuzzies well but only the American Fuzzy Lop presented by Patty was granted a working standard.\n\nAppearance and Personality\n\nThe American Fuzzy Lop resembles the Holland Lop with the exception of its wool. The American Fuzzy Lop weighs 3-4 lbs. as an adult with a preferred weight of bucks at 3.5 lbs. and does at 3.75 lbs. They have a very compact body, that appears very muscular. They come in most of the recognized ARBA colors. The ears of the American Fuzzy Lop do not stand erect, but rather lop along the side of the face. They have a short and flat muzzle similar to that of a cat.\n\nAmerican Fuzzy Lops are shown in two classes in ARBA shows based on their color pattern; either \"solid\" or \"broken\" variety (all white being a solid). Whites do come in Ruby Eyed White and Blue Eyed White varieties.\n\nAmerican Fuzzy Lops are an active, playful, social breed with lots of personality. They enjoy the attention of their owner, as well as the companionship of other rabbits. AFLs do enjoy having toys such as a plastic ball, pine cone, piece of soft wood, stuffed sock, or an old glove.\nThe American Fuzzy Lop is the combination of a French Angora and the Holland Lop. They are very fuzzy, as their name \nindicates, and make excellent pets.\nQuestion:\nAmerican Fuzzy Lop, Jersey Wooly and British Giant are all breads of which animal?\nAnswer:\nA Rabbit\nPassage:\nThe Proclaimers\nThe Proclaimers are a Scottish band composed of twin brothers Charlie and Craig Reid (born 5 March 1962). They are best known for the songs \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\", \"Sunshine on Leith\", \"I'm On My Way\" and \"Letter from America\", and their distinctive singing style with a Scottish accent. The band tours extensively throughout the world. They have released ten studio albums since 1987 as well as three compilation albums and a DVD.\n\nHistory\n\nCareer\n\nCraig Reid and Charlie Reid were born in Leith on 5 March 1962, and grew up in Edinburgh, Cornwall and Auchtermuchty.  When they lived in Auchtermuchty they attended Bell Baxter High School. After several punk rock bands at school they formed the Proclaimers in 1983.\n\nThe pair came to public attention when an Inverness-based fan sent their demo to the English band the Housemartins, who were impressed enough to invite the Proclaimers on their 1986 United Kingdom tour. The exposure of the tour won them a January 1987 appearance on the British pop music television programme The Tube on Channel Four;  \"Letter from America\" peaked at number three in the UK Singles Chart, while the album This Is the Story went gold.  The follow-up album Sunshine on Leith featured the singles \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\", which went to number one in Australia and New Zealand, and \"I'm On My Way\". They had a hit with their EP King of the Road, which reached number nine in the UK in 1990. \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" belatedly peaked at number three in the US in 1993, after appearing in the movie Benny & Joon.  After seven low-profile years, they released their comeback album Persevere in 2001.\n\nIn March 2007 they recorded a new version of \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" with television comedy characters Andy Pipkin (played by Matt Lucas) and Brian Potter (Peter Kay) for the Comic Relief charity. A long list of celebrities were featured in the music video for this new version, including David Bellamy, Rod, Jane and Freddy, Paul O'Grady, David Tennant, Frank Sidebottom and many more. This new version of the song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA stage musical featuring their songs, Sunshine on Leith, was created in 2007 for Dundee Rep and adapted as a feature film in 2013 bearing the same name. \n\nThe band was one of the B-52s' touring partners on their Funplex tour in Australia and New Zealand in November 2009, alongside Mental as Anything.\n\nThey featured in VH1's 100 greatest one hit wonders, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" having been their only US hit single. \n\nInfluence\n\nThe brothers are fans of Hibernian Football Club, and \"Sunshine on Leith\" has become a club anthem, being played at home matches for important fixtures, such as the Edinburgh derby versus Heart of Midlothian FC, the club's city rivals. Charlie and Craig Reid appeared at the Easter Road stadium for the \"Hands Off Hibs\"  campaign in 1990 when Wallace Mercer, a wealthy Edinburgh businessman with direct connections to Hearts FC, attempted a takeover of the club but was defeated by organised fan resistance.\n\nThey are also well-known supporters of Scottish independence and have, at various stages of their lives, been activists for the Scottish National Party, expressing such views during their promotional tour of Britain in March 2007. \n\nOn 16 May 2006 the twins announced their participation in a campaign to free a fellow Scot, Kenny Richey, from his death row sentence in Ohio, including an appearance at a charity concert.  Also, in 2010 they participated with Billy Bragg in a show supporting Reprieve, a charity that seeks to end the use of the death penalty. (In December 2007, Kenny Richey accepted a plea bargain, which led to his release from death row and return to Scotland on January 9, 2008.)\n\nThe Proclaimers also support other charities such as the Lighthouse Foundation (addiction victims), Worldwide Cancer Research, Drake Music Scotland (helping disabled people through music) and 500 Miles (amputees and disabled people in Africa).\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nCompilation and remastered albums\n\nEPs\n\n#17 (promotional acoustic EP) (2009)\n\nSingles\n\nDVD\n\n#The Best of The Proclaimers 1987–2002 (2002)\n\nSongs used in soundtracks\n\n#The Crossing (1990) (song, \"King of the Road\")\n#Benny & Joon (1993) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Dumb and Dumber (1994) (song, \"Get Ready\")\n#Bye Bye Love (1995) (song, \"Bye Bye Love\")\n#Bottle Rocket (1996) (song, \"Over and Done With\")\n#Slab Boys (1997) (songs, \"Maybe Baby\" and \"No Particular Place to Go\")\n#The Closer You Get (2000) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Shrek (2001) (song, \"I'm on My Way\")\n#How I Met Your Mother (2007, 2009, 2013 – episodes \"Arrivederci, Fiero\"; \"Duel Citizenship\"; \"Mom and Dad\") (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Mama's Boy (2008) (song, \"Then I Met You\")\n#Burke and Hare (2010) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#The Angels' Share (2012) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Bachelorette (2012) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Grey's Anatomy season 9 (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Identity Thief (2013) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Pitch Perfect (2012) (song, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\")\n#Uncle (TV series) (2015 - season 2, episode 6) (song, \"Over and Done With\")\n\nSoundtracks\n\n#Sunshine on Leith (2013) (from the film Sunshine on Leith - cover versions by film actors)\nQuestion:\nWhat song about the Highland Clearances was performed by the Proclaimers in 1987?\nAnswer:\nLetter From America\nPassage:\nRichie Aprile\nRichard \"Richie\" Aprile, Sr., played by David Proval, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos.  Richie was a capo and the older brother of former DiMeo crime family acting boss Jackie Aprile, Sr. \n\nRichie is one of the most ruthless characters on the show; he is impulsively violent, callous, irascible, and greedy. He made his first appearance in season two, recently released from a ten-year prison sentence, and soon began to cause trouble. Feeling disrespected by Beansie Gaeta, Richie ran him over with his car, leaving him unable to walk. There was continual tension between Richie and Tony Soprano, who was younger and had been subordinate to Richie before his prison term, but who was now boss of the family. He also rekindled an old relationship with Tony's sister Janice Soprano.\n\nPlot details\n\nRichie Aprile, the older brother of acting DiMeo crime family boss Jackie Aprile, Sr., was a capo in the DiMeo crime family before being sent to prison for ten years. While Richie was in prison, Jackie died; Richie came back to a very different family, with Tony Soprano as the boss. Richie had known Tony since before Tony had become a made man; Tony himself recalled for years he had to buy dinners at Benihana and Peter Luger Steak House for Richie and Jerry Anastasia. Tony and Richie had gotten along in the old days; Richie intervened on Tony and Jackie's behalf when old-school mobster Feech La Manna wanted them killed for robbing his card game.\n\nRichie still sees Tony as his younger brother's friend and subsequently has difficulty accepting orders from him. Richie feels he is entitled to inherit control of the family for having paid his dues in prison. Tony promises to give Richie his due, an offer which Richie immediately rebuffs by saying that what is his is not Tony's to give.\n\nRichie's tensions with Tony escalate throughout Season 2. One of Richie's first actions as a free man is to confront his old partner Peter \"Beansie\" Gaeta and try to claim money from him. When Beansie fails to pay Richie at Richie's welcome back party, Richie tracks him down again and threatens to shoot him. Later, Richie waits for Beansie by his car, and when he goes to get in, Richie rams Beansie with his car, crushing Beansie between the two vehicles. Richie then puts the car in gear and drives over the Beansie again. Richie is later forced by Tony to make amends by building Beansie a ramp for his wheelchair; instead, Richie sends a construction crew to tear up Beansie's house, never putting in the ramp. Richie comments to Paulie and Silvio: \"I'll build a ramp up to your ass, drive a Lionel up in there.\"\n\nRichie loans money to Tony's childhood friend Davey Scatino and eventually cuts him off when Scatino starts to miss payments. Scatino manages to get a seat at Tony's high-stakes executive game despite owing Richie money. However, Richie turns up and when he finds Davey playing he flew into a rage. Tony intervenes because he cannot afford to lose face by allowing one of his players to be harmed and sends Richie home. Tony later punishes Richie for his disruptive behavior at the executive game, for which Richie feigns apologies by presenting Tony with an \"old school\" leather jacket. After the game, Scatino is so heavily indebted to Tony and Richie that both men take over Scatino's sporting goods store, Ramsey Sports and Outdoor.\n\nRichie dislikes Tony's protégé Christopher Moltisanti because of his violent relationship with Richie's niece, Adriana La Cerva, and warns Christopher of the consequences should he ever hit her again. Christopher's two young associates, Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, learn of Richie's dislike for their boss, and shoot Christopher, hoping to impress Richie. The shooting goes wrong, however, and Christopher survives. Richie had nothing to do with planning the hit and when he learns of it, he refuses to help Bevilaqua and chases him off his premises.\n\nRichie and Janice Soprano, Tony's sister, used to date in high school. When Richie gets out of prison, he and Janice resume their old relationship and eventually get engaged. Janice frequently encourages Richie to defy Tony, because she wants to be married to the boss.\n\nIn the end, Richie prepares, with the approval of Tony's Uncle Junior, to take over the family as boss. Richie approaches acting capo Albert \"Ally Boy\" Barese to ask for his support in his takeover bid, but he declines. After weighing his options, Junior realizes he is better off with Tony in charge and tips him off about Richie's plans. Silvio Dante advises Tony that there is nothing to gain from leaving Richie alive, so Tony instructs Silvio to have Richie killed. However, this would prove unnecessary.\n\nAfter returning home one night, Richie and Janice gets into an argument over Richie's son's possible homosexuality. Richie is enraged at the thought of his son being gay, but Janice replies that it wouldn't matter. Furious, Richie punches her in the face before settling down for dinner. Janice shoots Richie twice, killing him. Distraught, she calls Tony, who has Chris and Furio Giunta dismember Richie's corpse and sends Janice off to Seattle to lie low.\n\nAfter death\n\nIn the season 5 episode \"The Test Dream\", Richie briefly appears in Tony's dream, riding in the backseat of a car driven by Artie Bucco. Sitting next to Richie is the deceased, former Aprile Crew capo Gigi Cestone.\n\nAppearances\n\n*Appears in: \"Toodle Fucking-Oo\", \"Big Girls Don't Cry\", \"The Happy Wanderer\", \"D-Girl\", \"Full Leather Jacket\", \"From Where to Eternity\", \"Bust Out\", \"House Arrest\", \"The Knight in White Satin Armor\", \"The Test Dream\".\nQuestion:\nIn the US television show ‘The Sopranos’, who shot and killed Richie Aprile?\nAnswer:\nParvati Wasatch\nPassage:\nGibson Desert\nThe Gibson Desert, an interim Australian bioregion, covers a large dry area in the state of Western Australia and is still largely in an almost \"pristine\" state. It is about 155000 km2 in size, making it the 5th largest desert in Australia, after the Great Victoria, Great Sandy, Tanami and Simpson deserts.\n\nLocation and description\n\nThe Gibson Desert is located between the saline Lake Disappointment and Lake Macdonald along the Tropic of Capricorn, south of the Great Sandy Desert, east of the Little Sandy Desert, and north of the Great Victoria Desert.  The altitude rises to just above 500 m in places. As noted by early Australian explorers such as Ernest Giles  large portions of the desert are characterized by gravel-covered terrains covered in thin desert grasses and it also contains extensive areas of undulating red sand plains and dunefields, low rocky/gravelly ridges and substantial upland portions with a high degree of laterite formation. The sandy soil of the lateritic buckshot plains is rich in iron. Several isolated salt-water lakes occur in the centre of the region and to the southwest a system of small lakes follow paleo-drainage features.  Groundwater sources include portions of the Officer Basin and Canning Basin.\n\nRainfall in the Gibson Desert ranges from 200 mm to 250 mm annually, while evaporation rates are in the range of 3600 mm per year. The climate is generally hot; summer maximum temperatures rise above 40 C whilst in winter the maximum may fall to 18 C and minimum winter temperatures dip to 6 C. \n\nHistory\n\nThe Gibson Desert was named by explorer Ernest Giles after a member of his party, Alfred Gibson, who became lost and presumably died in this desert during an expedition in 1874.\n\nIndigenous habitation\n\nIn much of the region, especially the drier western portion, the majority of people living in the area are Indigenous Australians.  In 1984, due to a severe drought which had dried up all of the springs and depleted the bush foods, a group of the Pintupi people who were living a traditional semi-nomadic desert-dwelling life, walked out of a remote wilderness in the central-eastern portion of the Gibson Desert (northeast of Warburton) and made contact for the first time with Australian society. They are believed to have been perhaps the last uncontacted tribe in Australia.  On the eastern margin of the region, population centres (which include people of European descent) include Warburton, Mantamaru and Warakurna. Young Indigenous adults from the Gibson Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture.\nQuestion:\nThe Gibson Desert is in the central area of which Australian state?\nAnswer:\nFauna of Western Australia\n", "answers": ["Curling sheet", "Curling", "Chess on ice", "Curling (sport)", "Button (curling)", "Curling rock", "Curling rink", "Curling shoes", "Roaring game", "The roaring game", "Curling stone", "Hammer (curling)", "Sweeping (sport)", "Curling broom", "Free guard zone", "History of curling"], "length": 5431, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f8fe0336d5b6887b01203f2c6d1aed2d4a419591f4001151"}

The population at the 2011 Census was 187. \n\nSwarkestone has a very old village church, a full cricket pitch, a plant nursery/ garden centre and restaurant called \"Swarkestone Nursery\", the Crewe and Harpur pub, a canal with locks and moorings. It was mentioned twice in Domesday as Sorchestun or Suerchestune, when it was worth twenty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. ISBN 0-14-143994-7 p.742 & 749\n\nSwarkstone Bridge\n\nThe ancient bridge at Swarkestone crosses the River Trent about 6 miles south of Derby and was for about 300 years the Midlands' main crossing of the Trent. The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nHistory\n\nSwarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge.[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid\n1088337 Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway], English Heritage, retrieved 7 September 2014 It was financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiances, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.\n\nSwarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England.\n\nIn 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne.\n\nAccording to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.  Substantial work was carried out in 1795–1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of  £3,550.\n\nThe Bridge Today\n\nThe bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic.\n\nLocal Legends\n\nThe bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops.\n The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about.\n\nThe bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fatal-crash-car-road-says-expert/story-11566348-detail/story.html#axzz2On4yqTMl A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner. | This is Derbyshire]\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the Beaker people living near Swarkestone was discovered in the 1950s. At that time it was estimated that people had lived near Swarkestone for at least 3,800 years.  The only surviving Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the Trent valley is at Swarkestone Lows near the A50. The barrow is a registered national monument. \n\nIn the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers.\n\nIn the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day.\n\nIn 1745 during the Jacobite Rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.\n\nSport\n\nSwarkestone cricket club has gained quite a reputation in recent years. After gaining promotion to the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League in 2011, they finished 2nd in the subsequent year and won the Premier League in the 2013 season, thus becoming the top league team in Derbyshire.\n\nThe Pavilion\n\nNearby is the Jacobean grandstand called Swarkestone Hall Pavilion and walled area, formerly connected with Harpur Hall, where (it is believed, see Pevsner, loc. cit.), they used to bait bulls. The pavilion is attributed to John Smythson who also designed Bolsover Castle, and is Grade I Listed.  It was repaired and is now owned by the Landmark Trust who maintain it and rent it out to holidaymakers.\n\nImages\n\nimage:SwalkestoneLockRH.jpg|Swarkestone Lock and Keeper's House\nimage:SwalkestoneChurchRH.jpg|St James' Church, Swarkestone\nimage:SwalkestoneLowesRH.JPG|Swarkestone Lowes\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Thomas Bancroft, poet, was born here in the early 17th century.Thomas Bancroft in the Dictionary of National Biography\nQuestion:\nThe advance south into England by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 reached approximately as far as the Swarkstone Bridge on which major English River?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTurn Back Time (Aqua song)\n\"Turn Back Time\" is a song by Scandinavian dance-pop group Aqua, released as their seventh single overall, and the sixth from their debut album Aquarium. The song became another worldwide hit for the group, and was included on the Sliding Doors soundtrack.\n\nComposition\n\nThe song possessed less of a \"bubble pop\" sound than their other releases. The song was slow-paced and showed the full range of Lene Nystrøm Rasted's vocals, while maintaining the Aqua sound. The song samples the Pet Shop Boys' single, \"Heart\". \n\nRelease\n\nThe song featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 film Sliding Doors, and was released across the world the same year. In Japan, \"Turn Back Time\" was released along with \"My Oh My\". The song subsequently gained far more radio airplay than their other releases.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe single is their third number one single in the United Kingdom. On its May 1998 UK release, the song topped the charts for one week, making Aqua one of the few groups to have their first three singles all make number one. This single reached #18 on Billboards Top 40 Mainstream chart and therefore was their second highest charting hit in the United States.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video for the release contained footage from Sliding Doors (1998), and was therefore very different from the previous, comedy videos by the group.

Literary critic Alfred Kazin calls it \"the most famous of his poems,\"Kazin, 41–43 and The Cambridge Companion to William Blake says it is \"the most anthologized poem in English.\"Eaves, pg. 207 It is one of Blake's most reinterpreted and arranged works.Whitson and Whittaker 63–71\n\nBackground\n\nThe Songs of Experience was published in 1794 as a follow up to Blake's 1789 Songs of Innocence.  The two books were published together under the merged title Songs of Innocence and Experience, showing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul: the author and printer, W. Blake featuring 54 plates. The illustrations are arranged differently in some copies, while a number of poems were moved from Songs of Innocence to Songs of Experience. Blake continued to print the work throughout his life.  Of the copies of the original collection, only 28 published during his life are known to exist, with an additional 16 published posthumously.  Only 5 of the poems from Songs of Experience appeared individually before 1839. \n\nStructure\n\nThe first and last stanzas are identical except the word \"could\" becomes \"dare\" in the second iteration. Kazin says to begin to wonder about the tiger, and its nature, can only lead to a daring to wonder about it. Blake achieves great power through the use of alliteration (\"frame\" and \"fearful\") combined with imagery, (burning, fire, eyes), and he structures the poem to ring with incessant repetitive questioning, demanding of the creature, \"Who made thee?\" In the third stanza the focus moves from the tiger, the creation, to the creator – of whom Blake wonders \"What dread hand? & what dread feet?\". \"The Tyger\" is six stanzas in length, each stanza four lines long.  Much of the poem follows the metrical pattern of its first line and can be scanned as trochaic tetrameter catalectic.  A number of lines, however, such as line four in the first stanza, fall into iambic tetrameter.\n\n\"The Tyger\" lacks narrative movement. The first stanza opens the central question, \"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Here the direct address to the creature becomes most obvious, but certainly, \"the Tyger\" cannot provide the lyrical \"I\" with a satisfactory answer, so the contemplation continues. \nThe second stanza questions \"the Tyger\" about where he was created; the third about how the creator formed him; the fourth about what tools were used. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders how the creator reacted to \"the Tyger,\" and who created the creature. \nFinally, the sixth restates the central question while raising the stakes; rather than merely question what/who \"could\" create the Tyger, the speaker wonders: who dares.\n\nThemes and critical analysis\n\n\"The Tyger\" is the sister poem to \"The Lamb\" (from \"Songs of Innocence\"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective (Blake's concept of \"contraries\"), with \"The Lamb\" bringing attention to innocence.  \"The Tyger\" presents a duality between aesthetic beauty and primal ferocity, and Blake believes that to see one, the hand that created \"The Lamb\", one must also see the other, the hand that created \"The Tyger”: \"Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\" \n\nThe \"Songs of Experience\" were written as a contrary to the \"Songs of Innocence\" – a central tenet in Blake's philosophy, and central theme in his work. The struggle of humanity is based on the concept of the contrary nature of things, Blake believed, and thus, to achieve truth one must see the contraries in innocence and experience. Experience is not the face of evil but rather another facet of that which created us. Kazin says of Blake, \"Never is he more heretical than ... where he glories in the hammer and fire out of which are struck ... the Tyger\". Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. In \"The Tyger,\" he presents a poem of \"triumphant human awareness,\" and \"a hymn to pure being,\" according to Kazin.\n\nMusical versions\n\n* Rebecca Clarke – \"The Tiger\" (1929–33)\n* Benjamin Britten, in his song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake (1965)\n* Greg Brown (folk musician), in his album \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Greg Brown album)\" (1986)\n* John Tavener – \"The Tyger\" (1987) \n* Tangerine Dream – \"Tyger\" (1987)\n* Jah Wobble – \"Tyger Tyger\" (1996)\n* Kenneth Fuchs – Songs of Innocence and of Experience, (Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe,   Cello, and Harp) (completed 2006)\n* Herbst in Peking – \"The Tyger & the Fly\" (2014)\n* Qntal – \"Tyger\" (2014)\nQuestion:\n\"Who wrote the lines, \"\"Tyger!

According to the Arts council of England it is the largest  arts centre in the United Kingdom outside London. \n\nIt has a 669-seat theatre, a 1,500 seat concert hall, a 150-seat studio, a 105-seat cinema, an Image Lab/media suite, a large gallery for photography and digital art, a restaurant and three function rooms. The concert hall is home to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. \n\nHistory, development and funding\n\nThe Poole Arts Centre (Towngate Theatre, Wessex Hall and Ashley Cinema) opened in April 1978 to serve the South East Dorset conurbation. The venue closed in May 2002 for an £8.5 million radical refurbishment and overhaul. This was paid for by Arts Council Lottery Awards, the Borough of Poole and through private donations. It reopened as Lighthouse, Poole's Centre for the Arts in October 2002. The refurbishment added new extensive facilities including a modern cinema, expanded concert hall and  photography labs. Other additions included expanded customer facilities and a new restaurant.\n\nThe Lighthouse receives additional funding from the Arts Council England. In 2005/06 £230,000, in 2006/07 they received £330,000 in 2007/08 they will receive a total of £339,080. The Lighthouse is currently owned by the Poole Arts Trust Ltd.\n\nProgramming and types of shows\n\nLighthouse provides a wide ranging programme, including:\n\nTheatre\n\n*Mid-scale musical tours (such as Fame and Blood Brothers)\n*Opera (annually from English Touring Opera)\n*Dance (both contemporary and classical)\n*Ballet\n*Plays (ranging from classics such as Romeo and Juliet, An Inspector Calls to more modern day 'kitchen sink dramas')\n*Pantomime (Cinderella for 2006/7 starring Bobby Crush, Peter Duncan & Brian Cant)\n\nConcert Hall\n\n*Weekly performances on Wednesday nights from the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\n*Regular performances from the Wessex Youth Orchestra\n*World music\n*Rock concerts (including KISS, Oasis, Kings of Leon, U2, Page & Plant, Rufus Wainwright, Doves, Fun Loving Criminals)\n*Jazz\n\nStudio\n\n*Small scale children's theatre\n*Small scale adult theatre\n\nCinema\n\nEclectic mix of world cinema, and recent releases normally presented 4–8 weeks after general release.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Lighthouse is situated just outside the main shopping centre / high street in Poole. However it is only a short walk from the centre of town.\n\nThe venue is easily accessible by public transport (10 minute walk from Poole railway station (for trains to London Waterloo, Southampton, Winchester and Weymouth, amongst others) and is opposite Poole bus station for local services across the town and into Bournemouth, Christchurch, Salisbury and Swanage) and also by the road network, within reasonable travel time from such towns as Dorchester, Weymouth, Yeovil, Salisbury, Christchurch, Bournemouth, Lymington, Southampton and Blandford.\n\nThere is adequate car parking for visitors to the Lighthouse Theatre in the Dolphin Centre multi-storey which is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nQuestion:\nWhich south coast resort has its own symphony orchestra, founded in 1893 and now based in Poole Arts Centre?\nAnswer:\nBournemouth (borough)\nPassage:\nEarnings before interest and taxes\nIn accounting and finance, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), is a measure of a firm's  profit that includes all expenses except interest and income tax expenses.Bodie, Z., Kane, A. and Marcus, A.

Season 1 of the Paul Temple television series was produced solely by the BBC, with all 13 episodes set in Great Britain. The very first episode was transmitted in November 1969, becoming one of the first shows to be broadcast in colour on BBC1. \n\nStarting with Season 2, Paul Temple became a co-production by the BBC and Taurus films of Munich, West Germany, and was shown internationally, with many of the episodes using overseas locations in West Germany, France, Malta and elsewhere. During the production of the Second Season, the producer Peter Bryant successfully persuaded Derrick Sherwin to join him on Paul Temple, from the BBC's Doctor Who television series at short notice. Both Sherwin and Bryant had previously worked on Doctor Who together. There was some disagreement between the BBC and Taurus over the casting of Steve Temple (who had been played in the radio series of Paul Temple from 1945-68 by Marjorie Westbury): the BBC wished to drop Ros Drinkwater from the role, but Taurus favoured her retention.\n\nAccording to Francis Matthews, both Paul and Steve Temple became fashion icons of sorts, creating a style that was to be imitated in ITV's The Persuaders!,  while, in America, Ros Drinkwater's role was reportedly emulated by Susan Saint James in McMillan & Wife and Stefanie Powers in Hart to Hart.  According to Matthews, Drinkwater chose her own \"very expensive\" designer clothes for the part. \n\nThe series was intended to go on for 5 years, but despite its popularity, especially in West Germany, the BBC withdrew prematurely after 2 years. Huw Wheldon, the BBC's managing director for television, later explained to Matthews that it was really \"Lew Grade territory\" and cited the BBC's preference for such historical dramas as The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R.  The series was allowed to peter out, the final episodes at least of the last Season all based in Great Britain.\n\nArchive\n\nThe BBC never repeated Paul Temple. The series suffered badly in the BBC's archive purging of the 1970s. Of the 52 episodes of Paul Temple that were made, only 16 remain in the BBC TV archives today. 11 of the surviving 16 episodes are available in colour, and these were re-run on UK Gold in its formative years in the 1990s. The other 5 episodes survive only as black and white telerecordings. The purge on Paul Temple was such that, of the first two seasons, only one episode exists (\"Games People Play\", 19 April 1970). That episode was made completely on film and therefore was archived in the BBC's Film Library. The remaining 25 episodes were wiped off their original videotape holdings by the BBC's Engineering Department so the tapes (expensive at the time) could be re-used. No telerecordings  are known to exist (other than the last five episodes of season 4).\n\nThe visuals of some of the 36 missing episodes survive in the ZDF TV archives in Germany. These are believed to emanate from seasons 2 to 4 which were BBC-ZDF co-produced, however they only have dubbed German soundtracks. Any BBC tape copies with their original English soundtracks intact are believed to be long-gone from the ZDF archive.\n\nDVD Releases\n\nIn July 2009, Acorn Media released the 11 existing colour episodes on DVD. These were cleared at the BBFC on 17 March 2009.  In April 2012, Acorn Media released a DVD of the final 5 episodes ever broadcast, which are only available in black and white. In August 2013, Acorn Media released all 16 existing episodes (11 in colour, 5 in black and white) on DVD, in a release named Paul Temple: The Complete Collection.\n\nIn May 2016, the series appeared in German speaking countries, released by German DVD company Fernsehjuwelen (English translation: TV Jewels). The DVD releases were from series 2 onwards in three different boxsets, the third of which to be released later. Episodes previously described as missing appeared for the first time on DVD, albeit with synchronised German audio only.\n\nMain cast\n\n* Francis Matthews ...  Paul Temple \n* Ros Drinkwater ...

When the new Queen was crowned a couple of months later, he was among the select few invited to celebrate the day in No 2 Carlton Gardens, a discreet building overlooking the Mall from where the men who ran Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service were watching the royal procession. Little did they know that during his time as a prisoner he had become a Communist and decided to work for the KGB.\nGeorge Blake worked as a double agent for the Soviet Union until he was discovered in 1961 and sentenced to 42 years in prison. He escaped from Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966 and fled to the USSR.\nAll traitors are complicated, but no one more so than Blake. In The Righteous Traitor, director George Carey speaks to Blake’s close acquaintances, historians and other former spies to chronicle his curious history. A close friend of his, Louis Wesserling, describes Blake: “He was a gambler…He spied to fill a void. It gave him a sense of enormous importance”. According to Tim Weiner, the famous historian of the CIA, “the revelation of Blake’s treachery did more damage to relations between Britain and America than all the Cambridge Five put together.”\nDirected by George Carey\nYear: 2015\nTopics:\nQuestion:\nWhich spy was sentenced to 42 years in prison in 1961, but escaped from Wormwood Scrubs in 1966?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nGive Us a Clue\nGive Us a Clue is a British televised game show version of charades which was broadcast on ITV from 1979 to 1992. The original host was Michael Aspel from 1979 to 1984, followed by Michael Parkinson from 1984 to 1992. The show featured two teams, one captained by Lionel Blair and the other by Una Stubbs. Later versions of the programme had Liza Goddard as captain of the women's team.\n\nA revived version was attempted by BBC One, which ran from 10 November to 19 December 1997 and commissioned 30 episodes, it was hosted by Tim Clark. Teams were captained by Christopher Blake and Julie Peasgood and the show tried to introduce a lateral thinking puzzle (which the host could \"give clues to\"). Give us a Clue returned for a special Comic Relief episode on 5 March 2011 with Sara Cox, Christopher Biggins, Lionel Blair, Una Stubbs, Holly Walsh, Jenni Falconer and David Walliams.\n\nFormat\n\nThe game was based on charades, a party game where players used mime rather than speaking to demonstrate a name, phrase, book, play, film or TV programme. Each player was given roughly two minutes to act out their given subject in front of his/her team, and if the others were unsuccessful in guessing correctly, the opposing team would have a chance to answer for a bonus point.\n\nTransmissions\n\nSeries 1 was not networked, Thames and a few other broadcast the series, around 19:00 while most others station moved it to an early time slot including 15:50. By 1980 all station were broadcasting the series in peaktime slot until 1986. No series was made in 1987 but repeats were broadcast on certain ITV station usually around 17:15.\n\nIn 1988 the show moved to an early morning slot, left vacant when ITV Schools relocated to Channel 4, before being moved once again to around 15:00 slot in 1989 onwards. The original run ended in 1991, but a one-off special was broadcast on 4 May 1992.\n\nTheme music\n\nThe original theme tune was called \"Chicken Man\", which was also the theme tune of Grange Hill. However, while Grange Hill used the original recording, Give us a Clue used a less dynamic custom arrangement more in keeping with the style of light entertainment programming. In 1981, David Clark took over as producer/director and commissioned an entirely new theme tune, then in 1987, a new vocalised theme tune was used up until the show ended in 1992.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe programme has been repeated on satellite TV and is also still parodied in British comedy. It was frequently referred to by Humphrey Lyttelton, chairman of BBC radio's long-running \"antidote to panel games\", I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, during a round of Sound Charades — usually with a gay innuendo-laden gag at the expense of Lionel Blair.\n\nOther versions\n\nA licensed version of it aired in New Zealand in the 1990s, after the British original had screened there for several seasons. SVT in Sweden broadcast their own version with the title Gäster med gester.\nQuestion:\nWho has presented Give Us A Clue, Child's Play, and Crackerjack?\nAnswer:\nAspel and Company\nPassage:\nAny Questions?\nAny Questions? is a topical debate radio programme in the United Kingdom that has been broadcast since 1948.\n\nFormat\n\nIt is broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on Friday evenings and repeated on Saturday afternoons, when it is followed by a phone-in response programme, Any Answers?, previously a postal response slot. Questions were originally far more diverse with a panel often made up of a clergyman, a journalist, an academic and either a politician or a trades unionist. Since current affairs journalists became its chairmen it nowadays typically features a panel with four members drawn from politicians from the three major UK political parties and other public figures who answer questions put to them by the audience, who are drawn from the locality being visited. Questions are collected from the audience and a number are then selected by a BBC producer. The chairman is Jonathan Dimbleby and it is produced by Lisa Jenkinson. In recent years the programme has made prominent use of the microblogging site Twitter, including the hashtag #bbcaq.\n    \nGeographic representation\n\nWhen the programme visits Scotland and Wales, representatives from the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru participate, as do the Northern Irish parties when Northern Ireland is visited.\n\nContent restrictions\n\nWhen the programme was first broadcast there was a rule that no questions could be asked on topics that had been discussed in the Houses of Parliament during the last two weeks. This rule created considerable consternation to the panellists on a programme during the Suez war. Over time the rule was relaxed and eventually dropped.\nAnother rule lasted much longer - a 1947 Cabinet Office minute barred ministers from appearing on the programme for many years on the grounds that a minister should not be expected to answer questions beyond their ministerial brief. Question Time launched without such a limitation and much lobbying took place until a Tory minister was allowed to take part. Since then the rules for ministers appearance has been the same for both radio and television.\nThe panel members are not notified of the questions before the programme, although questions usually cover topical political questions. The last question is normally light hearted - the one most politicians fear most.\n\nHistory\n\nAny Questions? was originated by Frank Gillard, a former war correspondent and later Managing Director of BBC Radio. It  was first broadcast from Winchester on 12 October 1948 as a programme on the Home Service in the West of England. It has been broadcast nationally since 1950, although for many years it still came exclusively from venues in the West Country.\n\nCarrier stations\n\nIt was initially broadcast nationally on the BBC Light Programme and BBC Radio 2 (even being simulcast on BBC Radio 1 from 6 October 1967 to 3 April 1970). However, in this era it was repeated on the Home Service and later Radio 4. The programme has gone out exclusively on Radio 4 since 10 April 1970. It inspired the television version, Question Time, on BBC1 on Thursday evenings, chaired by Jonathan Dimbleby's older brother, David Dimbleby. Their father also worked for the BBC.\n\nNotable programmes\n\n* On 11 October 2008, a programme was broadcast from Winchester marking the sixtieth anniversary of the programme. The panel were Shirley Williams, Oliver Letwin, Harriet Harman  and Peter Hennessy. The programme ended with a question asking whether Winchester should again be the capital of England.\n* In 1976 when broadcasting from a United Reformed Church in Basingstoke, Enoch Powell was part of the panel. During the programme, anti-fascist protesters threw bricks at the church. The programme was stopped but resumed after ten minutes.\n\nChairmen\n\nIt has had four permanent chairmen in its history:\n* Freddie Grisewood from 1948 to December 1967\n* David Jacobs from December 1967 to 27 July 1984\n* John Timpson from August 1984 to July 1987\n* Jonathan Dimbleby from July 1987; on the occasions when he is unable to chair the programme, others have substituted, including Nick Clarke, Eddie Mair and Martha Kearney.\n\nMany popular figures have appeared on the programme more than once:  the record for appearances is held by Tony Benn, who first appeared as a panel member in March 1951 and contributed to over 80 programmes.\nQuestion:\nWho presents 'Any Questions' on BBC Radio 4?\nAnswer:\nJonathan Dimbleby on Sunday\nPassage:\nCarbuncle Cup\nThe Carbuncle Cup is an architecture prize, given annually by the magazine Building Design to \"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months\". It is intended to be a humorous response to the prestigious Stirling Prize, given by the Royal Institute of British Architects. \n\nThe Carbuncle Cup award was launched in 2006, with the first winner being Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth by Chapman Taylor.  A shortlist is announced by Building Design each year, based on nominations from the public, and usually timed to coincide with the Stirling Prize shortlist. Public voting via the magazine's website was used to select past winners, giving the award a sense of democratic involvement. Since 2009 a small group of critics has selected the final winners.\n\nThe award was inspired by the Carbuncle Awards, which the Scottish architecture magazine Urban Realm, formerly Prospect, had been presenting to buildings and areas in Scotland since 2000.  \n\nThe names of both awards are derived from a comment by Charles, Prince of Wales, an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described Ahrends, Burton and Koralek's proposed extension of London's National Gallery as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\".  \n\nAnnual shortlists\n\n2006\n\nThe first shortlist was announced in October 2006, and featured ten buildings. \n\n2007\n\nSeven buildings were shortlisted in 2007. Opal Court, a student housing complex in Leicester, was voted the winner in October. \n\n2008\n\nThe 2008 shortlist of seven buildings was announced in early October. Stuart Lowther of EPR Architects said he was \"extremely disappointed\" at the award for the Radisson SAS Waterfront Hotel being given to his firm, as the project was inherited from another architect and EPR had not designed the building's exterior. \n\n2009\n\nA longlist of ten buildings was announced in August 2009.  Grosvenor Group, the developer of One Park West, organised a \"group hug\" of the building, following its nomination.  The prize, judged by critics Owen Hatherley and Ellis Woodman, and architect Sean Griffith, was awarded to Liverpool Ferry Terminal, with the University of Nottingham Amenity building and Queen Margaret University placed second and third. \n\n2010\n\nThe jury in 2010 comprised Jonathan Glancey, Owen Hatherley, Amanda Baillieu and Ellis Woodman. The shortlist of six was announced in July, and the Strata building was announced as the winner in August. The article described the tower as: \"Decked out with Philishave stylings, this is a building that appears to be auditioning for a supporting role in a James Bond title sequence.\"\n\n2011\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in July.  In August, a jury consisting of national newspaper architecture critics: Rowan Moore of the Observer, Hugh Pearman of the Sunday Times and the Guardian’s Jonathan Glancey voted MediaCityUK the 2011 winner. \n\n2012\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in July,  In August, a jury including Owen Hatherley, Gillian Darley and Ellis Woodman voted Cutty Sark Renovation the 2012 winner. \n\n2013\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2013.  The winner was announced later that same month as 465 Caledonian Road, student accommodation in London. \n\n2014\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2014.  The winner was announced in September 2014 as Woolwich Central, a Sheppard Robson-designed mixed-use scheme in south east London. \n\n2015\n\nThe shortlist of six was announced in August 2015, selected by a panel of judges including Building Design editor Thomas Lane, architectural critic Ike Ijeh, writer, broadcaster and historian Gillian Darley and architectural designer Eleanor Jolliffe, both columnists for the magazine.  The winner was announced in September 2015 as 20 Fenchurch Street, designed by Rafael Viñoly. \n\n2016\n\nThe nomination process for 2016 will run until the end of August when the shortlist will be announced. The winner will be declared in early September.  \n\nNominated buildings will be listed below and the table subsequently refined.\nQuestion:\nA 2010 publicity-driven competition called the Carbuncle Cup focused on unpopular British what?\nAnswer:\nArchitecturally\nPassage:\nCat-Tails for Two\nCat-Tails for Two is a 1953 (1961 Blue Ribbon Re-issue) Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce starring Bennie the fat cat and George. It was animated in 1952. Voices by Mel Blanc and music by Carl Stalling. It was the first appearance of Speedy Gonzales, in a prototype form.  Because this cartoon's rendition of Speedy Gonzales looked rather coarse, they redesigned him for future cartoon releases.\n\nPlot\n\nThe two cats pursuing Speedy in Cat-Tails for Two are the slow-witted (and injury-causing) Benny and the fully functioning but unfortunate George, both patterned after the characters Lennie and George in the novel Of Mice and Men. George and Benny are walking down a pier looking for food, when they find a Mexican ship. Figuring the ship will have plenty of Mexican mice, i.e. \"Mexican food\" (Benny: \"It gives me the heartburn and I love it!\"), they climb on, only to find an unkempt mouse calling himself \"Speedy Gonzales: Fastest Mouse in All Mexico\".\n\nGeorge and Benny go through numerous attempts to capture Speedy, who always outwits them. Speedy comes to think of them as private entertainment, at one point declaring \"I like those fellows. All the time having fon (fun)!\" Among the cats' failed attempts:\n\n1. A crate full of \"Acme Anvils\" set above a piece of cheese. With Benny holding the rope and George setting the bait, Speedy gives Benny a scare from behind, causing him to let go of the rope and the crate to flatten George. As punishment, George swings down on Benny's cranium with a mallet, but the mallet bounces off Benny's head right on top of his own! When Benny asks \"Why did you hit yourself on the head for, George?\", the slap-happy cat answers: \"I like it, I like it!!\"\n\n2. George sets up seven pieces of cheese with dynamite-stick booby traps throughout the ship, but doesn't have a match to light the sticks. Speedy taunts George with a match and sets him up to take the explosions. Benny comes to the rescue by cooling George down, but misinterprets a bucket of petrol as \"a funny way to spell 'water'\" leaving him half furless.\n\n3. A pipe with one end disguised as an entranceway to a cabaret and Benny standing at the other end with a mallet. When Speedy enters the pipe, George fires a skyrocket in behind him, the idea being to force Speedy out into the path of the mallet. But the rocket unexpectedly yanks George through the pipe behind it. Speedy is too fast for Benny, and Benny ends up clobbering George when he is pulled out the other side turning his head into a mallet size.\n\nFinally, the two cats run a pipe into Speedy's hiding place (to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse), but Speedy grabs a wrench and bends the pipe back around to the cats, unbeknownst to them. George starts shoving a lot of dynamite into the pipe, resulting in a mountain of TNT piling up behind him and Benny. When George is done shoving dynamite through the pipe, he lights the last stick with a match, and the mountain of dynamite blasts him and Benny up into the air. As they descend, Benny asks George about their Mexican dinner, with George responding \"I kind of lost my appetite for Mexican food,\" before both cats plunge into the harbor. A smug Speedy looks at the camera and declares \"I love those fellows. They're so see-lee (silly)!\" Iris out.\nQuestion:\nWhich famous animated character, first seen in 1953 in a feature called 'Cat Tails for Two' was usually wearing an over-sized sombrero, white shirt and trousers and red kerchief?\nAnswer:\nAriba Ariba\nPassage:\nMorland Brewery\nMorland is a British brewery which was bought by Greene King in 2000.  Morland’s beers include Hen’s Tooth, Old Speckled Hen, Tanner’s Jack and Morland’s Original.\n\nJohn Morland founded the brewery in 1711. In the 1860s, Morland bought Abbey Brewery and Eagle Brewery and in 1885 changed its name to United Breweries. The company bought several more breweries and around 1944 changed its name back to Morland. In 1979, Morland created Old Speckled Hen, one of their most popular beers.The Microbrewed Beer of the Month Club. Morland Brewing - Old Crafty Hen Lake Forest, CA: MonthlyClubs.com  Retrieved, August 7, 2014, 10:40 PM PST\n\nHistory\n\nA farmer, John Morland, set up the brewery in 1711, and the  ale and porter was bought by  public houses  in London . In the 1860s, Morland acquired  Abbey Brewery and then Eagle Brewery. In the 1880s Morland moved its operation from West Ilsley to  Abingdon.\n\nIn 1885, Morland became a limited company and changed its name to United Breweries and its trademark to a pyramid of three beer barrels, with the initials of the three breweries on the ends of them.  In 1889, the company took over two brewers, H. B. Saxby and Field & Sons,  keeping their names on the labels of their beers.\n\nMorland acquired Field & son Shillingford brewery near Wallingford. Thomas Skurray at the age of 19 came with Field & Son.  After 10 years at Abingdon the brewery Thomas Skurray was running everything apart from the offices. He was Chairman of the Board until his death in 1938 and was to build new malthouse and a soft drinks factory.\nThomas Skurray had a son Thomas Edward Deane Skurray who was a partner in a company called Theobold & Skurray, a company of Architects,Deane was responsible for the building of many new pubs in the 1930s: The Saxton Arms Abingdon, the Ox Oxford Road Abingdon, the Royal Oak Didcot, the Old White Hart at Hook, the New inn at Longworth and the Bystander at Wootton Abingdon, also looking after over 300 Morland pubs & hotels.\nMorland bought more breweries: \n*The Abbey Brewery.\n* Saxby's in Brewery Abingdon.\n* Field & sons Shillingford Brewery.\n* Ferguson & Sons' Angel Brewery.\n* The Wantage Brewery.\n* Dymore-Brown & Sons. First owned by Thomas Skurray then Morland & co ltd  \n* Henry Hewett & Co.\n*Justin & Brinns Castle Street Brewey.\n*The Tower Steam Brewery. This building was used by the Morlands as a vehicle repair centre until the 1990s, when they sold it to a housing developer.  It is now Tower Close Abingdon..\nIn 1944, United-Breweries became a public limited company called Morland and Co plc, and all the acquired brewery names were dropped except Ferguson's Ltd, which was retained for the wine and spirits business, and Bass-Charrington Brewery which was kept separate because of its expensive new distribution warehouse. In 1997 Morland purchased Ruddles Brewers and moved their production from Oakham to Abingdon. In 2000 Morland and Co plc was sold to Greene King brewery.  This led to the closure of the Abingdon brewery and the transfer of production to Bury St. Edmunds.\n\nThe Morlands sign, showing an artist with his palette, commemorated George Morland who was a noted artist and painter.  \"Artist's Keg\" bitter was also brewed during the 1980's and 1990's.\n\nMorland buildings\n\nPublic houses and restaurants\n\nIn 1991, Morland and Co plc purchased 101 pubs from Courage Ltd and a further 100 were added two years later from Whitbread. More purchases were made in the mid 1990s, and also a number of restaurants nationwide. Morland opened their own restaurants called Artist Fayre as well as another 100 pubs from Whitbread & co Plc.'. Morland Plc owned over five hundred pubs when the brewery closed in 2000.\n\nBrewery buildings\n\nA large wooden house built for head brewer James Dymore Brown great grand son of Jas Dymore Brown Reading Brewery once lived in was demolished when the company built a large air-conditioned draught beer warehouse.

Harbors and ports are often confused with each other. A port is a manmade facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports are often located in harbors.\n\nHarbors can  be natural or artificial. An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed breakwaters, sea walls, or jettys, or they can be constructed by dredging, which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging. An example of an artificial harbor is Long Beach Harbor, California, United States which was an array of salt marshes and tidal flats too shallow for modern merchant ships before it was first dredged in the early 20th century. \n\nIn contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by prominences of land. Examples of natural harbors include Sydney Harbour, Australia and Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka.\n\nArtificial harbors\n\nArtificial harbors are frequently built for use as ports. The oldest artificial harbor known is the Ancient Egyptian site at Wadi al-Jarf, on the Red Sea coast, which is at least 4500 years old (ca. 2600-2550 BC, reign of King Khufu). The largest artificially created harbor is Jebel Ali in Dubai.  Other large and busy artificial harbors include: \n* Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands; \n* Port of Houston, Texas, United States;\n* Port of Savannah, Georgia, United States;\n* Port of Long Beach, California, United States;  \n* Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California, United States.\n\nThe Ancient Carthaginians constructed fortified, artificial harbors called cothons.\n\nNatural harbors\n\nA natural harbor is a landform where a part of a body of water is protected and deep enough to furnish anchorage. Many such harbors are rias. Natural harbors have long been of great strategic naval and economic importance, and many great cities of the world are located on them. Having a protected harbor reduces or eliminates the need for breakwaters as it will result in calmer waves inside the harbor. Some examples are: \n* New York Harbor in the United States; \n* Poole Harbour in England, United Kingdom; \n* Kingston Harbour in Jamaica; \n* Grand Harbour in Malta; \n* Subic Bay in Zambales, the Philippines; \n* Scapa Flow in Scotland, United Kingdom;\n* Sydney Harbour in Australia; technically a ria\n* Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, United States; \n* Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka; \n* San Francisco Bay in California; \n* Visakhapatnam Harbour in Andhra Pradesh, India; \n* Killybegs in County Donegal, Ireland; \n* Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada;\n* Hamilton Harbour in Ontario, Canada;\n* Burrard Inlet in Vancouver, Canada;\n* Cork Harbour, Ireland;\n* Waitemata Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand.\n* Port of Tobruk in Tobruk, Libya.\n\nIce-free harbors\n\nFor harbors near the North and South Poles, being ice-free is an important advantage, especially when it is year-round. Examples of these include: \n* Murmansk, Russia; \n* Pechenga, Russia; \n* Liinakhamari, Russia; \n* Hammerfest, Norway; \n* Vardø, Norway; \n* Vostochny Port; \n* Nakhodka in Nakhodka Bay, Russia; \n* Prince Rupert Harbour, Canada. \nThe world's southmost harbor, located at Antarctica's Winter Quarters Bay (77° 50′ South), is potentially ice-free, depending on the summertime pack ice conditions. \n\nImportant harbors\n\nAlthough the world's busiest port is a hotly contested title, in 2006 the world's busiest harbor by cargo tonnage was the Port of Shanghai. \n\nThe following are large natural harbors:\n*Algeciras, Spain\n*Amsterdam, Port of Amsterdam, Netherlands\n*Antwerp, Port of Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium\n*Baltimore's Inner Harbor, Maryland, United States\n*Boston Harbor, Massachusetts, United States\n*Bremerhaven, Germany\n*Buenos Aires, Argentina\n*Burrard Inlet, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n*Busan, Korea\n*Cartagena, Colombia\n*Charleston, South Carolina, United States\n*Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India\n*Port of Chittagong, Chittagong City, Bangladesh\n*Cork Harbour, Ireland\n*Duluth–Superior harbor, Duluth, Minnesota, United States\n*Durban, South Africa\n*Falmouth, Cornwall, England, United Kingdom\n*Freetown Harbour, Sierra Leone\n*Golden Horn, Istanbul, Turkey\n*Gothenburg, Sweden\n*Grand Harbour, Malta\n*Gwangyang, Korea\n*Hai Phong Port, Haiphong, Vietnam\n*Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada\n*Hamburg Harbour, Germany\n*Hampton Roads, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n*Havana Harbor\n*Incheon, Korea\n*Izmir, Turkey\n*Port of Jakarta (Tanjung Priok), Jakarta, Indonesia\n*Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan\n*Kingston, Jamaica\n*Kobe Harbour, Kobe, Japan\n*Lisbon, Portugal\n*Lushunkou, Dalian, China\n*Mahón, Minorca, Spain\n*Manila Bay, Philippines\n*Maputo, Mozambique\n*Milford Haven, Wales, United Kingdom\n*Montevideo, Uruguay\n*Mumbai, India\n*Nassau, Bahamas\n*New York Harbor, United States\n*Oslofjord, Norway\n*Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States\n*Piraeus, Attiki, Greece\n*Plymouth Sound, Devon, England, United Kingdom\n*Poole Harbour, Dorset, England, United Kingdom\n*Port Jackson, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n*Port of Portland, Casco Bay, Maine, United States\n*Port of Sevastopol, Sevastopol, Ukraine\n*Port Phillip, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n*Provincetown Harbor, Provincetown, Massachusetts, United States\n*Punta del Este, Uruguay\n*Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara Bay, Brazil\n*Rotterdam, Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands\n*Salvador, All Saint's Bay, Brazil\n*San Antonio, Chile\n*San Diego Bay, San Diego, California, United States\n*San Francisco Bay, California, United States\n*Sankt Petersburg, Russia\n*Subic Bay, Zambales, Philippines\n*Tanger-Med, Tangier, Morocco\n*Tauranga Harbour, Tauranga, New Zealand\n*Tokyo Bay, Tokyo, Japan\n*Trincomalee, Sri Lanka\n*Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, India\n*Port of Tyne, Tyne & Wear, United Kingdom\n*Ulsan, Korea\n*Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong\n*Victoria Harbour (British Columbia) & Esquimalt Harbour, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\n*Visakhapatnam Port, Andhra Pradesh, India\n*Vizhinjam, Trivandrum, India\n*Waitemata Harbour, Auckland, New Zealand\n*Willemstad, Curaçao\n*Wellington Harbour, New Zealand\n\nOther notable harbors include:\n*Belém, Brazil\n*Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge, Flanders, Belgium\n*Port of Genoa, Italy\n*Port of Gdańsk, Poland\n*Kahului, Hawaii, United States\n*Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand\n*Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n*Keelung, Taiwan\n*Keppel Harbour, Singapore\n*Kilindini Harbour, Kenya\n*Manukau Harbour, Auckland, New Zealand\n*New Haven Harbor, Connecticut, United States\n*Portland Harbour, Dorset, England, United Kingdom\n*Rades, Tunisia\n*Rio Grande, Brazil\n*San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States\n*Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, Scotland, United Kingdom\n*Sydney Harbour, Australia\n*Port of Szczecin, Poland\n*Trondheim, Norway\n*Valparaiso, Chile\n*Vladivostok, Russia\nQuestion:\nWhat is the world’s largest natural harbour?\nAnswer:\nMiddle Habour\nPassage:\nDemonstration sport\nA demonstration sport is a sport which is played to promote it, most commonly during the Olympic Games, but also at other sporting events.\n\nDemonstration sports were officially introduced in 1912 Summer Olympics, when Sweden decided to include glima, traditional Icelandic wrestling, in the Olympic program, but with its medals not counting as official. Most organizing committees then decided to include at least one demonstration sport at each edition of the Games, usually some typical or popular sport in the host country, like baseball at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and taekwondo at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. From 1912 to 1992, only two editions of the Summer Olympics did not have demonstration sports on their program. Some demonstration sports eventually gained enough popularity to become an official sport in a subsequent edition of the Games. Traditionally, the medals awarded for the demonstration events followed the same design as the Olympic medals, but of a smaller size. They are never included in the medal count.\n\nDemonstration sports were suspended after the 1992 Summer Olympics, as the Olympic program grew bigger and it became more difficult for the organizing committees to give them the appropriate attention, since the IOC required the same treatment to be dispensed for official and demonstration sports.  It is unlikely that they will be reintroduced as a requirement for future Olympic organizing committees. However, the Beijing Olympic Committee received permission from the IOC to run a wushu competition parallel to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008.   \n\nFrom the 1984 Summer Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics, two Paralympic events (a men's and a women's wheelchair racing event) were included in the athletics programme of each Games. These events are considered by many as a demonstration sport, but are, in fact, used to promote the Paralympic Games.  Disabled events in alpine and Nordic skiing (1988 only) were also held as demonstration sports at the 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nSummer Olympics\n\nHere is the list of demonstration sports played at the Summer Olympic Games:\n\n*1 Although demonstration sports were \"officially\" introduced only in 1912, at the first Olympics some sports competitions were held simultaneously to the games, and today are considered \"unofficial\" or demonstration sports as well. \n*2 Removed from Olympic program after 2008.\n*3 Was part of the program in 1936.\n*4 Was part of the program between 1896 and 1924.\n*5 The IOC permitted a parallel Wushu competition to be run, but this was not an official demonstration sport.\n*6 The IOC permitted a parallel eSports competition to be run, but this was not an official demonstration sport.\n\nWinter Olympics\n\nHere is the list of demonstration sports played at the Winter Olympic Games:\n\n*5 Was part of the program in 1924, which in 2002 the IOC retroactively decided would be considered an official Olympic event.\nQuestion:\nIn which Olympics was taekwondo a demonstration sport?\nAnswer:\nSeoul 1988\nPassage:\nWilliam George Beers\nWilliam George Beers (May 5, 1843 – December 26, 1900), a noted Canadian dentist and patriot, is referred to as the \"father of modern lacrosse\" for his work establishing the first set of playing rules for the game.\n\nLacrosse\n\nWilliam Beers was involved with lacrosse from a young age.  As a teenager, in 1856, was a member of the Montreal Lacrosse Club. He was selected at age 17 to be a goalkeeper for a Montreal exhibition team that played a match before the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn 1860, Beers began to codify the first written rules of the modern game. Prior to this, all rules of the game needed to be decided prior to each game. Some of the rules established by Beers were the size of and the use of a rubber lacrosse ball, that the lacrosse stick could be any length, but the pocket needed to be flat in the absence of a ball, length of the field to 200 yd, size of the goal and goal crease, twelve members of a team on the field at a time, and the length of a match to first to reach five goals, or lead by three.  \n\nIn 1867, as lacrosse was growing significantly in popularity, Beers created the Canadian National Lacrosse Foundation. In 1869, Beers published a book on lacrosse entitled Lacrosse: The National Game of Canada. In 1876, Beers organized a team of Canadian players and Indians players to tour England, Scotland, and Ireland to showcase the sport.  During this trip in 1876, Queen Victoria witnessed an exhibition game and was impressed, saying \"The game is very pretty to watch.\" Her endorsement was enough for many English girls' schools to adopt the sport in the 1890s.  Again in 1883, Beers returned to England to showcase lacrosse.  This time Beers brought two teams to play exhibition game.\n\nDentistry\n\nBeers was a successful and notable dentist.  After finishing his schooling in 1856, Beers completed a dental apprenticeship.  By the early 1860s, Beers was a successful dentist and began publishing article in journals. In 1868, he founded Canada's first dental journal, the Canada Journal of Dental Science.    Although this publication failed, he went on to start the Dominion Dental Journal in 1889, which eventually became the modern day Journal of the Canadian Dental Association. He also served as dean of Quebec's first dental college - the Dental College of the Province of Quebec, founded in 1892. In 1896 this College became affiliated with Bishop's University as their Dental Faculty.  He held the position of Dean at Bishop's for only a short time; differences in opinion regarding curriculum and concerns over the use of untrained dental assistants led Beers to resign from the position. \n\nNationalism\n\nBeers was a strong Canadian nationalist. Besides advocating for lacrosse to become the national sport of Canada believing it would serve as \"unifying symbol for the emerging Canadian nationality,\" Beers also defended the country against the Fenian Raids in 1866 and 1870.   During the raids, Beers helped establish the Victoria Rifles of Canada. \n\nBibliography\nQuestion:\nIn 1867, William George Beers, a Canadian dentist, codified which sport (shortening the game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team), with the first game played under these rules at Upper Canada College between Upper Canada College and the Toronto Cricket Club?\nAnswer:\nLacrosse\nPassage:\nStraits of Johor\nThe Strait of Johore (also known as the Tebrau Strait, Johore Strait, Selat Johor, Selat Tebrau, and Tebrau Reach) is a strait that separates the Malaysian state of Johor on mainland Eurasia to the north from Singapore to the south.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Strait of Johore is the location of two Victoria Cross deeds. The award was for Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser and Acting Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis for the sinking of the 9,850-tonne Japanese cruiser Takao on 31 July 1945.\n\nThere are currently two man-made land connections over the strait. The Johor-Singapore Causeway, known simply as \"The Causeway\", links Johor Bahru and Woodlands in Singapore, while a bridge, known as the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, further west of the strait links Gelang Patah in Johor and Tuas in Singapore.\n\nPollution along the Strait of Johore is generally noted.  In 2003, Malaysia wanted to build a bridge across the strait to replace the existing causeway, but negotiations with Singapore were not successful. The main reasons cited for the change were: \n# a bridge would allow free flow of water across both sides of the strait which were artificially cut in two with the building of the causeway before (this would allow ships to bypass the port of Singapore).\n# a bridge would help ease congestion in Johor Bahru.\n\nIn August 2003, Malaysia announced that it was going ahead with a plan to build a gently sloping, curved bridge that would join up with Singapore's half of the existing causeway. The plans included a swing bridge for the railway line.  However, plans to build the bridge have been called off as of 2006.\n\nThe area is also a source of contention by both Malaysia and Singapore  due to land reclamation projects on both sides of the Causeway. There have been suggestions that the ongoing land reclamation projects may impact the maritime boundary, shipping lanes, and water ecology of the Malaysian side, as such Environmental Impact Assessments are requested before any reclamation is carried out such as the Forest City project.  Reclamation projects may also endanger the habitat and food source of dugongs, which are native to the strait.\n\nFormer Wakefield professional heavyweight boxer Paul Sykes claims to be the only person to have swum across the straits to avoid arrest.\n\nPlaces of interest \n\nStrait of Johore's most famous tourist attraction is Lido Beach,  located on the Malaysian side of the strait.  Here, visitors can walk or cycle along the 2 km stretch of the beach. There are also numerous restaurants and food stalls like Tepian Tebrau where one can sample delicacies that Johor Bahru has to offer.\n\nTributaries\n\nMajor tributaries which empty into the Strait of Johore include:\n\n*Sungai Tebrau\n*Sungai Segget\n* Johor River\n*Sungai Sengkuang\n*Sungai Haji Rahmat\n*Sungai Kempas\n*Sungai Sri Buntan\n*Sungai Abd Samad\n*Sungai Air Molek\n*Sungai Stulang\n*Sungai Setanggong\n*Sungai Tampoi\n*Sungai Sebulong\n*Sungai Bala\n*Sungai Pandan\n*Sungai Tengkorak\n*Sungai Plentong\n*Sungai Senibong\n*Sungai Pulai\n\nNote: Sungai is the Malay word for river.\nQuestion:\nThe straits of Johor separate which island from the Malay Peninsula?\nAnswer:\nSingapore City (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nPort and starboard\nPort and starboard are nautical terms for left and right, respectively. Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel, facing forward. Starboard is the right-hand side, facing forward. Since port and starboard never change, they are unambiguous references that are not relative to the observer. \n\nThe term starboard derives from the Old English steorbord, meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their centrelines, they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship and, because more people are right-handed, on the right-hand side of it. The term is cognate with the Old Norse stýri (rudder) and borð (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. Hence the left side was called port.  \n\nFormerly larboard was used instead of port. This is from Middle-English ladebord and the term lade is related to the modern load. Larboard sounds similar to starboard and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that port be used instead.  Larboard continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers. In Old English the word was bæcbord, of which cognates are used in other European languages, for example as the German backbord and the French term bâbord (derived in turn from Middle Dutch). \n\nAt night, the port side of a vessel or aircraft is indicated with a red navigation light and the opposite side with a green one, to help avoid collisions. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right. If the courses of two boats are intersecting, the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel. Sidelights are each lit from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its corresponding side. A mnemonic for this is \"If to starboard red appear, 'tis your duty to keep clear. Green to green, red to red perfect safety, go ahead.\"\nQuestion:\nWhat colour light indicates the starboard side of a boat?\nAnswer:\nGreenishly\nPassage:\nSugarloaf Mountain\nSugarloaf Mountain () is a peak situated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at the mouth of Guanabara Bay on a peninsula that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean.  Rising 396 m above the harbor, its name is said to refer to its resemblance to the traditional shape of concentrated refined loaf sugar. It is known worldwide for its cableway and panoramic views of the city.\n\nOverview\n\nThe  mountain is only one of several monolithic granite and quartz mountains that rise straight from the water's edge around Rio de Janeiro.  A glass-walled cablecar (in popular Portuguese, bondinho – more properly called teleférico), capable of holding 65 people, runs along a 1400-meter route between the peaks of Pão de Açúcar and Morro da Urca every 20 minutes. The original cable car line was built in 1912 and rebuilt around 1972/1973 and in 2008. The cable car leaves a ground station located at the base of the Babilônia hill, to the Urca hill and then to the Pão de Açúcar.\n\nOrigins of the name\n\nThe name \"Sugarloaf\" was coined in the 16th century by the Portuguese during the heyday of sugar cane trade in Brazil. According to historian Vieira Fazenda, blocks of sugar were placed in conical molds made of clay to be transported on ships. The shape given by these molds was similar to the peak, hence the name.\n\n1907 – The Brazilian engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos had the idea of linking the hills through a path in the air.\n1910 – The same engineer founded the Society of Sugar Loaf and the same year the works were started. The project was commissioned in Germany and built by Brazilian workers. All parts were taken by climbing mountains or lift by steel cables.\n1912 – Opening of the tram. First lift of Brazil. The first cable cars were made of coated wood and were used for 60 years.\n1972 – The current template trolley was put into operation. This increased the carrying capacity by almost ten times.\n2009 – Inauguration of the next generation of cable cars that had already been purchased and are on display at the base of Red Beach.\n\nReaching the site\n\nTo reach the summit, passengers take two cable cars. The first ascends to the shorter Morro da Urca, 220 m high. The second car ascends to Pão de Açúcar.  The Swiss-made bubble-shaped cars offer passengers 360-degree views of the surrounding city. The ascent takes three minutes from start to finish.\n\nRock climbing\n\nVisitors can  watch rock climbers on Sugarloaf and the other two mountains in the area: Morro da Babilônia (Babylon Mountain), and Morro da Urca (Urca's Mountain). Together, they form one of the largest urban climbing areas in the world, with more than 270 routes, between 1 and 10 pitches long.\n\nAppearances in media\n\n*Flying Down to Rio (1933) Starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The beach-side Hotel Atlantico has views across the bay looking toward Sugar loaf Mountain.\n*Now, Voyager (1942)  Starring Bette Davis.\n*In the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker, the villainous henchman Jaws (played by Richard Kiel) attempts to kill 007 (Roger Moore) and the agent's ally, Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), on a cable car. However, Bond and Goodhead escape and Jaws collides with the building at the bottom of the cable car route, demolishing the building but escaping unscathed. \n*Herb Alpert recorded a song entitled \"Sugarloaf\" for his 1982 album Fandango.\n*In The Simpsons episode \"Blame It on Lisa\", Homer's kidnappers meet with the rest of the family for the exchange between two cable cars.\n*In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, this mountain can be seen from the map \"Favela\".\n*In the film Rio, the mountain can be seen several times throughout the film.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay.jpg|View of Sugarloaf from the terrace of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of St. Anthony), c. 1816.

They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes.\n\nThe significance of quarter days is now limited, although leasehold payments and rents for land and premises in England are often still due on the old English quarter days.\n\nThe quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on. Accounts had to be settled, a reckoning had to be made and publicly recorded on the quarter days. \n\nIn England\n\nThe English quarter days (also observed in Wales and the Channel Islands) are\n* Lady Day (25 March)\n* Midsummer Day (24 June)\n* Michaelmas (29 September)\n* Christmas (25 December)\n\nLady Day was also the first day of the year in British dominions (excluding Scotland) until 1752 (when it was harmonised with the Scottish practice of 1 January being New Year's Day). The British tax year still starts on \"Old\" Lady Day (6 April under the Gregorian calendar corresponded to 25 March under the Julian calendar: 11 days new-style calendar advance in 18th century plus 1 day due to the twelfth skipped Julian leap day in 1800; however it was not changed to 7 April when a thirteenth Julian leap day was skipped in 1900). The dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century were the same as those in Scotland.Fitton, Mike (1994) [http://www.mpsgg.com/WDIM/WDIM_06.html Quarter Days and Courts]\n\nThe cross-quarter days are four holidays falling in between the quarter days: Candlemas (2 February), May Day (1 May), Lammas (1 August), and All Hallows (1 November). The Scottish term days, which fulfil a similar role as days on which rents are paid, correspond more nearly to the cross-quarter days than to the English quarter days.\n\nThere is a mnemonic for remembering on which day of the month the first three quarter days fall (Christmas being easy to recall): Every quarter day is twenty-something, and the second digit of the day of the month is the number of letters in the month's name. So March has five letters and Lady Day is 25 March; similarly June has four letters and September nine, with Midsummer Day and Michaelmas falling on the 24th and 29th respectively.\n\nAt many schools, class terms would begin on the Quarter days; for example, the autumn term would start on September 29, and thus continues to be called the Michaelmas term, especially at more traditional universities. \n\nIn Ireland\n\nPrior to the Christianization of Ireland in the 5th century AD, the Celtic quarter days were observed:\n\n*Lughnasadh (1 August)\n*Samhain (1 November)\n*Imbolc (1 February)\n*Beltaine (1 May)\n\nThese are now called cross-quarter days since they fall about halfway into each of the English quarters.\n\nIn Scotland\n\nThe \"Old Scottish term days\" corresponded approximately to the old Celtic quarter days:\n* Candlemas (2 February)\n* Whitsunday (legislatively fixed for this purpose on 15 May)\n* Lammas (1 August)\n* Martinmas (11 November).\n\nThese were also the dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century.\n\nThe dates for removals and for the employment of servants of Whitsunday and Martinmas were changed in 1886 to 28 May and 28 November respectively.  The Term & Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990 redefined the \"Scottish term days\", in official use, as the 28th of February, May, August and November respectively. The Act specifies that the new dates take effect on 13 June 1991 (12 months from the date it was passed).\nQuestion:\nThe quarter day Michaelmas occurs on which date of the year?\nAnswer:\nSept 29\nPassage:\nCujo\nCujo is a 1981 psychological horror novel by Stephen King about a rabid dog. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1982,  and was made into a film in 1983.\n\nBackground\n\nCujo's name was based on the nom de guerre of Willie Wolfe, one of the men responsible for orchestrating Patty Hearst's kidnapping and indoctrination into the Symbionese Liberation Army.   Stephen King discusses Cujo in On Writing, referring to it as a novel he \"barely remembers writing at all\". The book was written during a period when King was drinking heavily. Somewhat wistfully, King goes on to say that he likes the book and that he wishes he could remember enjoying the good parts as he put them down on the page. \n\nPlot\n \nThe story takes place in the setting of numerous King works; the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. Revolving around two local families, the narrative is interspersed with vignettes from the seemingly mundane lives of various other residents. There are no chapter headings but breaks in between passages to indicate when the narration switches to a different point of view.\n\nThe principal characters are the Trenton and the Camber families. The middle-class Trentons have recently moved to Castle Rock from New York City, bringing with them their four-year-old son, Tad. Father Vic discovers that his wife Donna has recently concluded an affair. In the midst of this household tension, Vic's advertising agency is failing, and he is forced to travel out of town, leaving Tad and Donna at home. The blue-collar Cambers are longtime residents; Joe is a mechanic who dominates and abuses his wife Charity and their ten-year-old son Brett. Charity wins a $5,000 lottery prize and uses the proceeds to trick Joe into allowing her to take Brett on a trip to visit Charity's sister, Holly, in Connecticut. Joe acquiesces, secretly planning to use the time to take a pleasure trip to Boston.\n\nCujo, the Camber's large, good-natured St. Bernard, chases a wild rabbit in the fields around their house and inserts his head in the entrance to a small limestone cave, where a rabid bat bites him on the nose and turns him mad. Soon after Charity and Brett leave town, Cujo attacks and kills their alcoholic neighbor, Gary Pervier. When Joe calls on Gary, Cujo also kills him. \n\nDonna, home alone with Tad, takes their failing Ford Pinto to the Cambers' for repairs. The car breaks down in Camber's dooryard, and as Donna attempts to find Joe, Cujo appears and is ready to pounce. She climbs back in the car, and Cujo starts to attack. Donna and Tad are trapped in their vehicle, the interior of which becomes increasingly hot in the sun. During one escape attempt, Donna is bitten in the stomach and leg but manages to survive and escape back into the car. She plans to run for the Cambers' home but abandons the idea due to her fears that the door will be locked, and she will be subsequently killed by Cujo, leaving her son alone.\n\nVic returns to Castle Rock after several failed attempts to contact Donna and learns from the police that Steve Kemp, the man with whom Donna was having an affair, is suspected of ransacking his home and possibly kidnapping Donna and Tad. To explore all leads, the state police send Castle Rock Sheriff George Bannerman out to the Cambers' house, but Cujo attacks and kills him. Donna, after witnessing the attack and realizing Tad is in danger of dying of dehydration, battles Cujo and kills him. Vic arrives on the scene with the authorities soon after, but Tad has already died from exposure. Donna is rushed to the hospital, and Cujo's head is removed for a biopsy prior to cremation of his remains.\n\nThe novel ends several months later with both the Trenton and Camber families trying to go on with their lives: Donna has completed her treatment for rabies, her marriage with Vic has survived, and Charity gives Brett a new, vaccinated puppy named Willie. A postscript reminds the reader that Cujo was a good dog who always tried to keep his owners happy, but the ravage of rabies drove him to violence.\nQuestion:\nWhat disease did Cujo have?\nAnswer:\nRabies\nPassage:\nCarpe diem\nis a Latin aphorism, usually translated \"seize the day\", taken from book 1 of the Roman poet Horace's work Odes (23 BC).\n\nTranslation\n\n' is the second-person singular present active imperative of carpō \"pick or pluck\" used by Horace to mean \"enjoy, seize, use, make use of\".  Diem is the accusative case of the noun dies \"day\". A more literal translation of \"\" would thus be \"pluck the day [as it is ripe]\"—i.e., enjoy the moment.\n\nHistory\n\nSources\n\nText from Odes 1.11:\n\nIn ancient literature\n\nPerhaps the first written expression of the concept is the advice given by Siduri to Gilgamesh, telling him to forgo his mourning and embrace life although some scholars see it as simply urging Gilgamesh to abandon his mourning, \"reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of Mesopotamian society.\"  \n\nMeaning\n\nIn Horace, the phrase is part of the longer \"\", which can be translated as \"Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow (the future)\". The ode says that the future is unforeseen and that one should not leave to chance future happenings, but rather one should do all one can today to make one's future better. This phrase is usually understood against Horace's Epicurean background.  The meaning of \"\" as used by Horace is not to ignore the future, but rather not to trust that everything is going to fall into place for you and taking action for the future today. \n\nRelated expressions\n\nHebrew\n\nThe phrase  \"And if not now, then when?\" (Pirkei Avoth 1:14).\n\nOther Latin\n\n\"\" (\"gather, girl, the roses\") appears at the end of the poem \"\"[http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~Harsch/Chronologia/Lsante01/Vergilius/ver_apro.html \"\"] in a collection of the works of Virgil under the note \" (\"This poem was written by an unknown poet\"); , Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (\"Of growing roses\", also called Idyllium de rosis) attributed to Ausonius or Virgil. It encourages youth to enjoy life before it is too late; compare \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may\" from \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\".\n\n' (\"On the Shortness of Life\"), often referred to as Gaudeamus igitur, (\"Let us rejoice\") is a popular academic commercium song, on taking joy in student life, with the knowledge that one will someday die. It is medieval Latin, dating to 1287.\n\nRelated but distinct is the expression \"memento mori\" (\"remember that you are mortal\") which carries some of the same connotation as \"\". For Horace, mindfulness of our own mortality is key in making us realize the importance of the moment. \"Remember that you are mortal, so seize the day.\" Over time the phrase \"\" also came to be associated with penitence, as suggested in many vanitas paintings. Today many listeners will take the two phrases as representing almost opposite approaches, with \"\" urging us to savour life and \"\" urging us to resist its allure. This is not the original sense of the \"\" phrase as used by Horace.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society, the English teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams, famously says: \"Carpe Diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.\" Later, this line was voted as the 95th greatest movie quote by the American Film Institute.  The NBC television series Community later satirized the movie in the episode \"Introduction to Film,\" with John Michael Higgins playing a comedically eccentric version of Williams' character.\n\nThe American progressive metal band Dream Theater released the 23-minute epic \"A Change of Seasons\" on their 1995 album of the same name. The song numerously references the \"carpe diem\" or \"Seize the Day\" aphorism as part of its storyline. The song also includes audio samples from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society and quotes from the 1648 Robert Herrick poem, \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\", all of which are conceived surrounding the concept of \"carpe diem\".\n\nThe American heavy metal band Metallica produced a song called \"Carpe Diem Baby\" on their 1997 album Reload. The chorus contains the line \"Come squeeze and suck the day. Come carpe diem, baby!\"\nIn the film Poseidon (2006)  Richard Dreyfuss at 13:06 toasts his fellow travelers with \"Carpe diem, my friend. Carpe diem. There was no work crisis.\"\n\nThe soundtrack to the 2011 animated film Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension includes  a track called \"Carpe Diem\".\nThe American punk rock band, Green Day, produced a song called \"Carpe Diem\" on their 2012 album ¡Uno!. The chorus is \"Carpe Diem, a battle cry, are we all too young to die? Ask for reason, and no reply, are we all too young to die?\"\n\nThe English alternative rock band, You Me at Six, produced a song called \"Carpe Diem\" on their 2014 album Cavalier Youth. The chorus is \"Carpe diem 'til the very end. I have no regrets. Carpe diem 'til the bitter end.\"\n\nBob Catley's 1999 solo album Legends includes the song \"Carpe Diem\" with the chorus \"seize the day\".\n\nA song and single of the album Chokmah by the German singer Nena is called \"Carpe Diem\".\n\nIt is the motto of Marden High School; the École Mission Senior Secondary School; Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School.\n\nIn season 1 of the animated show Gravity Falls, there is an episode titled \"Carpet Diem\".\n\nIn season 1 of the hit sci-fi show Eureka, the local restaurant in town is called \"Café Diem\".\nQuestion:\nWhich two word Latin phrase means 'Seize the Day?\nAnswer:\nCarpe diem quam minimum credula postero\nPassage:\nTales from the Vienna Woods\nTales from the Vienna Woods () refers to several landmark works in German-language culture, including:\n*a waltz by Johann Strauss II;\n*a play by Ödön von Horváth; and\n*several film adaptations of the play.\nAlthough Strauss originally used the contracted spelling ' for his waltz, the name is also commonly cited as ', which is also the version by which some of the subsequent works are known.\n\nWaltz\n\nComposed in 1868, ', op. 325 was one of six Viennese waltzes by Johann Strauss II which featured a virtuoso part for zither. The waltz's premiere that year reiterated the ascendancy that the dance had made from its humble village origins to become one of the pleasures of fashionable Viennese society, largely thanks to the performing and composing talents of the Strauss dynasty. Nevertheless, the title of Strauss' dance recalls the folk music of the inhabitants of the Vienna Woods.\n\nThe waltz's introduction is one of the longest he ever wrote for a waltz, 119 bars in the musical score. The first part of the introduction starts off in C major, intertwining with F major before gaining ascendancy in volume and mood, finishing with a lunga direction. The second part, which is the more reflective, is in the key of G major with a solo violin incorporating bits of material which appear again in successive waltz sections. A short flute cadenza invoking birdsong comes in which moves on to the zither solo, marked moderato. The zither part involves two sub-sections of its own; the slowish ländler tempo and its more vigorous counterpart, with the direction of vivace (quickly). If the zither is unavailable, a string quartet plays the zither themes, instead. Loud orchestral chords brings the waltz back to reality, and the familiar waltz theme in F major is played.\n\nWaltz 2A and 2B are in B-flat major, whereas waltz 3A is in the key of E-flat major with a quick section in B-flat in waltz 3B. The entire waltz section 4 is in B-flat as well, whereas waltz section 5 is wholly in the E-flat key. Waltz 5B contains the customary climax with cymbals and is loudly played. After a brief and tense coda, waltz 1A and 2B makes a re-entry. As the waltz ushers closer to its end, the zither solo makes another appearance, reprising its earlier melody in the introduction. A crescendo in the final bars dispels the tranquility and the waltz is concluded with a brass flourish and snare drumroll.\n\nPlay\n\nIn allusion to Strauss' waltz, Ödön von Horváth wrote a play of almost the same name (') in 1931, for which he was honored with the prestigious Kleist Prize that year. This ' (popular play) was based in the contemporary setting of Wachau, Josefstadt, and the Vienna Woods just before the Austrofascist takeover. It tells the fate of a naive young woman named Marianne, who breaks off her reluctant engagement with Oskar the butcher after falling in love with a fop named Alfred who, however, has no serious interest in returning her love. For this error, she must pay bitterly. Werner Pirchner composed the incidental music to the play.\n\nFilms\n\nThe play was filmed for cinematic release in 1961 by director , starring Johanna Matz (Marianne), Walter Kohut (Alfred), Helmuth Lohner, Hans Moser (reprising his role of Marianne's father from the 1931 Berlin premiere), Helmut Qualtinger (Oskar) and Jane Tilden (Valerie), among others.  Another version was made for television in 1964. \n\nA 1979 remake was undertaken by director Maximilian Schell, this time featuring  (Marianne), Hanno Pöschl (Alfred), Helmut Qualtinger (Zauberkönig), Jane Tilden (Valerie), Adrienne Gessner (Alfreds Großmutter, i.e. Alfred's grandmother),  (Oskar), André Heller (Hierlinger) and  (Erich). \n\nAn unusual adaptation of the waltz appears in the first half of Bob Clampett's 1943 cartoon A Corny Concerto. Set to the tune of the waltz, Porky Pig and his dog are \"...hunting that @!!*@ rabbit.\" The rabbit of course is none other than Bugs Bunny, who proceeds to play a series of tricks on the aforementioned characters. The second half of the cartoon focuses on The Blue Danube, another famous composition by Johann Strauss II. The cartoon was incorporated into the 1975 documentary Bugs Bunny: Superstar.\n\nA small piece of Tales from the Vienna Woods was featured in the 1987 film Escape from Sobibor each time a train of Jews arrived at the death camp's railway station, apparently for the purpose of providing a calming atmosphere in order to ally fears and ensure compliance amongst the new arrivals to the camp.\nQuestion:\nWho composed the work Tales From the Vienna Woods?\nAnswer:\nStrauss jnr\nPassage:\nKorma\nKorma (from Turkish kavurma), also spelled kormaa, qorma, khorma, kurma, or qovurma, is a dish originating in South Asia[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/anjum_anand/article2773345.ece Amjum Anand (2007), My Chicken Korma (Times Online)] consisting of meat or vegetables braised in a spiced sauce made with yogurt, cream, nut or seed paste.\n\nHistory\n\nThe word \"korma\" is derived from Urdu ḳormā or ḳormah, meaning \"braise\",Singh, D. Indian Cookery, Penguin, 1970, pp.24-25 derived in turn from Turkish kavurma, literally meaning \"cooked meat\".  Korma ( in Persian)  has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine of modern-day India and Pakistan. It is a characteristic Moghul dish which can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal incursions into present-day Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with water, stock, and yogurt or cream added. The technique covers many different styles of korma.\n\nThe flavour of a korma is based on a mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as spinach and turnip. The term Shahi (), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.\n\nVariations\n\nIn the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a korma is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce, served in curry houses. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk.\n\nNavratan korma\n\nNavratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both.  \"Navratan\" means nine gems, and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables.\n\nIn Azerbaijan\n\nIn Azerbaijan korma which is spelled as qovurma has several types such as lamb qovurma, liver qovurma and sabzi qovurma.  Sabzi qovurma or lamb stew with herbs is a blend of Persian and Turkic cooking, as \"sabzi\" means \"green\" in Persian while \"qovurma\" means \"fried meat\" in Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages. Sabzi qovurma can be served with pilaf rice or as a dish on its own with yoghurt and crushed garlic. \n\nPreparation\n\nThe korma style is similar to all other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly or seared using a high heat and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid. The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking.\n\nChicken or other poultry requires fairly thorough coating with the spice mixture, or marinating, and heating evenly in cooking oil or ghee at a high enough temperature to cook through, followed by a cooling period after which yogurt or cream may be added. However, lamb requires a very brief initial searing to brown the surface of each piece, followed by a braising at a continuous low temperature. This prevents the lamb from toughening, a particular problem if a large amount is to be cooked; temperature heterogeneity is difficult if the mixture is left to stand. This low cooking temperature is usually quite difficult to achieve, but if done correctly results in a memorable dish.\n\nThe korma can make use of a technique called bagar: later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.Singh, p.26\n\nThere is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring.\n\nIn few korma recipes coconut is used as the spice base like vegetable korma with coconut. \n\nA korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.Singh, p.154\nQuestion:\n'Korma' is an Indian cooking instruction to do what?\nAnswer:\nPotroast\nPassage:\nGranthi\nA Granthi (,) is a person, male or female, of the Sikh religion who is a ceremonial reader of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is the Holy Book in Sikhism, often read to worshipers at Sikh temples called a Gurudwara. The name Granthi comes from the Sanskrit granthika, which means a relater or narrator. Any Sikh individual appointed the title of being a Granthi is considered a principal religious official of Sikhism. Although they are considered religious officials in Sikhism, they are not considered to be the equivalent of a priest, as the belief is that there are no such religious intermediaries. \n\nQualifications \n\nTo be appointed a Granthi, one of the main qualifications is the commitment to the Sikh religion by becoming an Amritdhari Sikh. This is an acceptance of the full physical and spiritual discipline outlined in the Sikh Reht Maryada through a religious ceremony performed at the Gurudwara called an Amrit Sanchar. This ceremony is approved and conducted by the Panj Pyare, the Five Beloved Ones, who have themselves committed to the religion by becoming an Amritdhari Sikh. The five who are selected to perform this ceremony are chosen by the holy congregation referred to as the Sangat.\n\nOther important qualifications include being able to read the holy scriptures of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is the duty of a Paathi in the Gurudwara. A Granthi must be able to interpret the sacred hymns written in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, referred to as Gurbani, and must be able to fluently deliver sermons to the Sangat at the Gurudwara. Another important qualification is the ability to complete all duties related to taking care of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib at ceremonies as it is referred to as the \"living Guru\" in a Gurudwara and by Sikhs worldwide.\n\nA Granthi has to spend a few years as an assistant to a qualified reputable Granthi, who will act as a mentor and pass on his or her knowledge to teach ceremonial aspects of his or her duties. Assistant Granthis must possess the skills to play  tabla, which is a pair of percussion drums use in classical Indian music. This is a necessity as they are required to join the head Granthi during Gurmat Kirtan, which is the rendering of verses from the Sri Guru Granth Sahib in the Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib, Taalas, and musical scores composed in the scripture, considered the most important aspect of a prayer gathering.\n\nIt is expected that an assistant Granthi looking to become a qualified Granthi be mentored for a minimum of three years so that they learn all aspects of the ceremonial procedures and that they build up their ability to become a head Granthi at a Gurudwara who can recite prayers to a medium- to large-size Sangat.\nQuestion:\nA ‘Granthi’ is the keeper and reader of the scriptures in which religion?\nAnswer:\nSikh faith\nPassage:\nJohn Peel - Disc Jockey - Biography.com\nJohn Peel - Disc Jockey - Biography.com\nDisc Jockey\nRadio disc jockey and presenter John Peel fueled the British independent music scene by debuting such performers as David Bowie, Joy Division and the Smiths.\nIN THESE GROUPS\nFamous British People\nSynopsis\nJohn Peel was born August 30, 1939 in Heswall, England. in 1959 he went to America and became a disc jockey for Radio WRR in Dallas.

Caprifolium Mill.) are arching shrubs or twining bines in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified. About 100 of these species can be found in China and approximately 20 native species have been identified in Europe, 20 in India, and 20 in North America. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle).  Hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers on some of these plants, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle gets its name  because edible sweet nectar can be sucked  from the flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\n\nDescription\n\nMost species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a large minority of shrubby habit; a handful of species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1–10 cm long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen. Many of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \"twinberry\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles. The fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species — see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\n\nInvasive species\n\nSeveral species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in New Zealand and the United States.  Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, and L. tatarica.\n\nCultivation\n\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. \n\nThe following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n*\n*L. similis var. delavayi \n*L. × purpusii 'Winter Beauty' \n*L. × tellmanniana \nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\n\nSelected species\n\nLonicera acuminata\nLonicera albiflora (white honeysuckle)\nLonicera alpigena (Alpine Honeysuckle)\nLonicera altmannii\nLonicera angustifolia\nLonicera anisocalyx\nLonicera arborea\nLonicera arizonica (Arizona honeysuckle)\nLonicera biflora\nLonicera bournei\nLonicera brevisepala\nLonicera buchananii\nLonicera buddleioides\nLonicera caerulea (blue-berried honeysuckle)\nLonicera calcarata\nLonicera calvescens\nLonicera canadensis (American fly honeysuckle)\nLonicera caprifolium (goat-leaf honeysuckle, perfoliate honeysuckle.

Large Conservative majorities followed at the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Thatcher herself was deposed in 1990, partly as a result of the mass disaffection generated by the poll tax, but the Conservatives under John Major won the 1992 election.\nThe Conservatives eased unions out of many institutions that were based on 'tripartism' (an earlier form of 'social partnership'). The most important were the various Industrial Training Boards, which were generally abolished. The most symbolic move was the downgrading and eventual termination (in 1992) of the National Economic Development Council, where six TUC leaders had met leading employers and government ministers monthly since 1962. The TUC also lost its monopoly on nominating trade unionists to public bodies (such as employment tribunals).\nIn 1984 the government banned trade union membership among its employees at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) at Cheltenham. There was such a reaction by unions to this policy that, although it was not reversed until Labour came into office, the Conservatives did not repeat it elsewhere.\nMore potently, Conservative governments passed a series of laws - in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990 and 1993 - which, cumulatively, greatly restricted and controlled trade union activity. This process reversed the historic role of most governments since the 1870s: to protect unions, by legislation, from court judgments that seriously interfered with their functioning in peacetime.\nIn the early 1980s, a policy of active opposition to the anti-union laws was won at the TUC, with activists hoping to repeat the successful (though often unofficial) movement against the Industrial Relations Act of 1971. But they faced a very different economic situation, a much more determined government and employers emboldened to exploit the changed balance of power. At critical moments some unions, in a weak position, looked to the TUC General Council to organise support action but this was never going to happen. TUC General Secretaries (Len Murray, 1973-84, and Norman Willis, 1984-93) were not going to risk the TUC directly breaking the law (however distasteful that law was).\nTrade Unions and Labour\nTrade unions' relationship with the Labour Party also changed. After 1979 an electoral college gave unions (with their large affiliated membership to the party) a direct vote for the first time in the election of the Labour Party leader and deputy. The Labour leadership's quest for electability in a period of Conservative dominance saw it shift from a left-wing programme at the beginning of the 1980s to gradually accept many of the Conservative changes. From Labour's link with unions having been seen as an electoral asset in the mid-1970s, the Conservatives had turned it into an electoral liability by skilfully exploiting and exaggerating the so-called 'Winter of Discontent' under the Labour government in 1978-79.\nOpposition leaders came and went: Michael Foot (1981-83), Neil Kinnock (1983-92), and John Smith (1992-94) who died in office. When Tony Blair became leader in 1994, he campaigned to drop the longstanding Clause 4 of the Labour Party constitution (of 1918), with its emphasis on 'common ownership' - part of his 'New Labour' project. It was replaced by a weaker formulation that also embraced 'the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition'. With the collapse of the Eastern European states and the Soviet Union in 1989-91 (precipitating the effective disintegration of the Communist Party of Great Britain), socialist ideas were in retreat before a tide of rampant capitalism.\nA lifeline for the unions came from an unlikely source. The two dominant union leaders of the 1970s, Jack Jones and Hugh Scanlon, had campaigned publicly for a 'no' vote in the 1975 national referendum on Britain's continued membership of the European Economic Community. Yet, at the 1988 TUC, Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, was enthusiastically received when he laid out his vision of a Europe with social rights at its heart. By 1995, the TUC had come out in support of statutory rights to representation (as in most of Europe), abandoning its long-held belief in voluntarism in this area. Increasingly Europe (rather than the British government) is the source of most individual employment rights, such as the Working Time Directive (with its right to paid holidays), health and safety law, and rights to consultation.\nDave Lyddon, Centre for Industrial Relations, Keele University\nQuestion:\nLionel was the first name of which trade union leader of the 1970s?\nAnswer:\nLord Murray of Epping Forest\n", "answers": ["ISO 3166-1:PG", "Papua Niu Gini", "New Guinea Papua", "Independent State of Papua New Guinea", "Health in Papua New Guinea", "Papa New Guinea", "Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinee", "Papua-New-Guinea", "Independen Stet bilong Papua Niugini", "Papua New Guinea", "Papua-new guinea", "State of Papua New Guinea", "Papua Niugini", "Niugini", "Papa New Guinans", "Environment of Papua New Guinea", "PapuaNewGuineA", "Papua New Guinean", "Papau New Guinea", "Papa new guinea", "Niu Gini", "Paupa New Guinea", "East Papua", "Pappa New Guinans", "Pua pua new guniea", "Papua, New Guinea", "Pappa New Guinea", "The Papua New Guinea", "Papua new guinea", "Papua-New Guinea", "Papua New-Guinea", "Papua NG"], "length": 6836, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "968538bca4885160e5064bc185b1f003b64d25ff044e254f"}
{"input": "Passage:\nIt Ain't Me Babe\n\"It Ain't Me Babe\" is a song by Bob Dylan that originally appeared on his fourth album Another Side of Bob Dylan, which was released in 1964 by Columbia Records. According to music critic Oliver Trager, this song, along with others on the album, marked a departure for Dylan as he began to explore the possibilities of language and deeper levels of the human experience. Within a year of its release, the song was picked up as a single by artists who were forging the folk rock movement, including The Turtles and The Byrds. \n\nInfluences\n\nDylan's biographers generally agree that the song owes its inspiration to his former girlfriend Suze Rotolo. He reportedly began writing the song during his visit to Italy in 1963 while searching for Rotolo, who was studying there.\n\nClinton Heylin reports that a Times reporter at a May 1964 Royal Festival Hall concert where Dylan first played \"It Ain't Me\" took the chorus \"no, no, no\" as a parody of the Beatles' \"yeah, yeah, yeah\" in \"She Loves You\".  The melody in both phrases uses a scale descending through a minor third. (Dylan played at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, May 17, 1964. The Times reviewed the performance in the following day's edition under the heading of \"A Minnesota Minstrel.\" However, the review makes no mention of \"It Ain't Me, Babe.\")\n\nNotable covers and references\n\n* Dylan and Johnny Cash were admirers of each other's work.  Cash recorded the song with June Carter. The song was released on Cash's 1965 album, Orange Blossom Special, and became a hit. This song was also featured in the 2005 film about Cash's life, Walk the Line, and was performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon on the film's soundtrack.\n* In 1965, The Turtles also had a breakthrough hit single of the song, which reached #8 in the U.S. and was then featured on their debut album of the same name.\n* Jan & Dean covered \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on their 1965 album, Folk 'n Roll.\n* \"It Ain't Me Babe\" was among many Dylan songs recorded by Joan Baez in the early years of her career. Baez's version appeared on her 1964 album Joan Baez/5, which also included \"Go 'Way From My Window.\"  Additionally, Baez's 1967 album Live In Japan contains the song. Dylan and Baez sang a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" at the Newport Folk Festival on July 24, 1964, as can be seen in the 2007 documentary film The Other Side of the Mirror, and their October 31, 1964 performance of it may be heard on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall, released in 2004.\n* Sebastian Cabot recorded a spoken-word variation of the song for his infamous Sebastian Cabot, actor...Bob Dylan, poet album in 1966.  This version was included in Golden Throats: The Great Celebrity Sing Off in 1988. \n* Nancy Sinatra covered \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on her #1 1966 Boots album.\n* Davy Jones covered the song on his 1965 self-titled debut album David Jones and released it as a single in 1967.\n* Chris Potter covered \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on his album Ultrahang.\n* Johnny Thunders covered the song on the 1983 album Hurt Me.\n* Christofer Drew of Never Shout Never covered the song in 2010 for Billboards website Billboard.com.\n* The Brazilian singer Mallu Magalhães covered the song in her first performances, one of them included on her DVD.\n* The pop-punk band New Found Glory covered the song on their album From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II.\n* Bryan Ferry covered the song on Another Time, Another Place album in 1974\n* Kesha covered the song on 2016 Billboard Music Awards on May 22, 2016.\nQuestion:\nTo whom was Bob Dylan supposed to be singing It Ain’t Me Babe\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nGerman for Beginners: Lesson 7 - German Numbers and ...\nGerman Numbers and Counting (0-20)\nGerman Numbers and Counting (1)\nDie Zahlen und zählen (0-20)\nThe numbers and counting in German  are not difficult to learn, but... true mastery of numbers, in any language, takes time.

Though studies are still in their infancy, psychiatrists do their best to tailor treatments to each specific case through trial and error. One of the most important aspects when treating Androphobia is being comfortable and at ease with what the counselor is doing. As many times phobias can lead to full-blown panic attacks , discomfort can be detrimental to the healing process.\nNeuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is one form of treatment for Androphobia, which has shown positive and effective results. NLP is based around the idea that all behaviors are structured. By helping Androphobic patients to reprogram these behaviors, psychiatrists say it is possible to help patients manage, if not dissipate, their phobia through reprogramming the way the brain reacts to men. Hypnotherapy has also shown positive results in treating Androphobia. Hypnotherapy takes place with a therapist first putting their patient into a trance-like state. By relaxing the patient, the therapist attempts to bypass the “logical” part of the brain in order to reprogram the subconscious mind.\nAndrophobia can be crippling, but there is always help. Any number of counselors can help in controlling or even overcoming phobias, giving suffers a new way to leave their lives. With the number of treatment methods available almost every case can be helped, all anyone has to do is ask.\nView Resources\nQuestion:\nIf you suffered from androphobia what would you be afraid of?\nAnswer:\nManhoods\nPassage:\nA Rake's Progress\nA Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.\n\nThe filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. \n\nPaintings\n\nAdaptations\n\nGavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.\n\nThe 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.\n\nIgor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled \"The Rake's Progress\" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.\nQuestion:\n\"Who made two series of engravings based on two series of his paintings, called \"\"A Rake's Progress\"\" and \"\"A Harlot's Progress\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nHogarthian\nPassage:\nAllegra Kent\nAllegra Kent (born August 11, 1937) is an American ballet dancer and actress.\n\nIris Margo Cohen was born to Jewish parents, Harry Herschel and Shirley (née Weissman) Cohen, and later changed her name to Allegra Kent.  Kent grew up in what she later described as a dysfunctional environment. In Once a Dancer: An Autobiography,Once a Dancer: An Autobiography © 1997, St. Martin's Press; ISBN 0-312-15051-2, 1st edition January 1997. she describes her Texan father (\"who liked to substitute 'Cowboy' for Herschel\") as having \"a gambler's soul and a restless nature\" (at pgs 5, 7). She describes her Wisznice (present-day Poland)-born immigrant mother as feeling \"neither European nor American; she was ashamed of her [own] parents... she borrowed a neighbor's working papers and took a job at twelve. By fourteen, she was teaching ballroom dancing at night in someone's private home, mostly to Japanese men\" (at pg. 6). \n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Kent studied with Bronislava Nijinska and Carmelita Maracci before joining the School of American Ballet. She had completely flat feet as a little girl and consulted a doctor, who prescribed wedges in her shoes to give her arches. She then began taking ballet. \n\nAfter graduating, she joined the New York City Ballet in 1953 at the age of 15, and was promoted to principal in 1957. Many roles in George Balanchine's ballets were created for her, including Seven Deadly Sins, Ivesiana and Bugaku. She danced the role of Dewdrop in the 1958 Playhouse 90 telecast of Balanchine's version of The Nutcracker. \n\nShe performed in such ballets as Serenade, Agon and Dances at a Gathering. She retired in 1981, becoming a ballet teacher, and in 1997 published an autobiography, Once a Dancer. In 2012, Kent published her first book for children, Ballerina Swan, with Holiday House Books for Young People, illustrated by Caldecott Medalist Emily Arnold McCully.  It has received rave reviews from The New York Times,  Kirkus Reviews,  and School Library Journal.  In Fall of 2013, Ballerina Swan was adapted for the stage as a dance piece by New York City Children's Theater,  featuring choreographer Michael McGowan and artistic director Barbara Zinn Krieger. The adaptation received positive reviews by the New York Times,  Time Out New York Kids,  The Mama Maven,  and many others.  Due to its success, in December 2015, New York City Children's Theater produced a revival of \"Ballerina Swan.\"\n\nAllegra Kent currently teaches ballet at Barnard College. \n\nSources\n\n*The Encyclopedia of Dance & Ballet (1977), Rainbird Reference Books Ltd.; ISBN 0-907408-63-X \n*[http://www.ballerinagallery.com/kent.htm Profile], ballerinagallery.com; accessed November 10, 2014.\nQuestion:\nIn which branch of the arts does Allegra Kent work?\nAnswer:\nBallet\nPassage:\nKnights who say Ni\nThe Knights who say \"Ni!\" , also called the Knights of Ni, are a band of knights encountered by King Arthur and his followers in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  They demonstrate their power by shouting \"Ni!\" (pronounced \"nee\"), terrifying the party, whom they refuse to allow passage through their forest unless appeased through the gift of a shrubbery.\n\nDescription\n\nThe knights appear silhouetted in a misty wood, wearing robes and horned helmets; their number is never apparent, but there are at least six.  The leader of the knights, played by Michael Palin, is the only one who speaks to the party.  He is nearly double Arthur's height, and wears a great helm decorated with long antlers.  The other knights are large, but of human proportions, and wear visored sallet helmets decorated with cow horns.  The knight explains that they are the \"keepers of the sacred words 'Ni', 'Peng', and 'Neee-Wom'.\"  Arthur confides to Sir Bedivere, \"those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!\" \n\nTasks\n\nThe knights demand a sacrifice, and when Arthur states that he merely wishes to pass through the woods, the knights begin shouting \"Ni!\", forcing the party to shrink back in fear.  After this demonstration of their power, the head knight threatens to say \"Ni!\" again unless the travelers appease them with a shrubbery; otherwise they shall never pass through the wood alive.  When Arthur questions the demand, the knights again shout \"Ni!\" until the travelers agree to bring them a shrubbery, which the head knight specifies must be \"one that looks nice.  And not too expensive.\"\n\nIn order to fulfill their promise to the Knights of Ni, the party visits a small village, where Arthur and Bedivere ask an old crone where they can obtain a shrubbery.  The woman questions them, and Arthur admits that it is for the Knights who say \"Ni!\", whereupon she refuses to cooperate.  Arthur then threatens to say \"Ni!\" to the old woman unless she helps them, and when she still refuses, begins shouting \"Ni!\".  Bedivere has trouble saying the sacred word, which he pronounces \"Nu!\" until Arthur demonstrates the correct technique.  As the crone shrinks back from their combined assault, they are interrupted by Roger the Shrubber, who laments the lack of law and order that allows ruffians to say \"Ni!\" to an old woman.  Arthur obtains a shrubbery from Roger, and brings it to the Knights of Ni.\n\nThe head knight acknowledges that \"it is a good shrubbery,\" but asserts that the knights cannot allow Arthur and his followers to pass through the wood because they are no longer the Knights who say \"Ni!\"  They are now the Knights who say \"Ekke Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing!\" and must therefore give Arthur a test.  Unable to pronounce the new name, Arthur addresses them as \"Knights who until recently said 'Ni!',\" inquiring as to the nature of the test.  The head knight demands another shrubbery, to be placed next to but slightly higher than the first; and then Arthur \"must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest—with a herring!\"  The knight presents a herring to be used.  Arthur objects, asserting that \"it can't be done!\" upon which the knights recoil as though in fear and pain.  It soon emerges that the knights are unable to withstand the word \"it\", which Arthur's party is unable to avoid saying.  The knights are soon incapacitated by the word, which even the head knight cannot stop repeating, allowing Arthur and his followers to make their escape.\n\nFilm notes\n\nIn the original screenplay, it was suggested that the head knight be played by \"Mike standing on John's shoulders\".  In the DVD commentary for the film, Michael Palin states that their use of the word \"Ni!\" was derived from The Goon Show.  Upon Arthur's return, the knights were to have said, \"Neeeow...wum...ping!\" \n\nOther appearances\n\nThe Knights who say \"Ni\" reprise their role in the musical Spamalot.\n\nContemporary scholarship\n\nThe Knights who say \"Ni\" have been cited as an example of intentional disregard for historical accuracy in neo-medievalism, which may be contrasted with the casual disregard for historical accuracy inherent in more traditional works of the fantasy genre.   However, in Medievalisms: Making the Past in the Present, the authors suggest that the original characters of Monty Python and the Holy Grail actually represent medievalism, rather than neomedievalism, as many of the film's details are in fact based on authentic medieval texts and ideas.  With respect to the Knights who say \"Ni\", the authors suggest that Sir Bedivere's difficulty pronouncing \"Ni!\", despite its levity, \"carries a very learned joke about the difficulties of pronouncing Middle English,\" alluding to the Great Vowel Shift, which occurred in English during the late medieval period. \n\nFootnotes\nQuestion:\nIn ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’, what was desired by the knights who say ‘Ni’?\nAnswer:\nShrubbery\nPassage:\nLord Frederick Cavendish\nLord Frederick Charles Cavendish  (30 November 1836 – 6 May 1882) was an English Liberal politician and protégé of the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone.  Cavendish was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in May 1882 but was murdered only hours after his arrival in Dublin, a victim of the politically motivated Phoenix Park murders.\n\nBackground and education\n\nBorn at Compton Place, Eastbourne, Sussex, Cavendish was the second son of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, by his wife Lady Blanche Howard, fourth daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle, and the brother of Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire, who had also been Chief Secretary. Cavendish, after being educated at home, matriculated in 1855 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1858,  and then served as a cornet with the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry cavalry.\n\nPolitical career\n\nFrom 1859 to 1864 Cavendish was private secretary to Lord Granville. He travelled in the United States during 1859 and 1860, and in Spain in 1860. He was elected to parliament as a Liberal for the Northern Division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, 15 July 1865, and retained that office until his death. After serving as private secretary to the prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, from July 1872 to August 1873 he became a junior Lord of the Treasury, and held office until the resignation of the ministry. He was Financial Secretary to the Treasury from April 1880 to May 1882, when soon after the resignation of William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, he was appointed to succeed him.\n\nIn company with the Earl Spencer, Lord-Lieutenant, he proceeded to Dublin, and took the oath as chief secretary at Dublin Castle, on 6 May 1882; but on the afternoon of the same day, while walking in Phoenix Park in company with Thomas Henry Burke, the Permanent Under-Secretary, he was attacked from behind by several men from an extreme Irish nationalist group known as the Irish National Invincibles, who with knives murdered Burke and him.  The event was  known as the Phoenix Park Murders. His body being brought to England, was buried in Edensor churchyard, near Chatsworth, on 11 May, where 300 members of the House of Commons and 30,000 other persons followed the remains to the grave. The trial of the murderers in 1883 (see James Carey) made it evident that the death of Cavendish was not premeditated, and that he was not recognised by the assassins; the plot was against Burke, and Cavendish was murdered because he happened to be in the company of Burke.\n\nFamily\n\nCavendish married, on 7 June 1864, Lucy Caroline Lyttelton, second daughter of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, granddaughter of Sir Stephen Glynne and niece of William Ewart Gladstone's wife Catherine. She was maid of honour to the Queen.\n\nA statue of Cavendish can be found in the plaza behind the town hall of Barrow-in-Furness, where his father invested heavily in local industries. A window in memory of Cavendish was placed in St Margaret's Church, Westminster, at the cost of the members of the House of Commons. His imposing white Carrara marble tomb can be seen in Cartmel Priory, Cumbria. There is also a memorial fountain to him at Bolton Abbey.\n\nFile:St Peter's Church, Edensor - funeral of Lord Frederick Cavendish (1836–1882) 1.JPG|The funeral of Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish in St Peter's Churchyard, Edensor\nSt Peter's Church, Edensor - Memorial to Lord Frederick Cavendish (1836–1882).JPG|St Peter's Church, Edensor - Memorial to Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish\nChapel window by Hardman at St Peter's Church, Edensor.jpg|Window erected in his memory in St Peter's Church, Edensor made by Hardman & Co. in 1882\nCavendish Memorial, Bolton Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 747970.jpg|The memorial to Cavendish at Bolton Abbey\nMemorial to Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish (geograph 3663852).jpg|Memorial to Cavendish at Bolton Abbey erected by tenants of the Estate\n\nAncestry\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nIn which Irish park was Lord Cavendish assassinated in 1882?\nAnswer:\nPhœnix\nPassage:\nAde Adepitan\nAde Adepitan MBE (born 27 March 1973) is a British television presenter and wheelchair basketball player.

It is shared between the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, lying within western central London. The park covers an area of 111 ha.  The open spaces of Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park together form an almost continuous \"green lung\" in the heart of London between Kensington and Westminster.\n\nKensington Gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nBackground and location\n\nKensington Gardens are generally regarded as being the western extent of the neighbouring Hyde Park from which they were originally taken, with West Carriage Drive (The Ring) and the Serpentine Bridge forming the boundary between them. The Gardens are fenced and more formal than Hyde Park. Kensington Gardens are open only during the hours of daylight, whereas Hyde Park is open from 5 am until midnight all year round, which includes many hours of darkness.\n\nKensington Gardens were long regarded as smarter than Hyde Park because of its more private character around Kensington Palace. However, in the late 1800s, Hyde Park was considered the more \"fashionable\" of the two because of its location nearer to Park Lane (Mayfair) and Knightsbridge, adjoining the entrance to central London opposite Wellington Arch and was therefore more crowded.\n\nHistory\n\nKensington Gardens was originally the western section of Hyde Park, which had been created by Henry VIII in 1536 to use as a hunting ground. It was separated from the remainder of Hyde Park in 1728 at the request of  Queen Caroline and designed  by Henry Wise and Charles Bridgeman in order to form a landscape garden, with fashionable features including the Round Pond, formal avenues and a sunken Dutch garden.\n\nBridgeman created the Serpentine between 1726 and 1731 by damming the eastern outflow of the River Westbourne from Hyde Park.  The part of the Serpentine that lies within Kensington Gardens is known as \"The Long Water\". At its north-western end (originally the inflow of the River Westbourne) in an area known as \"The Italian Garden\", there are four fountains and a number of classical sculptures. At the foot of the Italian Gardens is a parish boundary marker, delineating the boundary between Paddington and St George Hanover Square parishes, on the exact centre of the Westbourne river.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe land surrounding Kensington Gardens was predominantly rural and remained largely undeveloped until the Great Exhibition in 1851. Many of the original features survive along with the Palace, and now there are other public buildings such as the Albert Memorial (at the south-east corner of Kensington Gardens, opposite the Royal Albert Hall), the Serpentine Gallery, and Speke's monument.\n\nThe park also contains the Elfin Oak, an elaborately carved 900-year-old tree stump.\n\nCultural references\n\nThe park is the setting of J.M. Barrie's book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, a prelude to the character's famous adventures in Neverland. The fairies of the gardens are first described in Thomas Tickell's 1722 poem Kensington Gardens. Both the book and the character are honoured with the Peter Pan statue by George Frampton located in the park.\n\nRodrigo Fresán's novel Kensington Gardens concerns in part the life of J.M. Barrie and of his creation Peter Pan, and their relationship with the park, as well as the narrator's own.\n\nThe Infocom interactive fiction game Trinity begins in the Kensington Gardens. The player can walk around many sections of the gardens, which are described in moderate detail.\n\nThe park is a prominent aspect of the short horror novel The Beast, Ashley McClung, due to the events of the opening and closing chapters occurring at this location.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Italian Garden fountains.jpg|Italian Garden fountains\nImage:London Serpentine Bridge from East.jpg|The Serpentine Bridge seen from Hyde Park\nImage:Kensington Gardens (The Flower Walk), London.JPG|Kensington Gardens, near the Flower Walk\nImage:London Kensington Gardens The Long Water.jpg|The Long Water looking north-west from the Serpentine Bridge\nImage:Equestrian statue called Physical Energy in Hyde Park in the City of Westminster, London in spring 2013 (8).JPG|Physical Energy by G.

It's happened five times in the Premier League era. In South America, it isn't rare for goalkeepers to take free kicks near goal or penalty kicks.\nHere's a look at the top 10 goals scored by goalkeepers in world football.\nTweet\nRogerio Ceni of Sao Paulo is more prolific at scoring goals than many strikers. The Brazilian has tallied over 100 goals in his career, the most of any keeper in history.\nWhile none of Ceni's goals have come from open play, the 40-year-old does deserve some credit for his set-piece work.\nThis free kick into the upper corner from about 25 yards out was good enough to make No. 10 on the list.\nTweet\nLike Ceni, the flamboyant Jose Luis Chilavert was no stranger to taking free kicks for whatever team he was on.\nMost of his free kicks were a lot closer than the one that earned him the No. 9 spot. After a foul against his team, Velez Sarsfield, in his own half, he noticed the River Plate goalkeeper was off his line.\nChilavert rushed up to take the kick, catching his own teammates and even the referee, who had to duck, off-guard. The ball dropped over German Burgos' head and into the net.\n\"I always say that an angel put that one in for me. If I took another 1,000 kicks like that, I'd never score another one like it,\" Chilavert said in an interview with FIFA.com.\nTweet\nIt's not often that the back line raises their hands to appeal for an offside call against the opposing keeper.\nBut that was the situation the Dortmund defense found themselves in 1997. Lehmann had come forward in search of an equalizing goal and found himself open on the back post for a header. The Schalke keeper was so wide open that Dortmund believed he had to be offside.\nThe ball came quickly toward Lehmann, who did well to direct it on target for the tying goal.\nTweet\nAli Ahamada claimed that he had an image of himself in his head scoring a goal, but I doubt it looked like this.\nWith Toulouse trailing Rennes 2-1 in 2012, Ahamada came forward on a free kick. The Frenchman appears to misjudge the ball badly on his run, but somehow recovers and heads the ball in while falling backwards.\n\"It was a magical moment. We all dream of one day scoring. For this little dream to come true, it's pretty special—to have enjoyed it with my team-mates and the public. That will remain etched in my memory,\" said Ahamada after the match.\nTweet\nMost strikers would be jealous about the amount of height and power Mart Poom got on this header in 2003.\nPlaying for Sunderland in the Football League Championship against his former club Derby County, Poom found himself on the end of a corner kick from Sean Thornton. The Estonian's powerful header gave Sunderland a 1-1 draw and cancelled out Ian Taylor's goal just a couple of minutes before.\nTweet\nWhen goalkeepers find themselves with the ball at their feet outside of their normal comfort zone, panic can often set in.\nWhat makes this goal from William Hesmer so good is the amount of poise he shows in finishing his chance.\nTrailing 2-1 in the Trillium Cup Derby against Toronto FC in 2010, Hesmer finds the ball come to his feet after a corner kick is headed down in the area. Instead of immediately lashing at the ball, the Columbus keeper shows a great first touch and enough patience to wait out challenges from the Toronto defense before slotting home the equalizer.\nThe amount of composure is even more remarkable considering it was the first time he ever went forward.\n\"I've never gone into the box before, it's my first time ever,\" Hesmer said after the match.\nTweet\nNormally when goalkeepers score a goal, they rescue a point for their team with a late game-tying goal. Rarely does it rescue an entire season.\nCarlisle United needed a win on the final day of the 1998-99 season to avoid relegation out of the Football League. With just seconds to go against Plymouth Argyle and the scoreline 1-1, Glass trotted up from his own area to try to save Carlisle from the drop.\nWhile the finish wasn't technically superior, Glass tucked the ball inside the post from six yards out and triggered a massive pitch invasion with his heroics.\nGlass only played three matches for Carlisle United in his career. He had come to the club on loan from Swindon Town. But he'll never have to buy a drink in Carlisle again.\nMost of us find the League Cup to be an annoyance or a chance to give younger players some experience instead of a competition worth winning.\nYou couldn't tell that from the reaction of Leeds United in 2003 against Swindon Town.\nPaul Robinson produced a magical header to level the cup tie at 2-2 and force extra time. A seasoned striker would have difficulty getting the cross on target, considering how far Robinson is in front of the near post. But the former England international manages to direct the header all the way to the back post and in the corner of the net.\nLeeds would end up winning the match on penalties, but would be relegated later that season.\nQuestion:\nWhich former Derby County, Sunderland and Arsenalfootballer is the only Estonian ever to have played in the Premier League?\nAnswer:\nMART POOM\nPassage:\nCLANCY BROTHERS - THE IRISH ROVER LYRICS\nCLANCY BROTHERS - THE IRISH ROVER LYRICS\nThe Irish Rover Lyrics\nAnd the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and six\nWe set sail from the port quay of Cork\nWe were sailing away with a cargo of bricks\nFor the grand City Hall in New York\nWe'd a near-leaking craft, she was rigged fore and aft\nAnd how the trade winds drove her\nShe had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts\nAnd they called her the Irish Rover\nAnd there was Bobby McGee from the banks of the Leith\nThere was Hogan from county Tyrone\nThere was John D.

It took place at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 1 June 2013.\n\nThe race was won by Ruler of the World, at odds of 7/1 ridden by jockey Ryan Moore. The winner gave Aidan O'Brien his fourth success and was the first horse since Shergar to win both the Chester Vase and the Derby.  The favourite Dawn Approach finished last of the twelve runners. \n\nRace synopsis \n\nDawn Approach, who had been sired by 2008 Derby winner New Approach, was a 5-4 favorite leading into the race, having won the 2013 2000 Guineas Stakes, the first leg of Britain's Triple Crown, by 5 lengths.  The only other horse from the 2000 Guineas was Mars, going off at 12-1.  Appearing in his third race was Ruler of the World, who did not race as a two-year-old, but he won his first race, a maiden race at Curragh by 3 1/2 lengths and also took the Chester Vase by six lengths.  Ruler of the World went off at 7-1 odds. \n\nPresent for the race, as in years past, was Queen Elizabeth II, along with a crowd of 18,237.  Favourite Dawn Approach would be ridden by Kevin Manning, who had also ridden his father New Approach to the 2008 Derby win.  Ruler of the World, who would go on to win this year's Derby, was ridden by Ryan Moore, after fellow jockey Joseph O'Brien elected to ride Battle of Marengo.  Both Battle of Marengo and Ruler of the World were trained by Aidan O'Brien from Ballydoyle, who is Joseph's father.  O'Brien would train five of the twelve horses in the race, also including Mars, Flying the Flag, and Festive Cheer.\n\nAt the start of the race, favourite Dawn Approach showed little discipline, and was out of the running by the first furlong.  Though he led briefly at the one-mile mark, he would fall to the back of the pack and finished last, half a length behind Ocean Applause.  Early in the straight Ruler of the World overtook his stable companion Battle of Marengo and established a clear advantage which he maintained throughout the final quarter mile and won by a length and a half. Libertarian finished strongly, overtaking several horses in the closing strides to finish second ahead of Galileo Rock and Battle of Marengo.\n\nFollowing the race, winning jockey Ryan Moore stated \"I planned to be a bit closer but I just didn’t get away very well —- it was a very messy race.\"  Trainer Aiden O'Brien, on winning his fifth Derby stated that Ruler of the World \"quickened up well that day and won like a very good horse.\" \n\nRace details\n\n* Sponsor: Investec\n* Winner's prize money: £782,314\n* Going: Good\n* Number of runners: 12\n* Winner's time: 2 minutes, 39.06 seconds\n\nFull result\n\nWinner details\n\nFurther details of the winner, Ruler of the World:\n* Foaled: 17 March 2010, in Ireland\n* Sire: Galileo; Dam: Love Me True (Kingmambo)\n* Owner: Derrick Smith, Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor\n* Breeder: Southern Bloodstock\n\nForm analysis\n\nTwo-year-old races\n\nNotable runs by the future Derby participants as two-year-olds in 2012:\n\n* Dawn Approach – 1st in Coventry Stakes, 1st in Vincent O'Brien Stakes, 1st in Dewhurst Stakes\n* Battle of Marengo - 1st in Beresford Stakes\n\nThe road to Epsom\n\nEarly-season appearances in 2013 and trial races prior to running in the Derby:\n\n* Dawn Approach – 1st in 2000 Guineas\n* Ruler of the World - 1st in Chester Vase\n* Libertarian – 1st in Dante Stakes\n* Battle of Marengo – 1st in Ballysax Stakes, 1st in Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial\n* Ocavango – 1st in Prix Greffulhe\n* Chopin – 1st in Dr. Busch-Memorial\n* Festive Cheer - 2nd in Prix Hocquart\n\nSubsequent Group 1 wins\n\nGroup 1 / Grade I victories after running in the Derby:\n\n* Dawn Approach – St. James's Palace Stakes (2013)\nQuestion:\nWhich horse won the 2013 Epsom Derby at 7 to 1?\nAnswer:\nRuler of the World\nPassage:\nSepoy\nA sepoy was formerly the designation given to an Indian soldier. In the modern Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Pakistan Army and Bangladesh Army it remains in use for the rank of private soldier. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe term \"sepoy\" is derived from the Persian word sepāhī () meaning \"infantry soldier\" in the Mughal Empire. In the Ottoman Empire the term Sipahi was used to refer to cavalry troopers.  In its most common application, sepoy was the term used in the British Indian Army, and earlier in that of the British East India Company, for an infantry private (a cavalry trooper was a sowar). \n\nHistorical usage\n\nThe term sepoy came into use in the forces of the British East India Company in the eighteenth century, where it was one of many, such as peons, gentoos, mestees and topasses used for various categories of native soldier. Initially it referred to Hindu or Muslim soldiers without regular uniform or discipline. It later generically referred to all native soldiers in the service of the European powers in India. Close to ninety-six percent of the British East India Company's army of 300,000 men were native to India and these sepoys played a crucial role in securing the subcontinent for the company. \n\nSepoys in the Mughal Empire\n\nA Sipahi or a sepoy was an infantryman in both the Mughal Empire and the Kingdom of Mysore. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707) raised battalions of sepoys variously armed with matchlocks, rockets, and grenades.  These troops were successfully employed in siege warfare, particularly during the Siege of Bidar, the Siege of Bijapur and the Siege of Golconda.\n\nSepoys in British service\n\nInitially the British recruited sepoys from the local communities in the Madras and Bombay Presidencies, the emphasis being on recruits having adequate physique and being of sufficient caste. In the Bengal Army however, recruitment was only amongst high caste Brahmin and Rajput communities, mainly of the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions. Recruitment was undertaken locally by battalions or regiments often from the same community, village and even family. The commanding officer of a battalion became a form of substitute for the village chief or gaon bura. He was the mai-baap or the \"father and mother\" of the sepoys making up the paltan (from \"platoon\"). There were many family and community ties amongst the troops and numerous instances where family members enlisted in the same battalion or regiment. The izzat (\"honour\") of the unit  was represented by the regimental colours; the new sepoy having to swear an oath in front of them on enlistment. These colours were stored in honour in the quarter guard and frequently paraded before the men. They formed a rallying point in battle. The oath of fealty by the sepoy was given to the East India Company and included a pledge of faithfulness to the salt that one has eaten.\n\nThe salary of the sepoys employed by the East India Company, while not substantially greater than that paid by the rulers of Indian states, was usually paid regularly. Advances could be given and family allotments from pay due were permitted when the troops served abroad. There was a commisariat and regular rations were provided. Weapons, clothing and ammunition were provided centrally, in contrast to the soldiers of local kings whose pay was often in arrears. In addition local rulers usually expected their sepoys to arm themselves and to sustain themselves through plunder.\n\nThis combination of factors led to the development of a sense of shared honour and ethos amongst the well drilled and disciplined Indian soldiery who formed the key to the success of European feats of arms in India and abroad.\n\nFollowing the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the surviving East India Company regiments were merged into a new Indian Army under the direct control of the British Crown. The designation of \"sepoy\" was retained for Indian soldiers below the rank of lance-naik, except in cavalry where the equivalent ranks were sowar or \"trooper\".  \n\nSepoys in French service\n\nFollowing the formation of the French East India Company (Compagnie des Indes) in 1719, companies of Indian sepoys (cipayes) were raised to augment the French regulars and Swiss mercenary troops available. By 1720 the sepoys in French service numbered about 10,000.  Although much reduced in numbers after their decisive defeat in India at the Battle of Wandewash in 1760, France continued to maintain a Military Corps of Indian Sepoys (corps militaire des cipayes de l'Inde) in Pondicherry until it was disbanded and replaced by a locally recruited gendarmerie in 1898. \n\nSepoys in Portuguese service\n\nSepoys were also recruited in Portuguese India.  The term \"cipaio\" (sepoy) was also applied by the Portuguese to African soldiers in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, plus African rural police officers. Cipaios from Angola provided part of the garrison of Goa during the final years of Portuguese rule of that Indian territory.\n\nOther usages\n\nThe same Persian word reached English via another route in the form of spahi.  Zipaio, the Basque version of the word, is used by leftist Basque nationalists as an insult for members of the Basque Police,  implying that they are not a national police but servants of a foreign occupier.\n\nIn Hispanic American countries, especially in Argentine, the word cipayo has historically been used as an abusive colloquial expression referring to individuals considered as serving foreign interests, especially those of the United States or Britain.\nQuestion:\nThe Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 that was fought in places like Cawnpore, Lucknow before ending in Gwalior is said to be the first war of independence in the history of which country?\nAnswer:\nഭാരത മഹാരാജ്യം\nPassage:\nHM Prison Lindholme\nHM Prison Lindholme  is a Category C/D men's prison located near Hatfield Woodhouse in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Lindholme is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated in close proximity to Hatfield and Moorland prisons.\n\nHMO Lindholme will close in late 2017 to early 2018 for reasons not yet confirmed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe site was originally constructed as RAF Lindholme during the Second World War to house and operate bombers. During the RAF station's lifetime it was home to the RAF Bomber Command Bombing School (BCBS) and also the RAF Navigation School. BCBS moved out in 1972, and RAF Lindholme became a radar installation with its hangars converted for storage, eventually being downgraded to a relief glider landing field and closing altogether shortly thereafter.  The site re-opened as a prison in 1985. Most of the original buildings and hangars from the RAF station are still in use as prison accommodation, offices and workshops. In 2000, the old RAF Officers' Mess building (which had been used as a Category D prison wing) was converted into an Immigration Removal Centre.\n\nHMP Lindholme has recently been going through the bid process, a tendering process which initially had looked like Serco were to be given the contract to run the establishment along with HMP Moorlands. Due to irregularities with Serco's other government contracts this is now in doubt. Lindholme is currently one of the most cost-effective prisons with a budget just short of 11 million GBP per year (approximately 1,000 prisoners). Figures were taken from parliamentary questions.\n\nOn 14 July 2011, it was announced that HMP Lindholme would be put out to tender, accepting bids from private companies and HM Prison Service for the management of the establishment.  In November 2013 it was announced that HMP Lindholme along with the two other contested sites in South Yorkshire would remain in the public sector, ending two years of uncertainty. \n\nIn April 2012, the Immigration Removal Centre was closed and converted back to a Category D prison wing. In June 2013 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons was strongly critical of the Category D wing of the prison (now closed). The report also stated that there were religious tensions at the prison, illegal drugs and alcohol were widely available, and that the needs of disabled inmates were neglected. However the report also stated that much of the training for prisoners was of good quality, and that vocational courses in construction and baking were \"outstanding\". \n\nLindholme today\n\nLindholme holds Cat C male prisoners only. The prison holds Category C convicted males over the age of 21, and a small number of Cat D males awaiting allocation. The prison has the space to hold 1,010 inmates of Certified National Accommodation and an Operational Capacity to the same number. \n\nThe Category C site consists of 11 wings, 6 of the which are dormitories that have single and multi-occupancy rooms. 3 wings are relatively new additions to the prison and are single cell occupancy. A further new wing opened in November 2007 with double cells. The Induction Unit has double cells, and a purpose built Care and Separation Unit was built in 2008.\n\nThe prison education department offers inmates opportunities to study for qualifications such as NVQs, GCSEs and A Levels in subjects including English, math, ESOL, information technology, business administration, graphic design, reprographics and printing, visual art, catering, baking, hospitality, hairdressing and barbering, industrial cleaning, construction industry training in trowel trades, plastering, painting and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, civil engineering, fork lift training, light engineering, railway engineering, horticulture, waste management, textiles, and a range of PE courses.\nQuestion:\nLindholme Prison is situated dose to which English town or city?\nAnswer:\nDoncaster, England\nPassage:\nMona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)\n\"Mona Lisa\" is a popular song written by Ray Evans and Jay Livingston for the Paramount Pictures film Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1950). \nThe title and lyrics refer to the renaissance portrait Mona Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci.\nThe song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1950. \n\nNat King Cole version\n\nMusical arrangement was handled by Nelson Riddle and the orchestral backing was played by Les Baxter and his Orchestra.   \nThe recording was originally the B-side of \"The Greatest Inventor Of Them All.\" \nIn an American Songwriter magazine interview, Jay Livingston recalled that the original advertisements for the record did not even mention \"Mona Lisa;\" only upon returning home from a publicity junket of numerous radio programs did the song become a hit.\n\nThe soundtrack version by Nat King Cole spent eight weeks at number one in the Billboard singles chart in 1950. Cole's version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1992.   Cole described this song as one of his favorites among his recordings.\n\nCover versions\n\nThe Billboard sales charts of 1950 also showed significant sales on versions by Dennis Day and Harry James. Hit versions for Moon Mullican #4 (Country) and Jimmy Wakely #10 (Country) were also featured in 1950.\n\nVarious artists, including Jim Reeves, Elvis Presley 1959 (home recording), Willie Nelson 1981, Art Lund, Shakin' Stevens 1981, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, the Neville Brothers 1981, and Nat King Cole's daughter Natalie Cole 1992, have released cover versions of this song. Bruddah Iz (Israel Kamakawiwo'ole) also covered the song on the album Alone in IZ World. Harry Connick, Jr. included the song on his 2009 album, Your Songs.  (Andy Williams recorded it in 1964) \n\nA rockabilly version of \"Mona Lisa\" (b/w/ \"Foolish One\") was released by Carl Mann on Phillips International Records (#3539) in March 1959 and reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Conway Twitty recorded a version of \"Mona Lisa\" in February 1959, but planned to release it only as an album cut (on an EP and an LP, Conway Twitty Sings by MGM Records). Nevertheless, it peaked at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in that year and in the top 30 in the United States. Sam Phillips signed Carl Mann to record his version of the song after the Twitty version began getting radio play in early 1959.  This was the most successful single in Mann's career. The melody is slightly different, and the lyrics are also mostly the same as in the original version by Nat King Cole, though a few more phrases are added in that elaborate more on the girl he likes. Brian Setzer covered the Mann version in his 2005 Rockabilly Riot Vol. 1: A Tribute to Sun Records.\n\nThe singer Don Cherry recorded a version backed by the Victor Young Orchestra which reached number seven in 1952. Andy Williams released a version on his 1964 album, The Academy Award-Winning \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and Other Hit Songs from the Movies. In 1994, Alexia Vassiliou covered the song in the live album from Sony BMG Horis Revma.\n\nLittle Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1990 album Singalong with Little Willie Littlefield.\n\nPhil Ochs, known for his protest songs in the 1960s, performed the song in 1970 at his infamous Carnegie Hall concert. The cover appears on the 1974 concert album Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.\n\nIn the early 1950s, German bandleader Kurt Henckels recorded a big band version in the pre-WWII style on the East German Amiga label.\n\nLegacy\n\nPartygoers sing Mona Lisa in the background of one scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). \nIn 1986, the song was used as the theme to the British film Mona Lisa. \nThe song was used in the wedding scene of the NBC mini-series, Witness to the Mob, in 1998.\nThe song was also used in the film by Andrew Bergman, The Freshman, in which Marlon Brando spoofs his performance in The Godfather.\n\nChart performance\n\nMoon Mullican\n\nJimmy Wakely\n\nConway Twitty\nQuestion:\n\"The Academy Award-winning song \"\"Mona Lisa\"\", written by Ray Evans and Jay Livingston for the film \"\"Captain Carey, U.S.A\"\", was a 1950 hit for which artist?\"\nAnswer:\nJet My Love\n", "answers": ["Peacock", "Peahens", "Peacocks", "Peachick", "Pavo, Afropavo", "Pea fowl", "White peacock (bird)", "Peahen", "Pea cock", "Peacock feather", "Peacockery", "Peafowl", "Indian Blue Peacock"], "length": 5913, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c9550d3f26ecccb2d0b8eac7ca9edaaa8cec81eaf676359e"}

In 1965, he published one of his theories called \"Tuckman's stages of group development\". In 1977, he added a fifth stage named Adjourning. According to the Tuckman theory of group development, there are four phases of group development: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (and Adjourning, added in 1977). \n\nTuckman was also known for his research on college students' procrastination and development of the Tuckman Procrastination Scale (1991).\n\nHe served as professor of educational psychology at The Ohio State University, where he founded and directed the Walter E. Dennis Learning Center with the mission of providing students of all backgrounds with strategies for college success that enabled them to enter, excel in, and complete programs of postsecondary education. To teach students strategies for succeeding in college, he co-authored the textbook, Learning and Motivation Strategies: Your Guide to Success, with Dennis A. Abry and Dennis R.

Lysander tells Hermia that as long as there has been true love, there have been seemingly insurmountable difficulties to challenge it. He goes on to list a number of these difficulties, many of which later appear in the play: differences in birth or age (“misgrafted in respect of years”) and difficulties caused by friends or “war, death, or sickness,” which make love seem “swift as a shadow, short as any dream” (I.i.137, I.i.142–144). But, as Hermia comments, lovers must persevere, treating their difficulties as a price that must be paid for romantic bliss. As such, the above lines inaugurate the play’s exploration of the theme of love’s difficulties and presage what lies ahead for Lysander and Hermia: they will face great difficulties but will persevere and ultimately arrive at a happy ending.\n2.\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\nHelena utters these lines as she comments on the irrational nature of love. They are extremely important to the play’s overall presentation of love as erratic, inexplicable, and exceptionally powerful (I.i.227–235). Distressed by the fact that her beloved Demetrius loves Hermia and not her, Helena says that though she is as beautiful as Hermia, Demetrius cannot see her beauty. Helena adds that she dotes on Demetrius (though not all of his qualities are admirable) in the same way that he dotes on Hermia. She believes that love has the power to transform “base and vile” qualities into “form and dignity”—that is, even ugliness and bad behavior can seem attractive to someone in love. This is the case, she argues, because “love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind”—love depends not on an objective assessment of appearance but rather on an individual perception of the beloved. These lines prefigure aspects of the play’s examination of love, such as Titania’s passion for the ass-headed Bottom, which epitomizes the transformation of the “base and vile” into “form and dignity.”\n3.\nLord, what fools these mortals be!\nPuck makes this declaration in his amazement at the ludicrous behavior of the young Athenians (III.ii.115). This line is one of the most famous in A Midsummer Night’s Dream for its pithy humor, but it is also thematically important: first, because it captures the exaggerated silliness of the lovers’ behavior; second, because it marks the contrast between the human lovers, completely absorbed in their emotions, and the magical fairies, impish and never too serious.\n4.\nI have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about t’expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom.\nBottom makes this bombastic speech after he wakes up from his adventure with Titania; his human head restored, he believes that his experience as an ass-headed monster beloved by the beautiful fairy queen was merely a bizarre dream (IV.i.199–209). He remarks dramatically that his dream is beyond human comprehension; then, contradicting himself, he says that he will ask Quince to write a ballad about this dream. These lines are important partially because they offer humorous commentary on the theme of dreams throughout the play but also because they crystallize much of what is so lovable and amusing about Bottom. His overabundant self-confidence burbles out in his grandiose idea that although no one could possibly understand his dream, it is worthy of being immortalized in a poem. His tendency to make melodramatic rhetorical mistakes manifests itself plentifully, particularly in his comically mixed-up association of body parts and senses: he suggests that eyes can hear, ears see, hands taste, tongues think, and hearts speak.\n5.\nIf we shadows have offended,\nThink but this, and all is mended:\nThat you have but slumbered here,\nWhile these visions did appear;\nAnd this weak and idle theme,\nNo more yielding but a dream,\nGentles, do not reprehend.\nIf you pardon, we will mend.\nPuck speaks these lines in an address to the audience near the end of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, extending the theme of dreams beyond the world of the play and putting the reality of the audience’s experience into question (V.epilogue.1–8). As many of the characters (Bottom and Theseus among them) believe that the magical events of the play’s action were merely a dream, Puck tells the crowd that if the play has offended them, they too should remember it simply as a dream—“That you have but slumbered here, / While these visions did appear.” The speech offers a commentary on the dreamlike atmosphere of A Midsummer Night’s Dream and casts the play as a magical dream in which the audience shares.\nQuestion:\n\"\"\"The course of true love never did run smooth\"\" is a line from which play?\"\nAnswer:\nA midsummer night's dream\nPassage:\nHonshu\nis the largest and most populous island of Japan,  located south of Hokkaido across the Tsugaru Strait, north of Shikoku across the Inland Sea, and northeast of Kyushu across the Kanmon Straits. The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to its south and east. It is the seventh largest island in the world, and the second most populous after Java.  \n\nHonshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kantō plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe, and Hiroshima; by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.  The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. Its climate is humid and mild.\n\nGeography\n\nThe island is roughly 1300 km long and ranges from 50 to wide, and its total area is , 60% of the total area of Japan, making it slightly larger than Great Britain.  Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north, but global sea level rise has diminished these effects. Honshu has 5450 km of coastline.\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as    while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3776 m, which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps run the length of Honshu, dividing the northwestern (Sea of Japan) shore from the southeastern (Pacific or Inland Sea) shore; the climate is generally humid subtropical in the southern and coastal parts of the island and humid continental in the northern and inland portions.\n\nExtreme points\n\nThe northernmost point on Honshu is the tip of the Shimokita Peninsula in Ōma, Aomori; Cape Kure lies at the southern extreme in Kushimoto, Wakayama. The island's eastern extremity is Todogasaki in Miyako, Iwate, and its western one is Bishanohana in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi. Honshu spans more than eight degrees of latitude and 11 degrees of longitude.\n\nBridges and tunnels\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku by tunnels or bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyō Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima-Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaido, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connects Honshu with Kyushu.\n\nAdministrative regions and prefectures\n\nThe island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.\n\nThe regions are: \n*Tōhoku — Aomori Prefecture, Iwate Prefecture, Miyagi Prefecture, Akita Prefecture, Yamagata Prefecture, Fukushima Prefecture\n*Kantō — Ibaraki Prefecture, Tochigi Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefecture\n*Chūbu — Niigata Prefecture, Toyama Prefecture, Ishikawa Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture, Yamanashi Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, Gifu Prefecture, Shizuoka Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture\n*Kansai — Mie Prefecture, Shiga Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture, Hyōgo Prefecture, Nara Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture\n*Chūgoku region — Tottori Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, Okayama Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, Yamaguchi Prefecture\n\nNatural features \n\nMinerals \n\nYields of zinc, copper, and oil have been found on Honshu. \n\nAgriculture \n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu. Fruits, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton are grown in Honshu. Niigata is noted as an important producer of rice. The Kantō and Nōbi plains produce rice and vegetables. Yamanashi is a major fruit-growing area, and Aomori is famous for its apples.\nQuestion:\nWhat undersea rail tunnel, 33.5 miles long is the longest operational underground railway tunnel in the world ?

Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening. Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano's bright yellow colour. Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla. In the final stage, distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. Galliano has been formulated at both 60 proof (30% by volume) and 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume).\n\nTaste\n\nGalliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes.  The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as Sambuca, Pernod, or Anisette. It is used both as a digestivo (meant for drinking after heavy meals), and as an ingredient for cocktails, most notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream. It is also used in a popular Brooklyn cocktail, Mr. October,  which the New York Times notes, \"tastes like apple pie à la mode, thanks to Galliano’s vanilla notes.\" \n\nOwnership\n\nThe Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column.\n Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia,  where the products are popular as shots.\nGalliano also makes Galliano Ristretto coffee-flavored liqueur and Galliano Balsamico, a balsamic vinegar-infused liqueur. Both Galliano Autentico and Galliano Vanilla, as used in the Harvey Wallbanger, are available.\n\nAwards\n\nGalliano has earned bronze and silver medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.  Another spirit ratings organization, Wine Enthusiast, gave Galliano L'autentico a score of \"90-95\" in 2011. \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nVodka, Galliano and orange juice make up which cocktail?\nAnswer:\nGeorge Bednar\nPassage:\nInitialism | Define Initialism at Dictionary.com\nInitialism | Define Initialism at Dictionary.com\ninitialism\n[ih-nish-uh-liz-uh m] /ɪˈnɪʃ əˌlɪz əm/\nSpell\nnoun\n1.\na set of initials representing a name, organization, or the like, with each letter pronounced separately, as FBI for Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n2.\na name or term formed from the initial letters of a group of words and pronounced as a separate word, as NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization; an acronym .\n3.\nthe practice of using initials or forming words from initials.\nOrigin of initialism\nQuestion:\nWhat is the term for a word formed from the initial letters of other words, such as NATO?\nAnswer:\nAcronymous\nPassage:\nDead man's hand\nThe makeup of poker's dead man's hand has varied through the years. Currently, the dead man's hand is described as a two-pair poker hand consisting of the black aces and black eights. Along with an unknown \"hole\" card, these were the cards reportedly held by \"Old West\" folk hero, lawman and gunfighter, Wild Bill Hickok when he was murdered.\n\nEarliest details\n\nThe expression \"dead man's hand\" appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s.  The earliest detailed reference to the \"dead man's hand\" was 1886, where it was described as a \"full house consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens\".  Jacks and sevens are called the 'dead man's hand' in the 1903 Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences  Edmond Hoyle references the Dead Man's Hand as \"Jacks and eights\" in 1907. \n\nHickok's hand\n\nWhat is considered the dead man's hand card combination of today gets its notoriety from a legend that it was the five-card stud hand held by James Butler Hickok (better known as \"Wild Bill\" Hickok) when he was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall on August 2, 1876, in Nuttal & Mann's Saloon at Deadwood, Dakota Territory. Reportedly, Hickok's final hand included the aces and eights of both black suits. \n\nThe make-up\n\nAccording to a book by Western historian Carl W. Breihan, the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand: \"Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy's son: the ace of diamonds with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickock's blood on it.\" \n\nHickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: \"The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights [clubs and spades], and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker' [card].\"  However, Rosa said no contemporaneous source for this exact hand can be found.  The solidification in gamers parlance of the dead man's hand as two pair, \"aces and eights\", didn't come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book, Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers—50 years after Hickok's death.\n\nThe fifth card\n\nIn accounts that mention two aces and eights, there are various claims regarding the identity of Hickok's fifth card, suggestions that he had discarded one card or that the draw was interrupted by the shooting and Hickok therefore never received his fifth card.\n\nHistorical displays in the town of Deadwood, including one in a reconstruction of the original saloon, display the nine of diamonds as the fifth card. The Lucky Nugget Gambling Hall, at the historic site of Nuttal & Mann's Saloon, displays a jack of diamonds instead. The old Stardust Casino on the Las Vegas Strip had used a five of diamonds in related displays.  The western-themed collectible card game Doomtown (and its rebooted expandable card game, Doomtown: Reloaded) uses the Dead Man's Hand as the highest rank in the game, and uses the Jack of Diamonds as the fifth card. \n\nLegacy\n\nBoth the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Division and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System use the dead man's hand in their insignia, .\nQuestion:\nThe two black aces and the two black eights is called the 'Dead Man's Hand' in poker, who is said to have been holding it when he was shot in the back in 1876?\nAnswer:\nWild Bill Hickok\nPassage:\nPapa & Nicole\n\"Papa\" and \"Nicole\" were fictional characters created to advertise the Renault Clio in the United Kingdom between 1991 and 1998. The \"Papa!\" \"Nicole\" and \"Nicole!\" \"Papa\" verbal exchanges between Nicole and her father during the advertisements were adapted from an original exchange between Nicole Bonnet (played by Audrey Hepburn) and her father (played by Hugh Griffith) in the 1966 film How to Steal a Million. Surveys by Channel 4 and ITV revealed the series as the most popular car advertisements ever made. In 1996, one survey found that Nicole was recognised by more Britons than the Prime Minister John Major, Bob Hoskins or Chris Evans.  Renault was found to be the most persuasive advertiser in five European countries in 1994. The advert was designed by the Publicis agency.\n\nCast\n\n* 'Nicole' - Estelle Skornik\n* 'Papa' - Max Douchin\n* Unnamed - Vic Reeves\n* 'Bob' - Bob Mortimer\n\nSkornik had not passed her driving test when the first Clio advertisements were made. Professional driver Penny Mallory  drove in place of both Nicole and Papa.\n\nEpisodes\n\n#  ('Interesting'), 1991\n#  ('The meeting'), 1992\n#  ('Skiing'), 1993\n#  ('Transformation'), 1994\n#  ('Mum'), 1995\n#  ('Moved on'), 1996\n#  ('Parallel lives'), 1997\n#  ('The Wedding'), 1998\n\nFinalé\n\nAn all-new second generation Renault Clio was launched in 1998, and with it came the finalé of Nicole's Provençale story.\n\nMuch publicity and speculation surrounded the question of whom Nicole would marry. Socialite and It girl Tara Palmer-Tomkinson noted, \"I can't understand what she is doing getting married. I mean, she is giving up everything. She is one of the most beautiful, stunning, eligible girls around. She must be off her rocker. I mean, she had everything going for her, driving around the country in her Renault Clio, all at Daddy's, or rather Papa's, expense. I should be so lucky.\"\n\nThe finalé was itself a spoof of the film The Graduate. Wearing a dress by Deborah Milner and a hairstyle by Nicky Clarke, with her ring designed by Stephen Webster, Nicole was led down the aisle to the as-yet-unseen groom. Played during the advertising break for Coronation Street on 29 May 1998, an estimated 23 million viewers watched Nicole leave Vic Reeves at the altar and start a new life with Bob Mortimer in his new Renault Clio.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nAll but one of the advertisements used Renault's 1980s and 1990s signature tune, Robert Palmer's Johnny And Mary. Each used a variation of the song, including Martin Taylor's acoustic interpretation, an alternative version of which he released on his album Spirit of Django and Renault's promotional compilation, Miles More Music.   The advert to not use Johnny And Mary was Le Changement ('Moved On') from 1996, where Soul II Soul song Keep On Movin' was used.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* The £350 dress worn in the first advertisement inspired a £37.99 copy at Selfridges. \n* The comedy duo Alas Smith and Jones parodied the advertisements in a sketch showing \"Papa\" kerb-crawling looking for a prostitute and accidentally attempting to hire the services of a girl who turns out to be \"Nicole\". The sketch was written by Martin Curtis. (Brown)\n* A mid-1990s British Rail advertisement for Intercity trains used lookalikes of Nicole and Papa in a humorous pastiche. \"Papa's\" train-traveling companion wonders who the young lady is and remarks, \"I thought you weren't married.\"\n* In pre-publicity for Series 8 of the BBC One science fiction series Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, newly cast as the latest incarnation of The Doctor, and at 56 the oldest incumbent to the role, indicated that there were no plans for his version of the Doctor to flirt with the Doctor's 27-year-old companion Clara Oswald, unlike what had occurred during the tenure of the previous Doctor actor, Matt Smith. In explaining the rationale in numerous interviews and press conferences, Capaldi said he wished to avoid any \"Papa and Nicole moments\". \n\nSources\n\n* [http://easier.com/view/News/Motoring/Renault/article-61418.html Clio TV stars mark the public launch of new Clio Renaultsport 197], easier.com, July 2006\n* [http://jyanet.com/cap/001.htm CAP Online, Nicole?

Balthazar is traditionally referred to as the King of Arabia and gave the gift of myrrh to Jesus.  In the Western Christian church, he is regarded as a saint (as are the other two Magi).\n\nTradition \n\nThe Gospels of the New Testament in The Bible do not give the names of the Magi (or even how many there were), but their traditional names are ascribed to a Greek manuscript from 500 AD translated into Latin and commonly accepted as the source of the names.  In this original manuscript, Balthazar is called Bithisarea which later developed into Balthazar in Western Christianity. Balthazar was described in the 8th century by Saint Bede as being \"[of] black complexion, with [a] heavy beard\" with the \"myrrh he held in his hands prefigured the death of the Son of man\". \n\nAs part of the Magi, Balthazar followed the Star of Bethlehem first to the palace of Herod the Great who instructed them to return to him when they had found the Child Jesus. When they arrive at the house,  the Magi worshipped him and presented their gifts. Balthazar gave the gift of myrrh, which symbolised the future death of a king, as myrrh was an expensive item at the time.   Following his return to his own country, avoiding King Herod, it is purported that Balthazar celebrated Christmas with the other members of the Magi in Armenia in 54 AD but later died on 6 January 55 AD aged 112. \n\nBalthasar is a character in the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ and the various film adaptions of the novel, which chronicles his later years.\n\nCommemoration \n\nBalthazar, along with the other Magi, is purported to be buried in the Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne Cathedral following his remains being moved from Constantinople by Eustorgius I in 314 AD to Milan. In 1164, Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa moved them to Cologne.  Balthazar is commemorated on Epiphany with the other members of the Magi but in Catholicism, Balthazar's feast day is on the 11th of January. \n\nBlackface controversy\n\nIn Continental European countries where the Magi are portrayed, because of Saint Bede's description of him, Balthazar is often portrayed by a person in blackface in a tradition that dated back to the Middle Ages where dark skinned people were described as bringers of gold. In the 21st century, there have been a number of campaigns in Spain for an actual black person to play Balthazar rather than a person in blackface.\nQuestion:\nWho were Balthazar, Melchior and Caspar?\nAnswer:\nGold frankincense and myrrh\nPassage:\nFinal day for the Elgar £20 note - BBC News\nFinal day for the Elgar £20 note - BBC News\nBBC News\nFinal day for the Elgar £20 note\n30 June 2010\nClose share panel\nImage caption The Elgar £20 note which is being withdrawn from circulation\nThe £20 English banknote featuring the image of composer Edward Elgar will be accepted in shops for the last time on Wednesday.\nBanks, building societies and post offices will only exchange the note for a newer replacement at each institution's discretion after then.\nFrom 1 July, customers may find they can only swap it by sending it back to the Bank of England.\nThe alternative £20 note carries a picture of economist Adam Smith.\nThe Elgar £20 banknote, first issued in June 1999, has gradually been replaced by the Adam Smith note since March 2007.\nVariations\nThe look of banknotes is sometimes changed by the Bank of England, partly to beat counterfeiters.\nThe removal of writing and music in the shape of Shakespeare and Elgar on Bank of England notes makes our currency much less colourful\nJeremy Dibble, Durham University\nThe demise of the Elgar £20 note\nIn 1993, William Shakespeare's image disappeared from the face of the £20 note.\nElgar's image appears on the banknote along with a picture of Worcester Cathedral, the scene of the first performance of one of his best-known works - the Enigma Variations.\nHis disappearance was branded as a \"disgrace\" by Jeremy Dibble, professor in the Department of Music at Durham University.\n\"Land Of Hope And Glory is one of the most stirring tunes ever composed and its composer, Edward Elgar, is an iconic figure and a fitting symbol of artistic inspiration in England,\" he said.\n\"Dropping Elgar tells us much about the way in which the arts is now viewed in England.\n\"The removal of writing and music in the shape of Shakespeare and Elgar on Bank of England notes makes our currency much less colourful.

A phobia that has a significant amount of overlap with gymnophobia is dishabiliophobia, which is the fear of undressing in front of others. \n\nSymptoms\n\nGymnophobics experience anxiety from nudity, even if they realize their fear is irrational. They may worry about seeing others naked, being seen naked, or both. Their fear may stem from a general anxiety about sexuality, from a fear that they are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves them exposed and unprotected.  \n\nGymnophobia should not be confused with avoidance or shunning of many forms of nudity on modesty or other rational or moral grounds. Many people avoid public nudity as well as nudity in private situations, and some have an aversion to nudity as an aspect of prudishness or body shame.  \n\nGymnophobia refers to an actual fear of nudity, but most sufferers with the condition learn how to function in general society despite the condition. They may, for example, avoid  changing rooms, washrooms, showers, and beaches. However, the condition can be regarded as an anxiety disorder if the person cannot control the phobia or it is interfering with their daily life.  Gymnophobia is common among children, especially those undergoing puberty. Child gymnophobia is common due to peer pressure, bullying, and a fear of exposing sexual organs.\n\nGymnophobia has been likened to the fictional condition \"never-nude\" portrayed in the comedy series Arrested Development.\nQuestion:\nFrom what would you fear if you suffered from Gymnophobia?\nAnswer:\nStarkers\nPassage:\n1980s Workout Videos|Richard Simmons Workout Videos ...\n1980s Workout Videos|Richard Simmons Workout Videos|Richard Simmons  Exercise videos - YouTube\n1980s Workout Videos|Richard Simmons Workout Videos|Richard Simmons  Exercise videos\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

As a singles player, he peaked at World No. 8, winning three titles (including the 1979 Cincinnati Open).\n\nTennis career\n\nFleming attended Chatham High School, where he won the New Jersey high school individual championship in 1972, during his junior year. \n\nDuring the 1980s, Fleming teamed up with fellow American John McEnroe to dominate the men's doubles game. The duo won 50 doubles titles together, including four at Wimbledon (1979, 1981, 1983 and 1984), and three at the US Open (1979, 1981 and 1983). Fleming once said that \"The best doubles pair in the world is John McEnroe and anyone\". \n\nFleming also played on three American Davis Cup winning teams (1979, 1981 and 1982), and helped the US win the World Team Cup twice (1984 and 1985).  Fleming reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in 1984. His career-high singles ranking was World No. 8 in 1980, the year in which he reached the quarter-finals at the Wimbledon championships. Over the course of his career Fleming won three top-level singles titles and sixty doubles titles.

Originally released in 1989 from their album Cosmic Thing, the single was the band's biggest hit song and first million-copy seller.  It was also the band's first song to reach the Billboard Top 40 charts, peaking at number 3,  also reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and was number 1 for eight weeks in Australia, number 1 for 4 weeks in New Zealand, number 1 in the Republic of Ireland and also number 1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nProduced by Don Was,  the song's inspiration was a cabin around Athens, Georgia, complete with tin roof, where the band conceived \"Rock Lobster\", a single from their first album; it is often said to have been located off \"the Atlanta Highway\", as the first verse implies. B-52's singer Kate Pierson lived in the cabin in the 1970s, and the cabin existed until 2004, when it burned down. \"Tin roof...rusted,\" wailed by lead singer Cindy Wilson, was originally an outtake added to the track, and is perhaps the song's most memorable line. Fred Schneider also provides some memorable lines, including his notable boast of having a Chrysler that is \"as big as a whale\" and \"seats about twenty\". It has come to mean many things to different listeners. \n\nThe drag queen RuPaul can be seen dancing in the music video that was directed by Adam Bernstein and shot at the home and studio of ceramic artists Philip Maberry and Scott Walker.[http://www.jefblocker.com/?p\n2129 The Story Behind \"Love Shack\" by the B-52's], jefblocker.com, 2 March 2012 The song was a comeback of sorts following the band's decline in popularity in the early 1980s coupled with the death of their guitarist, Ricky Wilson, in 1985. \n\nThe song received a number of accolades following its release. Named as one of the 365 Songs of the Century in 2001,  the video for the song received an award from MTV as the Best Group Video, and was named the Best Single of 1989 by Rolling Stone. Additionally, it was ranked #246 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. \n\nTrack listing\n\nThe single release contained various tracks depending on the country it was released in. The United States had a B-side of \"Roam\", a song that would later reach number 3 as well, and other countries had singles with either \"Channel Z\" or a live version of \"Rock Lobster\" as the B-side.  In 1998 and 1999, the single was released again with a number of remixes, including one by DJ Tonka, but the re-release did not chart in the United States, although it did enter the United Kingdom charts. \n\nUK single\n\n# \"Love Shack\" (Single Version) — 4:20\n# \"Love Shack\" (LP Version) — 5:21\n\nUS 12\" single / CD maxi-single\n\n# \"Love Shack\" (12\" Remix) — 8:00\n# \"Love Shack\" (Remix/Edit) — 4:07\n# \"Channel Z\" (12\" Rock Mix) — 6:24\n# \"Love Shack\" (12\" Mix) — 6:10\n# \"Love Shack\" (A Capella) — 3:56\n# \"Love Shack\" (Big Radio Mix) — 5:31\n\nCharts\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* Love Shack was played in the third season finale of Full House, where Stephanie danced to the song at the \"We Love Our Children\" telethon. \n* Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Chipettes covered the song for their 1996 album Club Chipmunk: The Dance Mixes.\n* In a 2015 episode of The Muppets, \"Pig Out\", the song is performed by Gonzo, Rizzo, and Pepe.\n*The Simpsons parodied the song in the episode E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) with a song titled \"Glove Slap\" over a montage of Homer challenging Springfield residents to a duel with gloves, as well as the end credits.

The book profiles his early life, coming of age, education and 27 years in prison. Under the apartheid government, Mandela was regarded as a terrorist and jailed on the infamous Robben Island for his role as a leader of the then-outlawed ANC. He has since achieved international recognition for his leadership as president in rebuilding the country's once segregated society.  The last chapters of the book describe his political ascension, and his belief that the struggle continues against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nMandela dedicated his book to \"my six children, Madiba and Makaziwe (my first daughter) who are now deceased, and to Makgatho, Makaziwe, Zenani and Zindzi, whose support and love I treasure; to my twenty-one grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who give me great pleasure; and to all my comrades, friends and fellow South Africans whom I serve and whose courage, determination and patriotism remain my source of inspiration.\"\n\nOverview\n\nIn the first part of the autobiography, Mandela describes his upbringing as a child and adolescent in South Africa, and being connected to the royal Thembu dynasty. His childhood name was Rolihlahla, which is loosely translated as \"pulling the branch of a tree\", or a euphemism for \"troublemaker\".\n\nMandela describes his education at a Thembu college called Clarkebury, and later at the strict Healdtown school, where students were rigorously put in routines. He mentions his education at the University of Fort Hare, and his practice of law later on. He also then writes; \"Democracy meant all men to be heard, and decision was taken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be clashed by a majority.\" (p. 29)\n\nIn the second part of the book, Mandela introduces political and social aspects of apartheid in South Africa, and the influences of politicians such as Daniel François Malan who implemented the nadir of African freedoms, as he officially commenced the apartheid policies. Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1950 and describes his organisation of guerrilla tactics and underground organisations to battle against apartheid.\n\nIn 1961, Mandela was convicted for inciting people to strike and leaving the country without a passport and sentenced to five years imprisonment. However, Mandela was shortly thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage in what was known as the \"Rivonia Trial\", by Justice Dr. Quartus de Wet, instead of a possible death sentence. (p. 159)\n\nMandela describes prison time on Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. His 28-year tenure in prison was marked by the cruelty of Afrikaner guards, backbreaking labour, and sleeping in minuscule cells which were nearly uninhabitable. Unlike his biographer Anthony Sampson, Mandela does not accuse the warder James Gregory of fabricating a friendship with his prisoner. Gregory's book Goodbye Bafana discussed Mandela's family life and described Gregory as a close personal friend of Mandela. According to Mandela: The Authorised Biography, Gregory's position was to censor the letters delivered to the future president, and he thereby discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he then made money from by means of his book Goodbye Bafana. Mandela considered suing Gregory for this breach of trust.  In Long Walk to Freedom Mandela remarks of Gregory only that \n'I had not known him terribly well, but he knew us, because he had been responsible for reviewing our incoming and outgoing mail.' \n\nLater on in his sentence, Mandela met South African president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, and was released from prison in 1990. Unlike his friend Anthony Sampson's account, Mandela's book does not discuss the alleged complicity of de Klerk in the violence of the eighties and nineties, or the role of his ex-wife Winnie Mandela in that bloodshed. Mandela became the South African president in 1994.\n\nReviews\n\nThe book won the Alan Paton Award in 1995, and has been published in numerous languages, including an Afrikaans translation by Antjie Krog.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nLong Walk to Freedom has been adapted into a film titled Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom directed by Justin Chadwick, written by William Nicholson, and produced by Anant Singh. Mandela personally awarded the film rights to the book to Singh's company some years before 2009. Singh believes that as the film is based on Mandela's own writing, it will be the \"definitive\" biopic of him.  English actor Idris Elba portrays Mandela in the film.  The film was limited released on 29 November 2013 in the United States. Full release happened on Christmas Day 2013 in the United States. \nWhen the film was shown in London for Prince William and his wife, Nelson Mandela's death was announced.\n\nGhost writer\n\nIn an obituary of Mandela, The Times reported that the later chapters had been \"ghosted by a skilful US journalist\", and that Mandela had later started work on a second set of memoirs without a ghost writer.\nQuestion:\nA Long Walk To Freedom, published in 1995 was the autobiography of which famous Political figure ?\nAnswer:\nRolihlahla\nPassage:\nAmalthea (mythology)\nIn Greek mythology, Amalthea or Amaltheia () is the most-frequently mentioned foster-mother of Zeus.\n\nOverview\n\nThe name Amalthea, in Greek \"tender goddess\", is clearly an epithet, signifying the presence of an earlier nurturing goddess,  whom the Hellenes, whose myths we know, knew to be located in Crete, where Minoans may have called her a version of \"Dikte\".  Amalthea is sometimes represented as the goat who suckled the infant-god in a cave in Cretan Mount Aigaion (\"Goat Mountain\"),  sometimes as a goat-tending nymph  of uncertain parentage (the daughter of Oceanus, Haemonius, Olenos,  or—according to Lactantius—Melisseus ), who brought him up on the milk of her goat.  The possession of multiple and uncertain mythological parents indicates wide worship of a deity in many cultures having varying local traditions. Other names, like Adrasteia, Ide, the nymph of Mount Ida, or Adamanthea, which appear in mythology handbooks,  are simply duplicates of Amalthea.\n\nIn the tradition represented by Hesiod's Theogony,  Cronus swallowed all of his children immediately after birth. The mother goddess Rhea, Zeus' mother, deceived her brother consort Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped to look like a baby instead of Zeus. Since she instead gave the infant Zeus to Adamanthea to nurse in a cave on a mountain in Crete, it is clear that Adamanthea is a doublet of Amalthea. In many literary references, the Greek tradition relates that in order that Cronus should not hear the wailing of the infant, Amalthea gathered about the cave the Kuretes or the Korybantes to dance, shout, and clash their spears against their shields. \n\nAmalthea and the aegis\n\nAmalthea's skin, or that of her goat, taken by Zeus in honor of her when she died, became the protective Aegis in some traditions.\n\nAmalthea placed among the stars\n\n\"Amaltheia was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Capra—the group of stars surrounding Capella on the arm (ôlenê) of Auriga the Charioteer.\"  Capra simply means \"she-goat\" and the star-name Capella is the \"little goat\", but some modern readers confuse her with the male sea-goat of the Zodiac, Capricorn, who bears no relation to Amalthea, no connection in a Greek or Latin literary source nor any ritual or inscription to join the two. Hyginus describes this catasterism in the Poetic Astronomy, in speaking of Auriga, the Charioteer:\n\nParmeniscus says that a certain Melisseus was king in Crete, and to his daughters Jove was brought to nurse. Since they did not have milk, they furnished him a she-goat, Amalthea by name, who is said to have reared him. She often bore twin kids, and at the very time that Jove was brought to her to nurse, had borne a pair. And so because of the kindness of the mother, the kids, too were placed among the constellations. Cleostratus of Tenedos is said to have first pointed out these kids among the stars.\n\nBut Musaeus says Jove was nursed by Themis and the nymph Amalthea, to whom he was given by Ops, his mother. Now Amalthea had as a pet a certain goat which is said to have nursed Jove.\nQuestion:\nWhat type of creature was Amaltheia, who suckled the infant Zeus in a cave on Crete?\nAnswer:\nThe Goat (film)\nPassage:\nMuscovado\nMuscovado, called Khaand in Hindi language, is a type of partially refined to unrefined brown sugar with a strong molasses content and flavour. It is technically considered either a non-centrifugal cane sugar or a centrifuged, partially refined sugar according to the process used by the manufacturer.  \n\nConfusion has been created over the meaning of the term muscovado sugar, and as there is no legal definition or Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), different manufacturers are free to use the term loosely to describe any dark, molasses-rich sugar they produce. The term was originally coined in 17th- to 18th-century English to designate a poorly refined sugar that had retained too high a content of molasses and was deemed low quality.   \n\nIn a modern context muscovado is used to define sugar made from the juice of sugar cane by evaporation until crystallization occurs. This solution of crystals and mother liquor (molasses) is called massecuite. The massecuite is set into moulds directly, granulated in cooling pans by shear action (either the traditional manual method or through use of a spray drier) or sent to a centrifuge to separate a crystal-rich mush that is drained of its molasses in a vessel under gravity.    \n\nCurrently there are two localities still producing a commercial sugar termed muscovado, Mauritius and the Philippines. Muscovado from Mauritius is produced by centrifuged massecuite left to drain naturally of its molasses, whilst Filipino muscovado may be generated from any of the three methods. \n\nThere is some effort being made to clean up the terminology of sugars produced over the world as there are various synonyms used to describe unrefined through poorly refined to partially refined sugars with high molasses content and a dark colour made from sugar cane, such as panela (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Argentina), rapadura (Brazil), chancaca (Chile, Peru, Bolivia), piloncillo (Mexico), muscovado (Philippines, Mauritius), panocha (Philippines), raspadura (Panama), kokuto (Japan), jaggery (India, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria) and papelon (Venezuela) \n\nHistory\n\nAlso known as \"Barbados sugar\", \"molasses sugar\" or \"moist sugar\", muscovado sugar is an English corruption of the Spanish azúcar mascabado or the Portuguese açúcar mascavado,  meaning sugar of the lowest quality or lowest value.  The name and meaning is tied to the state of sugar production and markets of the late 18th to earliest 19th century, when sugar that had been less refined was considered an inferior product by the industry; thus muscovado meant literally a low quality sugar that was poorly drained of its molasses.\n\nThroughout the British Empire sugars that had been refined enough to lose most of their molasses content were termed raw and deemed higher quality, while most poor quality sugars with a high molasses content were usually referred to as muscovado, though the term \"brown sugar\" was occasionally used interchangeably.  Sugar in the 19th century was produced through a variety of methods ranging from traditional, outdated practices, through to more modern, industrialized methods which incorporated the latest technology, such as vacuum pans and centrifuges.   Sugar imported into Britain from its colonies (the West Indies, Mauritius and India) or from foreign markets (Cuba, Java, Brazil, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Réunion, Louisiana or the French West Indies) was brought to port in a variety of purities that could be sold either as raw sugar direct to market or as muscovado bound for a British refinery such as those in Glasgow or London. Sugar refinement had reached a zenith in Britain (and also, incidentally, in Louisiana), so expensive industrial equipment did not need to be installed in the colonies. In the early 19th century muscovado sugar was being produced in Mauritius from centrifuges and sent to conical moulds, in which molasses dripped from the sugar crystals under gravity. At the same time muscovado was being produced in the West Indies by primitive shearing action (feet stamping into barrels) on clarified, evaporated cane juice. Both of these are examples of the divergent production methods used to make muscovado sugar.\n\nUses\n\nMuscovado is very dark brown and slightly coarser and stickier than most brown sugars. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugarcane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making rum. Muscovado sugar can be used in most recipes where brown sugar is called for, by slightly reducing the liquid content of the recipe. \n\nMuscovado sugar  has 11 calories/ 4 grams (approx. 1 tsp). When produced under regulated conditions, it is nutritionally richer than other brown sugars or refined sugar, and retains most of the natural minerals inherent in sugarcane juice, as shown in this chart: \n\nMineral content of muscovado sugar (per 100 g):\n* Total mineral salts 740 mg max.\n* Phosphorus (P) 3.9 mg max.\n* Calcium (Ca) 85 mg max.\n* Magnesium (Mg) 23 mg max.\n* Potassium (K) 100 mg max.\n* Iron (Fe) 1.3 mg max.\n\nThis unrefined sugar can be used in coffee and other beverages, and was one of the most prominent export commodities of the Philippines, especially from the Negros region from the 19th century until the late 1970s.  The production of muscovado sugar in the Philippines, Barbados, and elsewhere had experienced a long period of decline when large mills took over sugar production from small farmers with small mills until consumer interest in healthy and organic foods revived interest in muscovado sugar, creating a new market for muscovado sugar production from small mills.\nQuestion:\nDark and light muscovado are types of what\nAnswer:\nSugar lumps\nPassage:\nLimburger\nLimburger is a cheese that originated during the 19th century in the historical Duchy of Limburg, which is now divided among modern-day Belgium, Germany, and Netherlands. The cheese is especially known for its pungent odor caused by the bacteria Brevibacterium linens, which smells like strong body odor and particularly smelly feet. \n\nManufacture\n\nWhile today most Limburger is produced in Germany, Herve cheese is a type of Limburger which is still produced in the territory of the old Duchy of Limburg. Herve is located near Liège, and the borders separating Belgium from the Netherlands and Germany. The \"Pays de Herve\" is a hilly area between the Vesdre and Meuse rivers.\n\nIn the US, it was first produced in 1867 by Rudolph Benkerts in his cellar from pasteurized goat's milk.  A few years later, 25 factories produced this cheese. The Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin is the only American company that makes this cheese. It is also manufactured in Canada, where it is a German-Canadian cultural marker, by the Oak Grove Cheese Company in New Hamburg, Ontario.\n\nDescription\n\nIn its first month, the cheese is firmer and more crumbly, similar to the texture of feta cheese. After about six weeks, the cheese becomes softer along the edges but is still firm on the inside and can be described as salty and chalky. After two months of its life, it is mostly creamy and much smoother. Once it reaches three months, the cheese produces its notorious smell because of the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and many other smear-ripened cheeses.   This is Brevibacterium linens, the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor and particularly foot odor.\n\nUses\n\nOne of the most traditional forms of eating limburger is the limburger sandwich. After three months, when the cheese has ripened, it becomes spreadable. The cheese is often spread thick (> 0.5 cm) on firm-textured 100% rye bread, with a large, thick slice of onion, and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer. Alternatively, for heartier eaters, chunks or slices of the cheese up to 1.5 cm thick can be cut off the block and placed in the sandwich. This sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America, such as in Cincinnati, or German Village in Columbus, Ohio. However, it is markedly less popular among the descendants born after ca. 1960, mainly because of the permeating smell, and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it. In Wisconsin, the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants, accompanied by brown mustard. \n\nLimburger and its characteristic odor are a frequent butt of jokes and gags. Reactions to, and misinterpretations of, the smell of limburger cheese were gags used in numerous Little Rascals and Three Stooges comedy shorts.  Also, the arch-enemy of the Biker Mice from Mars has the name Lawrence Limburger, complete with terrible body odor.\n\nIn 2006, a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology.   The results of the study were published in the medical journal The Lancet on 9 November 1996.\n\nNutrition facts\n\n28 grams of Limburger contains 5 grams of saturated fat and 8 grams of total fat. 67 of the 92 calories in the 28 grams are from fat.\nQuestion:\nWhat type of foodstuff are 'Shropshire Blue' and 'Limburger'?\nAnswer:\nCheeses...(of Nazareth)\nPassage:\nBarnt Green\nBarnt Green is a village  and civil parish in the Bromsgrove District of Worcestershire, England, situated 10 mi south of Birmingham, with a population at the 2011 census of 1,794. \n\nOrigins\n\nOriginating from the development of the railway, Barnt Green has always been a commuter settlement.  When the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was completed in 1840 the only buildings already in existence on an 1880 map  were Barnt Green House, probably the oldest recorded bearer of the name Barnt Green, the buildings which made up the railway station, and Sandhills Farm which dates from the 15th century.\nThe early  establishment  of Barnt Green as a village began with the construction of The Victoria  a public house that was originally built as a temperance house at the start of the 20th century. A later map from 1905  already shows several buildings, including the Victoria and many of the terraced houses which skirt today's shops.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe majority of the village is a product of the 20th century. Much of its development occurred between the World Wars, with very many houses built between the 1940s and 1970s, and some newer redbrick development.\n\nDespite the proximity of the Birmingham conurbation, the built up area of the city is concealed by hills to the north and the landscape retains a rural aspect. The area provides an environment for wildlife, including birds, foxes and badgers.\n\nSituation\n\nImmediately above (in height) to the northwest are the Lickey Hills Country Park and the Victorian houses of Lickey. Almost immediately to the north is the site of the former Longbridge car factory and beyond that Birmingham.\n\nNortheast are Cofton Hackett and the Bittell Reservoirs, with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal running alongside. To the east, farmland stretches from the edge of the factory right across to Hopwood. This large block of rural land forms a part of the green belt which encircles the settlement.\n\nSoutheast is the older village of Alvechurch and beyond that Redditch. South of the village, across the M42 motorway, is the large stretch of farmland of Cobley and Tardebigge which runs to the ancient seat of the Earl of Plymouth, Hewell Grange (now a prison).\n\nTo the southwest, the Lickey Incline, a stretch of railway, runs down the Bunter geological formation to Blackwell and Bromsgrove. The M5 motorway lies to the West.\n\nServices\n\nBarnt Green railway station is on the Cross-City Line (Redditch to Lichfield) and the Birmingham to Worcester via Bromsgrove Line. The area is close to junctions on the M5 and M42 motorways, as well as the nearby A38.\n\nIn the centre of the village is a linear shopping street and small park. Other facilities include a sports club, a cricket club, and separate Quaker, Baptist and Church of England churches. St Andrew's C of E First School is also based in the village.\n\nNotable people \n\n* Ian Lavender, actor, was wicket keeper for Barnt Green Cricket Club \n* Margaret Leighton, award winning actress, born in Barnt Green in 1922\n*Patrick Beesly, author and naval intelligence officer, was born in Barnt Green in 1913\n*Susan Jameson, actress, was born in Barnt Green in 1941\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the notoriously steep railway gradient south of Birmingham between Barnt Green and Bromsgrove?\nAnswer:\nLickey Bank\nPassage:\nFulliautomatix - The Asterix Project - Wikia\nFulliautomatix | The Asterix Project | Fandom powered by Wikia\nAsterix the Gaul\nFulliautomatix (French: Cetautomatix) is the village smith. His father, Semiautomatix, was the village smith before him. He is tall and robust, and very strong – he is one of the strongest characters, perhaps second only to Obelix, and a bit of a bully.\nFulliautomatix's first appearance was in the first volume, Asterix the Gaul where the Roman spy Caligula Minus was amazed that he used his fists to forge iron. However, he is subsequently shown using a normal hammer and is now rarely seen without one. Fulliautomatix often interacts with Unhygienix , the fishmonger, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. Fulliautomatix constantly claims the fish Unhygienix sells are stale, and this often results in Unhygienix throwing a fish at his face, causing a violent quarrel which almost always results in the entire village being engaged in a fish fight. Fulliautomatix also takes great pleasure in bullying and breaking the lyre of Cacofonix the bard, threatening him and hitting him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song (the songs are so bad that the other villagers do not object). It has been stated that he is perhaps the ancestor of all music critics. On the other hand, he is occasionally beaten up by Geriatrix when he is provoked by some comment the smith makes. When this happens he will often take out his frustration on the nearest convenient bystander (Cacofonix for preference) on the grounds that he does not feel he can fight back against someone so old, which only helps to further incense the old man.\nIt is possible to assume that Fulliautomatix is Geriatrix's grandson. On p. 15 of the English version of Asterix at the Olympic Games , Fulliautomatix calls Geriatrix \"Grandpa\", although this could also simply be a nickname or the like. Fulliautomatix also has two unnamed children who have appeared in separate comics – a son with blonde hair in Asterix in Corsica, and a daughter with blonde hair in Asterix and the Secret Weapon. In Asterix and the Great Divide he is shown as having an apprentice, though it is not indicated whether or not they are related; some speculate that he is the young son grown to teenage years. Also, in\nAsterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book , in the \"example\" of the village 50 years older than usual, Fulliautomatix is seen sitting next to his son who is smithing his own invention, false teeth. Fulliautomatix's appearance changes in the course of time. In Asterix the Gaul we see him with his usual blonde hair, but still with no hammer. His next appearance is in Asterix and the Banquet or four books since Asterix the Gaul, here he is shown arguing with Obelix about a roman, but yet this is not the real Fulliautomatix (I mean look at him he has a shirt, Fulliautomatix is never shown having a shirt). In Asterix and Cleopatra we see a more \"proper\" version of him (he is shown briefly at the beginning when Cacofonix the bard tells him that he stepped on his foot) now this is more like the future Fulliautomatix. The next time we see the big bully is in Asterix and the Big Fight surprisingly he is not punching Cacofonix for his attempt to \"sing a little song\", but admiring\nchief Vitalstatistix for wining however we finally see his hammer (he is the one right next to Cacofonix)! Then in the next book (Asterix in Britan) we again only see his back at the beginning of the book breaking Cacofonix's lyre. The \"real\" Fulliautomatix finally emerges in Asterix and the Normans the ninth book in the series! There he is shown having blond hair a blacksmith apron and his hammer. During the course of time Fulliautomatix changes a lot, however after the release of book nine (Asterix and the Normans) he changes very little maybe the only real change to him is his hair from blonde it swaps to orange-red, but this is only in later books!\nQuestion:\n\"In the English version of the \"\"Asterix\"\" books, the character of Unhygienix has what occupation?\"\nAnswer:\nFishmonger\n", "answers": ["Dame Anita Lucia Roddick", "Anita Roddick", "Anita Lucia Roddick", "Anita Rodick", "Gordon Roddick", "Anita Roddick Foundation"], "length": 5408, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "889d404515b7875dfb894f1f3bd59406374a3a275ea9b584"}
{"input": "Passage:\nArdwick - Familypedia - Wikia\nArdwick | Familypedia | Fandom powered by Wikia\nArdwick is a district of Manchester in North West England , one mile east of the city centre .\nHistorically in Lancashire , by the mid-19th century Ardwick had grown from being a village into a pleasant and wealthy suburb of Manchester, but by the end of that century it had become heavily industrialised. [1] [2] When its industries later fell into decline then so did Ardwick itself, becoming one of the city's most deprived areas. Substantial development has taken place more recently in Ardwick and other areas of Manchester to reverse the decline, notably the construction of many facilities for the 2002 Commonwealth Games held nearby in Eastlands .\nIn the late 19th century Ardwick had many places of entertainment, but the only remnant of that history today is the Art Deco Manchester Apollo , a venue for pop and rock music concerts. [2]\nContents\nEdit\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution , Ardwick was a small village situated just outside Manchester in open countryside. The principal residents were the Birch family, one of whom was a Major General when Oliver Cromwell (briefly) instituted direct military rule.\nOne Samuel Birch was instrumental in providing a small chapel of ease , dedicated to St. Thomas, and consecrated in 1741. This soon expanded into a rather fine Georgian church, to which a fine brick campanile tower was added in the 1830s. It contained a very rare Samuel Green organ, the first in which the sharp keys were distinguished in black. There was also a memorial chapel to the dead of the First World War , chiefly men of the local territorial unit. Sadly, these have been removed, and the church is now used as offices for voluntary organisations.\nGrand terraces of regency houses (some of which still survive) were built either side of the church, and these were fronted by Ardwick Green , a private park for the residents, containing a pond. Similar housing developments to those around the Green took place along Higher Ardwick and the area known as the Polygon.\nEarly inhabitants included members the family of Sir Robert Peel . Charles Dickens drew many of his characters from life, and was a frequent visitor to Manchester. It is said that Dickens based the character of the crippled Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol on the invalid son of a friend who owned a cotton mill in Ardwick. [3]\nArdwick Cemetery was established in the 1830s as a prestigious place for fashionable burials. John Dalton , the chemist and physicist best known for his advocacy of atomic theory, is amongst those buried there. The cemetery has since been converted into a school playing field.\nIndustrial Revolution\nEdit\nDuring the 19th century, Ardwick became heavily industrialised and it was characterised by factories, railways and rows of back-to-back terraced houses being juxtaposed. Large numbers of Irish immigrants settled here, as they did throughout Manchester. Ardwick railway station is situated at a junction where the Manchester and Birmingham Railway , later the London and North Western Railway diverged from the line to Sheffield that became the Great Central Railway . Nicholls Hospital , a neo-gothic building that was later a school, was constructed on Hyde Road in the last quarter of the 19th century. More recently it has become the Nicholls Campus of the Manchester College . [4]\nThe railway bridge across Hyde Road was known by older residents as the \"Fenian Arch\".  On 18 September 1867 it was the scene of an attack upon a prison van carrying two Fenian prisoners to the former Belle Vue gaol (jail). One police officer was shot dead. Three Irishmen involved in the affray were caught, tried and executed. The men are referred to by their supporters as the so-called \" Manchester Martyrs \". [5]\nGeography and administration\nEdit\nThe village of Ardwick can be traced back to 1282, when it was known as Atherdwic and the road between Manchester and Stockport runs through it. From mediaeval times Ardwick was an independent township in the ancient parish of Manchester within the Salford hundred of Lancashire . It became part of the Borough of Manchester on the borough's creation in 1838. The historic boundary between Ardwick and Manchester was the River Medlock .\nPolitical divisions\nArdwick ward is represented by three councillors , Tom O'Callaghan, Bernard Priest and Mavis Smitheman, all members of the Labour Party . O'Callaghan (2004-05) and Smitheman (2008-09) have served as Lord Mayor of Manchester.\nPresent day\nEdit\nArdwick Green Park has recently been refurbished, and though the pond is no more, it still contains an interesting glacial erratic in the form of a boulder. There is also a cenotaph commemorating the 'Eighth Ardwicks', once a Territorial Army unit of the Manchester Regiment , whose former drill hall is still nearby. It was the old Volunteer Barracks, a fine Victorian castellated structure bearing the old volunteer motto \"Defence Not Defiance\". It is still in military use today.\nThe Manchester Apollo , a 1930s Art Deco theatre, is one of Ardwick's most famous landmarks: it was in use as a cinema (the ABC Ardwick) for many years and now plays host to national and international performing artists.\nExtensive demolition of dilapidated Victorian terraces took place around Ardwick during the 1960s. Some residents remained in the area in new council-owned houses and flats, while others were moved to overspill estates such as Hattersley .\nDemographics\n(According to 2011 census [6] )\nWhite British – 35.5%\nQuestion:\nDidsbury, Ardwick and Fallowfield are all areas of which British city?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nVelcro\nVelcro Companies is a privately held company that produces a series of mechanical based fastening products, including fabric hook and loop fasteners, under the brand name \"Velcro\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe first touch fasteners were developed by  Swiss electrical engineer George de Mestral who in 1941 went for a walk in the woods and wondered if the burrs that clung to his trousers — and dog — could be turned into something useful. \n\nThe original patented hook and loop fastener was invented in 1948 by de Mestral, who patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.\n\nDe Mestral developed a fastener that consisted of two components: a lineal fabric strip with tiny hooks that could \"mate\" with another fabric strip with smaller loops, attaching temporarily, until pulled apart.  Initially made of cotton, which proved impractical,  the fastener was eventually constructed with nylon and polyester. \n\nDe Mestral gave the name Velcro, a portmanteau of the French words velours (\"velvet\"), and crochet (\"hook\"),   to his invention as well as his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.\n\nHumphrey Cripps began investing in Velcro in the 1960s. In 2009, the company was taken private by a private equity firm linked to the Cripps family.  \n\nPatents and trademarks\n\nIn 1958, de Mestral filed for a patent application for his hook-and-loop fastener in Switzerland, which was granted in 1961. De Mestral’s original patent expired in 1978, and competitors began to enter the market. The company frequently uses the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system for international filings, and as of late 2010 has filed 134 PCT applications.\n\nVelcro Companies has relied on its Velcro trademark to build a brand name since the original patent expired. The term Velcro is a registered trademark of Velcro Industries B.V. Velcro Companies also owns trademark registrations for many of its other brands.\n\nTo reduce the risk of the Velcro name becoming a generic term and thereby losing the distinctiveness necessary to maintain its trademark protection, the company claims that there is no such thing as “Velcro,” and that the term is a company name, a brand and a trademark, not a generic term for a type of product. This is despite the fact that de Mestral himself gave the name Velcro to his invention rather than the company. Additionally the former director of industrial Sales for Velcro USA said \"Velcro is a series of hooks and loops, a male and female, one grabs the other and sticks.\"  Many dictionaries define Velcro as being a type of fastener, but generally note that the term is a protected trademark or proprietary name.  Through advertisements, product literature and marketing campaigns the company informs consumers that not all hook and loop fasteners are Velcro brand products.\n\nProducts\n\nVelcro make fastening products for a wide array of industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, personal care, military, packaging, construction, apparel, and agriculture.\n\nProducts of Velcro Companies include:\n* General Purpose adhesive backed fasteners\n* Ties and Straps\n* Heavy Duty Fasteners \n* Fabric Tapes and Fasteners \n* Traditional Hook-and-Loop fasteners\n* Woven, knit and molded products \n* Kid’s Construction Sets\n\nCauses\n\nThe Neeson Cripps Academy, a high performance school for the Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF) in Phnom Penh was funded by Velcro Companies. New York City-based COOKFOX Architects designed the eco-efficient building, which is scheduled for completion in 2017.  \n\nIn 2015, Velcro Companies and Velcro Brand Ambassador and design expert Sabrina Soto launched an annual Classroom Makeover contest that takes place during Teacher Appreciation Week. The first winner from Joplin, Missouri received two redesigned classrooms.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* 1968 - Velcro brand fasteners are used on the suits, sample collection bags, and lunar vehicles brought to the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.\n* 1984 - David Letterman wears a suit made of Velcro brand fasteners and jumps from a trampoline into a wall covered in the product during an interview with the company’s USA director of industrial sales.\n* 2012 - Shoes with Velcro fasteners feature in the song \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. quote: \"I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those.

This approach is commonly used for theorems in mathematics, but can be used for anything. LaTeX provides a command that will let you easily define any theorem-like enunciation.\nContents\nFirst of all, make sure you have the amsthm package enabled:\n\\usepackage{amsthm}\nThe easiest is the following:\n\\newtheorem{name}{Printed output}\nput it in the preamble. The first argument is the name you will use to reference it, the second argument is the output LaTeX will print whenever you use it. For example:\n\\newtheorem{mydef}{Definition}\nwill define the mydef environment; if you use it like this:\n\\begin{mydef} Here is a new definition \\end{mydef}\nIt will look like this:\nDefinition 3 Here is a new definition\nwith line breaks separating it from the rest of the text.\nTheorem counters[ edit ]\nOften the counters are determined by section, for example \"Theorem 2.3\" refers to the 3rd theorem in the 2nd section of a document. In this case, specify the theorem as follows:\n\\newtheorem{name}{Printed output}[numberby]\nwhere numberby is the name of the section level (section/subsection/etc.) at which the numbering is to take place.\nBy default, each theorem uses its own counter. However it is common for similar types of theorems (e.g. Theorems, Lemmas and Corollaries) to share a counter. In this case, define subsequent theorems as:\n\\newtheorem{name}[counter]{Printed output}\nwhere counter is the name of the counter to be used. Usually this will be the name of the master theorem.\nThe \\newtheorem command may have at most one optional argument.\nYou can also create a theorem environment that is not numbered by using the newtheorem* command [1] . For instance,\n\\newtheorem*{mydef}{Definition}\nProofs[ edit ]\nThe proof environment [1] can be used for adding the proof of a theorem. The basic usage is:\n\\begin{proof} Here is my proof \\end{proof}\nIt just adds Proof in italics at the beginning of the text given as argument and a white square ( Q.E.D. symbol, also known as a tombstone ) at the end of it. If you are writing in another language than English, just use babel with the right argument and the word Proof printed in the output will be translated accordingly; anyway, in the source the name of the environment remains proof.\nIf you would like to manually name the proof, include the name in square brackets:\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of important theorem] Here is my important proof \\end{proof}\nIf the last line of the proof is displayed math then the Q.E.D. symbol will appear on a subsequent empty line. To put the Q.E.D. symbol at the end of the last line, use the \\qedhere command:\n\\begin{proof} Here is my proof: \\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\qedhere \\] \\end{proof}\nThe method above does not work with the deprecated environment eqnarray*. Use align* instead.\nTo use a custom Q.E.D. symbol, redefine the \\qedsymbol command. To hide the Q.E.D. symbol altogether, redefine it to be blank:\n\\renewcommand{\\qedsymbol}{}\nTheorem styles[ edit ]\nIt adds the possibility to change the output of the environments defined by \\newtheorem using the \\theoremstyle command [1] in the header:\n\\theoremstyle{stylename}\nthe argument is the style you want to use. All subsequently defined theorems will use this style. Here is a list of the possible pre-defined styles:\nstylename\nCustom styles[ edit ]\nTo define your own style, use the \\newtheoremstyle command [1] :\n\\newtheoremstyle{stylename}% name of the style to be used {spaceabove}% measure of space to leave above the theorem. E.g.: 3pt {spacebelow}% measure of space to leave below the theorem. E.g.: 3pt {bodyfont}% name of font to use in the body of the theorem {indent}% measure of space to indent {headfont}% name of head font {headpunctuation}% punctuation between head and body {headspace}% space after theorem head; \" \" = normal interword space {headspec}% Manually specify head\n(Any arguments that are left blank will assume their default value).

Celebrations for the quincentenary of his death were arranged for 2009.\n\nCareer\n\nAlbertus was originally called Albertus Immenhusen, after the German town of Immenhausen in Hessen of which he was a native. He occurs in Swedish historical sources from 1465, when he was admitted a burgher of Arboga. Eight years later he moved to Stockholm, where, in accordance with current practice, he took over the workshop as well as the widow of a deceased painter. \n\nHe was a versatile and prolific artist, known to his contemporaries not only for his church wallpaintings, but also as an organist and embroiderer (hence his nickname of Pärlstickare, \"Pearl-embroiderer\"). More than thirty of his schemes, mostly in a secco technique, are extant, many in the Lake Mälaren region, about a third of which bear his signature. Notable examples include wallpaintings at Bromma kyrka, near Stockholm, Lid kyrka, in Södermanland and Täby Kyrkby kyrka in Täby. Part of his life and work are depicted in the illustrated book, \"Albert målare och sommaren i Härkeberga\" (\"Albert the Painter and the summer in Härkeberga\"), which describes his painting of the small church of Härkeberga in Uppland (see below).\n\nInfluence\n\nAlbertus's illustration of Death playing chess from Täby kyrka inspired the famous scene in Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal in which a knight (Antonius Block) plays chess with personified Death. Albertus Pictor himself appears as a character in the film (played by Gunnar Olsson), in a dialog with Jöns, Antonius Block's squire, while working on a church mural.\n\nChurches with wall paintings by or attributed to Albertus Pictor\n\nAlbertus Pictor's paintings are considered preserved in 37 churches. Nine of the painting are either signed with some variant of Albertus name or the signing documented was destroyed. Other paintings ascribed to Albertus Pictor are based on attributes made by experts on the subject. Attenuation on stylistic grounds based on comparisons to those of the churches that have secure signings is difficult to determine especially when it concerns the making of the works. \n\nThe ornamentation has traditionally been important for the attribution, it is, however, in greater part in the public domain and is more general in its expression and easier to copy than figure painting. A lot of them are also strong influenced by over-liming and production with subsequent restoration. Albertus Pictor's painting, however, differ so much from contemporary Swedish painters that they usually can not be attributed to the author. It is conceivable that in some cases they rather have strong influences.\n\n* Almunge (Uppland)\n* Bromma (Stockholm)\n* Bälinge (Uppland)\n* Danmark (Uppland)\n* Dingtuna (Västmanland)\n* Ed (Uppland)\n* Floda (Sörmland)\n* Gryta (Uppsala)\n* Helga Trefaldighet (Uppsala)\n\n* Husby-Sjutolft (Uppland)\n* Håbo-Tibble (Uppland)\n* Härkeberga (Uppland)\n* Härnevi (Uppland)\n* Kalmar (Uppland)\n* Kumla (Västmanland)\n* Lid (Sörmland)\n* Nederluleå(Norrbotten)\n* Odensala (Uppland)\n\n* S Per (Uppsala)\n* Sala (Västmanland)\n* Sollentuna (Uppland)\n* Solna (Uppland)\n* Storkyrkan (Stockholm)\n* Torshälla (Södermanland)\n* Täby (Uppland)\n* Uppsala Cathedral (Uppland)\n* Vadsbro (Södermanland)\n\n* Vaksala (Uppland)\n* Vansö (Sörmland)\n* Vittinge (Uppland)\n* Vårdinge (Södermanland)\n* Vänge (Uppland)\n* Västerås Cathedral (Västmanland)\n* Yttergran (Uppland)\n* Ösmo (Sörmland)\n* Österunda (Uppland)\n* Övergran (Uppland)\nQuestion:\nA 1480s painting by Albertus Pictor in Täby Church located north of Stockholm that inspired a film director depicts a man playing chess with whom?\nAnswer:\nDevitalized\nPassage:\nTommy Steele – Flash, Bang, Wallop Lyrics | Genius Lyrics\nTommy Steele – Flash, Bang, Wallop Lyrics | Genius Lyrics\nThe same thing happened long ago\nWhen man was in his prime\nAnd what went on we only know\nFrom the snaps he took at the time\nWhen Adam and Eve in their birthday suit\nDecided to get wed\nAs Adam was about to taste the fruit\nThe man with the camera said\nCHORUS\nYou've read it in a folio\nOr seen it in a Shakespeare play\nHow Juliet fell for Romeo\nIn the merry month of May\nAnd as he climbed the orchard wall\nTo reach his lady fair\nAs he tumbled she began to bawl\nAs he floated through the air\nCHORUS\nKing Henry the Eighth had several wives\nIncluding Anne Boleyn\nAnd he kept an album of their lives\nWith all their photos in\nAs Anne Boleyn was on her knees\nDressed in her very best frock\nKing Henry shouted, \"Smile dear, please\"\nAs her head rolled off the block\nCHORUS\nThere was just the same to do\nHe galloped home from the battle scene\nAll the way from Waterloo\nAnd as he came from off his horse\nTo the boudoir where she sat\nShe said to him, in French of course\nAs he took of his big cocked hat\nCHORUS\nStick it in your family\nStick it in your family\nIn your family album\nFrom the musical Half A Sixpence, based on the HG Wells novel, Kipps\nHidden\nThis page is accessible to\nVerified artists on the song\nLocked\nThis song has been locked and is considered \"done.\" You need 600 IQ to add annotations to locked songs.\n\"Flash, Bang, Wallop\" Track Info\nQuestion:\nWhich musical featured the song Flash Bang, Wallop?\nAnswer:\nOne-half\nPassage:\nGocompare.com\nGocompare.com is a British financial services comparison website, established in Wales in 2006. It provides comparison details for vehicle, home and pet insurance, breakdown cover, utilities, financial products, etc.\n\nSince 2009 its adverts have featured a fictional Italian tenor named Gio Compario (played by Welsh tenor Wynne Evans), which have been voted \"most irritating advertisement\". \n\nHistory\n\nGocompare.com was established in November 2006 and is based in Newport, Wales. The company's founder was Hayley Parsons, who worked for Admiral Insurance for 14 years, and was formerly head of business development at Confused.com.  Parsons was replaced as CEO by Jon Morrell following a takeover by insurance company esure in March 2015 \n\nIt was the first comparison site to focus on features of insurance products rather than just listing prices,  which led to the company being invited to become a member of the British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA). \n\nThe company, which is 49% owned by esure, posted a pre-tax profit of £34.7 million for 2011, up 15% on the previous year.\n\nThe company is the shorts sponsor of Welsh football team Cardiff City.\n\nOn 8 December 2014, insurance company esure was to take over Gocompare.com in a deal worth £95 million. \n\nServices\n\nGocompare.com provides a comparison service for vehicle, home and pet insurance, and breakdown cover. It also provides comparison services for travel insurance, gas and electricity, broadband, loans, credit cards, mortgages and other financial products through preferred providers such as Energylinx and Experian.\n\nOn 14 August 2012, the company launched \"Covered mag\", an online magazine that claims to be \"unlike any other financial publication you've ever read\". \n\nAdvertising\n\nIn June 2009 the company launched an advertising campaign featuring a fictional Italian tenor called Gio Compario played by Wynne Evans,  The advertisements feature Gio singing the 'Go Compare' tune in different places such as a coffee shop and was voted as the most irritating advertisement of both 2009 and 2010.  \n\nIn direct response to this reaction, Go Compare deliberately subverted the campaign in July 2012 by running a series of adverts where celebrity guests such as Sue Barker, Jimmy Carr, Stuart Pearce, Ray Mears, Louie Spence and Stephen Hawking lined up to \"silence\" the character of Gio Compario. Marketing officer Kevin Hughes said \"It was risky, but a brand has to listen to its customers.\" \n\nThe character returned in July 2015 after an 18-month break, singing as part of what Evans called a \"much calmer performance\". \n\nGio was actually modeled on Mr Steven Jones from Stowmarket Suffolk who is a very close Friend of the CEO John Morrell.\n\nAwards\n\nThe company won the 'One to Watch' category at the Fast Growth Business Awards 2008, with the judges complementing the management team for 'an extremely well-executed business with a clear USP and strong brand'.  In September 2009 it achieved the Investors in People award.\n\nThe company's founder, Hayley Parsons, was winner of the 'Woman in Business' award at the South Wales Chamber of Commerce Business Awards 2009.  She also won the Western Mail's 'Welsh Woman in Innovation Award' in 2008, and the 'Business Leader' category in the Inspire Wales Awards 2010.  The awards, which are organised by the Institute of Welsh Affairs, recognise the role that Welsh residents play in encouraging active citizenship and in promoting their communities on a local, regional, national and global scale. In January 2012, Parsons was awarded an OBE for services to the economy.\n\nControversy\n\nIn September 2007 the company admitted that, on one occasion, an unlawful breach of privacy had taken place with regard to the passing on of data provided by customers. It said that this was the result of a breach of contract by a sub-contractor, Performance Direct, and stated that it would take immediate action to prevent it happening again. \n\nIn January 2008 the site was blacklisted for a time by Google due to \"irregular inbound links\". This resulted in its share of search traffic for the term \"car insurance\" reducing from 17.49% to 2.31%.  Gocompare.com was blacklisted again in April 2009.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the fictional Italian tenor in the UK ‘Go Compare’ television adverts?\nAnswer:\nGio Compario\n", "answers": ["Manchester developments", "Manchester (borough)", "UN/LOCODE:GBMNC", "Manchester, Greater Manchester", "Manchester, UK", "Climate of Manchester", "City of Manchester", "The weather in Manchester", "Manchester (city, England)", "Machester", "Drizzlechester", "Mancs", "Manchester", "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Manchester (England)", "Metropolitan Borough of Manchester", "Manchester, U.K.", "Manchester (UK)", "England Manchester", "Manchester, England", "County Borough of Manchester"], "length": 4392, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bd51313596feec0e2ed933c6b481888897651f922ad46ad9"}

White Lacryma Christi is made mainly from Verdeca and Coda di Volpe grapes, with smaller proportions of Falanghina, Caprettone  and Greco di Tufo included. Red Lacryma Christi is made from Piedirosso and Sciascinoso grapes. It is also, as archaeologists have discovered, the nearest equivalent to wine drunk by the Ancient Romans, having analysed microscopic residue left on the taps of the casks. \n\nOrigins of name\n\nThe name Lacryma Christi comes from an old myth that Christ, crying over Lucifer's fall from heaven, cried his tears on the land and gave divine inspiration to the vines that grew there. The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by past lava flows, and its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages and covered with vineyards.\n\nLacryma Christi in literature and media\n\nLacryma Christi is an old wine, frequently mentioned by poets and writers. Lacryma Christi was mentioned in the book by Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo, in W. J. Turner's poem Talking with Soldiers, in Candide by Voltaire, and by Christopher Marlowe in his play Tamburlaine the Great, Part II. The Irish periodical writer and journalist William Maginn mentions the wine amongst other spirits in his poem \"Inishowen\" c. 1822. In the late work of the German novelist Theodor Fontane \"Der Stechlin\" (1898) the wine is mentioned  to be served after lunch in a convent and is characterized to be of higher grade than a Montefiascone. The Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch mentions the wine together with the island of Capri in his 1987 novel \"The Pupil\". In the short story \"Rappaccini's Daughter\" collected in Mosses from an Old Manse and Other Stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a glass of lachryma is drunk by the protagonist \"which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies\". \n\nIn the 1954 movie, Three Coins in the Fountain, Lacryma Christi is mentioned as being the favorite wine of Prince Dino di Cessi, played by actor Louis Jourdan.\n\nJean Paul Didierlaurent mentions the wine in his novel \"The reader on the 6.27\" (2014), \"(...) getting drunk on Christ's tears was the best thing that could happen to a Christian.\"\nQuestion:\nLachryma Christi, an old Italian sweet red wine translates to mean 'whose what'?\nAnswer:\nChrist's Tear\nPassage:\nControl-C\nControl-C is a common computer command. It is generated by pressing the  key while holding down the  key on most computer keyboards.\n\nIn graphical user interface environments that use the control key to control the active program, control-C is often used to copy highlighted text to the clipboard. In many command-line interface environments, control-C is used to abort the current task and regain user control. It is a special sequence which causes the operating system to send a signal to the active program. Usually the signal causes it to end, but the program may \"catch\" it and do something else, typically returning control to the user.\n\nIn graphical environments \n\nCtrl-C was one of a handful of keyboard sequences chosen by the program designers at Xerox PARC to control text editing, with Ctrl-Z (Undo), Ctrl-X (Cut), Ctrl-V (Paste), and Ctrl-P (Print). The first four letters are all located together at the left end of the bottom row of the standard QWERTY keyboard, and P towards the upper right. The equivalent key combination on Macintosh computers is Command-C.\n\nIn command-line environments \n\nControl-C as an abort command was popularized by TOPS-20 and TOPS-10 and adopted by other systems including Unix. It was also adopted by Digital Equipment operating systems, from which it was copied to CP/M and thus to MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. In POSIX systems, the sequence causes the active program to receive SIGINT, the interruption signal. If the program does not specify how to handle this condition, it is terminated. Typically a program which does handle a SIGINT will still terminate itself, or at least terminate the task running inside it.\n\nThis system is usually preserved even in graphical terminal emulators. If control-C is used for copy-and-paste in the graphical environment, an ambiguity arises. Typically an alternate keystroke is assigned to one of the commands, and both appear in the emulator's menus.\n\nAs many keyboards and computer terminals once directly generated ASCII code, the choice of control-C overlapped with the ASCII end-of-text character. This character has a numerical value of three, as \"C\" is the third letter of the alphabet. It was chosen to cause an interrupt as it is otherwise unlikely to be part of a program's interactive interface. Many other control codes, such as control-D for the end-of-transmission character, do not generate signals and are occasionally used to control a program.\nQuestion:\nIn most modern operating systems ctrl (or on a mac the mac key) x is cut, ctrl c is copy and ctrl z is undo. What is the letter for paste?\nAnswer:\nctrl v\nPassage:\nWhen I Need You\n\"When I Need You\" is a popular song written by Albert Hammond and Carole Bayer Sager. Its first appearance was as the title track of Hammond's 1976 album When I Need You. Leo Sayer's version, produced by Richard Perry, was a massive hit worldwide, reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in February 1977 after three of his earlier singles had stalled at number 2.   It also reached number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 for a single week in May 1977;  and the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 24 song of 1977.  Sayer performed it on the second show of the third season of The Muppet Show.\n\nMelody comparison\n\nThe melody of the \"hook\" line, or chorus of \"When I Need You\" is identical to the part of the Leonard Cohen song \"Famous Blue Raincoat\", where the lyrics are as follows: \"Jane came by with a lock of your hair, she said that you gave it to her that night, that you planned to go clear.\" The melody of these lyrics matches the lyrics of \"When I Need You\" as follows: \"(When I) need you, I just close my eyes and I'm with you, and all that I so want to give you, is only a heart beat away.\"\n\nIn a 2006 interview with the Globe & Mail Cohen said:\n\nI once had that nicking happen with Leo Sayer. Do you remember that song 'When I Need You'?\" Cohen sings the chorus of Sayer's number one hit from 1977, then segues into 'And Jane came by with a lock of your hair', a lyric from 'Famous Blue Raincoat'. 'Somebody sued them on my behalf … and they did settle', even though, he laughs, 'they hired a musicologist, who said, that particular motif was in the public domain and, in fact, could be traced back as far as Schubert. \n\nThe same melody can be heard in Elton John's \"Little Jeannie\" in the lyrics: \"Stepped into my life from a bad dream / Making the life that I had seem / Suddenly shiny and new\"\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Leo Sayer - vocals\n*James Newton Howard - synthesizer\n*Bobby Keys - Saxophone  \n*Michael Omartian - electric piano\n*Dean Parks - electric guitar\n*Jeff Porcaro - drums\n*Willie Weeks - bass\n\nChart performance\n\nWeekly singles charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCover versions\n\nRod Stewart version\n\nRod Stewart recorded the song for his 1996 ballad compilation album If We Fall in Love Tonight. This version was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and was released as the second single from the album, though it did not chart in the US or UK.\n\nCeline Dion version\n\n\"When I Need You\" is a promotional single from Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love album, released on September 7, 1998 in Brazil only. \n\nAfter Dion finished her Falling into You Tour in June 1997, she began to record her next English album. Dion and her manager and husband René Angélil wanted to include few cover versions on it. David Foster came up with the idea of recording Leo Sayer's hit \"When I Need You.\" The song, recorded at Paramount Studios and Chartmaker Studios, was produced by Foster and included on Dion's Let's Talk About Love album, released on November 15, 1997. Dion performed this song during the Let's Talk About Love avec Julie Snyder Canadian TV show in late 1997.\n\nAfter a string of successful singles like \"My Heart Will Go On\" and \"Immortality,\" Sony Music Entertainment decided to release \"When I Need You\" as a promotional single in Brazil (September 1998). Two previous singles were very successful in Brazil. However, with no music video and no promotion \"When I Need You\" failed to repeat the success of Dion's earlier songs.\n\nAuthors of \"When I Need You\" worked with Dion also on several other songs. Albert Hammond wrote \"Just Walk Away\", included on The Colour of My Love album (1993) and Carole Bayer Sager wrote \"The Prayer\", which became a part of These Are Special Times (1998).\n\nCritical reception\n\nEW editor David Browne wrote: \"an obligatory remake (a precisely enunciated version of Leo Sayer's When I Need You)\".  The New York Observer editor Jonathan Bernstein: \"A sliver of redemption is found in the passable version of Leo Sayer’s “When I Need You”\". \n\nFormats and track listings\n\nBrazilian promotional CD single\n#\"When I Need You\" – 4:12\n\nCliff Richard version\n\nOn October 29, 2007, Cliff Richard released \"When I Need You\" and reached number 38 on the UK Singles Chart.  It is also one of the five new recordings featured on his album Love... The Album.\n\nFormat and track listings\n\n#\"When I Need You\"\n#\"My Pretty One\"\n#\"Never Let Go\"\n\nSiv-Inger (Siw Inger) version\n\nSwedish singer Siv-Inger (Siw Inger) recorded 1979 a Swedish cover version. The song called \"Varför\" and has been a single of her LP \"Liv och kärlek\". \"Varför\" reached the Swedish Svensktoppen Charts and stayed 10 weeks in the Top Ten between March 30 and June 1, 1980. The song's best position in Svensktoppen was 4th.\n\nJulio Iglesias version\n\nThe Spanish singer achieved one of his best performances of this song in 1994.\n\nLuther Vandross version\n\nIn 1998, the American singer Luther Vandross covered the song as part of his I Know album.
