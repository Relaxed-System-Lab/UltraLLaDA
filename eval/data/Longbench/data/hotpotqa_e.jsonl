The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :백암성, Hanja :白巖城) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: 白岩城) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\n\nHistory\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\n\nLocation\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: 太子河; pinyin: Tàizǐhé), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: 沈阳; pinyin: Shěnyáng).\n\nConstruction\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\n\nStatus\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\n\nAccessibility\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\nPassage 5:\nYanzhou District\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: 兖州; traditional Chinese: 兗州; pinyin: Yǎnzhōu) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People's Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\n\nAdministration\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\n\nSubdistricts (街道)\nTowns (镇)\nHistory\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\n\nGeology\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\n\nClimate\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from −1.0 °C (30.2 °F) in January to 26.8 °C (80.2 °F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 °C (56.8 °F).

It is named after Sir Douglas Mawson, a geologist and explorer who made several expeditions to Antarctica. For the first three decades of its existence, it was a bellwether seat held by the party of government. This pattern was broken at the 2002 election, when Robert Brokenshire held the seat for the Liberals amidst a Labor election victory. Although it was thought that Brokenshire had established a base in Mawson, it reverted to form at the 2006 election, when Labor candidate and former journalist Leon Bignell won amid that year's massive Labor landslide. Bignell went on to increase his seat margins at the 2010 and 2014 elections. In both cases, he not only bucked the statewide trend, but also decades of voting patterns in the electorate. The 2016 redistribution ahead of the 2018 election heavily redistributed Mawson from a 5.6 percent Labor seat to a notional 3.2 percent Liberal seat, taking in areas down the coast as far as and including Kangaroo Island.

It contains a mix of seaside residential areas, wasteland and industrial regions. In addition to its namesake suburb of Port Adelaide, the district  includes the suburbs of Birkenhead, Bolivar, Cavan, Dry Creek, Ethelton, Exeter, Garden Island, Gepps Cross, Gillman, Glanville, Globe Derby Park, Largs Bay, Largs North, New Port, North Haven, Osborne, Ottoway, Outer Harbor, Peterhead, Semaphore, Semaphore South, St Kilda, Taperoo, Torrens Island, Wingfield, as well as part of Rosewater.\nPort Adelaide has had three incarnations as a South Australian electoral district.\nPort Adelaide was the name of an electoral district of the unicameral South Australian Legislative Council from 1851 until its abolition in 1857.From 1857 until 1902 it was a two-seat multi-member district. From 1902 until 1915 it was a large three-seat multi-member district covering Adelaide's north-west and western suburbs; together with the four-member Adelaide and five-member Torrens, the three districts with a total of 12-members covered the whole of the metropolitan area in the 42 member house.  The district returned to two members in 1915, and became a single member district from the 1938 election onward. It was held without interruption by Labor until the district's abolition prior to the 1970 election, and for most of that time was one of Labor's safest seats. The bulk of its territory was split between the neighbouring seats of Semaphore and Price.  The last member for this seat's original incarnation, John Ryan, transferred to Price.\nThe seat was recreated in 2002, essentially as a reconfigured version of Hart (which was itself created in 1993 as a replacement for Semaphore). Like its previous incarnation, it is a comfortably safe Labor seat.  The member for Hart, deputy premier and state treasurer Kevin Foley, followed most of his constituents into the recreated seat and held it easily.  At the 2006 election, Foley increased his margin from 21.7 percent to 25.7 percent, and gained a majority in all booths. Foley retired in 2011, triggering a by-election held in February 2012.  Susan Close retained the seat for Labor.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nMcLaren Vale\nMcLaren Vale is a  wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the  Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale  about 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and is included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 95 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are family-run operations and boutique wineries.\n\nGeography\nThe wine region, which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area, runs 30km down the coastline of the Gulf St Vincent in the west and stretches to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its northern boundary commences at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishes in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion.\n\nClimate\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry and warm summer, the area typically has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. The climate  is gentle with long, warm days and short, cool nights. Winter rains of 580–700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea.\n\nWines\nThe McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. A range of climate appropriate Mediterranean grape varieties including Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Nero d'Avola and Sangiovese are increasingly being grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties.\nNotable for producing premium Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 60% of the total crush. The area's diverse soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha—much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.)\n\nShiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity.  The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common.\nGrenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones.\nChardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours—rich and generous with pure elegance.\nSauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas.\nPetit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive.\nSangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April.\nTempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region.\nVerdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh.\nViognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours.\nZinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.\n\nSoil characteristics\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types, and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays.\nEach of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit.\nSome soil types allow grapes to be dry-grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour.\nMost vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards.\n\nSubregions\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology.\n\nStatutory protection of parts of the wine region\nIn February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\"  Premier Rann said: \"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\"Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013.  The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict.In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga.  The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area.  Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south.\n\nSee also\nAustralian wine\nFleurieu zone (wine)\nList of wineries in McLaren Vale\nSouth Australian wine\nPassage 8:\nCradock, South Australia\nCradock is a town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia 320 kilometres north of the state capital of Adelaide on the RM Williams Way  . The nearest town with a greater population is Hawker which is approximately 20 km away with a population of around 360. Cradock is in the Flinders Ranges Council area, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nThe town was surveyed during November 1878 and proclaimed on 6 March 1879.  The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Town of Cradock and the sites of the ceased Government Towns of Charlcome and Herbert.After the South Australian government permitted settlers to go into the semi-arid lands north of Goyder's Line Cradock was established in 1879 on a 'grassy flat' of 'strong red loam', by the Wirreanda Creek. Cradock takes its name from the then Governor of South Africa, Sir John Cradock.Soon after settlement, a school, police station, two hotels, two blacksmith shops and a saddler were operating in Cradock. The \"wheat rush\" was followed by the failure of four years of crops which led to an increasing despair and a loss of many of the town's population.\n\nHistoric buildings\nCradock had three churches. The stone Catholic church opened in 1883. The Wesleyan Methodist church built in 1884 was weatherboard and iron, replaced by a stone church (construction started in 1924) which was used into the 1980s, but is now a private residence. The stone Anglican church built in 1894 was used until 1958 and is also now a private residence.The historic former St Gabriel's Catholic Church designed by Thomas Burgoyne in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.The town still has one hotel, the Cradock Hotel, known in earlier days as the Heartbreak Hotel.\nPassage 9:\nPenor, Pahang\nPenor is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia. Located near the Kuantan-Pekan district border, it is accessible by the  Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route 183). Penor houses the jail of Pahang, Penor Jail, which is Penor's landmark.

{"input": "Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?", "context": "Passage 1:\nHuernia\nThe genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\n\nSpecies\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\n\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\nPassage 2:\nDictyosperma\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\n\nDescription\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax— which has given the palm its epithet album— and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 – 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\n\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, Réunion\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Guého - 2 remaining specimens on Île Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\n\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on Île Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on Île Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 734, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ebbd87b5c458cf749032bb57bb69ba30cd54ac841b39153d"}

{"input": "Willsmere was a railway station located in which inner suburb from Melbourne Australia?", "context": "Passage 1:\nKew, Victoria\nKew (;) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km east from Melbourne's Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of Boroondara – meaning \"a place of shade\" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby Villa Alba, built before 1863, is open to the public.In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the Penny Bridge) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.\nThe commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street. The Kew Hotel opened in 1855, the Prospect Hill Hotel (now the Dan Murphy's liquor store) in 1857, the Council Hotel about 1860, the Clifton (now Hotel Kew) in 1869 and the Greyhound (now the Skinny Dog Hotel) in 1874. The block of civic buildings comprising the former post office, the former court house and the former police station were built in 1888 as was the National Bank, at the corner of Walpole and High Streets.In 1856, a site was reserved for a mental asylum next to the river. By 1871 Kew Lunatic Asylum, now known as Willsmere Estate, was completed. The Kew Cottages for children were added in 1887. The hospital was built despite objections by residents and the Kew Borough Council and provides an historical example of nimbyism. Kew Cottages and Willsmere Hospital are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\nVarious churches opened in the 1850s, with the first school opened by the Anglican Church in 1856. In 1875 Sacred Heart Primary School was opened. More private schools were opened in 1878, including Ruyton Girls' School (non-denominational) and Xavier College (Catholic in Jesuit order). Other private schools soon followed, including Methodist Ladies' College (Uniting Church in Australia) in 1882, Genazzano FCJ College in 1889, Trinity Grammar School (Anglican) in 1903, and Carey Baptist Grammar School (Baptist) in 1923. Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School, was opened in the early 1930s. In 1960 it was said: \"it would be difficult to find any locality so richly endowed with so many and such large educational institutions as are to be found in Kew.\"A railway branch line to Kew from Hawthorn Station opened on 19 December 1887 and was officially closed on 13 May 1957. Kew was proclaimed a town on 8 December 1910, and a city on 10 March 1921. The population of the area tripled between 1910 and World War II.\nA former house in Kew was the birthplace of the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. As of 2016, due to its demolition, the house no longer exists.\n\nRaheen\nRaheen is a historic 19th-century Italianate mansion, located at 92 Studley Park Road. It was built in the 1870s, and its name means \"little fort\" in Irish.\nRaheen was once the residence of Daniel Mannix, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1917 with support from John Wren.\nIt was purchased in 1980 by the Australian businessman Richard Pratt and his family and is not currently open to the public. Pratt extensively renovated the house and gardens, including the addition of a new wing, designed by Glen Murcutt.\n\nToday\nKew has grown steadily since the early Bridge Road crossing development and is cited as one of the most prestigious suburbs in Melbourne. As a consequence, many of these residences now attract some of the highest residential resale values in Melbourne.Streets in the Sackville Ward (bounded by Barkers, Burke, Cotham and Glenferrie Roads), such as Alfred, Rowland, Wellington, Grange and Sackville, have some exceptional examples of Edwardian, Victorian and contemporary architecture.\nThe suburb has been home to numerous Scout Groups since 1st Kew was formed in 1909. Today, only 1st Kew and 4th Kew are in operation.\nKew has convenient access to public facilities and transport. The 109, 16 and 72 along with tram route 48 (North Balwyn – Victoria Harbour Docklands) tram routes pass through the suburb and the City/Lilydale/Belgrave train line is easily accessed at Hawthorn and Glenferrie Stations. Kew Station and the associated railway branch was last served by passenger trains in 1952, with the station site now the headquarters of VicRoads.\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census, there were 24,499 people in Kew. 66.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 6.6%, England 2.9%, Malaysia 2.2%, India 1.8% and New Zealand 1.4%. 70.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.6%, Greek 3.0%, Cantonese 2.8%, Italian 1.7% and Vietnamese 1.4%.

{"input": "The third solo album by David Gates of Bread shares a name with a 1977 film directed by who?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Goodbye Girl\nThe Goodbye Girl is a 1977 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross, written by Neil Simon and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings and Paul Benedict. The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\nRichard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\nPlot\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she does not like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of Richard III, but the director, Mark (Paul Benedict), wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype—in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous New York City television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.\nElliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre, and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the phone booth across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\nCast\nRichard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield\nMarsha Mason as Paula McFadden\nQuinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden\nPaul Benedict as Mark Bodine\nBarbara Rhoades as Donna Douglas\nTheresa Merritt as Mrs. Crosby\nMichael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\nPatricia Pearcy as Rhonda Fontana\nNicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began as a screenplay called Bogart Slept Here (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after Taxi Driver. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.Simon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\nThe basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.\nFilming began on Bogart Slept Here but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song, \"Goodbye Girl\", was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.\n\nReception\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason's performance and the character as written, calling it \"hardly ever sympathetic.\" However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his Richard III scenes as \"the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged Springtime for Hitler.\" Ebert criticized the beginning as \"awkward at times and never quite involving,\" but \"enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.\" Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, \"Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about 'The Goodbye Girl' is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss' own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film to be \"exhausting without being much fun\" and \"relentlessly wisecracked.\" Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times lauded it as \"the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"another feather in Herbert Ross' directorial cap,\" with Dreyfuss giving \"his best screen performance to date.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was negative, commenting, \"It's not Neil Simon's one-liners that get you down in The Goodbye Girl, it's his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it's almost macabre.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"It's pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, The Goodbye Girl is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nAwards and nominations\nRichard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody—just one month shy of his 30th birthday—won for The Pianist.\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Passions – #81\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Songs:\nThe Goodbye Girl – Nominated\nAFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Romantic Comedy\n\nMusical and remake\nThere were three failed attempts to turn The Goodbye Girl into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg's book Unsold Television Pilots.

It runs from the Virginia state line, where the roadway continues east to Appalachia, Virginia as State Route 160, north via Lynch, Benham, Clutts, Cumberland, Sand Hill, Gordon, Linefork, Kings Creek, Premium, and Hot Spot to Kentucky Route 15 at Van. KY 160 overlaps KY 15 through Isom to Cody, where it splits to run via Carr Creek, Brinkley, and Hindman, ending at Kentucky Route 1087 at Vest. Due to the mountainous terrain and numerous tight bends. KY 160 is signposted closed to tractor-trailers from Lynch to the Virginia state line. \n\nKY 160 is part of the State Primary System from Virginia to the U.S. Highway 119 interchange in Cumberland, the State Secondary System from US 119 to KY 15 at Van and from KY 15 at Cody to Kentucky Route 80 north of Hindman, and the Rural Secondary System from KY 80 to KY 1087 at Vest.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 2:\nKentucky Route 686\nKentucky Route 686 (KY 686) is a 6.333-mile (10.192 km) state highway around the city of Mount Sterling, Kentucky. The route begins at Kentucky Route 11 and U.S. Route 460 north of the city and goes counter-clockwise, ending at U.S. Route 60 east of downtown. The western portion of the bypass from KY 11 south of the city to US 460 north of the city was completed in late 1985 as a four-lane highway. East of the southern junction with US 460 to the eastern terminus at US 60, KY 686 is a 2.827-mile (4.550 km) two-lane highway on a four-lane right-of-way and was completed in the early 2000s.\n\nRoute description\nKY 686 begins at an intersection with US 460/KY 11 in the northern part of Mount Sterling, heading west on four-lane divided Indian Mound Drive. The road passes through business areas, curving to the south. The route intersects KY 713 before coming to a junction with US 60. Past US 60, KY 686 heads through residential areas with some businesses, turning to the east. The road intersects KY 11 again and passes more development in the southern part of Mount Sterling before coming to another junction with US 460. Following this intersection, the route heads northeast into agricultural areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing KY 713 again. KY 686 curves to the north and passes through more rural areas before heading near residential and commercial development and ending at another intersection with US 60 to the east of Mount Sterling.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Montgomery County.\nPassage 3:\nOldham County, Kentucky\nOldham County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state and commonwealth of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,607. Its county seat is La Grange. The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.\nOldham County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nOldham County is the wealthiest county in Kentucky and 47th-wealthiest county in the U.S. and ranks as the most educated county in Kentucky  While the causes for this are complicated, areas east of Louisville have long been popular with wealthy residents, initially as summer residences and eventually as year-round suburban estates and bedroom communities. Oldham County lies northeast of the best known of these areas, Anchorage, just outside Louisville's pre-merger East End.\n\nHistory\nOldham County was established on December 15, 1823, from parts of Henry, Jefferson, and Shelby Counties. It was the 74th Kentucky county, and was named in honor of Col. William Oldham of Jefferson County, a Revolutionary War officer.Initially, it was mainly a rural county with small, scattered developments in places like Westport which was founded in 1800 and served as the county seat early on. When the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad Company introduced rail lines in the area in the 1850s, many new towns and communities sprang up. Eventually the railroad ceased operating as a form of public transportation, but the more rural nature of the county continued to draw residents away from the metropolitan areas in Jefferson County. Since the early 1970s and the completion of Interstate 71, which connects Oldham County to Downtown Louisville and shopping in Eastern Jefferson County, Oldham County has increasingly become suburban in nature, a natural extension of Louisville's wealthy East End as it ran out of large tracts of undeveloped land.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 196 square miles (510 km2), of which 187 square miles (480 km2) are land and 9.2 square miles (24 km2) (4.7%) are covered by water. It is the 13th-smallest county in Kentucky.

Oldham County is the most affluent county in the state of Kentucky; most residents work in Louisville and choose to live in Oldham County due to the lack of crime and the nationally recognized school system. North Oldham High School in particular, is ranked very highly among state high schools, having been named a national blue ribbon school of excellence, and ranked in the top 250 best schools in the nation through US Weekly. 2006 classes at Oldham County High School were reported as to have a teacher:student ratio of 1:15, but that number does not accurately reflect the ratio of a normal class.  That number includes, for example, the small classes of five to six students in Behavioral Disorders.  The published ratio also includes small classes at the County Career Center, which is located on the same campus.  The actual teacher-student ratios are closer to 1:30. Regardless of population swelling and diminishing student-teacher ratios, which have led to a slight decline as of late, Oldham county is still widely recognized as the best public school system in the state.\n\nCommunities\nCities\nCensus-designated places\nBuckner\nWestport\n\nOther unincorporated places\nPolitics\nGovernment\nAt the federal level, Oldham County overlaps two congressional districts in the House of Representatives, the third district, represented by Democrat John Yarmuth, and the fourth district, represented by Republican Thomas Massie.\n\nNotable people\nD.

The highway, maintained by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, runs north from High Bridge, Kentucky through Wilmore before ending at Nicholasville. Within Wilmore, KY 29 intersects Kentucky Route 1268 and junctions with Kentucky Route 3433. The highway acts as the border between Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary. Just north of Wilmore, KY 29 merges with U.S. Route 68 for 0.590 miles (0.950 km) before leaving US 68 and turning east heading towards Nicholasville. KY 29 terminates at Kentucky Route 39 and U.S. Route 27 Business in downtown Nicholasville.\n\nRoute description\nKY 29 begins at an intersection with Lock Seven Road near the Kentucky River in High Bridge, Jessamine County, heading north on two-lane undivided High Bridge Road. The road heads through woodland with some homes and turns to the east, passing under a Norfolk Southern railroad line. The route continues through farmland with some woods and residences and curves to the northeast. KY 29 turns to the north and comes to a bridge over the railroad tracks. The road heads northeast through more rural areas before it enters Wilmore and becomes South Lexington Avenue. KY 29 passes homes before it runs past businesses and comes to an intersection with KY 1268. The road becomes North Lexington Avenue and runs between Asbury University to the west and Asbury Theological Seminary to the east. The route intersects the western terminus of KY 3433 and continues through residential areas. KY 29 leaves Wilmore and becomes Lexington Road, passing through farmland with some residential development. The route comes to an intersection with US 68 and forms a concurrency with that route on Harrodsburg Road.The road heads northeast and widens into a four-lane divided highway. KY 29 splits from US 68 by heading southeast on two-lane undivided Wilmore Road and continues through agricultural areas with some residential development. The road curves to the east and intersects the eastern terminus of KY 3433. The route heads into Nicholasville and widens to a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with US 27. KY 29 becomes undivided again and passes through residential and commercial areas, coming to another bridge over the Norfolk Southern line. The road becomes West Maple Street and runs past more homes before intersecting the southern terminus of KY 2332 and heading into the downtown area. KY 29 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 27 Bus., where the road continues east as KY 39.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Jessamine County.\nPassage 5:\nKentucky Route 3016\nKentucky Route 3016 (KY 3016) is a state highway in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The highway extends 2.082 miles (3.351 km) from KY 982 north to KY 36 and KY 356 in Cynthiana in central Harrison County. KY 3016 serves the south and west sides of the Harrison County seat. The highway was established north of U.S. Route 27 Business (US 27 Bus.) and KY 32 in 1987 and extended south to KY 982 in 2014.\n\nRoute description\nKY 3016 begins at KY 982 (New Lair Road) just north of that highway's bridge across the South Fork Licking River at the south city limit of Cynthiana. The highway heads northwest along Safety Way and veers onto Ladish Road just east of its bridge across the South Fork Licking River. West of the river, KY 3016 turns northeast onto Paris Pike, on which the highway runs concurrently with US 27 Bus. and KY 32. The route splits onto Old Leesburg Pike, which crosses and then parallels Grays Run and Paris Pike, which runs along the south side of Grays Run on its way to its river crossing and downtown Cynthiana. At Grays Run's confluence with the South Fork Licking River, KY 3016 curves north onto River Road, which the route follows to its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with KY 36, KY 356, and White Oak Pike. KY 36 heads east along Pleasant Street into downtown Cynthiana and north on Williamstown Road, and KY 356 heads west on Pleasant Street. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet classifies KY 3016 as a state secondary highway along its independent course; its concurrency with US 27 Bus. and KY 32 is a state primary highway.\n\nHistory\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3016 as a rural secondary highway between Paris Pike, which then included mainline US 27, and Pleasant Street through a May 4, 1987, official order. The agency reclassified the highway as a state secondary highway via an October 19, 2004, official order. The cabinet extended KY 3016 south from US 27 along Ladish Road and Safety Way to KY 982 after an August 5, 2014, official order. The highway's overlap with US 27 became one with US 27 Business after the mainline U.S. Highway was placed on the Cynthiana Bypass as ordered December 10, 2014.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Cynthiana, Harrison County.\nPassage 6:\nKentucky Route 393\nKentucky Route 393 (KY 393) is a 5.325-mile-long (8.570 km) state highway in Oldham County, Kentucky, that runs from Kentucky Route 1818 southeast of Centerfield to U.S. Route 42 north of Buckner.\n\nRoute description\nIts northern terminus is US 42.  From there it continues 5.5 miles (8.9 km) south to a 0.04-mile (0.064 km) overlap with KY 146 in Buckner.  It then splits south to continue for 2.5 miles (4.0 km) where it junctions KY 22 near Centerfield.  It follows KY 22 east for 1-mile (1.6 km) until it splits to the south.  It continues 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south and then terminates at Mount Zion Road.  There are no low clearances or weight limits on this particular state route. As of 2009, this route has been relocated and improved.  From the interchange of Interstate 71, it has been widened to three lanes with a center turn lane.  It has been improved to the junction of State Route 22.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Oldham County.\nPassage 7:\nKentucky Route 155\nKentucky Route 155 (KY 155) is a 20.788-mile-long (33.455 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 31E and US 150 (Bardstown Road) in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other side of intersection, KY 155 becomes a local road called Trevilian Way. KY 155 continues through several Louisville suburbs to Jeffersontown, Kentucky and into Spencer County, where it eventually merges with Kentucky Route 55 a few miles north of Taylorsville, Kentucky.\nIt is known locally as Taylorsville Road from its northern terminus until a junction with Kentucky Route 148 in Jefferson County, where it is known as Taylorsville Lake Road until reaching its southern terminus. Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations.\nIt is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265.\n\nHistory\nKY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\nPassage 8:\nKentucky Route 28\nKentucky Route 28 (KY 28) is a 36.217-mile-long (58.286 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that travels from KY 11 and KY 30 in Booneville to KY 15 in northern rural Perry County via Cow Creek, Arnett, Buckhorn, and Chavies. KY 28 begins in Booneville by traveling concurrently with KY 30 east while KY 30 west travels through town to the northwest. KY 30 veers off at the official beginning of KY 28 at Mulberry Street. KY 28 heads out of Booneville in Owsley County, heading southeast. About 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Booneville, KY 28 enters Breathitt County. After about 6 miles (9.7 km) through Breathitt County, KY 28 enters Perry County. KY 28 passes through the community of Buckhorn before making a short reentry into Breathitt County. After returning to Perry County, KY 28 passes through the community of Chavies before ending at KY 15 at Grapevine in Perry County.\n\nMajor intersections\nOwsley County + Breathitt County = 18.154\n\nSee also\n U.S. Roads portal\n United States portal\nPassage 9:\nKentucky Route 93\nKentucky Route 93 (KY 93) is a 27.734-mile (44.634 km) state highway in western Kentucky.\n\nRoute description\nThe route is separated into two segments. The southern segment runs from Kentucky Routes 139 and 276 southeast of the unincorporated community of Lamasco to Kentucky Route 810, Kentucky Route 819, and Iuka Ferry Road northwest of \nKuttawa via Lamasco, Confederate, and Eddyville. The northern segment runs from Kentucky Route 917 and Short Drive just east of Iuka to Kentucky Route 453 in rural Livingston County several miles east of Iuka via Iuka. It appears that the two segments were originally or meant to be connected, as both segments are just a few miles apart. It appears that they were to connect at the Cumberland River, at which the northern segment ends on the western bank and a rural road, likely what was or is to be part of KY 93, ends on the east bank.\n\nHistory\nKY 93 previously ran from the Tennessee State line in Trigg County to Fredonia via Cadiz, Eddyville and Kuttawa. KY 93 north of Eddyville is now US 641, while the highway from the Lyon-Caldwell-Trigg County tripoint southward is now signed as KY 139. \nKY 93 was reassigned to US 62's old alignment west of Kuttawa to Iuka via the now-discontinued ferry service when US 62 was reallocated to a new alignment providing a more-direct route to Paducah in the mid-1950s.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 10:\nKentucky Route 1065\nKentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065) is a 13.856-mile-long (22.299 km) state highway located in Louisville, Kentucky. The western terminus of the route is at Kentucky Route 907 a short distance west of Kentucky Route 841 (Gene Snyder Freeway) exit 6 in the Louisville neighborhood of Auburndale. The eastern terminus is at Kentucky Route 1819 in Fern Creek.\nThe route is known as the Outer Loop, Beulah Church Road, Seatonville Road, and Lovers Lane. It passes by what was the Louisville Motor Speedway and intersects Interstate 65 and the U.S. Route 31E/U.S. Route 150 concurrency.\n\nRoute description\nKY 1065 begins at an intersection with KY 907 in the Auburndale section of Louisville, heading east on two-lane undivided Outer Loop. The road crosses a CSX railroad line and heads between homes to the north and commercial establishments to the south. The route passes near shopping centers and comes to an intersection with KY 1865. KY 1065 continues through wooded areas with some nearby homes and commercial areas, reaching the KY 1020 junction. Past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads through areas of businesses and industry, coming to a bridge over a CSX railroad line. The road passes through more industrial areas and heads to the south of a landfill as a four-lane undivided road before becoming a divided highway again as it comes to an interchange with I-65.  Past this interchange, KY 1065 passes near residential neighborhoods prior to reaching an intersection with KY 61 in a commercial area. The road continues east past several shopping centers and passes to the south of Jefferson Mall. The route heads through residential areas with some businesses and intersects the southern terminus of KY 2052.\n\nKY 1065 becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and heads east through more suburban development. The route curves northeast and intersects KY 864, at which point it turns southeast to form a concurrency with that route on Beulah Church Road. The road curves east, and KY 864 splits to the south. KY 1065 continues east on two-lane Beulah Church Road and passes through wooded residential neighborhoods, curving to the northeast. The route turns east and comes to an intersection with US 31E/US 150. Past this intersection, the road becomes Seatonville Road and heads east through more wooded areas of homes. KY 1065 turns east onto Lovers Lane and winds north and east through areas of fields and homes.

Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nHistory\n1932–1938\nOriginally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.\n\n1938–1965\nIn 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.  In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".  The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\". Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.  This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.\n\n1965–2001\nIn 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after Érik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\nThis version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3 km (0.81 mi), separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made – whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.\nDuring the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984–1985), 195 (1986–1987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.\n\nMany problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.\nThese events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.\n\n2002 redesign\nIn the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823 km (4.240 mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-Württemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\"). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.\nThere was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (0.40 km) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300 m) distance in 2012.\n\nFormula One\nThe Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous Nürburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the Nürburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured Nürburgring.\nIn July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. From 2007, the Nürburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the Nürburgring in 2007.\n\nOngoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the Nürburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the Nürburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nDrag racing (NitrolympX – Rico Anthes Quartermile)\nFrom 1986 to 1988, the start–finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.\nThe drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX main event a week later. Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.\nWhen the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and 486.91 km/h by Anita Mäkelä (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69 km/h.\n\nDTM\nThe DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.\n\nRallycross\nLocated in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.\n\nLayout history\nCurrent circuit configurations\nPrevious configurations\nLap records\nOfficial record lap times are only set during the race. The fastest ever lap on the track is 1:11.212 set by Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari SF71H during qualifying at the 2018 German Grand Prix.

He made his professional debut during the 2014/15 season.\nPassage 2:\nDiego Luz\nDiego Alexander Luz Pizarro (born 3 July 1990) is an Uruguayan professional football (soccer) player. He played for Club Sportivo Miramar Misiones, Club Atlético Rentistas, Central Español Fútbol Club and Huracán del Paso de la Arena. Known for playmaking skills, range of passing and crossing ability, bending free-kicks with both legs and head goals. Since 2017 he plays for Huracán Buceo.\n\nEarly career\nLuz's professional club career began with Miramar Misiones, where he made his first-team debut in 2007 at the age of 17. He played for two seasons with Miramar Misiones, contributing to the promotion to First Professional League.\nHe then played one season with Rentistas, winning the championship of the Second League and getting the promotion to the First Professional League. He also played one season with Central Español and three seasons with Huracán del Paso de la Arena. In 2017, he plays for Huracán Buceo.\n\nEarly life\nLuz was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He is the son of Silvia Pizarro and Wilmen Luz. He has two younger brothers Claudio and Nahuel Luz. He regularly played football as a child, and attended Portones Primary School and Jose Pedro Varela High School.\nPassage 3:\nCristian Jeandet\nCristian Daniel Jeandet (born March 1, 1975) is a retired Argentine football striker. He retired in December 2015 after playing in 23 clubs and in the top-leagues of eight different countries: Argentina, Italy, FR Yugoslavia, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Morocco and Venezuela. He is regarded along Lutz Pfannenstiel and Sebastián Abreu among the best known globetrotters.\n\nCareer\nBeginnings and Newell's\nBorn in Concordia, Entre Ríos, Argentina, he started playing in local side Estudiantes Concordia when he was 12.  By his own words, he scored 60 goals in 23 games in first year, and 73 goals in 36 games in next one, receiving, an award as the recognition of the record of goals in youth levels, by then, at the city of Paraná, Entre Ríos. After that, Newell's Old Boys coach, Marcelo Bielsa, took him after trials. Jeandet spent 6 years at youth levels of Newell's, reaching promotion to the first team but without ever debuting in the league. Then what followed were loans, first six months to Ferrocaril de Concordia playing at Torneo Argentino A in 1995–96, but failed to qualify to final stage of the tournament, and next to same level club Patronato, in 1996–97, reaching with them the semi-finals.\n\nEurope: Italy and Yugoslavia\nAfter the loans at Argentino A, Jeandet left Newell's and joined Lanús.  He faced tough competition for a spot in the team from older and more experienced Claudio Enría and Ariel \"Chupa\" López. He failed to debut in the league, so he left, this time moving abroad, crossing the Atlantic, and settling in Italy. First he played with Fidelis Andria, competing in Serie B at that time, and making 4 appearances. Next, he played with Casertana F.C. and Fidenza.  He experienced difficulties adapting, so he decided during the winter-break of 1999–2000 to cross the Adriatic and join Serbian side Sartid Smederevo playing back then in the First League of FR Yugoslavia. He stayed six months in Yugoslavia, leaving Sartid at the end of the season. In between, he also apent some time in Switzerland with FC Lugano.\n\nBack to South America\nAfter leaving Sartid, Jeandet crossed back the Atlantic, but instead of returning to his native Argentina, he went to Chile where he joined Palestino. There were three more Argentinian players in the club and Jeandet adapted well, however not long afterwards, the club changed the coach and Argentinian Ricardo Dabrowski was brought, who said Jeandet was not in his plans. That meant the end of the short spell at Palestino in Chile, and Jeandet returned to Argentina. Dalcio Giovagnoli informed him about the ambitious project Central Córdoba was having under way at the time. Several Jeandet's former colleagues from Newell's were also playing at that time at the club, and Jeandet spent a solid 2000–01 season with Central Córdoba. They reached the \"octogonal\" with Jeandet scoring 9 goals in the process, but were eliminated in the 1/8 finals by Instituto de Córdoba which were strong and coached by Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino. Jeandet moved precisely to Instituto for the next season, but with Tito Martino already gone, and not getting many chances as a starter in the line-up, Jeandet opted to leave as soon as a good offer from Bolivian side Blooming arrived through his agent.\n\nPeru\nThe arrival to a major Bolivian club looked initially promising, however the club at the time was experiencing major difficulties. After three months at Blooming the situation became unsustainable; several coaches changed and the players were receiving no salaries and were on strike. Jeandet decided to leave, and left Bolivia and moved to Peru where he joined Club Aurora. He stayed at Aurora six very important months for the club, since Jeandet was crucial in the squad from Cochabamba that won the 2002 Copa Simón Bolívar thus earning promotion after 14 years to the Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano, the national top tier. Jeandet scored two goals in the decisive victory of Aurora over Fancesa by 5–1.Next, he joined Peruvian top-league side Sport Boys where he played coached by his compatriot Jorge Sampaoli during 2003. At the time his daughter Catalina was about to born, his wife wanted to have her in Argentina. By that time, Jeandet was approached by Cienciano president with an offer to join the club and become their main striker in their upcoming Copa Sudamericana campaign, but with Jeandet disbelief of Cienciano doing well in the Copa, and the disadvantage of that meaning a move to Cusco, Peru, over his wife's desire to return to Argentina, Jeandet dropped the offer from Cienciano and joined Argentinian side Gimnasia y Esgrima. Playing in the Primera B Nacional, they finished the season relegated. Besides the bad sporting result, the club also failed to pay the last six salaries, which meant also a bad financial decision for him, and to make the bad choice even harder, Cienciano surprisingly won the Copa Sudamericana that season, and consequently, the Recopa Sudamericana as well.\n\nGlobetrotter: Morocco and Venezuela\nAfter this disastrous decision, Jeandet was decided to reanimate his career. After spells at Sarmiento de Junin and Estudiantes de Buenos Aires he moved again abroad. After trials in Austria, he joined in 2007, along Claudio Ortiz, Wydad Casablanca, becoming the first Argentinians to play in the Moroccan top league, the Botola. He played with Wydad in the CAF Champions League. The African adventure was followed by a trip to Venezuela where he played with Mineros de Guayana.\n\nBack to Argentina\nAfter Venezuela, he returned to Argentina and in the following years he had spells with Villa Dálmine, Sarmiento de Leones, Almagro, Deportivo Laferrere, Unión Aconquija, General Paz Juniors, Talleres de Perico and Sarmiento Leones.\n\nPersonal life\nCriistian Jeandet has four children, the older one, Catalina, then Constanza, Jeremías and Felipe. By spring 2014, Jeremías was playing football in Belgrano as striker.\n\nHonors\nAuroraCopa Simón Bolívar: 2002Individual:\n\nTorneo Argentino B top-scorer: 2012–13 (22 goals)\nPassage 4:\nJonathan Blanes\nJonathan Blanes Núñez (born March 10, 1987 in Paysandú) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for River Plate in the Uruguayan Primera División.\n\nHonours\nClub\nRacing Club2007-2008 Uruguayan Segunda División championship\nPassage 5:\nJonathan Urretaviscaya\nJonathan Matías Urretaviscaya da Luz (born 19 March 1990) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays for Boston River as a right winger.\n\nClub career\nBorn in Montevideo to a father of Basque descent, Urretaviscaya started off his career with hometown's Club Atlético River Plate. His Primera División debut came one month shy of his 18th birthday as he scored in a 2–0 win against Liverpool Montevideo in the Clausura's first game, and he eventually netted nine goals overall for the runners-up.Urretaviscaya signed a contract with Portuguese club S.L. Benfica on 2 July 2008, for a fee of €1.5 million, being rarely used in his debut season. In January 2010, after having made almost no official appearances during the campaign – his only Primeira Liga game was against FC Porto as his team had many players missing due to injuries and suspensions, and he put up a good performance in a 1–0 home win for the eventual champions– he was loaned to Peñarol for five months, thus returning to his country.In late June 2010, Urretaviscaya was loaned to Deportivo de La Coruña in a season-long move. In the following transfer window, however, he returned to Peñarol in the same situation.For 2011–12, Urretaviscaya returned to Portugal, being loaned to Vitória S.C. while also renewing his contract until 2015. He went on to miss most of the campaign, due to injury.Subsequently, returned to the Estádio da Luz, Urretaviscaya spent the better part of the following two seasons with the B team. On 1 September 2014 he terminated his contract with Benfica and penned a one-year deal with F.C. Paços de Ferreira.Urretaviscaya re-joined Peñarol for a third spell on 23 January 2015, after signing for six months. He was on the move again the following June, joining C.F. Pachuca in the Mexican Liga MX.\n\nInternational career\nUrretaviscaya was part of the Uruguayan squad that competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, held in London. He earned his first cap for the full side on 28 March 2017: after having come on as a second-half substitute for Carlos Sánchez, he received two yellow cards in 11 minutes and was thus sent off, in a 2–1 away loss to Peru for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.On 2 June 2018, Urretaviscaya was selected for the finals in Russia by manager Óscar Tabárez. He made his debut in the competition on 6 July, playing 17 minutes in the 2–0 quarter-final defeat against France after replacing Nahitan Nández.\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nAs of 16 December 2017\n\nInternational\nAs of match played 7 September 2018\n\nHonours\nBenfica\n\nPrimeira Liga: 2009–10\nTaça da Liga: 2009–10\nUEFA Europa League runner-up: 2012–13Peñarol\n\nUruguayan Primera División: 2009–10\nCopa Libertadores runner-up: 2011Pachuca\n\nLiga MX: Clausura 2016\nCONCACAF Champions League: 2016–17Monterrey\n\nLiga MX: Apertura 2019\nCONCACAF Champions League: 2019Individual\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Bronze Ball 2017\nPassage 6:\nDiego Vicente\nDiego Sebastián Vicente Pereyra (born July 19, 1998)  is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Danubio in the Uruguayan Segunda División.\n\nClub career\nVicente started his career playing with River Plate. He made his professional debut during the 2015/16 season.\nPassage 7:\nSebastián Abreu\nWashington Sebastián Abreu Gallo (Spanish pronunciation: [seβasˈtjan aˈβɾew]; born 17 October 1976) is a Uruguayan football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is the current manager of Peruvian club Universidad César Vallejo.\nHe is best known for his record of appearing for 32 teams in 11 countries during his professional career. Nicknamed Loco (Madman in Spanish), the prolific scorer for club and national team initially retired in 2021 after a four-month stint with Sud América, but later that same year came out of retirement with Olimpia de Minas.A Uruguayan international for more than 15 years, Abreu represented his country in two World Cups and three Copa América tournaments, winning the latter in 2011.\n\nPlaying career\nClub\nEarly career\nBorn in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Abreu played in numerous clubs throughout the Americas (Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil). He also had an unsuccessful stint with Spain's Deportivo de La Coruña, which loaned him several times for the duration of his contract.In his sole season in La Liga, which started in January 1998, having been signed from San Lorenzo, Abreu scored for the Galicians in a 3–1 home defeat of Barcelona on 25 January.\n\nRiver Plate and Beitar\nAfter having joined Mexico's UANL in 2007, Abreu was able to rescind his contract with them in order to join River Plate – the Mexican Football Federation stalled on recognising the transfer because of an imposed moratorium between the clubs. He became the only foreigner to score in the Clásico Regiomontano (Tigres vs. Monterrey, which he represented the previous year) against each team.In the middle of 2008, after exhausting negotiations, Abreu signed a deal with Israeli League champions Beitar Jerusalem. He appeared in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League, but his team was quickly eliminated. Additionally, he could not play in the domestic front due to lack of payment.\nAbreu re-signed with River Plate in September 2008 after terminating his link with Beitar, with a deal lasting until June 2009. Due to being a late addition, he was not able to play for the side in the Primera División, only featuring in the Copa Sudamericana. The next year, he was eligible for both the domestic and Copa Libertadores fronts.\n\nReal Sociedad\nIn early January 2009, Abreu returned to Spain after a ten-year absence, being loaned by River to Segunda División side Real Sociedad, which had lost habitual first choice Iñigo Díaz de Cerio for the season due to a serious leg injury.On 14 March 2009, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 away win against league leaders Xerez. His team, however, ultimately failed in returning to the top flight.\n\nBotafogo\nOn 13 June 2009, Aris in Greece signed Abreu from River Plate. However, in January of the following year, the 33-year-old changed club and country again, agreeing on a two-year contract with Brazil's Botafogo.Abreu scored the second goal in the 2–1 victory over Flamengo on 18 April 2010, which gave the team the Campeonato Carioca title. In July, he had his link extended until 31 December 2012 with a release clause of US$11.3 million, with the player declaring he had previously held talks with Universidad de Chile and Trabzonspor of Turkey.On 6 February 2011, Abreu was involved in a dramatic match against Fluminense: his team won a penalty kick as they were losing 2–1, and he shot it in Panenka-style, with Diego Cavalieri saving the shot by simply standing still. Another penalty was awarded just five minutes later, and he shot it in the same fashion, this time into the right-hand corner of the goal, as the goalkeeper dived the other way; a few minutes later, Botafogo scored again and won the game.Abreu was loaned to fellow Série A side Figueirense on 5 July 2012. However, as the season went on to end in relegation, his contract was ended via Twitter on 24 November, one day before the last game against Grêmio.\n\nSol de América\nFrom January 2013 to December 2015, Abreu was under contract to Nacional, also being loaned to Rosario Central and Aucas during this timeframe. On 28 December 2015, Paraguayan newspaper D10 reported that he had met in Uruguay with Sol de América chairman Miguel Figueredo. He had already received a more lucrative offer from Mexico, but declined in order to be closer to his country, and was officially confirmed on 6 January 2016.\n\nBangu\nOn 12 November 2016, 40-year-old Abreu joined Brazil's Bangu from Santa Tecla, with the deal being made effective the following January. After ten appearances in the Rio de Janeiro State League, he left.\n\nLater years\nOn 4 April 2017, Abreu signed with Montevideo-based team Central Español of the Uruguayan Segunda División. In late December of the same year, he joined Chilean Primera División's Audax Italiano from Puerto Montt, in the same country but one level below; this transfer broke a world record, as it marked him as the first player to have played for 26 professional clubs.Abreu returned to Brazil in December 2018 at age 42, agreeing to a contract at Série D's Rio Branco. He returned to his homeland the following July, signing with Boston River and making his Primera División debut in a 0–0 draw against River Plate where he donned jersey number 113.On 8 February 2021, Abreu signed for Athletic Club in Brazil. After four matches in the Campeonato Mineiro, he terminated his contract on 21 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On 30 March 2021, Abreu joined newly promoted Uruguayan top-tier club Sud América. On 10 June, he announced his decision to retire from professional football, and it was reported on news the game against Liverpool the following day would be his last.Abreu's hometown side Olimpia de Minas announced on 29 August 2021 that he would briefly come out of retirement to play for them in the local Campeonato Minuano. He finished as champion of the +40 category tournament of ADIC (Asociación Deportiva de Integración Colegial), and also top scorer with 17 goals in 11 matches for the amateur (college) team Colegio Jesús María 2019, being the second championship won in the year after the Apertura, where he also ranked first in the scoring charts.\n\nInternational\nAbreu played for Uruguay at the 2002 FIFA World Cup – three matches – and the 1997, 2007 and 2011 Copa América editions, netting twice in the latter. He made his debut for the national side on 17 July 1996 in a friendly with China, going on to earn 70 caps.On 27 May 2010, Abreu stood only five goals short of Uruguayan all-time goalscoring record, held by Héctor Scarone for 79 years. He was selected for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where he appeared three times as a substitute; in the quarter-finals against Ghana he scored the decisive penalty shootout attempt (1–1 after 120 minutes), a Panenka to send his team to the semi-finals for the first time in 40 years.\n\nCoaching career\nOn 26 April 2019, Abreu was announced as the interim manager of Santa Tecla on an initial one-and-a-half month spell, with the parties holding the option open of keeping him as a player-coach or just as a player afterwards. He won the Copa El Salvador four days later, defeating Audaz 1–0 in the final.In December 2019, Abreu was appointed player-coach at Boston River ahead of the upcoming campaign in the Uruguayan Primera División.

(Watt, 1985)  The founding of this Christian place of worship is associated with St. Nathalan. who lived circa 650 AD.  The structure is alternatively known as Cowie Chapel.\nThe chapel is at the point where the Highland Boundary Fault meets the sea and so is on the dividing line between the highlands and lowlands of Scotland.\n\nArea history\nThe Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan is one of the oldest surviving structures in Kincardineshire.  About one kilometre to the west is the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which was constructed on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south of Stonehaven into Aberdeen. This route specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Muchalls Castle and Cowie Castle from the south. (Hogan, 2007) The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the battle of the Civil War in 1639.\n\nSee also\nDoonie Point\nLimpet Burn\nRed Cloak\nPassage 2:\nInverallochy Castle\nInverallochy Castle is a ruined courtyard castle, near the village of Inverallochy in the Buchan area of North-East Scotland, dating to 1504. It lies 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of Cairnbulg Castle, near Fraserburgh, and formerly stood beside the now-drained Loch of Inverallochy. It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire.\n\nDescription\nThe remains of buildings are arranged around three sides of a courtyard, with a curtain wall across the south side. A tower in the north-east corner remains largely to its full height, while the remaining curtain wall stands up to 10 m high. The internal walls have largely collapsed. Evidence of a larger outer courtyard measuring approximately 60 metres (200 ft) square to the north and east remains. The ruins are protected as a scheduled monument. The castle appears to have all been built at once, and architectural evidence suggests an early 16th-century date. It may have been the work of Sir William Comyn (or Cumyng) of Inverallochy, who was Lord Lyon in 1512–1519.\n\nInscribed stone\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, there was a stone inserted above the entrance, bearing the sculptured arms of the Comyns, with an inscription \"recording that the estate around it was obtained by Jordan Comyn for building the abbey of Deer\".\nPassage 3:\nCowie Bridge\nCowie Bridge is a roadway bridge which carries the B979 across the mouth of the Cowie Water in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  \nHistorically, the area in the vicinity of the Cowie Bridge site has been an old fishing village known as Cowie Village.  Between the Cowie Bridge and the North Sea, a new pedestrian bridge is planned, which will also support a new pipeline structure.  The site of Cowie Bridge is approximately the point of the southern terminus of the Causey Mounth trackway, which was the only available medieval route crossing the coastal Grampian Mountains northerly by way of Muchalls Castle and Gillybrands.\n\nSee also\nCowie Castle\nChapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan\nPassage 4:\nAllardice Castle\nAllardice Castle (also spelled Allardyce) is a sixteenth-century manor house in Kincardineshire, Scotland. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres north-west of the town of Inverbervie.  The Bervie Water flows around Allardice Castle on both sides. Allardice may be viewed as one of a chain of coastal castles; to the north are Dunnottar Castle (ruined), Fetteresso Castle, Cowie Castle (ruined) and Muchalls Castle. The castle is a category A listed building. Allardice castle was the chief seat of the Barons of Allardice, an ancient family who first appear in an 1197 charter. Since 1542 (the time at which the current L-plan building was built) many alterations and changes have been made to the original structure.\nPassage 5:\nStonehaven Bay\nStonehaven Bay is a natural harbour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The town of Stonehaven is built along the shore of Stonehaven Bay. The mouths of the Carron Water and the Cowie Water are both situated in Stonehaven, within the Bay.\nPassage 6:\nBervie Water\nBervie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Bhiorbhaigh) is a river in Aberdeenshire, Scotland which rises in the Drumtochty Forest and flows across The Mearns to reach the North Sea at Inverbervie.  Approximately two kilometres upstream of the North Sea, the Bervie Water flows through the grounds of Allardice Castle.  The Bothenoth Burn (Burn of Healing) joins the Bervie Water to the east of Arbuthnott House. At Arbuthnott the river forms a steep-sided valley where gardens were laid out on the south-facing slope. It is a series of four terraces across which run diagonal intersecting grass paths.\n\nSee also\nCarron Water, Aberdeenshire Media related to Bervie Water at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 7:\nCowie Castle\nCowie Castle is a ruined fortress in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  The site lies at the northern end of Stonehaven on the North Sea coast.  To the immediate south is the Cowie Bridge crossing of the Cowie Water.  Evidence of prehistoric man exists in the vicinity dating to the Iron Age in the form of ring cairns.\n\nStrategic location\nThe ancient Causey Mounth trackway was developed at least as early as the eleventh century AD to connect the coastal portion of Stonehaven to a crossing of the River Dee at the southern edge of Aberdeen.  This strategic route in the Middle Ages fit with the coastal defences of the fortresses of Dunnottar Castle and Cowie Castle, controlling land and sea movements of military units.  Cowie Castle at the north of Stonehaven effectively controlled all coastal land and sea movements to the north.  Proceeding north from Cowie Castle, the Causey Mounth crosses the Burn of Muchalls at the Bridge of Muchalls and thence proceeds northward past Muchalls Castle.  The trackway passes the ruins of the Episcopal Chapels, dating to 1624 situated on the lands of the Muchalls Castle Estate, and thence northerly crossing through the boggy Portlethen Moss (which had a much larger historic extent than present). Cowie Castle is also situated near the southern end of the Elsick Mounth, another strategic route used by the Romans in their northern invasion and also instrumental in subsequent eras' military movements.\nOther nearby castles are the ruined Dunnottar Castle to the south, Fetteresso Castle to the south-west and Muchalls Castle to the north.  St. Nathalan is said to have founded the ruined Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan immediately north of the Cowie Castle site.\n\nThe castle\nCowie is thought to have been the site of a royal hunting lodge in the Middle Ages, and may have served as a royal lodging during progresses through the north-east of Scotland. Only a small section of masonry survives today on the site, which is a scheduled monument.\n\nSee also\nBarony of Cowie\nCowie Village\nFiddes Castle\nPassage 8:\nCowie Water\nThe Cowie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Chollaidh) is a river of Scotland.\n\nGeography\nThe river rises in the Grampian Mountains in Kincardineshire, and discharges to the North Sea in the northern part of Stonehaven, south of the ruined Cowie Castle. Tributaries of the Cowie Water include the Burn of Monboys, which drains the area to the north, in which the archaeological site Raedykes Roman Camp is situated; and Cowton Burn.\nNotable features in this vicinity include Dunnottar Castle, Fetteresso Castle and Muchalls Castle.  Other nearby coastal waterways discharging to the North Sea include Burn of Muchalls to the north and Carron Water to the south.\n\nHydrology and water quality\nSummer flow rates are typically in the range of 200 cubic feet per second (5.7 m3/s) at the river's mouth.  July values for pH have been measured at 8.2 or slightly alkaline  July water temperatures are about 11.9 degrees Celsius and electrical conductivity at Cowie Bridge near the mouth has been measured at a relatively low value of .07 micro-Siemens per meter.  Turbidity measured exactly 24 hours after a moderate rainfall of one centimeter was 14 JTU in a July circumstance.\n\nSee also\nBarony of Cowie\nUry House\n\nLine notes\n Media related to Cowie Water at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 9:\nMearns FM\nMearns FM is a community run radio station  based in the North East of Scotland.  There are transmitters in Laurencekirk, Inverbervie, Stonehaven and Portlethen leading to a coverage area stretching from St Cyrus to Aberdeen.  The studio is located in Stonehaven.\n\nHistory\nIn 1993, Community Radio in the Mearns area began following a visit to North East Community Radio by members of the Stonehaven Community Centre Management Committee. Stonehaven Community Radio was subsequently formed, and it transmitted for the first time during July 1994 from the old primary school toilet block in Stonehaven Community Centre.  At that time, community stations could only operate for 28 days at a time. The group disbanded in 1998.In 2004, five year community radio licences were introduced, which led to the formation of a new group of enthusiasts. A draft constitution was adopted at the first AGM which was held in the late Summer of 2005. The project was delayed because a round of broadcasting applications had just closed and Ofcom, the regulating authority, did not invite new applications until the late autumn of 2006. It was necessary for the organisation to become a Company Limited by Guarantee and a registered charity.The committee originally planned the station to be named Stonehaven Community Radio but it was decided to become Mearns wide and be called Mearns FM.  Because of the large geographical area of the Mearns, the station applied for three transmitters which Ofcom subsequently agreed to and a licence was issued in early July 2007.The station began broadcasting on 6 June 2009 during the annual Feein' Market in Stonehaven. At 11am the station was officially opened by the local MP, Sir Robert Smith.Since then OFCOM have renewed our license to broadcast twice and we are able to keep broadcasting until at least 2024.\nIn 2016, the station was the only Community Radio Station in Scotland to receive accreditation from the BBC for Eurovision Song Contest coverage.In April 2020 Mearns FM was successful in a bid to increase power at all 3 transmitters and install a new transmitter at Portlethen church hall. This will improve coverage across South Aberdeenshire, half the funding needed to replace 4 transmitters was granted from Aberdeenshire Council and we are very grateful for that help. We will also open a new studio in Portlethen church hall part-financed by the National Lottery awards for all program. Mearns FM also launched on DAB digital radio across North-East Scotland in July 2020.\n\nStudio\nThe station was broadcast from Stonehaven Town Hall from its inception in 2007 until late 2019, when it had to move due to electrical upgrades taking place in the town hall. After broadcasting from temporary studios, the station moved permanently to a new studio on Ann Street on 13 September 2020.\n\nProgramming\nPrograms did include the self-proclaimed \"world's only Doric show\". Every Sunday at 9am, the previous Sunday's worship service of Bervie Church is broadcast.\nPassage 10:\nFetteresso Castle\nFetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway. Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House.\n\nPrehistory\nFrom cropmarks in the \"policies\" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus. A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe property is recorded to have been owned by the Strachans.\nRobert de Bruce opposed the Balliol (and later the Comyn) claim to the throne of Scotland, which culminated at the Battle of Barra Hill (1308). Castlehill of Strachan was in fact burned out by Robert de Bruce, and the Barony of Strachan later disinherited from the de Strachan family and granted by Robert de Bruce to Sir Alexander Fraser in c. 1316 (Robertson Index, 1-15). The Strachan family were supporters and kinsmen of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.\nThe barony of Fetteresso eventually passed to William Keith, the Earl Marischal of Scotland, who inherited the barony through his mother, the daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser in the 14th century to the Clan Keith Earls Marischal, who built the tower house. The Earls Marischal also held the nearby fortress, Dunnottar Castle.\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nThe characteristic Scottish designs of crow-stepped gables and the battlement crenellation elements were introduced. A dovecote of considerable height was constructed in the 17th century to the south of the castle. In 1659 Jean Hunter lived at Fetteresso. She was accused of witchcraft and hanged at her home. An artist and wright named Alexander Charles worked at Fetteresso as an overseer. Charles flourished from 1671 to 1678 and published his drawings in at least one book. Late in the 17th century, the Duff family controlled Fetteresso and expanded the building around the old tower house.\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nIn the 1940s, the castle was owned by Maurice Simpson and Geraldine Simpson (née Pringle). She was the heir to the Pringle knitware fortune. Subsequently, the Simpsons acquired and lived in nearby Muchalls Castle. After the Simpsons' tenure at Fetteresso, the roof was off the castle for some period starting around 1954, and the castle was bought by a local landowner and then left to the Don family in his will. In the latter part of the 20th century, the castle was restored, greatly modified, to yield seven houses, which is its present use. Ms Simpson continued to reside in the local area until her death in 2010.\n\nSee also\nAllardice Castle\nKirkton of Fetteresso\nRed Cloak\nStonehaven Tolbooth\nUry House\n\nBibliography\nC.

It is based on the novel Native Son by American author Richard Wright, who also stars in the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Chenal. Actor Canada Lee, who was originally scheduled to play the film's protagonist Bigger Thomas, had difficulties with his visa while filming Cry, the Beloved Country (1951) in South Africa and had to decline the role; with the whole production in jeopardy due to the mishap, Wright decided to step in and replace Lee.Due to its controversial plot, the film received severe editing in the United States, which removed about 30 minutes. A restored cut premiered on Turner Classic Movies on February 20, 2021, for the film's 60th anniversary.\nNative Son was later remade in two adaptations: one in 1986 and another in 2019.\n\nPlot summary\nA young black man, Bigger Thomas, is hired as a chauffeur for a progressive, affluent white family living in Chicago in the early 1940s. That evening, he drives their teenage daughter Mary into town to meet left-wing sympathizers. Their attempts to befriend Bigger are baffling to him because no white person has ever been kind to him and reflect how oblivious they are to the reactions of the black man.\nMary gets so drunk with her boyfriend, Jan, that she passes out.  Bigger takes Mary home and carries her to bed. Mary makes advances to Bigger so he kisses her. Mrs. Dalton, who is blind, suddenly opens Mary's door.  Bigger panics and covers her mouth with a pillow. Mary cannot breathe, and he accidentally smothers her to death. Mrs. Dalton merely thinks that Mary has passed out from being drunk and leaves the room.  Bigger moves the body and puts her in the basement furnace, trying to cover up what happened.\nA group of reporters, relegated to the furnace room of the house, notice fragments of bone and an earring in the ashes, prompting Bigger to flee in terror. He joins his girlfriend Bessie, a nightclub singer, in an abandoned building, but when she goes to a drug store for liquor and a sweater for him, Bigger thinks she has conspired with stool pigeon Snippy to put the police onto him, and he murders her, throwing her body into an elevator shaft. He flees the building, but the police give chase, turning a hose on him and forcing his surrender.\nHe is defended by a leftist lawyer with support from Jan, who worked with Mary toward racial equality. Max, the lawyer, fails to overcome the racism of the judge and jury and Bigger is sentenced to death. When Max tearfully says goodbye to Bigger for the last time, Bigger asks him to \"say hello to Mr... to Jan\". Bigger had found two white people capable of kindness to him; all the others put him to death.\n\nCast\nRichard Wright ... Bigger Thomas\nWilla Pearl Curtis ... Mrs. Hannah Thomas\nGloria Madison ...

Richard Wright was a particular fan of film noir, and director Chenal was a pioneer in the style. He was the first to make a film treatment of the novel The Postman Always Rings Twice, and there are many parallels between Native Son and that film noir classic. Regarding the movie's status as a film noir, writers have noted its similarities to this style, stating it has \"noir touches\" and \"the unmistakable feel of noir\", and that it \"does justice to the noir style.\" Other writers have gone further, stating it is \"good noir\" or \"darkly satiric noir\", and \"genuine noir.\" One writer expounded \"indeed it is [film noir] ... Not only in terms of the visual style but in terms of moral ambiguity.\"\n\nProduction\nCasting\nWhile Bigger is 20 years old in the novel, he is about 25 in this version.Americans were the primary actors while Latin Americans and Argentines of African descent had smaller roles.\n\nDevelopment\nThe history of this movie started with the Broadway version of Richard Wright's novel Native Son, produced by Orson Welles. Welles worked with playwright Paul Green and Richard Wright himself on the adaptation. MGM offered Wright $25,000 for the film rights to the novel, but they insisted the movie be cast with white actors exclusively. The independent producer Harold Hecht proposed to make the film, but wanted Bigger to be a white man of an oppressed ethnic background rather than a black man. Wright declined both.\nWright ultimately agreed to a proposal by French director Pierre Chenal to film his version. Chenal's film was greatly influenced by Welles' version and took it as its starting point.France and Italy were approached for location, but both countries refused to grant the requisite permits; they were recipients of US economic aid from the Marshall Plan and were afraid of repercussions if they hosted such an incendiary film. Wright and Chanal then turned to Argentina, where Chanal had already shot several pictures after fleeing from the Nazis in France.  Funding for the film came from Argentina's government, which had raised the money by taxing the box office receipts of Hollywood movies shown there.\nShechtman wrote that the process of making Buenos Aires look like Chicago occurred \"without too much difficulty\". The slums there substituted easily for the slums of Chicago, and Wright was meticulous about recreating Chicago visually, insisting that storefronts and brand names recreated on set were authentic.\nWright played Bigger because his first choice, Canada Lee, who had portrayed the character in the Broadway play, was not able to do so. Many other actors would not consider the role because they were fearful of repercussions; Wright was blacklisted in Hollywood at the time for membership in the communist party. The role of Mary required the white actress to touch a black man, so multiple actresses were unwilling to take the role. Hollywood actress Jean Wallace accepted the female lead, possibly because her career had stalled due to personal problems.\nAmerican studios refused to release the film, but independent distributor Classic Pictures picked it up after extensive editing. About 30 minutes of film had been excised as per the direction of the New York Board of Censors.\n\nRelease and later restoration\nDespite a heavy editing, multiple U.S. states made it illegal to show the new cut of the film.The Library of Congress undertook a restoration, with consultation by Edgardo Krebs of the Smithsonian Institution. In 2012, an in-progress  version of the restoration aired at the New York Film Festival. The fully restored uncut film, stitched together from a complete 16MM Argentine print and an incomplete 35MM print in the Archivo General de Puerto Rico intended for non-United States markets, premiered in the United States at the Museum of Modern Art in 2016.\n\nReception\nShechtman wrote that, in regards to the initial U.S. distribution, \"Reviewers and theatre owners were encouraged to receive it as tawdry entertainment, and most did.\" Chenal stated \"We presented a perfectly massacred version of the film and they have the right to review it.\" A review in an African American newspaper described the edited film as being similar to The Birth of a Nation; the review stated that the film was \"leaving the audience with no choice but to condemn\" Bigger due to omission of key characteristics.The 1951 review in The New York Times described the film as \"a sincere but strangely unconvincing film\". The reviewer added \"The stature of Native Son has been reduced with this exposure of film\". That same review described many of the actors as also being \"amateurish\".Media studies professor Thy Phu stated that the film was \"a commercial and critical disaster\".: 36  Film historian Aljean Harmetz wrote in The New York Times that the 1951 film was \"criticized as amateurish and melodramatic\".Film journalist Anna Shechtman wrote in The New Yorker that the \"amateurism\" in the portrayal of Bigger by Wright \"almost works\" due to the \"slow and stilted\" voice \"as though he's speaking to people in a language they don't know—which, partly, he was.\" Film critic J. Hoberman in The New York Times argued  that the attempt to age Bigger in the film does not help the portrayal and that \"Although Wright's delivery is forceful and his looks camera-friendly, he can't avoid seeming inauthentic in a T-shirt and baseball cap, playing a man half his age.\"Regarding the restored version, Chris Vogner of the Houston Chronicle stated \"Even if it's not a great film, the \"Native Son\" is of historical and cultural significance\".\n\nSee also\nStein, Sadie (2013-07-15). \"Watch Richard Wright Act in Native Son\".

It is an adaptation of the 1866 novel of the same name by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The same year a separate American film adaptation was made featuring Peter Lorre.\nThe film's sets were designed by the art director Aimé Bazin. Chenal rejected Bazin's original designs as too realistic and historically faithful, as he wished to create a more expressionist ambience for the film.\n\nCritical reception\nWriting for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a moderately good review, praising the direction and the camerawork particularly during the murder scene, the fidelity of the film to the text upon which it was based, and the acting of Pierre Blanchar in portraying Raskolnikov. Of Harry Bauer's portrayal of Porphyrius, Greene described the acting as \"a lovely performance, the finest I have seen in the cinema this year\". For Greene, the major problem with the film was that by converting it into a film in the third party instead of approaching the tale from within Raskolnikov's mind, the film was necessarily curtailed.\n\nCast\nHarry Baur as Porphyre\nPierre Blanchar as Rodion Raskolnikov\nMadeleine Ozeray as Sonia\nLucienne Le Marchand as Dounia\nMarcelle Géniat as Mme Raskolnikov\nAlexandre Rignault as Razoumikhine\nSylvie as Catherine Ivanova\nAimé Clariond as Loujine\nMagdeleine Bérubet as Aliona\nGeorges Douking as Nicolas\nMarcel Delaître as Marmeladov\nCatherine Hessling as Elisabeth\nDaniel Gilbert as Zamiatov\nPaulette Élambert as Polia\nPaul Asselin as Lieutenant Poudre\nEugène Chevalier as Le Borgne\nGeno Ferny as Commissioner's assistant\nClaire Gérard as Nastassia\nLéon Larive as Koch\nCharles Lemontier as Pestriakov\nPassage 5:\nThe Lafarge Case\nThe Lafarge Case (French: L'Affaire Lafarge) is a 1938 French historical crime film directed by Pierre Chenal and starring Pierre Renoir, Marcelle Chantal and Raymond Rouleau.

He graduated from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) with an MA in screenwriting.\n\nCareer\nAfter directing a small-budget film called Footsteps, Evans was hired as a freelance director for a documentary about the Indonesian martial art pencak silat. He became fascinated with it, and discovered Indonesian martial artist Iko Uwais, who was working as a deliveryman for a phone company. Evans cast Uwais in his 2009 film Merantau. He planned to produce a larger action film, but scaled the production budget down and created an action film called The Raid (2011). After the success of The Raid, the larger action film eventually became the basis for its sequel, The Raid 2: Berandal (2014).In late 2016, Evans started working on his next film, Apostle, which stars Dan Stevens. The film was released by Netflix on 12 October 2018.\nIn October 2017, TheWrap reported that Evans had pitched his idea for a Deathstroke solo film and is in early talks to write and direct.

It is part of the European route E105. It is 720 kilometers long.\nInaugurated in 1950, the highway starts at the junction of the Moscow Ring Road and Varshavskoye Shosse and travels south-west, immediately bypassing the cities of Tula, Oryol, Kursk and Belgorod before terminating at the border with Ukraine. \nWest of the border at Hoptivka, the road continues through Kharkiv and Zaporizhia to Simferopol and Yalta as the Ukrainian M20 and M18. Prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation, it was used by Russian summer vacationers who travel to the Black Sea resorts of Crimea; that journey may now be made  by the M4 and A290 instead.\n\nHistory\nAt the heart of the route of the road lies the ancient Crimean tract. The highway Moscow - Kharkiv section was built in 1840–60. The road was completely renovated in 1946–50, Getting asphalt cover. The route Moscow - Kharkiv - Simferopol in the Soviet period had the number 4.\nBy the time of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, it was decided to build a high-speed road understudy. Olympic Torch Relay took place partly on the new road, despite the fact that only a part of the route in the Moscow region and the junction with the Ring Road was completed in 1980. This was the first interchange in the Soviet Union, the traffic movement on which was carried out in three levels.\n\nSee also\nBerlinka, the never-completed Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg of the Third Reich into East Prussia.\nPassage 4:\nA180 highway (Russia)\nRussian Route A180, also known as Narva Highway (Russian: Федера́льная автомоби́льная доро́га А180 «На́рва», Federal highway A180 \"Narva\") is a Russian federal highway that runs from Saint Petersburg through Ivangorod up to the border with Estonia by the Narva River, with the Estonian city of Narva on the opposite bank, which explains the name of the highway. It is part of European route E20, making its easternmost stretch.\nUp until late 2010, it was designated as М11, which is now the number of the newly planned Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway.Since the 2000s the road has been being gradually reconstructed to have four lanes instead of two and to pass around the congested streets of Kransnoye Selo.\nThe eastern stretch of the highway adjacent to Saint Petersburg, known there as Tallinskoye Highway (Russian: Таллинское Шоссе), is a part of World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments due to its historical significance and multitude of cultural and historical monuments along its course.\nPassage 5:\nM9 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M9, also known as the Baltic Highway, is a 610 km-long trunk road that leads from Moscow through Volokolamsk to Russia's border with Latvia. The road runs north of Moscow across the towns of Krasnogorsk, Istra, Volokolamsk, Zubtsov, Rzhev, Velikiye Luki, and Sebezh, ending up at the state border. It passes Moscow, Tver, and Pskov Oblasts. The highway forms a part of the European route E22 which continues across the border to Rēzekne and Riga.In Moscow, the highway follows Zvenigorodskoe Shosse, Mnevniki Street, and Marshala Zhukova Avenue before crossing with Moscow Ring Road. The stretch between Moscow and Volokolamsk is known as Novorizhskoye Shosse. This is the only stretch (along with the part within the city of Moscow) built as a dual carriageway.\nPassage 6:\nEuropean route E411\nEuropean route E411 is a European route in Belgium and France connecting Brussels to Metz via Namur and Arlon. The E411 starts in the municipality of Auderghem alongside the Beaulieu metro station, crosses the municipality on a viaduct, then crosses the Brussels Ring and leaves Auderghem to enter Flanders in Overijse. When it leaves Overijse, the route enters Wallonia in Rixensart. It has an interchange with European route E42 near Namur and with European route E25 near Neufchâteau. At this point and up to Arlon, the two routes use the same road. In Arlon, route E411 continues to Aubange in Belgium, Longwy in France and on to Metz where it connects to the A31-E25 near Uckange.\nIn Belgium, the route E411 has the national designation A4 and name l'Autoroute des Ardennes and is roughly parallel to the N4 road.\n\nExternal links\nUN Economic Commission for Europe: Overall Map of E-road Network (2007)\nPassage 7:\nHemus motorway\nThe Hemus motorway (Bulgarian: Автомагистрала „Хемус“, Avtomagistrala \"Hemus\") or Haemus motorway, designated A2, is a partially built motorway in Bulgaria. Its planned length is 418 km, of which 191 km are in operation as of October 2022. The motorway in operation is divided into two sections — the first one links the capital Sofia with Boaza near Yablanitsa, crossing Stara planina (Balkan mountains), and the second segment connects Varna and Buhovtsi near Targovishte. According to the plans, Hemus motorway would connect Sofia with the third-largest city of Varna, at the Black Sea coast, duplicating European route E70 (Varna–Shumen), European route E772 (Shumen–Yablanitsa) and European route E83 (Yablanitsa–Sofia).\n\nHistory\nOctober 4, 1974\nThe construction of the motorway officially began. The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by the First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP), Todor Zhivkov.\n\n1999\nThe Pravets–Yablanitsa section of the Hemus motorway was officially opened on 5 December 1999. Due to the mountainous terrain through the Balkans, the 5.47 km section together with another 16 km reconstructed, features two viaducts and one tunnel (Praveshki hanove), while the whole Sofia–Yablanitsa section has three more tunnels. The construction of the Pravets–Yablanitsa section began in 1984 but ceased in the late 1980s due to lack of funds to eventually be finished in 1998–1999.\n\n2005\nThe 12.8 km section connecting Shumen with Kaspichan to the east was opened on 30 December 2005 and cost 77.6 million leva.\n\n2013\nIn July 2013 a segment of the motorway at Shumen opened.\nIn August 2013 a 8.46 km segment, connecting the Sofia ring road and the Yana junction, opened to traffic.\n\n2015\nIn August 2015, a 4.9 km segment, including the Belokopitovo interchange (with I-2 road), was inaugurated.\n\n2019\nIn October 2019, а 9.3 km segment, connecting Yablanitsa with the I-4 road near the Boaza ravine of Vit, was inaugurated.\n\n2022\nIn October 2022, а 16.3 km segment, connecting Belokopitovo with the village of Buhovtsi near Targovishte, was inaugurated.\n\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2013 National Company \"Strategic Infrastructure Projects\" (NCSIP), a state-run company, tendered feasibility study for the remaining sections of Hemus motorway (Yablanitsa-Panayot Volovo). In 2014 NCSIP signed contracts for drawing conceptual designs for all 8 lots of the motorway. In January 2015, a tender for design and build of 2 lots, between Yablanitsa and the Pleven/Lovech road, has been announced by NCSIP. In 2016 NCSIP was closed, with all activities being transferred to the Roads Agency. The tender for construction of the Yablanitsa - Pleven/Lovech road was cancelled due to lack of secured financing and later in 2016 a new tender for a shorter 9 km stretch between Yablanitsa and Boaza has been announced.\n\nExits\nMiscellaneous\nBebresh Viaduct, regarded as the highest motorway bridge in the Balkans with a clearance of 120 m, is part of the Hemus motorway.\nThe motorway is named after the Haemus Mons, an ancient name of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina).\n\nGallery\nPassage 8:\nM1 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M1 (also known as the Belarus Highway, road to Minsk) is a major trunk road that runs from Moscow through Smolensk before reaching the border with Belarus. The length is 440 kilometers (270 mi). The highway runs south of Odintsovo, Kubinka, Mozhaysk, Gagarin, north of Vyazma, through Safonovo and Yartsevo. After crossing the border with Belarus, the highway continues (as olimpijka) to Minsk, Brest, and Warsaw. The entire route is part of European route E30 and AH6.\nDuring the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 50-kilometer (31 mi) stretch between the 23-kilometer (14 mi) mark and the 73-kilometer (45 mi) mark was used for the road team time trial cycling event.\nPassage 9:\nM6 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route P22 (also known as the Caspian Highway) is a major trunk road that links Moscow to the Caspian Sea. The road runs from Stupino, then heads southeast across Ryazan Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, and Volgograd Oblast, running along the right bank of the Volga River through Volgograd before terminating at Astrakhan. Its length is 1381 kilometers. The entire route is part of European route E119, the stretch between Volgograd and Astrakhan is also part of European route E40, and the stretch between Borisoglebsk and Saratov is also a part of European route E38. The section from Kashira to Astrakhan is part of AH8, the section from Saratov to Borisoglebsk is part of AH61, and the section from Volgograd to Astrakhan is part of AH70.

{"input": "What 1986 drama directed by Lee Doo-yong starred Lee Mi-sook?", "context": "Passage 1:\nMulberry (film)\nMulberry (Korean: 뽕; Hanja: 桑; RR: Ppong) is a 1986 South Korean erotic drama film directed by Lee Doo-yong. Based on the eponymous classic story by Na Do-hyang, the film became known for its erotic subject matter, made possible by the government's gradual relaxation of censorship and control over the film industry during the 1980s. It was part of the wave of \"Folk erotic\" films that had become popular in South Korea at this time.\n\nPlot\nAn-hyeop, a beautiful young woman, lives in a small village in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Her husband, Sam-bo, is a traveling gambler who returns home for short periods after months away. During his long absences, An-hyeop earns food, money and other goods by picking mulberry leaves (ppong in Korean) for a neighbor who raises silk-worms, and also by having sex with nearly every male in the village. Angered by An-hyeop's influence over their husbands, the village women conspire to drive her away, first by beating her, and then by convincing the village elder expel her. When the elder visits An-hyeop's home to convince her to leave, she instead wins him over to her side by seducing him. The only man An-hyeop refuses to have sex with is Sam-dol, the village servant. Frustrated and infuriated, Sam-dol retaliates by telling An-hyeop's husband about her sexual promiscuity when he returns to the village. Sam-bo, An-hyeop's husband, reacts by beating Sam-dol for his verbal abuse of his wife. As Sam-bo again leaves to gamble, An-hyeop is again left to fend for herself, gathering mulberry leaves. The film closes with a lively, humorous ode to Spring (봄 - bom) and mulberry (뽕 - ppong).\n\nCast\nLee Mi-sook as An-hyeop\nLee Dae-geun as Sam-dol\nLee Moo-jeong as Kim Sam-bo\n\nBackground\nEssentially a melodramic sex-farce, Lee Young-il, in his History of Korean Cinema (1988) points out that the film \"depicts the agony of life under Japanese rule through sexual jests.\" Min, et al. write that the film symbolically shows that, with the husband gone to work with the Independence Movement, there was not much else going on in small villages during the Japanese Occupation but sex.Mulberry was shot on location at Bossam Village, a small, traditional site in Samdong, Ulsan, which was also used in director Im Kwon-taek's Surrogate Womb (씨받이 - Ssibaji) (1986), a film which helped to bring international attention to the South Korean cinema. The Korean cinematic \"tough guy\" of the era, Lee Dae-geun played the role of the servant, Sam-dol, who is the one man in the village with whom An-hyeop will not have sex. Lee became a sex symbol through his role in the film, which caused the actor some consternation. He states that he had appeared in the film for its literary qualities. Because the erotic elements of the film upstaged the literary aspects in the public eye, he refused to appear in the first sequel, Mulberry 2 (뽕 2 - Ppong 2, 1988).\n\nAvailability\nMulberry was released on Region 3 DVD in South Korea in 2005 with English subtitles. As of December 2007, it is currently still in print.\n\nAwards\nBest Film, Best Actress (Lee Mi-sook), Best Actor (Lee Dae-keun) at 6th Korean Film Critics Association (Yongpyong) Awards\nBest Director at 22nd Korea Drama and Film Art Awards\nBest Adaptation at 24th Dae Jong Awards\nBest Actress (Lee Mi-sook) at 31st Asian Pacific Film Festival\nPresented at 10th Montreal World Film Festival\n\nLater films\nA sequel titled Mulberry 2 was released in 1988, followed by Mulberry 3 in 1992.In 2014, a contemporary adaptation titled Mulberry 2014 and featuring different characters in a similar setting was released.

Some objected to the shade of the lead actress' skin, saying that she looked too dark for a Korean. Whiteness of skin was and is still considered important among many in Korea.\nOthers scoffed that it was unlikely that all of the injustices depicted could have happened to one woman. However, it is a vivid and visually spectacular depiction of the struggles many women went through in that time period.\nThe film also polarized audiences and stirred controversy when it was shown at the East–West Center and the Fifth International Film Festival in Honolulu.\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 57th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of South Korean submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nPassage 3:\nEunuch (film)\nEunuch (Korean: Naeshi) is a 1986 South Korean drama film directed by Lee Doo-yong.

One of the best-known actresses of 1980s Korean cinema, Lee's most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. She retired from film after getting married in 1987, though she still appeared on television in dramas such as How's Your Husband? (1993). Then a decade later, Lee made her comeback with an award-winning leading role in E J-yong's feature debut An Affair (1998). She has since remained active in film and television, notably in the May–December romance Solitude (2002), the Dangerous Liaisons adaptation Untold Scandal (2003), the mockumentary Actresses (2009), and the family dramas Smile, Mom (2010)\n\nCareer\nLee Mi-sook debuted in film at the age of twenty in Thoughtless Momo in 1979. By the mid-1980s she had become one of the best-known actresses of her era. Together with Lee Bo-hee and Won Mi-kyung, they dominated the screen and were referred to as the \"Troika of the 1980s.\" Her most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. Her early career lasted until the film Love Triangle in 1987, and then she retired from the cinema after getting married.Over ten years later, in 1998, Lee returned with a widely praised role in E J-yong's award-winning film An Affair, about a woman who falls in love with her sister's fiancé. Using this film as a springboard, she re-launched her career.In 2000, Lee was cast in the high-profile project The Legend of Gingko, which was considered to be production company Kang Je-gyu Film's followup to the successful Shiri (even though Kang himself was not directing). However the film proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment. Lee's next two films, Kiss Me Much and Oh! Lala Sisters, were also more or less ignored by audiences. In contrast, her appearances in TV dramas such as Solitude (2002) were more successful.However, 2003 was one of Lee's best years, with her highly praised role in E J-yong's Untold Scandal, a retelling of the novel Dangerous Liaisons set in the Joseon Dynasty, and her role as a single mother in Lee Eon-hee's well-received melodrama ...ing.Lee next starred in Hellcats, a 2008 romantic comedy that traces the lives and loves of three characters at different stages of womanhood. Then in 2009 Lee reunited with E J-yong in Actresses, a semi-improvisational mockumentary featuring six actresses each playing themselves.In 2011, Lee launched her own lingerie line Starit, which was sold on home shopping channels. This would've been virtually unheard of in previous years with the fashion industry's historically narrow focus on young women. But since 2008 the sophisticated and stylish image of actresses such as Lee, Choi Myung-gil and Kim Hee-ae became aspirational for middle-aged women in Korea, and brands specifically targeting women in their 40s and 50s have increased. Lee remains a favorite in editorial spreads in fashion magazines, notably a 2010 Elle Korea feature opposite pop star TOP.Lee continued to act on television, giving a vulgar, selfish, but human spin to her role as the stepmother in Cinderella's Sister, a ratings hit in 2010. 2012's Love Rain, a Yoon Seok-ho melodrama that jumps between the 1970s and the present, inked overseas distribution deals, but was unsuccessful domestically.After a judging stint on reality acting talent program Miracle Audition, Lee hosted the cable talk show Bad Scene, which featured celebrities who reveal bad or embarrassing scenes from their past.In August 2022, she left SidusHQ and signed with new agency Hunus Entertainment.\n\nLawsuit\nIn 2012, Lee was embroiled in a controversy when she was sued by her former agency, The Contents Media, after she moved to a new agency, Hoya Spotainment. The Seoul High Court ruled that Lee was guilty of breach of contract and ordered her to pay ₩120 million (US$110,604) in damages. However, The Contents Media filed an appeal, stating that the agency was owed at least double the amount. They alleged that Lee had been involved in a romantic relationship with a man 17 years her junior in 2006, whom they claimed to have paid off in millions of won to keep him from talking to the press and tarnishing Lee's image. Lee counter-sued The Contents Media and the two reporters who broke the story for defamation. Lee lost her appeal in February 2013, and the Seoul High Court ruled for her to pay the amount in the original ruling.In August 2013, she signed with another agency, SidusHQ.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2007, Lee and her husband Hong Sung-ho, a plastic surgeon, divorced after 20 years of marriage. They have a son and a daughter.\n\nFilmography\n*Note; the whole list is referenced.\n\nTelevision series\nVariety show\nBook\nAwards\nPassage 5:\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave, originally released as Visitor of America (Korean: 아메리카 방문객; Hanja: 아메리카 訪問客; RR: Amelika bangmungaeg), is a 1976 Bruceploitation supernatural martial arts film starring tae kwon do instructor Jun Chong (credited as 케리・郑 Ke-li Chong in the original South Korean version and as Bruce K. L. Lea in the English-dubbed and altered U.S. edit). The film was directed by Lee Doo-yong, though persistent misinformation claims that the movie was directed by Italian horror director Umberto Lenzi.\n\nPlot overview\nThe opening sequence (which was filmed separately and added to the original South Korean film when the film was dubbed into English) shows Bruce Lee (played by an unknown imitator), leaping from his grave after it is struck by lightning. While this and the title imply a story involving Bruce Lee returning from the afterlife in order to do battle, the rest of the movie revolves around a plot that has nothing to do with Bruce Lee. Instead, it talks about a certain Wong Han, a Korean man trying to discover the truth behind the death of his brother, Han Ji-Hyeok. He travels to Los Angeles and allies himself with a woman named Suzanne. Han is harassed by a number of petty criminals and thugs in his attempt to find out the truth about his brother. Eventually, he begins to suspect that Ji-Hyeok is still alive and involved in a criminal racket.\n\nCast\nJun Chong (credited as 케리・郑 Ke-li Chong / Bruce K. L. Lea) as Wong Han\nDeborah Dutch as Susanne\nSho Kosugi as Suzuki\n\nRegional differences\nThe version of the film seen on both the U.K. and U.S. VHS and DVD comes from an American edit of an English dub that was prepared in Hong Kong.\nAlthough the film was released in South Korea in 1976, it is unknown as to whether or not the film had a release in Chinese theaters.\nThe music score for the English-language version contains music lifted from the soundtracks to Rocky and Rollercoaster, two films not released until after the South Korean release date of this film. The sound effects on this version are typical of those often found in Hong Kong martial arts films at the time, rather than the sort that were heard in South Korean films.\nThe script for the English dub makes repeated references to the Asian characters being Chinese, when the visual evidence indicates that they are Korean.\nThe U.S. distributors added the infamous \"Bruce Lee\" opening sequence.\n\nSee also\nList of Hong Kong films\nList of martial arts films\nPassage 6:\nMiss Korea (TV series)\nMiss Korea (Korean: 미스코리아) is a South Korean television series starring Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Yeon-hee, Lee Mi-sook, Lee Sung-min, Song Seon-mi, and Lee Ki-woo.

The film was partly inspired by Montesquieu's Persian Letters, as well as the 1971 film Straw Dogs, with guidance from Antonythasan Jesuthasan, who stars as the title character.\nThe film tells the story of three Tamil refugees who flee the civil war-ravaged Sri Lanka and come to France, in the hope of reconstructing their lives. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It was later shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nSivadhasan is a Tamil Tiger soldier during the last days of the Sri Lankan Civil War. After the armed conflict resolves, his side loses and he is forced to move to a refugee camp. There he decides to move to France to take a fresh chance at life. However, in order to secure political asylum, he requires a convincing cover story. He is given the passport of a dead man, Dheepan Natarajan, and pairs with people he barely knows posing as his family. Along with his supposed wife, Yalini and his supposed 9-year-old daughter, Illayaal, they get on a ship bound for Paris. Upon arrival, he lands a job as a resident caretaker and starts building a new life in a banlieue housing project named Le Pré. He winds up as a caretaker of a rough housing project controlled by drug dealers (filmed on location in the peaceful project of La Coudraie, in the suburban city of Poissy). The new home turns out to be another conflict zone for him. Shootouts between rival drug gangs terrify Yalini and Illayaal as they try to fit into their roles as mother and daughter. Yalini is pressured to accept a job as a nurse-maid to the father of the local drug lord. Sivadhasan attends to his duties in spite of the chaos that surrounds him but is drawn into the fight. Caught in the crossfire of a climactic gunfight, Sivadhasan's latent battle-readiness resurfaces and he single-handedly destroys an entire gang with just a handgun, a machete and a screwdriver. He rescues Yalini from her boss's blood-soaked apartment. Eventually they all manage to immigrate to England where they find real peace.\n\nCast\nAntonythasan Jesuthasan as Dheepan Natarajan/Sivadhasan\nKalieaswari Srinivasan as Yalini\nClaudine Vinasithamby as Illayaal\nVincent Rottiers as Brahim\nMarc Zinga as Youssouf\nFaouzi Bensaïdi as Mr. Habib\nBass Dhem as Azziz\nFranck Falise as Janitor of Hallway C\nJoséphine de Meaux as Headmistress\nJean-Baptiste Pouilloux as Jurist\nNathan Anthonypillai as Interpreter\nVasanth Selvam as Colonel Cheran\n\nProduction\nDirector Jacques Audiard started making the film with the intent to make a variation of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 thriller Straw Dogs.

The Independent called it \"a radical and astonishing film that turns conventional thinking about immigrants on its head\".\n\nAccolades\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. After winning the award, Audiard said \"To receive a prize from the Coen brothers is something pretty exceptional. I'm very touched\".

I feel Michigan has the potential to become a leader in women's athletics in the next few years, and I want to be a part of it.\"Soluk served as Michigan's women's basketball coach from 1977 to 1984. In her first four seasons as head coach, the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team did not have a winning season and compiled a 36–63 record.  In 1979 and again in 1980, some players began a movement to remove Soluk as the head coach.  During the 1980–1981 season, 11 players left the team, reportedly as the result of conflicts with Soluk.\nDuring the 1981–1982 season, the team was led by All-American Diane Dietz, who broke the Big Ten Conference scoring record.  The team compiled a 17–9 record, the best in the program's history. Dietz later recalled her time playing for Soluk as follows:\"She was here when I came in. I played against her teams a lot in high school – she was at a rival school then. But she was a Bobby Knight disciple, so it was motion offense, all the way. A lot of people weren't doing that then. She spent a lot of time with us, coaching that philosophy, and it changed the way I played, how all of us played.\"\nWith the loss of Dietz to graduation, the Michigan women's basketball team reached new lows from 1982 to 1984.  The team compiled a 4–24 record during the 1982–1983 season and followed with another poor showing (4–22) in the 1983–1984 season. After the 1983–1984 season, Soluk resigned and was replaced by Bud Van De Wege, Jr., as Michigan's women's basketball coach.  Soluk's overall record as Michigan's women's basketball coach was 66–120.\n\nSoftball\nSoluk was also the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines softball team, holding the position from 1978 to 1980. When she was hired by Michigan in 1977, it was as Michigan's women's basketball coach, and there was no softball team.

Swimming and boating are not allowed on Hog Lake.  Fishing is allowed on the pier.\nPassage 5:\nG. O. Guy\nG.O. Guy was a small chain of drugstores located in the Seattle area of the U.S. state of Washington. The chain was founded in 1888 by George Omar Guy. Throughout the early 20th century, G.O. Guy's was the second largest drug store chain in Seattle behind Bartell Drugs and predated it by two years. In 1987 Pay 'n Save purchased all six locations and converted most of them to Pay 'n Save express stores, slightly smaller than full service stores. Pay 'n Save was bought by Thrifty PayLess which in turn was bought by Rite Aid.\n\nOriginal location\nMany modern sources give the location of the first store as the H. K. Owens / Metropole Building at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, however contemporary sources indicate that Guy's first store was actually located about two blocks south, at Occidental Avenue and Main Street. For example, Guy's January 31, 1927, obituary in the Seattle Daily Times, reads:\n\nMr. Guy started his drug business at the corner of Occidental Avenue and Main Street. After the great fire a year later [i.e. in 1889], which demolished his store, he resumed business in a tent at First Avenue and Main Street and in 1893 occupied, at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, the present site of the drug company.A Times article from 1934 gives further details of the several years following the fire:\n\nGuy's first thought was for the medicines, and he saved them to establish headquarters in a first-aid tent, where he stayed until a frame building was finished at Fourth Avenue and Main Street... Later he moved to First Avenue and Main Street and, in 1893, he moved to Second Avenue and Yesler Way. There the store still stands.\n\nShootout at Second and Yesler\nThe G.O. Guy drugstore at the corner of Second Avenue and Yesler Way in Seattle was the site of an infamous shootout in 1901.Seattle police chief William L. Meredith had been fired for corruption as part of a feud with \"box house\" owner John Considine. John Considine owned the People's Theater, a \"box house,\" offering light entertainment \"such as magic acts, singing, dancing, minstrel shows,\" but also providing sexual services. Their feud had led to Meredith's resignation under pressure.Meredith, out of a job, came gunning for Considine. After Meredith got off a couple of wild shots, Considine's brother Tom Considine managed to grab a gun and use it as a club to fracture Meredith's skull; John Considine shot Meredith in the heart. The struggle lasted about 90 seconds altogether. The Considines were ultimately acquitted for the killing.\n\nLocations\nLocations included, but not limited to:\n\nSecond Avenue and Yesler Way \n725 3rd Avenue, also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Columbia \n1401 3rd Avenue in the Mann Building  also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Union, opposite the post office \n406 Broadway East, also described as corner Broadway and Harrison  and as 406 North Broadway \n4501 University Way \n4700 California Avenue SW \n2238 Market Street \n4002 Roosevelt Way \n518 Queen Anne Avenue \n1928 3rd Avenue, also described as corner of 3rd Avenue and Virginia Street in the Security Market Building \n1024 Madison Street \n4002 10th Ave NE at north end of University Bridge \n4727 California Avenue SW \n427 2nd Avenue South \n3600 South Village Mall \n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nBay Lake, Florida\nBay Lake is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 29 at the 2020 census. It is named after a lake that lies east of the Magic Kingdom. All four of the Walt Disney World Resort theme parks, and one of Walt Disney World's two water parks, are in Bay Lake, though all Disney parks in the region have mailing addresses in nearby Lake Buena Vista.\nBay Lake is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District) which also includes Walt Disney World, the other being Lake Buena Vista. The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\nChapter 67-1104 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the city of Bay Lake, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, or RCID), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1965 (incorporating the City of Reedy Creek). It was and still is located fully inside the RCID, and all its duties have been taken care of by the RCID. As fully described in Reedy Creek Improvement District, the city has always been controlled by the Walt Disney Company and has allowed them powers that other area attractions have not had.\nChapter 69-836 of the Laws of Florida, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries to exclude the easternmost part of Bay Lake. Chapter 69–1527, which became a law the same day, completely moved the city of Reedy Creek, with the land given up by Bay Lake included in the new city. Since then, Bay Lake has expanded to fill the original RCID west of Bonnet Creek, but the Reedy Creek Improvement District has expanded to include new land not in the city.\nThe RCID had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities were incorporated inside of it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \"community of the future\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park. The later Celebration, Florida was deannexed from the city and the RCID in 1994 so the Walt Disney Company would not lose control of the district. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a community on the north shore of Bay Lake (on Bay Court). The only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, rights-of-way for state and county roads, and five five-acre (2.0 ha) lots owned by senior Disney employees to give them voting power in the Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\nGeography and climate\nBay Lake is located at 28°23′29″N 81°34′0″W (28.391502, –81.566659).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59.1 km2), of which 21.5 square miles (55.7 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.5 km2) (5.86%) is water.The principal border that divides the cities of Lake Buena Vista to the east and Bay Lake to the west is the canal called Bonnet Creek, adjacent to Bonnet Creek Parkway. Most of the attractions associated with the Walt Disney World Resort are actually located within the City of Bay Lake, including all four theme parks.\nThe only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Bay Court, a street which, in 1987, was a dirt road. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the city. The population density was 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.4/km2). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 0.5 per square mile (0.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was twenty-two whites (95.7%) and one African American (4.3%). None of the people in Bay Lake were Asian, Native American or Hispanics or Latinos.\nThere were nine households in Bay Lake, out of which three had children under the age of 18 living with them, five had married couples living together, one had a female householder with no husband present, and three of the households were non-families. Three households were made up of individuals, and one consisted of someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.00.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $86,288, and the median income for a family was $86,288. Males had a median income of $76,284 versus $21,667 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,731. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.\nBecause of Bay Lake statistics, legislators have to be careful not to use the words \"maximum\" and \"average\" in the computations used for the State of Florida's 2007 property tax reform debate.  For example, in 2006 the \"per capita levy\" of property tax in Bay Lake was $176,230.  Since the statewide average that year was $475, legislators have had to be careful to distinguish the phrase \"average savings\" from the phrase \"savings by the average taxpayer.\"In 2010 Bay Lake had a population of 47.  The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 72.3% white, 6.4% Asian, 4.3% of two or more races and 17.0% Hispanic or Latino.\n\nPoints of interest\nWalt Disney World:\nMagic Kingdom\nDisney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground\nMagnolia and Palm Golf Courses\nDisney's BoardWalk Resort\nEpcot\nDisney's Animal Kingdom\nDisney's Blizzard Beach\nDisney's Hollywood Studios\nESPN Wide World of Sports Complex\nDisney's Animal Kingdom Lodge\nStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District has its Fire Department Emergency Services station in Bay Lake (it has a Lake Buena Vista postal address).\n\nEducation\nResidents of Bay Lake (Bay Court) are zoned to schools in the Orange County Public Schools:\nBay Lake Elementary SchoolIt opened in 2016, relieving Horizon West area elementary schools and making it one of three schools to open that year in the county. Myrlene Kimble was the school's first principal. The 94,279-square-foot (8,758.8 m2) building, with a capacity of 837 students, is on a 15-acre (6.1 ha) property. In fall 2016 it had 785 students. Its design is similar to that of Independence Elementary School.\nBridgewater Middle School\nWindermere High SchoolFormerly it was zoned to the following:\n\nIndependence Elementary School (prior to 2016)\nWindermere Elementary School\nLakeview Middle School\nWest Orange High School (prior to 2017)\nPassage 7:\nRay's Splash Planet\nRay's Splash Planet (often referred to as Ray's) is a Mecklenburg County, North Carolina funded water park located in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. The aquatic facility is operated by the Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation department. Ray's Splash Planet is considered one of the largest indoor water parks in both of the Carolinas and is the largest water park in Charlotte, North Carolina, with over 29,000 square feet of space and using over 117,000 gallons of water at 87 degrees. The water is cleaned and sanitized through the use of chlorine, filtration and an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation system. There are multiple attractions including the Blue Comet, a three-story figure 8 slide, and other family friendly attractions like the Orbiter, Saturation Station, the Vortex, Meteor Showers, Moon Beach and the Sea of Tranquility. The water park also features a fitness center and gymnasium shared with the Irwin Academic Center, an educational center of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system. The first floor of the facility includes the pool area, locker rooms, birthday party classrooms and concessions stand. The second story includes the fitness center with an aerobics/dance studio. Access to the indoor gymnasium is also located on the second floor. Ray's Splash Planet is located on North Sycamore Street near Johnson & Wales University and is just off Interstate 77 in North Carolina in the Third Ward section of Uptown Charlotte.  The water park opened on October 15, 2002 with help from Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation's partnership with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Major competitors are Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina, Great Wolf Lodge in Concord, North Carolina and Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nHistory\nIn 1994, a plan was suggested to turn the Irwin Avenue Elementary School into a new recreation center. Extensive renovation of the gymnasium followed the approval of a 1995 park bond referendum, and the (basketball) gymnasium opened to the public in 1998 as the Irwin Avenue Recreation Center. The referendum also allowed for design for one of the first indoor water parks in the Southeast. Land for the water park was available on the Irwin Elementary campus, adjacent to a natural creek that is park of the Mecklenburg County greenway system and that connects surrounding neighborhoods. The architect firm Clark/Nexsen designed the water park facilities, emphasizing the movement of water and incorporating the nearby natural creek as its design. The $7.5 million project had its groundbreaking in March 2001. Physically attached to the Irwin Academic Center (previously known as Irwin Avenue Elementary) through the shared space of the gymnasium, Ray's Splash Planet opened on October 15, 2002. Since 2002, Ray's Splash Planet has won numerous awards and accolades for being a feature attraction for local residents from the Charlotte Observer newspaper, Creative Loafing and Charlotte Parent magazines.\n\nRides and attractions\nSee also\nList of waterparks\nPassage 8:\nAshland/63rd station\nAshland/63rd is an 'L' station and the terminal of the CTA Green Line's Ashland branch, located in the West Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Situating at 6315 S. Ashland Avenue, the station contains a Park 'n' ride lot with 235 spaces as well as a Kiss 'n' Ride lane. This is one of two stations on the Green Line to be named Ashland. The other station is on the Lake Street branch and is shared between the Green and Pink Lines. The Red Line served this station from May 19, 2013 to October 20, 2013, April 3, 2017 to November 22, 2017, and July 30, 2018 to April 26, 2019.\n\nHistory\nLoomis\nLoomis was a station on the Englewood branch of the Chicago \"L\". Although other stations on the Englewood branch opened in stages, the station opened on July 13, 1907, concluding overall construction of the branch. Despite improvements to the station, it was closed in 1969 when the new Ashland/63rd station opened two blocks west.\n\nAshland/63rd\nThe Ashland/63rd station opened on May 6, 1969 to replace the Loomis station. Though the station itself was not rebuilt during the course of the Green Line renovation in 1994-96, an elevator was added to the station to make it accessible to passengers with disabilities.\n\nBus connections\nCTA\n\n 9 Ashland (Owl Service) \n X9 Ashland Express (Weekday Rush Hours only) \n 63 63rd  (Owl Service)\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nAshland (CTA Green and Pink Lines station)\nAshland (CTA Orange Line station)\nAshland Yard\nPassage 9:\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe (often simply referred to as Wet 'n Wild or Emerald Pointe) is a water park located in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, and part of the Wet 'n Wild chain. There are 40 rides and attractions, including 5 pools, 2 children's areas, and one of the largest wave pools in the country. The Themed Entertainment Association has ranked the park 20th in North America in terms of attendance, of which they had 407,000 visitors as of 2015. Major regional competitors are Carowinds' Carolina Harbor in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dollywood's Splash Waterpark in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nHistory\nOriginally named Aqua Gardens, the park opened in September 1983. From 1984 to 1986, it used the name Water Country USA. In 1986, it was purchased by a local company and renamed Emerald Pointe. In March 1999 Ogden Corp purchased the property, along with Raging Waters and Wet 'n Wild's assets, and renamed the park Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe. In 2019, the newest attraction \"Bombs Away\" was revealed at the end of the season to the public and was originally slated to open for the 2020 season. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, it has been delayed to open for the 2022 Season.\n\nRides and attractions\nCurrent attractions\nFormer attractions\nSee also\nWet 'n Wild (brand)\nPassage 10:\nHat 'n' Boots\nHat 'n' Boots is a roadside attraction and landmark in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

Also commonly known as black fruit wolfberry, siyah goji, and kaokee, it is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family which can be found in Central Asia, southern part of Russia, throughout Northwest China, Northern India and Pakistan.\n\nDescription\nThe species is either 1.8 centimetres (0.71 in), 20–50 centimetres (7.9–19.7 in), 20–150 centimetres (7.9–59.1 in), or 180 centimetres (71 in) tall. The leaves are either 5–30 millimetres (0.20–1.18 in), 0.6–2.5 centimetres (0.24–0.98 in), or 6–25 millimetres (0.24–0.98 in) by 1–1.5 millimetres (0.039–0.059 in). It have 2-4 sepals each one of which is bell-shaped and 3–4 millimetres (0.12–0.16 in) long. Pedicels are either 5–10 millimetres (0.20–0.39 in) long or can be as long as it sepals. The calyx is 2.5–3.5 millimetres (0.098–0.138 in) long but can be companulate and exceed 4–5 millimetres (0.16–0.20 in). Corolla's tube is 5–7 millimetres (0.20–0.28 in) long with stamens have 5–8 millimetres (0.20–0.31 in) long berries (which can sometimes grow up to 9 millimetres (0.35 in)) which are also broad and globose. The fruits' seeds are brown coloured and are 1.5–2 millimetres (0.059–0.079 in) long. The flowering time is June to August but can sometimes bloom in May too. Fruits mature from August to October.\n\nDistribution and uses\nIn India, it grows in Nubra Valley where it is used by native people to cure blindness in camels. In Central Asia and Northwest China the species grows on elevation of 400–3,000 metres (1,300–9,800 ft) in saline deserts, sands and roadsides.\nPassage 2:\nCrocosmia aurea\nCrocosmia aurea, common names falling stars, Valentine flower, or montbretia, is a perennial  flowering plant belonging to the family Iridaceae.\n\nEtymology\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, \nmeaning \"odor\", as dried leaves of these plants, when immersed in hot water, emit a strong smell similar to saffron. The species Latin name aurea, meaning “golden”, refers to the bright colour of the flowers.\n\nDescription\nCrocosmia aurea reaches on average 120 centimetres (47 in) in height. It grows from basal underground corms with long stolons. The basal, alternate leaves are cauline, linear, with a distinct midvein and entire margins, about 20–30 millimetres (0.79–1.18 in) wide. At the end of the flower stalk they have colourful branched inflorescences of bright orange to red flowers, reaching on average 40 millimetres (1.6 in) in diameter. The flowering period extends from June through August. The fruit is a capsule, with small blackish and round seeds. The plant can also be propagated by dividing the clumps of corms, fleshy underground stems similar to bulbs.\n\nDistribution\nCrocosmia aurea is widely distributed in southern and eastern Africa, from South Africa to Sudan. In South Africa it is common in the grasslands of the Cape Floristic Region.\n\nHabitat\nUsually these plants live in large colonies in shady forests and in banks of the rivers. They prefer moist habitats, at an altitude of 0–2,000 metres (0–6,562 ft) above sea level..\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nCrocosmia\nCrocosmia (;), also known as montbretia (), is a small genus of flowering plants in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan. One species is endemic to Madagascar.\n\nDescription\nThey can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms. The alternate leaves are cauline and ensiform (sword shaped). The blades are parallel-veined. The margin is entire. The corms form in vertical chains with the youngest at the top and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden.\nThey have colourful inflorescences of 4 to 20 vivid red and orange subopposite flowers on a divaricately (horizontally) branched stem. The terminal inflorescence can have the form of a cyme or a raceme. These flower from early summer well into fall. The flowers are sessile on a flexuose arched spike. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. All stamens have an equal length. The style branches are apically forked. They are pollinated by insects, birds (sunbirds) or by the wind. The dehiscent capsules are shorter than they are wide.\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, meaning \"odor\" – from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from Crocus – another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) – when immersed in hot water.The alternative name montbretia is still widely used, especially for the garden hybrid C. × crocosmiiflora.  \"Montbretia\" commonly used in the British Isles for orange-flowered C. × crocosmiiflora cultivars that have naturalised, while \"crocosmia\" is reserved for less aggressive red-flowered cultivars.  Montebretia is a heterotypic synonym of the genus Tritonia in which some species of Crocosmia were once included.  It was named by Alire Raffeneau Delile for Ernest Coquebert de Montbret, a fellow French botanist on Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign.\n\nSpecies\nSpecies accepted by World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\nCrocosmia ambongensis (H.Perrier) Goldblatt & J.

It has 27 pairs of chromosomes. A perennial flowering plant, it has leaves between 3–5 cm in length and flower heads that are 3–4.5 cm with white petals. Typically, flowering occurs in October to December annually. It the floral emblem of Hyōgo Prefecture.\n\nDistribution\nCurrently it is classified as semi-endangered. Native only in Japan. It is naturally found in Shikoku (coastal area of Kochi prefecture and Ehime prefecture).\n\nIndustrial uses\nIt is used in the manufacture of nojigiku alcohol.\nPassage 5:\nWolffia arrhiza\nWolffia arrhiza is a species of flowering plant known by the common names spotless watermeal and rootless duckweed, belonging to the Araceae, a family rich in water-loving species, such as Arum and Pistia. It is the smallest vascular plant on Earth. It is native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is present in other parts of the world as a naturalized species.\n\nDescription\nWolffia arrhiza is an aquatic plant which grows in quiet water bodies such as ponds. The green part of the plant, the frond, is a sphere measuring about 1 mm wide, but with a flat top that floats at the water's surface. It has a few parallel rows of stomata. There is no root. The plant produces a minute flower fully equipped with one stamen and one pistil. It often multiplies by vegetative reproduction, however, with the rounded part budding off into a new individual. In cooler conditions the plant becomes dormant and sinks to the bed of the water body to overwinter as a turion. The plant is a mixotroph which can produce its own energy by photosynthesis or absorb it from the environment in the form of dissolved carbon.\n\nHuman uses\nThis tiny plant is a nutritious food. Its green part is about 40% protein by dry weight and its turion is about 40% starch. It contains many amino acids important to the human diet, relatively large amounts of dietary minerals and trace elements such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and vitamin B12. It has long been used as a cheap food source in Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, where it is known as khai-nam (\"eggs of the water\").  The plant is prolific in its reproduction, growing in floating mats that can be harvested every 3 to 4 days; it has been shown to double its population in less than four days in vitro.It is also useful as a form of agricultural and municipal water treatment. It is placed in effluent from black tiger shrimp farms to absorb and metabolize pollutants. The plants grow quickly and take up large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. The plants that grow in the wastewater can then be used as feed for animals, such as carp, Nile tilapia, and chickens.\nPassage 6:\nActaea racemosa\nActaea racemosa, the black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, rattle-top, or fairy candle (syn. Cimicifuga racemosa), is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. The roots and rhizomes were used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Most dietary supplements containing black cohosh are not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease. In contrast, some herbal medicinal products containing black cohosh extract hold a marketing authorization in several states of the European Union and are well-studied and recommended for safe and effective use for the relief of menopausal symptoms (i.e. in the years around menopause) such as hot flushes and profuse sweating attacks. Such differentiation between the product types seems to be important.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe plant species has a history of taxonomic uncertainty. Carl Linnaeus, on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds, placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, is not closely related to black cohosh, and may be unsafe if used together.\n\nDescription\nBlack cohosh is a smooth (glabrous) herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, compound leaves from an underground rhizome, reaching a height of 25–60 cm (9.8–23.6 in). The basal leaves are up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and broad, forming repeated sets of three leaflets (tripinnately compound) having a coarsely toothed (serrated) margin.\nThe flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on a tall stem, 75–250 cm (30–98 in) tall, forming racemes up to 50 cm (20 in) long. The flowers have no petals or sepals, and consist of tight clusters of 55–110 white, 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long stamens surrounding a white stigma. The flowers have a distinctly sweet, fetid smell that attracts flies, gnats, and beetles.The fruit is a dry follicle 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long, with one carpel, containing several seeds.\n\nCultivation\nA. racemosa grows in dependably moist, fairly heavy soil. It bears tall tapering racemes of white midsummer flowers on wiry black-purple stems, whose mildly unpleasant, medicinal smell at close range gives it the common name \"Bugbane\". The drying seed heads stay handsome in the garden for many weeks. Its deeply cut, superficially maple-like leaves, burgundy colored in the variety \"atropurpurea\", add interest to gardens, wherever summer heat and drought do not make it die back, which make it a popular garden perennial. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The plant was Virginia Native Plant Society’s 2017 wildflower of the year.\n\nTraditional medicine\nHistory\nNative Americans used black cohosh in the belief it could treat gynecological and other disorders. Following the arrival of European settlers in the U.S. who continued the use of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia under the name \"black snakeroot\". In the 19th century, the root was used to treat snakebite, inflamed lungs, and pain from childbirth.\n\nHerbalism\nExtracts from the underground parts of the plant — the rhizome (Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma) and the root (Cimicifugae racemosae radix) — are used in herbal medicine. The rhizomes and roots contain various saponins (triterpene saponins and triterpene glycosides, such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids.In most European countries, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Argentina and some other countries, black cohosh products are available as herbal products which have been approved by regulatory authorities ensuring reliable pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy for the relief of menopausal complaints such as hot flushes and profuse sweating. In the U.S., India, and some other countries, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement marketed mainly to women for treating menopausal symptoms and other gynecological problems. Meta-analyses of contemporary evidence support these claims on menopausal complaints only for products holding a marketing authorization for this indication, whereas there is no high-quality scientific evidence to support such uses for other products.\n\nSafety concerns\nThe Herbal Medicinal Product Committee (HMPC) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has summarized the adverse drug reactions of herbal medicines made from cimicifuga with mentioning allergic skin reactions (urticaria, itching, exanthema), facial oedema and peripheral oedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. dyspeptic disorders, diarrhoea).Studies on the long-term safety of using herbal medicines made from black cohosh are available. They do not show harmful effects on breast tissue, endometrium, or breast cancer survivors. In contrast, such studies have not been published for dietary supplements made from black cohosh. Most black cohosh materials are harvested from the wild. Lack of proper authentication and adulteration of commercial preparations by other plant species are risk factors in dietary supplements and a critical matter of quality control in herbal medicinal products holding a marketing authorization. Very high doses of black cohosh may cause nausea, dizziness, visual effects, a lower heart rate, and increased perspiration.Worldwide, some 83 cases of liver damage, including hepatitis, liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes, have been associated with using black cohosh, although a cause-and-effect relationship remains undefined. Millions of women have taken black cohosh without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials found no evidence that black cohosh preparations had adverse effects on liver function. Package leaflets of phytomedicines made from black cohosh caution that people with liver problems should not take it, although a 2011 meta-analysis of research evidence suggested this concern may be unfounded. In 2007, the Australian Government warned that black cohosh may cause liver damage, although rarely, and should not be used without medical supervision. Other studies concluded that liver damage from use of black cohosh is unlikely. The clinical picture is similar to an autoimmune hepatitis with centrilobular liver cell necrosis, which can be treated with corticosteroids.\n\nPhytochemicals and pharmacology\nThe rhizomes and roots of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa rhizoma) contain diverse phytochemicals, particularly various saponins (triterpene saponins/triterpene glycosides such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids. The pharmacologically active substance comprises the total extract. In the past, estrogen-like properties were attributed to preparations from this herbal drug. However, formonetin—a phytoestrogen compound (isoflavone)—could only be detected in methanolic extracts and was not found in ethanolic or isopropanolic cimicifuga extracts. Today, an estrogen-like mechanism of action can be ruled out. Regarding the alleviation of menopausal symptoms, central nervous activity was suspected as early as 2003, and it has since been confirmed with preclinical and clinical data.\n\nSee also\nCaffeic acid\nFerulic acid\nList of unproven and disproven cancer treatments\nPhenylpropanoids\nTriterpenoids\nPassage 7:\nCrocosmia paniculata\nCrocosmia paniculata is a bulbous flowering plant that is native to eastern South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini, growing in wet areas by streams, marshes, and drainages. Plants reach 4 to 5 ft (1.2–1.5 m) tall, with lanceolate leaves and deep orange to orange-brown flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant.The plant has escape cultivation and become established in the wild in parts of the United Kingdom.The common name Aunt Eliza is derived from the former generic name Antholyza.In Lesotho, where it is native, the plant is used by the indigenous Sotho people as an antidiarrhoeal remedy, administered not only to humans, but also to cattle so afflicted.\nPassage 8:\nCimicifuga\nCimicifuga (bugbane or cohosh) was a genus of between 12 and 18 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe genus is now generally included in Actaea.The name Cimicifuga means 'bedbug repeller'.\n\nSelected species\nCimicifuga americana\nCimicifuga arizonica\nCimicifuga biternata\nCimicifuga brachycarpa\nCimicifuga dahurica - Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: 升麻; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga elata\nCimicifuga europaea\nCimicifuga foetida\nCimicifuga heracleifolia - both used in TCM as Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: 升麻; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga japonica\nCimicifuga laciniata\nCimicifuga nanchuanensis\nCimicifuga racemosa\nCimicifuga rubifolia\nCimicifuga simplex\nCimicifuga yunnanensis\n\nIn pharmacology\nCimicifugae rhizoma - pharmacological term in herbal medicine (Cimicifuga/Actea root), translated as Sheng ma, Chinese herb\nPassage 9:\nActaea arizonica\nActaea arizonica is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name Arizona bugbane. It is endemic to Arizona in the United States, where it occurs in Coconino, Gila, and Yavapai Counties. Like some other species in genus Actaea, this plant was formerly included in the genus Cimicifuga.This rhizomatous perennial herb produces hairless stems up to 1.5 to 2 meters tall. The leaves are each made up of triple-lobed, toothed leaflets up to 17.5 centimeters long by 12.5 wide. They are borne on long petioles up to 35 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a panicle with several long branches, growing erect or leaning. The flowers have five sepals, two of which are greenish and three of which are cream in color. There are sometimes white petals as well, but these are often absent. Flowering occurs in July and August. There are many stamens in each flower. The flowers are pollinated by three species of bumblebee, Bombus occidentalis, Bombus morrisoni, and Bombus huntii. If the flowers are not pollinated by insects, or if pollination is prevented, for example, by a heavy rain, the flowers undergo abortion. The fruit is a follicle that has \"a bottle-brush appearance,\" and \"the seeds resemble furry little bugs.\"This plant is endemic to central Arizona, where it grows in the ecotone between coniferous forest and the riparian zone. The elevation is about 5300–7000 feet. Some plants grow in canyons and some grow in very moist habitat such as seeps and springs on mountain slopes. The soils are rich with humus and are well-shaded. The type locality is Bill Williams Mountain in Coconino County. It shares its habitat with the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida).\nPassage 10:\nActaea elata\nActaea elata (syn. Cimicifuga elata) is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name tall bugbane. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it can be found in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.\n\nDescription\nThis species is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial reaching a maximum height around 1.8 meters. It is hairy in texture, with some glandular hairs. The leaves are made up of many lobed, toothed leaflets which resemble maple leaves in shape. The inflorescence is a branching panicle up to 17 centimeters long. The panicle bears many flowers, each with five white or pink-tinged sepals, but no petals. The flower presents a spray of long white stamens. Blooming occurs from May or June to August. The fruit is a flattened follicle up to 1.2 centimeters long. The fruits are poisonous. The plant has an unpleasant scent.\n\nHabitat\nThis species grows in moist woods and forest habitat. It is mostly restricted to lower elevations and is more common on north-facing slopes. It is associated with the forest trees Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), red alder (Alnus rubra), and vine maple (Acer circinatum), and other forest plants such as oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Alpine enchanter's nightshade (Circaea alpina), herb robert (Geranium robertianum), and wall lettuce (Lactuca muralis) are indicator species for the plant, often growing alongside it. This species can dominate the forest understory where it is common. The plant may be found in old-growth forests. It prefers the shade of dense forests. It can tolerate some breaks in the canopy but not large-scale clearing, such as clearcutting. Some penetrating sunlight is beneficial for the plant during its reproductive season. Animals associated with the species include the mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), particularly in Canada. Depending on location, pollinators of the plant include bumblebees, other types of bees, beetles, and syrphid flies.\n\nDistribution\nThis species has a limited distribution in its range. Most occurrences are in southern Oregon, where the populations can be large. There are fewer occurrences in Washington. In British Columbia, the plant is only known from the far southern regions of the province, near the Chilliwack River. It is considered an endangered species in British Columbia. There are ten known populations in British Columbia, making up less than 5% of the global population of the plant.In 2004 a new variety of the species was named and defined, var. alpestris. This variety is endemic to southern Oregon and it differs from other members of its species by having scales along the lower stem, and often more pistils. It may also be found at higher elevations.Threats to this species include processes that threaten its home ecosystems, such as the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. Fire suppression, logging, road maintenance, and other forest disturbance, collection from the wild, and damage to pollinator populations can harm occurrences of the plant.", "answers": ["Crocosmia"], "length": 3863, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b55bff6ef6f22a2c6dee6ff372eca9a460934b1b09868ee9"}

His father was the eldest son of Lord George Cavendish (later created, in 1831, the 1st Earl of Burlington, by the second creation), third son of the 4th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Charlotte Boyle, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork. His mother was the daughter of the 1st Baron Lismore.\nHe was educated at Eton and the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), attaining the position of Second Wrangler and the Smith's Prize for mathematics. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Cavendish of Keighley in 1831 when the earldom of Burlington was revived in favour of his grandfather.\n\nCareer\nCavendish was returned to parliament as the MP for Cambridge University in 1829, a seat he held until July 1831, when he was returned for Malton. He only sat for Malton until September of the same year and was out of the House of Commons until 1832, when he was returned for North Derbyshire. He succeeded his grandfather in the earldom of Burlington in 1834 and entered the House of Lords. In 1858, he also succeeded his cousin as Duke of Devonshire. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1857 to 1891 and Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1858 to 1891.Devonshire was Chancellor of the University of London from 1836 to 1856, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1861 to 1891, and Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1880 to 1891. At Cambridge he endowed the Cavendish Professorship of Physics, and the building of the Cavendish Laboratory. He made vast (and ultimately unsuccessful) investments in heavy industry at Barrow-in-Furness, and had his nearby country house Holker Hall rebuilt in its present form after it was gutted by a fire in 1871. He was one of the original founders of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1839, and was president in 1870. On 26 July 1871, he was nominated a trustee of the British Museum.The 7th Duke inherited a considerable amount of property in Eastbourne from his grandfather, and from his wife Elizabeth Compton of Compton Place. He saw through the development of Eastbourne in the 19th century with its parks, baths and squares and is commemorated by a statue at the top of Devonshire Place. The Duke also played a part in the foundation of Eastbourne College, the local private school, by selling some of his land at a modest price to build the school on and commissioning respected architect Henry Currey to design the school chapel and College House (now the School House, a boarding facility).\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1829, Devonshire married Blanche Georgiana Howard (1812–1840), daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle, and the former Lady Georgiana Cavendish, sister of the 6th Duke of Devonshire, known as the \"Bachelor Duke\".  Blanche was the Bachelor Duke's favourite niece, and his fondness for the young couple who were his heirs may have contributed to his decision not to marry himself. He commemorated Blanche with an inscription in the Painted Hall at Chatsworth, which states that he completed his reconstruction of the house in the year of his bereavement, 1840, and by Blanche's Urn at the top of the Long Walk in the garden. Together, Blanche and William were the parents of five children:\n\nWilliam Cavendish, Lord Cavendish of Keighley (1831–1834), who died 6 days after the death of his great-grandfather\nSpencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire (1833–1908), who married Countess Louisa von Alten on 16 August 1892.\nLady Louisa Caroline Cavendish (1835–1907), who married Adm.

In 1920, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s.At the 1929 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches.\nWith the formation of a National Government in August 1931, the parliamentary Labour Party was divided into two factions, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated along with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success.Earlier in 1931, Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954–1955.With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Oldfield attempted to rejoin the armed forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant.In 1953, he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington, Kent. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964, he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981.He died in Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving the House of Commons.

A steam George V class railway engine was named in his honour by the LNWR.\nPassage 9:\nDevonshire Club\nThe Devonshire Club was a London gentlemen's club which was established in 1874 and was disbanded in 1976. Throughout its existence it was based at 50 St James's Street. The major Liberal club of the day was the Reform Club, but in the wake of the 1868 Reform Act's extension of the franchise, the waiting list for membership from the larger electorate grew to such an extent that a new club was formed to accommodate these new Liberal voters. The clubhouse was on the western side of St James's Street. The original intention was to call it the 'Junior Reform Club', along the model of the Junior Carlton Club formed in 1866, but complaints from the Reform Club's members led it to being named the Devonshire, in honour of its first chairman, the Duke of Devonshire, an aristocrat from a long line of Liberals.\nThe club was fortunate in obtaining the St James's Street premises of Crockford's Club, a renowned eighteenth century club which had closed down in 1845. The Devonshire did well in its first decade, but found itself in an awkward position from the 1880s upon the establishment of the National Liberal Club. With a further extension of the franchise in 1885, the much larger National Liberal was aimed at these new electors, and the Devonshire came to possess neither the prestige of Brooks's or the Reform, nor the broader appeal of the National Liberal. The Devonshire soon lost its political flavour.\nIn the 1960s the Golfers Club shared the premises using a club room at the back of the building and there was also a Masonic temple on site, catering for those lodges without premises.\nAfter a great deal of financial trouble in the 1970s (mirrored in many other clubs of the time, including the Reform, the Carlton, the St James's, the United University, the Junior Carlton, the Army and Navy, and the United Service Club), it finally closed in 1976, with its membership being absorbed by the East India Club.\n\nFurther reading\nHenry Turner Waddy, The Devonshire Club and Crockford's (E.

{"input": "What is the capitol of the district that also includes the village of Shienga?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBenicia Capitol State Historic Park\nBenicia Capitol State Historic Park is a state park in Benicia, California. The park is dedicated to California’s third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853 to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remains. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city's main street also includes a carriage house, workers' quarters and sculptured gardens.\n\nHistory\nFollowing large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early 1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and \"the insecure condition of the public archives\" arose in January 1854.\nAfter a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters. \"So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,\" the Sacramento Union reported, \"that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500.\" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971.\n\nPresent day\nThe original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits. The interior includes a reconstruction of the building's original floor with ponderosa pine. The desks, four of which are from the 1850s or earlier, are furnished with a candlestick, a 19th-century newspaper, a quill pen, blotting sand, a spitoon, and a top hat.\n\nThe historic park is located at 115 West G Street in Benicia, a city in the northern San Francisco Bay Area between San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay.\nOn February 16, 2000, the California State Legislature met in the old Capitol in a symbolic session to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Legislature's first meeting.\n\nProposed for closure\nThe Benicia Capitol State Historic Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program, since rescinded following public outcry. It also was placed on the Governor's list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown's 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L.

The film's script was written by Michon with her husband W. Bruce Cameron. It is based on her 2004 novel The Grrl Genius Guide to Sex (With Other People), which was partially based on her life. Muffin Top was Michon's second directorial effort, after 2007's Cook Off!, though that film would not be released until 2017. The film stars Michon as a woman who must re-enter the dating world after her husband (played by Diedrich Bader) leaves her for a younger woman. It had its world debut on October 18, 2014 at the Carmel International Film Festival. Distribution for the film was handled by the on-demand movie distribution website Tugg, which allowed Michon to show her film in areas with high enough demand. Muffin Top was also released via VOD.\n\nPlot\nSuzanne (Cathryn Michon) is a professor of Women's Studies Pop Culture at Malibu University. On her birthday her husband Michael (Diedrich Bader) surprises her by saying that he's divorcing her in favor of his co-worker Jessica (Haylie Duff), prompting her to go on a quest to find herself.\n\nCast\nCathryn Michon as Suzanne Nicholson\nMarissa Jaret Winokur as Elise\nDiedrich Bader as Michael Nicholson\nJill Holden as Dr. Nadja Borman\nHaylie Duff as Jessica\nJane Morris as Dr. Khalsa\nWayne Federman as Hayes Greenberg\nMichael Hawley as Jarod\nDot-Marie Jones as Christina\nCristine Rose as Deborah\nMelissa Peterman as Kim\nMichael Halpi as Barnaby\nGary Anthony Williams as Gregory David Gregory\nVictoria Bohush as Andrea\nDominique Dorian as Sophie\nDavid Arquette as Cameron Scott\nMeredith Scott Lynn as Katey\nTucker as BooBoo\n\nProduction\nFilming for Muffin Top took place in Hollywood, California over a four-week period with a budget of under $1 million. While choosing the film's music Michon decided to only use music composed by female performers and she has billed Muffin Top as the \"first rom-com to have an all-female soundtrack and score\" and as a \"body image romantic comedy\".\n\nReception\nCritical reception has been mixed. The Oakland Press wrote a favorable review for Muffin Top, stating that \"most readers have probably never heard of this movie, which I think is a shame.\" The Windy City Times commented upon the film's central focus on women, which they felt was \"one of the reasons The Babadook and why actor-writer-director Cathryn Michon's comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story are such refreshing finds.\"The Star Tribune wrote a mixed review, criticizing it for utilizing vignettes while also encouraging viewers to support the flawed lead heroine while laughing at her unbearable dates. However they also stated that while the film did not match up to female oriented films like Bridesmaids, it was also \"tolerably funny\" and deserved a B for effort. A reviewer for Chicagoist panned Muffin Top and included it in their \"worst of the year\" list, writing \"Made with obvious good intentions, the indie comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story has little else going for it. Its basic plea for women to not allow their self-esteem to be damaged by unrealistic, media-enforced notions of an ideal body is a welcome message. Unfortunately, it is delivered via a frequently irritating and laugh-free feature made almost bearable by some talented cast members.\"", "answers": ["My Boss, My Hero"], "length": 3547, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5938b467f1d6ee64c2bed583d2b845f3bc1a3ea06f8d4a5a"}

James Kennedy) as being the orchestrators of perpetual, institutionalized homophobia.

Their style is characterized by prominent usage of orchestral arrangements, black (sometimes death) metal vocals, and guitar riffs. Their studio albums are concept albums with lyrics based on ghost stories and folklore, such as the Flying Dutchman. The band sets itself apart from other symphonic black metal artists with the usage of multiple languages such as English, French, German, and Dutch. Most songs are based on English, with transitions into other languages during chorus and bridge sections.\nDrummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers quit the group in February 2020, leaving the band with two current members, singer Seregor and keyboardist Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers.\n\nName\nThe name \"Carach Angren\" is derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's  The Lord of the Rings and means \"Iron Jaws\" in the Elvish language of Sindarin. In the Tolkien universe, \"Carach Angren\", also called \"Isenmouthe\" (both meaning the same) is the name of a fortified pass into the plateau of Gorgoroth in North-Western Mordor.\n\nHistory\nCarach Angren was formed in 2003, in the Dutch municipality of Landgraaf, after two members of Vaultage, Lee Hartney and Inger Indolia, started a side project based on their shared love of legends and black metal. Eventually, Carach Angren was more successful, so both stepped down from Vaultage.\nIn 2004, Carach Angren released their first EP, The Chase Vault Tragedy. The EP is a concept album, telling the story of mysteriously moving coffins known as the Chase Vault Mystery. In 2005, the band released a second EP, Ethereal Veiled Existence, covering the story of the Brown Lady. In 2007, Carach Angren was signed to Maddening Media, a German independent record label. Carach Angren recorded their first full-length album for this label, Lammendam, which received positive international reviews following its release in 2008.Their second album, Death Came Through a Phantom Ship, was released on 26 February 2010.

This concept album covers themes surrounding war, including war, death, and suffering. \nOn 17 February 2015, the band's fourth album, This Is No Fairytale was available for streaming on Metal Hammer. The album was officially released on 23 February 2015. The album is a modern interpretation of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale with themes of domestic abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, sexual child abuse, suicide, child abduction and cannibalism.\nOn 16 June 2017, their fifth studio album, Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten, was released. This album diverges from the previous \"storytelling\" theme of the previous albums, but remains a concept album, with ghost themes, including the Blood Queen and Charles Francis Coghlan.On 10 February 2020, drummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers left the band. According to him, the departure was motivated by \"dissatisfaction with the music industry\". Seregor and Ardek posted the announcement on the band's official website, revealing that the exit was a friendly one, saying, \"Although we are very sorry for your departure, we respect your decision\".\nIn late 2019 the band announced they had begun work on a sixth studio album, scheduled to be released in mid-2020. Its name and release date were unveiled on 20 February 2020; Franckensteina Strataemontanus. The album is a concept album inspired by the life of Johann Konrad Dippel, and was released through Season of Mist on 26 June.\n\nBand members\nDiscography\nPassage 5:\nDance (Keller Williams album)\nDance is the seventh studio album by Keller Williams, released in 2003.

They released one EP in 1998, which was followed by Freedumb (1999), their first studio album in five years.

He had not written songs in 18 years, and as a result of listening to these tapes and getting enthused again, we got him back into it.\"In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Charles Bermant said, \"the best material here is the spirited and melodic 'new' songs, driven by Sal Valentino's pure voice and (former bassist) Declan Mulligan's spry lead guitar.\" \nBermant also noted Elliott's incorporation of bossa nova and reggae into the band's style.Allmusic writer Bruce Eder said that while Live! is a \"decent\" album, \"it isn't remotely the revelation that one would expect or wish for -- the producers might at least have been more honest by foregoing the exclamation point.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\"Nine Pound Hammer\" (Travis) — 3:52\n\"You Tell Me Why\" (Elliott) — 3:34\n\"Turn Around/Singing Cowboy\" (Elliott, Durand) — 8:01\n\"Gate of Hearts\" (Elliott) — 3:18\n\"Lonely People\" (Meagher) — 4:19\n\"Music Speaks Louder\" (Elliott) — 2:49\n\"Lisa\" (Mulligan) — 3:01\n\"Tennessee Walker\" (Elliott) — 4:34\n\"Don't Talk to Strangers\" (Elliott, Durand) — 2:21\n\"Laugh, Laugh\" (Elliott) — 3:15\n\"Lonesome Town\" (Elliott) — 3:09\n\"Free\" (Elliott, Engle) — 3:45\n\"Man and Woman Kind\" (Elliott, Engle) — 4:50\n\"Restless Soul\" (Elliott) — 3:29\n\"Her Dream Alley\" (Elliott) — 2:34\n\"City Girl\" (Elliott, Engle) — 3:29\n\"Paper Plane\" (Elliott) — 2:59\n\"Just a Little\" (Elliott, Durand) — 2:51\n\"Love Can Fall\" (Elliott, Engle) — 4:47\nPassage 10:\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten is the fifth studio album by Dutch symphonic black metal band Carach Angren. It was released on June 16, 2017 via Season of Mist. Although the album doesn't follow a linear story as their previous albums did, it is still a concept album. Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers describes the album's concept as visitations from multiple ghosts of the dead; including the \"Blood Queen\" and Charles Francis Coghlan. The full album is focused on a nameless girl who plays with a Ouija board causing her to raise a variety of spirits and ends up getting possessed. The album ends by informing the listener that the box the CD came in is haunted by these same spirits, and that by opening the album, the listener has also released them.\n\nTrack listing\nComposed by Ardek.\nGuitars written by Ardek (tracks 5 to 9) and Seregor (tracks 2 to 9).\nLyrics by Ardek (tracks 3, 5, 7 & 9) and Seregor (tracks 2, 4, 6 & 8)\nViolin written by Ardek (tracks 3 to 9)\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nCarach Angren\n\nDennis \"Seregor\" Droomers – guitar, sound effects, vocals, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nClemens \"Ardek\" Wijers – guitar, bass, keyboards, orchestral arrangements, orchestration, violin, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nIvo \"Namtar\" Wijers – drums, sound effectsAdditional musiciansPatrick Damiani – guitar, bass, guitar engineer\nNikos Mavridis – violin (tracks 3 to 9)TeamCostin Chioreanu – artwork, design\nJonas Kjellgren – mastering\nPeter Tägtgren – mixing, drum engineering\nSylvy Notermans – proof reading\nErik Wijnands – lyric consultant\n\nCharts", "answers": ["the Netherlands"], "length": 3287, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9ba6e5905bd2df894da4f773da7a85162463143e34f5f6d4"}
{"input": "What Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales created in 1906 covers suburbs like Alexandria?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the independent federal agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising federal Australian elections, by-elections and referendums.\n\nResponsibilities\nThe AEC's main responsibility is to conduct federal elections, by-elections and referendums. The AEC is also responsible for the maintenance of up-to-date electoral rolls, devising electorate boundaries, apportionments and redistributions. Under the Joint Roll Arrangements, the AEC maintains electoral rolls for the whole of Australia, other than Western Australia, which is used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to conduct their elections. The AEC publishes detailed election results and follows up electors who had failed to vote or who have voted multiple times in an election.\nThe AEC is also responsible for registering political parties intending to field candidates at federal elections, monitoring the activities of those political parties, including receiving returns from parties of donations and expenditures, and the publication of the information. The AEC also plays an electoral education role, aiming to educate citizens about the electoral process by which representatives are elected, and by which the Australian Constitution is changed (referendums). It also plays a role in industrial voting and protected action ballots (e.g., votes on industrial action).\nThe rules for federal elections are contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, while the rules for referendums are contained in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.\n\nRegistration of political parties\nThe formal registration of political parties in Australia commenced in New South Wales in 1981 and 1984 for the Commonwealth. The AEC is required to maintain a register of political parties. Such registration is required before a party can field candidates, receive public funding, have party identification on ballot papers and use above-the-line ticket voting.In all jurisdictions, conditions relating to a party name require party names to have a maximum of six words, not be obscene and not to resemble the name of another, unrelated party, be likely to cause confusion with another party nor contain the word 'independent' or 'independent party'.\nAll Australian jurisdictions also have a minimum membership requirement, which differs widely, especially when compared with the total number of people enrolled in the jurisdiction. These range from 100 in the ACT and Tasmania, 200 in SA, 500 in Vic and WA, 1,500 for the Commonwealth and 750 in New South Wales. Four jurisdictions require a fee for registration: $500 for the Commonwealth, Victoria and the Northern Territory; and $2,000 for New South Wales.\n\nPublic funding of political parties\nSince 1984, Australian political parties have been publicly funded by the AEC. The objective of public funding is to reduce the influence of private money upon elections, and consequently, the influence of private money upon the shaping of public policy. After each election, the AEC distributes a set amount of money to each political party, per vote received. A candidate or Senate group needs 4% of the primary vote to be eligible for public funding.After the 2013 election, political parties and candidates received $58.1 million in election funding, with the funding rate being 248.800 cents per vote. The Liberal Party received $23.9 million, as part of the Coalition total of $27.2 million, while the Labor Party received $20.8 million. Other significant recipients were Australian Greens with $5.5 million, Palmer United Party with $2.3 million, and Liberal Democratic Party with $1.0 million.In 2016, $62.7 million was distributed, with the funding rate being 262.784 cents per vote.\n\nElectoral roll\nOne of the functions of the AEC is the maintenance of the electoral roll, which in some other countries are called electoral registers. In Australia voter registration is called \"enrolment\". The AEC maintains Australia's federal electoral roll, which is used for federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Australia has maintained a permanent federal electoral roll since 1908 and, by amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, enrolment has been compulsory for federal elections since 1924. The requirement to register then applied to \"British subjects\" over the age of 21.\nThough each state and territory also has its own electoral commission or office, voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. The federal roll also forms the basis of state (except in Victoria and Western Australia, which maintain their own rolls) and local electoral rolls.AEC registration covers federal, state and local voter registration. In Australia and in each state and territory, it is a legal offence to fail to vote (or, at the very least, attend a polling station and have one's name crossed off the roll) at any federal or state election, punishable by a nominal fine. The amount varies between federal and state elections. (The fine for not voting is currently A$75.00 in Victoria. This figure is indexed at the beginning of every financial year.) Usually people are issued with warnings when it is found that they have not voted, and they are given an opportunity to show cause. Acceptable reasons for not voting may include being in the accident department of a hospital, being ill (requires confirmation), being out of the country on election day, religious objections, being incarcerated, etc. \"I forgot\" is not considered acceptable and will incur a fine. Section 245 of the Electoral Act (Cwth) provides that if an elector has been asked the \"true reason\" for his failure to vote states that he did not do so because it was against his religion, this statement shall be regarded as conclusive, and no further action will be taken.\nTraditionally, voters cannot register within three weeks of an election. In 2004 the Howard government passed legislation that prevented registration after 8 pm on the day that the writs were issued (this can be up to 10 days after the election has been announced). This legislation was considered controversial by some Australians who contended it disenfranchised first-time voters or those who have forgotten to update their enrolment. The law was repealed just before the 2010 federal election, after advocacy group GetUp! obtained a High Court ruling that the changes were unconstitutional. 16 and 17 year olds can provisionally enrol and are able to vote when they turn 18.\n\nHistory and structure\nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 set up the framework for the Commonwealth electoral system, which was administered until 1916 as a branch of the Department of Home Affairs, then until 1928 by the Department of Home and Territories, back to Department of Home Affairs until 1932 and then Department of the Interior until 1972. The Australian Electoral Office was created in 1973 by the Australian Electoral Office Act 1973. On 21 February 1984 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was established as a Commonwealth statutory authority.\nThe AEC is answerable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament of Australia, and must report on how elections were carried out and the success of elections in general.\nThe AEC was created by and operates under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It consists of a chairman (a judge or a retired judge of the federal court), the electoral commissioner and a non-judicial member (usually the Australian Statistician). The electoral commissioner has the powers of a secretary of a department under the Public Service Act 1999 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998. The chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.\nEach House of Representatives electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for administration of elections within the division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for administration of Senate elections. The AEC has a National Office in Canberra and an office in each State and Territory: Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.\nAfter the loss of 1,400 ballots during the recount for the 2013 Western Australia Senate election and the subsequent 2014 special election, the AEC came under significant scrutiny, leading to the resignation of Commissioner Ed Killesteyn.\n\nList of Australian Electoral Commissioners\nSee also\nAlbert Langer\nElectoral system of Australia\nCompulsory voting\nGetup Ltd v Electoral CommissionerElectoral commissions of each state and self governing territory:\n\nAustralian Capital Territory Electoral Commission\nNew South Wales Electoral Commission\nNorthern Territory Electoral Commission\nElectoral Commission of Queensland\nElectoral Commission of South Australia\nTasmanian Electoral Commission\nVictorian Electoral Commission\nWestern Australian Electoral Commission\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nThe Australian Electoral Commission website\nThe Electoral Council of Australia and New Zealand website, the consultative council between the AEC, New Zealand, state and territory electoral authorities\nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918\nReferendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984\nPassage 2:\nDivision of Cook (1906–55)\nThe Division of Cook was an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1906 and abolished in 1955. The Division was named for James Cook, who explored the east coast of Australia in 1770. It was located in the inner suburbs of Sydney, taking in the suburbs of Alexandria, Redfern and Surry Hills. It has been a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, but in the 1930s and 1940s it was fiercely contested between Federal Labor and Lang Labor factions of the party.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nSee also\nDivision of Cook\nPassage 3:\nDivision of Lang\nThe Division of Lang was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, and was named after Rev. John Dunmore Lang, a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and advocate of Australian independence. It originally included the suburbs of Kogarah and Marrickville, but by the time it was abolished in 1977, it covered the suburbs of Lakemba and Belmore.  The Division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 75 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election.  It was held by the Labor Party for all but one term after 1928, and in its final form was very safe for that party.  It was abolished at the redistribution of 31 October 1977.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 4:\nDivision of Barrier\nThe Division of Barrier was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was named for the Barrier Ranges near the city of Broken Hill in western New South Wales. In 1901, it included Broken Hill, Wilcannia, White Cliffs and Tibooburra and the surrounding pastoral areas. In 1906, it gained Menindee, Wentworth from Riverina and in 1913, it gained Balranald and Deniliquin from Riverina. It was abolished in 1922 with Broken Hill, Wentworth and Balranald being transferred to Darling and Deniliquin transferred to Riverina. It was a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, although both its members left the ALP at the end their terms: Josiah Thomas to join the Nationalists, and Michael Considine (a radical socialist) to sit as an independent.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 5:\nDivision of Phillip\nThe Division of Phillip was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the Sydney's eastern suburbs, and was named after Captain Arthur Phillip, captain of the First Fleet and first Governor of New South Wales. The Division included the suburbs of Bondi, Coogee, Kensington and Randwick.\nThe Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 Federal election. It was abolished prior to the 1993 Federal election.  It was a marginal seat that from 1963 onward was held by the governing party of the day.\n\nMembers\n\n\n== Election results ==\nPassage 6:\nDivision of Bland\nThe Division of Bland was an Australian electoral division in New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was abolished in 1906. It was named for Dr William Bland, a New South Wales colonial politician. Based in rural southern New South Wales, it included the towns of Narrandera, Young, Wagga Wagga and West Wyalong. Bland was held by Chris Watson, the first Leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and Australia's first Labor Prime Minister. When Bland was abolished in 1906, Watson transferred to South Sydney.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 7:\nDivision of Riverina\nThe Division of Riverina is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.\nIt includes the city of Wagga Wagga.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election, although it was abolished between 1984 and 1993, so has not been contested at every federal election. The division was named after the Riverina region in which it is located, though its modern borders do not correspond exactly with the Riverina region. The division covers a primarily agricultural, rural area with many small towns.\nIn the 1984 redistribution, the division was abolished and replaced by Riverina-Darling, but in the 1993 redistribution it was re-created.\nSince its re-creation in 1993, it has been a safe Nationals seat. Its first incarnation tilted toward the Nationals' predecessor, the Country Party, for much of its history, but was occasionally taken by Labor during high-tide elections. It was fairly marginal for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, when it included the strongly pro-Labor mining towns of Broken Hill and Cobar which have now been transferred to Farrer and Parkes.\nThe division is located in South-West rural New South Wales, generally following the Murrumbidgee River valley. It includes the larger city of Wagga Wagga, as well as the towns of Cowra, Forbes, Junee, Cootamundra, Temora, West Wyalong, Young, Tumut and Gundagai. The Sturt Highway runs along the length of the division, and it contains a large section of the Newell Highway.\nThe Division of Riverina also contains the major town of Parkes which has the same name as the bordering Division of Parkes.\nThe seat has previously been held by Al Grassby, Minister for Immigration in the Whitlam government. The current Member for Riverina, since the 2010 federal election, is Michael McCormack, former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party of Australia from 2018 to 2021.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 8:\nDivision of Maribyrnong\nThe Division of Maribyrnong is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. It is located in the inner north-western suburbs of Melbourne. Suburbs include Aberfeldie, Airport West, Avondale Heights, Essendon, Footscray, Gowanbrae, Keilor East, Maribyrnong, Moonee Ponds, Niddrie, West Footscray and Tullamarine. Due to redistributions, the division has been slowly moving west and changed with the introduction of the  Division of Fraser in 2018. According to the 2011 census, Maribyrnong has the highest proportion of Catholics in any Commonwealth Electoral Division in Australia with 41.6% of the population.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 13 July 1906, and was first contested at the 1906 election. The division was named after the Maribyrnong River, which runs through it. A safe Labor seat for most of the first half of the 20th century, it became a marginal Liberal seat for most of the 1950s and 1960s, in part due to the influence of the Democratic Labor Party. Labor retook the seat in 1969, and for most of the time since then, it has been a comfortably safe Labor seat.\nProminent former members include James Fenton, a minister under James Scullin and Joseph Lyons; Arthur Drakeford, a minister under John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley; and Moss Cass, a minister under Gough Whitlam. The current member for Maribyrnong since the 2007 election is the former National Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union and former Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 9:\nAlexandria, New South Wales\nAlexandria is an inner southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Alexandria is located 5 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. The postcode is 2015.The rough boundaries of Alexandria are Botany Road to the east, Gardeners Road to the south, Mitchell Road and Sydney Park to the west, and Boundary Road to the north. It is approximately 3.5 km south of Central station.\n\nHistory\nThe Parish of Alexandria was established in 1835. The naming of Alexandria and neighbouring Waterloo commemorates the famous British Empire military and naval victories over Napoleon – the Battles of Alexandria and Waterloo.  The Iron Duke Hotel in Alexandria is itself named after the Duke of Wellington, as is Wellington Street in Waterloo. It was thought Alexandria may have been named after Princess Alexandra, Queen consort of King Edward VII, however, Alexandra was born on 1 December 1844 and the parish's naming predates the birth of Alexandra by six years.\nIn 1868, the Municipality of Alexandria was formed, after separating from Waterloo. The former Alexandria Town Hall is in Garden Street. Land for the building was acquired in 1879; the building was designed by Ferdinand Reuss Snr and completed in 1881. Major alterations took place over the years, right up to 1928. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.By 1943, Alexandria was the largest industrial district in Australia, and known as the \"Birmingham of Australia\", with everything from bricks to aeroplanes manufactured in 550 factories in just 1,000 acres (4.0 km2). The municipality was abolished upon merger into the City of Sydney in 1949, along with Darlington, Erskineville, Newtown, Redfern, Waterloo, Paddington and The Glebe.\nIn 1968 the boundaries were changed again and Alexandria was part of a new municipality, South Sydney Council. South Sydney was brought back into the City of Sydney in 1982 and then became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988. In 2004, Alexandria moved back into the City of Sydney, when the City of Sydney was merged with the City of South Sydney.\n\nTrams\nThe former Alexandria tram line opened in 1902 as a single-track electric line that was duplicated in 1910. The line branched off from the Botany line at the junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in Alexandria. The line proceeded down Henderson Road then swung left into Mitchell Road. A turn-back was provided at Ashmore Road (near Erskineville Oval) for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known as an extension of Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the Princes Highway near St Peters railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction.  The line was closed in 1959. Transit Systems route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.\n\nHeritage listings\nAlexandria has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nAlexandra Canal\n39 Brandling Street: Enginemans Resthouse\n16-22 Retreat Street: Yiu Ming Temple\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2021 census, there were 9,649 people living in Alexandria.At the 2016 census, Alexandria had a population of 8,262. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.7% of the population. The most common ancestries in Alexandria were English 22.6%, Australian 17.5%, Irish 10.8%, Scottish 6.9% and Chinese 5.8%. 59.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 5.4%, New Zealand 3.7%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 2.6%, Ireland 1.3% and the United States 1.0%. 72.1% of people spoke only English at home.

The suburb was once mostly terraced housing, that was demolished for light industrial use and warehousing which continues to this day. Pockets of quiet residential areas remain along the northern boundary of the suburb, adjoining Erskineville and Waterloo.\nVirgin Atlantic has its Australia offices on Level 3 Eastside in the Sydney Corporate Park in Alexandria.\n\nGreen Square\nAlexandria is part of the Green Square district, in the north east of the suburb, which is undergoing gentrification. This involves an urban renewal project that is constructing modern retail, business and medium-high density residential developments.\n\nSouth Sydney Markets\nEstablished in September 2009, its main purpose was to meet the community demand for local markets, providing fine produce and a venue for local handmade crafts. The children's activities kept the little ones entertained with face painting and a kids zoo. It was open every Sunday 10am - 3pm at 75-85 O'Riordan St Alexandria however, it has unfortunately been temporarily closed.\n\nTransport\nAlexandria is serviced by Transdev John Holland routes to the Sydney central business district. Alexandria is close to two railway lines on the Sydney Trains network. Green Square railway station, located on the north-eastern fringe, is on the Airport & South Line. Erskineville railway station and St Peters railway station are serviced by the Bankstown Line. Both are within easy walking distance, to the west of Alexandria.\n\nCulture\nAlexandria has the headquarters of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Australia and New Zealand.\nAlexandria is the location for a Chinese community centred on the Yiu Ming Temple in Retreat Street. The temple was heritage-listed in 1999, along with the terraced houses that line Retreat Street.\n\nSport and recreation\nSydney Park is a large recreational area on the western border. Alexandria Park and McKell Playground are situated on Buckland Street. Tennis courts and a cricket oval are located here. Erskineville Oval is just over the western border. Erskineville Oval is the home ground of the Alexandria Rovers junior rugby league team. The Alexandria Dukes Rugby Football Club play in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union competition and will again contest the Meldrum Cup in 2014.  The club rooms for the Dukes are at the Iron Duke Hotel.\nA number of popular pubs are located in the suburb including the Alexandria Hotel (reopened), Iron Duke Hotel, Buckland Hotel and the Parkview Hotel on Mitchell Road.\n\nGallery\nPassage 10:\nDivision of Canobolas\nThe Division of Canobolas was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was abolished in 1906, when the Division of Calare was created. It was named after Mount Canobolas (an Aboriginal word meaning \"two peaks\"). It was located in central western New South Wales, including the towns of Forbes, Orange and Parkes. It was held by the Australian Labor Party throughout its existence.\n\nMembers\n\n\n== Election results ==", "answers": ["Division of Cook"], "length": 3918, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "69a7a204e296babb322d3fe7c7ee60e6b8f0f70e237abb80"}

He was \"discovered\" while working at the BBC, sorting records for Desert Island Discs. A producer for the show heard him singing \"Questa o quella\" from Rigoletto while working, and suggested he study professionally.Rendall entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1970, and the Salzburg Mozarteum in 1973. He won a Young Musician of the Year Award from the Greater London Arts Association in 1973 and received a Gulbenkian Fellowship in 1975. In May 1978 he sang the tenor part of Anton Bruckner's Te Deum under the baton of Herbert von Karajan during a performance at Musikverein Hall of Vienna with Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nPerforming career\nAt Covent Garden, Rendall sang the roles of the Italian singer in Der Rosenkavalier, Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Des Grieux in Manon, Matteo in Arabella, Rodrigo in La donna del lago, Flamand in Capriccio, and the Duke in Rigoletto. After making his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1980 as Ernesto in Don Pasquale, he returned as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, subsequently performing Lensky in Eugene Onegin, Matteo in Arabella, Ferrando in Cosi fan Tutte and the title role of Idomeneo.He also performed with the English National Opera from 1976 to 1992, with the New York City Opera, San Francisco Opera, and many other opera companies in the United States, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Italy, Georgia, Japan, Denmark, and Germany.Rendall was involved in a peculiar onstage incident in 1998 when he accidentally stabbed baritone Kimm Julian in the death scene of I Pagliacci during a rehearsal with the Florentine Opera. The switchblade-style knife that the Milwaukee opera company used failed to collapse, and the baritone received a 3-inch-deep (76 mm) cut into his abdomen. Julian recovered and police cleared Rendall of any wrongdoing. He suffered injuries from a collapsing stage set during an April 2005 performance on stage in Copenhagen, and his career was subsequently curtailed. Rendall returned to performance in June 2013.Rendall is married to the British lyric mezzo-soprano Diana Montague.  Their son is the baritone Huw Montague Rendall.\n\nRecordings\nRendall's recordings include Berlioz, Requiem in 1979 conducted by Michael Gielen,  Maria Stuarda with Charles Mackerras and the English National Opera in 1982 and La rondine with Lorin Maazel and the London Symphony Orchestra in 1985.\n\nSee also\nMozart: Così fan tutte (Alain Lombard recording)\nThe Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala, Deutsche Grammophon DVD, 00440-073-4538, 2009\nPassage 2:\nPowell Lloyd\nHarold Powell Lloyd (known as Powell Lloyd) (1900 – 1987) was an English operatic tenor and opera director and producer.\n\nBiography\nLloyd studied singing at Morley College and later with Amy Martin and Herbert Oliver. He began his career as an actor at the Old Vic in his early 20s, excelling in the plays of William Shakespeare. During this time he also sang in the opera chorus. In 1923 he began to appear as a soloist with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic; mostly in buffo roles. While there he met his future wife, operatic mezzo-soprano Edith Coates. The couple married in 1933 and often performed together.Lloyd remained with Baylis's company when they moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931 and later became a producer and director for the company. Among the many roles he created on stage at Sadler's Wells were Bardolfo in Falstaff, Basilio in The Marriage of Figaro, Bobyl in The Snow Maiden, Goro in Madama Butterfly, Monostatos in The Magic Flute, Spoletta in Tosca, and Vašek in The Bartered Bride. He also had two major successes at the Royal Opera, London: the witch in Hänsel und Gretel (1934) and David in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1936) under conductor Thomas Beecham. The latter role was recorded on Columbia Records.Lloyd's career was put on hold while the London stages were closed during World War II. After the war he worked mainly as an opera director and producer. He worked for the Sadler's Wells Theatre, Theatre Scarborough, the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and the opera houses in Dublin and Johannesburg during the 1940s.  In 1951, he directed Balfe's opera The Rose of Castille at the first Wexford Festival.  In 1955 he joined the Welsh National Opera where he worked for a decade. He also was involved with producing works for radio and television broadcasts.\nPassage 3:\nWalking in the Air\n\"Walking in the Air\" is a song written by Howard Blake for the 1982 animated film The Snowman based on Raymond Briggs's 1978 children's book of the same name. The song forms the centrepiece of The Snowman, which has become a seasonal favourite on British and Finnish television. The story relates the fleeting adventures of a young boy and a snowman who has come to life. In the second part of the story, the boy and the snowman fly to the North Pole. \"Walking in the Air\" is the theme for the journey. They attend a party of snowmen, at which the boy seems to be the only human until they meet Father Christmas with his reindeer, and the boy is given a scarf with a snowman pattern. In the film, the song was performed by St Paul's Cathedral choirboy Peter Auty; this performance was reissued in 1985 (on Stiff Records) and 1987.In 1985, an altered version was recorded for use in a TV advertising campaign for Toys \"R\" Us. While it was believed that Auty's voice had then broken, Auty claimed in an interview with BBC Breakfast News on 2 December 2022 that his voice had not broken and he was never contacted for the recording. Blake recommended the then-14-year-old Welsh chorister Aled Jones, whose recording reached number five in the UK Singles Chart, and who became a popular celebrity on the strength of his performance. The association of the song with Jones, combined with Auty not being credited on The Snowman, led to a common misbelief that Jones performed the song in the film.  \"Walking in the Air\" has subsequently been performed by over forty artists, in a variety of styles. In a UK poll in 2012, the Aled Jones version was voted 13th on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\n\nNightwish version\nIn 1998, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish covered the song for their second studio album, Oceanborn, in a power ballad style. A shorter version of it was released on 30 January 1999 as the second single from the album, featuring two b-sides. It spent eighteen weeks on the Finnish charts, peaking at number one for a week. The band named the compilation Walking in the Air: The Greatest Ballads after this song.\nThe song was performed regularly during Tarja Turunen's time with the band as the lead singer; after her departure, she went on to record her own version for her 2006 winter album Henkäys Ikuisuudesta.\nNightwish's founding member and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen had stated that it is his all-time favourite piece of music.\n\nTrack listing\n\"Walking in the Air\" (radio edit) – 3:41\n\"Nightquest\" (Tuomas Holopainen) – 4:15\n\"Tutankhamen\" (Nightwish, Holopainen) – 5:30\n\nOther notable recorded versions\nIn 1983, the British rock band Rainbow covered the song for their 7th studio album, Bent out of Shape. The song is called Snowman.\nAled Jones (as a teen boy soprano) reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1985 with his cover. He released it again, in a duet with himself (as an adult baritone), on his 2007 Album You Raise Me Up: The Best of Aled Jones. In 2022, Jones recorded a duet version with tenor Russell Watson, which was included on the Christmas with Aled and Russell album of the same year.\nChloë Agnew (from Celtic Woman) in 2004 released her debut solo album titled Walking in the Air which hit number 13 on Billboard's Classical Albums Chart, and peaked at number 4 on Billboard's World Music chart. The song is the first track.\nDigital Dream Baby's \"Walking in the Air\", an electronic dance remix, peaked at number 49 in December 1991 in the UK's album chart.\nMcFly released their cover of the song on 2 December 2021. The single enjoyed a brief run on the UK Downloads chart, topping at number 25.\n\nUses in other media\nA parody version of it was used in a Scottish television commercial in 2006, for an Irn-Bru advert. It was reused in the advert's sequel in 2018.\nIt was used in a 2013 World Wide Fund for Nature commercial showing on YouTube, performed by Vajèn van den Bosch.\nPassage 4:\nDavid Hillman\nDavid Hillman may refer to:\n\nDavid Hillman (tenor)\nDavid Hillman (politician)\n\nSee also\nDave Hillman, American baseball player\nPassage 5:\nJohn Mitchinson (tenor)\nJohn Leslie Mitchinson (31 March 1932 – 17 December 2021) was an English operatic tenor.Mitchinson was born in Blackrod, Lancashire.

In 1978 he joined the Welsh National Opera, with whom he worked for four years. Able to sing a variety of roles, he portrayed Peter Grimes and Tristan during this period, among others.\nHe sang the title role of Wagner's Rienzi in a 1976 BBC broadcast of one of the rare performances in recent history of the complete opera; a recording of this broadcast survives and has circulated.\nMitchinson married the mezzo-soprano Maureen Guy in 1958.

At the age of 13, he sang \"Walking in the Air\", the theme song of the 1982 animated film, The Snowman, but in the rush to finish the film his name was omitted from the credits until the film was remastered for its 20th anniversary in 2002.\nThe composer, Howard Blake, decided to re-record the song for a commercial for Toys \"R\" Us in 1985. Aled Jones was chosen instead and the song became a hit single. Many people assumed that Jones was the singer in the version used in the film.\n\nOpera singer\nAuty took the role of Camille in York Light Opera Company's production of The Merry Widow in 1995. Subsequently, he moved to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama where he studied under Peter Alexander Wilson. At the summer performance in 1997 of Prokofiev's Betrothal in a Monastery (given as The Duenna), the Opera critic noted \"another potentially Wagnerian voice, the tenor Peter Auty, a very young-looking Don Jerome; the voice has that edge of smoky colour one associates with a Siegfried, but still has to settle into its own space and breadth\".Auty's professional stage debut was with Opera North in 1998. With the company, he subsequently sang the roles of Rodolfo in La bohème during the 2001-02 season and Don José in Carmen in 2011. At Covent Garden he played the Major-Domo to the Marschallin in the 2000 run of Der Rosenkavalier under Thielemann, Michelis in the 2000 run of The Greek Passion under Mackerras, Flavio in Norma, Maintop in Billy Budd and a Shepherd in Tristan und Isolde in 2000, Roderigo in Otello, Gastone in La traviata and Third Esquire in Parsifal in 2001, Malcolm in Macbeth in 2002, and Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor in 2003.Elsewhere in Britain he sang at Glyndebourne Festival Opera (Rodrigo in Verdi's Otello and Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore). His Don José for the Glyndebourne tour in 2002 was described as \"beautifully sung, deeply troubled\".There have also been roles with Scottish Opera and English National Opera. In other parts of Europe he has appeared in many other venues such as Frankfurt and Rouen. For the ENO Rigoletto in 2006, his Duke led a reviewer to comment that his \"brilliant top and equally sensitive shaping of lines made him a Duke of real distinction. On this and other recent showings, Auty is surely the finest lyric tenor in the Italian repertoire the UK has produced since the young Dennis O'Neill\".In 2018 he sang the \"exhausting\" title role in the stage premiere (and UK premiere) of Konstantin Boyarsky's Pushkin at Grange Park Opera. As the only non-Russian in the cast \"Auty coped heroically with Boyarsky's demanding vocal lines, and emphasized Pushkin's ardour and naiveté, nonchalantly delivering the many quotes (in Russian) that pepper the libretto.Auty has also performed concerts with orchestras both in his home country and abroad, such as London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy and Royal Flemish Philharmonic led by Edo de Waart.\n\nSelected discography\nDvořák: Requiem, Op. 89 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra Neeme Järvi; 2009 (London Philharmonic Orchestra – LPO)\nBrian: Symphony No. 1 'Gothic' - BBC forces under Martyn Brabbins; 2011 (Hyperion)\nDonizetti: L'elisir d'amore (as Nemorino) - Glyndebourne Opera, Maurizio Benini (video); 2010 (Opus Arte)\nDvořák: Stabat Mater, Op. 58 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra, Neeme Järvi; 2012 (LPO)\nElgar: The Dream of Gerontius - Royal Flemish Philharmonic, Edo de Waart; 2013 (Pentatone)\nVerdi: Rigoletto (as Borsa) - Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Edward Downes (video); 2013 (Opus Arte)\nJoubert: St. Mark Passion - Wells Cathedral Choir, Matthew Owens; 2017 (Resonus Classics)\nPassage 8:\nNicholas Sharratt\nNicholas Sharratt (born in Nottingham) is an English operatic tenor.\n\nBiography\nSharratt studied at the Royal Northern College of Music and the National Opera Studio.He has performed the title role in Orpheus in the Underworld for Scottish Opera and Ernesto in Don Pasquale for English Touring Opera.

{"input": "Which park is further south within Spain, Picos de Europa National Park or Timanfaya National Park?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLake Ercina\nLake Ercina is a small highland lake in Asturias, Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa, in the Cantabrian Mountains. Situated next to Lake Enol, together, they forms the group known as Lakes of Covadonga within the Picos de Europa National Park. Lake Ercina is smaller than Lake Enol. It is situated at an altitude of 1,108 metres (3,635 ft) and its maximum depth is just over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in). The eutrophic lake covers approximately 8 hectares (20 acres). Its characteristics are tied to its glacier origin and geographic location.\nPassage 2:\nCuñaba\nCuñaba is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Peñamellera Baja, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 47 (INE 2011).\nPassage 3:\nLake Enol\nLake Enol is a small highland lake in the Principality of Asturias, Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa Western Massif, Cantabrian Mountains. It is next to Lake Ercina and together, they form the group known as Lakes of Covadonga, inside the Picos de Europa National Park. Lake Enol is the larger of the two. It is situated approximately 10 km from Covadonga and 25 km from Cangas de Onís. A curving road is available from Arriondas to the lake. Measuring 0.1 square kilometres (0.039 sq mi), it is one of the biggest lakes in the area. Lake Enol is situated 1,070 metres (3,510 ft) above sea level, in the Picos de Europa). It was formed by the withdrawal of a front glacier.\n\nCulture\nA submerged image of the Virgin Mary is elevated every year on 8 September and then taken out for a procession. Regional dancing occurs at Lake Enol during the Fiesta del Pastor on 25 July.\nPassage 4:\nTrescares\nTrescares is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Peñamellera Alta, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 55 (INE 2007).\nIn this village, there are two of the most important buildings of this autonomy: the church and, the most important, La Vidre bridge (El Puente La Vidre), built in the romanic time over another bridge that was constructed by the Romans. Today's bridge is known worldwide, and so, a lot of spots are made in it.\nHere it pass one of the most important rivers of Asturias, the Cares river (El Río Cares), which ends in the river Deva that separates the community of Asturias and Cantabria. One of the sports more played is the fishing,\nLike another village, Trescares has its feast: Saint Fausto.  This is celebrated on the following Saturday of The Pilar (national feast), in which the Trescares people wear asturian dresses and offer a two metres high bouquet to the Saint.\nPassage 5:\nTimanfaya National Park\nTimanfaya National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional de Timanfaya) is a Spanish national park in the southwestern part of the island of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands. It covers parts of the municipalities Tinajo and Yaiza. The area is 51.07 square kilometres (19.72 sq mi), and the parkland is entirely made up of volcanic soil.\nThe statue El Diablo by César Manrique is its symbol.\nIt is the only National Park in Spain which is entirely geological. Timanfaya National Park represents a sign of recent and historical volcanism in the Macaronesian Region. The last volcanic eruptions occurred during the 18th century as well as on the 19th century.\n\nVolcanic activity\nThe greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736. The volcanic activity continues as the surface temperature in the core ranges from 100 to 600 °C (212 to 1,112 °F) at the depth of 13 metres (43 ft), which is demonstrated by pouring water into the ground, resulting in a geyser of steam which is an attraction for tourists. There is only one active volcano, Timanfaya volcano, after which the park is named.\n\nEcological value\nIn 1993, UNESCO designated a Biosphere reserve covering the whole of Lanzarote. The national park is one of the core areas of the biosphere reserve.\nAccess to the park by the public is strictly regulated to protect the delicate flora and fauna. There are one or two footpaths, and a popular short route where one can visit by camel. There is a public car park from which one can tour the volcanic landscape by coach using a road that is otherwise closed to the public.\nPassage 6:\nLakes of Covadonga\nThe Lakes of Covadonga (el. 1134 m.) are composed of two glacial lakes located on the region of Asturias, Spain. These lakes, often also called Lakes of Enol or simply Los Lagos, are Lake Enol and Lake Ercina located in the Picos de Europa range and they are the original center of the Picos de Europa National Park, created in 1918. They are near Covadonga Sanctuary.\n\nVuelta a España\nThe road ascending from Covadonga to the lakes is a popular climb in professional road bicycle racing, having been used by Vuelta a España many times in the last 25 years.\nTogether with Alto de l'Angliru, Lagos de Covadonga is the most important climb in the modern history of the Vuelta. The road that leads to the lakes starts at Covadonga and is 12.6 kilometres long at an average gradient of 7.3% (height gain: 1056 m).[1] The most demanding section is La Huesera, 7 kilometres from the top of the climb, with an average gradient of 15% during 800 meters. It was featured for the first time in 1983 with the victory of Marino Lejarreta, who was in a fierce battle with Bernard Hinault for overall victory. This was the same Vuelta that saw Hinault, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon all riding on the same team.  Stage 7 of the 2023 La Vuelta Femenina ended at Lagos de Covadonga, with Dutch cyclist Demi Vollering placing first.\n\nWinners of the Lakes of Covadonga stage - Men\nWinners of the Lakes of Covadonga stage - Women\nExternal links\nLagos de Covadonga climb details (in Spanish)\nInformation and profile of the Covadonga by Climbbybike.com\nCycling up to Lagos de Covadonga: data, profile, map, photos and description\nPassage 7:\nTobes\nTobes is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Peñamellera Baja, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 123 (INE 2011).\nPassage 8:\nPicos de Europa National Park\nThe Picos de Europa National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional de Picos de Europa) is a National Park in the Picos de Europa mountain range, in northern Spain. It is within the boundaries of three autonomous communities, Asturias, Cantabria and Castile and León, which are represented on the body which runs the park. The park is also a popular destination for hikers and trekkers.\n\nHistory\nIt was the first of the National Parks of Spain. When it was created 22 July 1918 with help from Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, it covered the western part of today's national park, centered on the Lakes of Covadonga.\nThe Parque Nacional de la Montaña de Covadonga, as it then was called, had an area of 169.25 km². On 30 May 1995 and then on 3 December 2014, the park was extended to include its current total area of 671.27 km².\nOn 9 July 2003, UNESCO approved Biosphere Reserve status for the National Park.  Picos de Europa is one of several biosphere reserves in the Cantabrian Mountains which are being integrated into a single super-reserve to be known as \"Gran Cantábrica\".\n\nGeography\nThe total area of the park is 671 km² and is shared by  Castilla y León, Asturias, and Cantabria. The highest point of the park is in Torre de Cerredo peak,  2,648 m AMSL and the lowest point is 75 m AMSL in the Deva River, that is, a vertical drop of 2,573 m.\nThe geological features of the park show the effects of glacial erosion on the limestone massifs that form the Cantabrian Mountains.\nThe human population is about 1300.Vega de Liordes, an enclave in the León sector of Picos de Europa belonging to the municipality of Posada de Valdeón registered −35.8 °C (−32.4 °F), a record low temperature, on January 7, 2021.\n\nFlora and fauna\nSeveral types of woods can be found in the area; trees include beeches and Cantabrian Holm Oaks.\nThere are many protected animal species, like the Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus), the Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), the Cantabrian brown bear and the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus). The most representative animal of the Picos de Europa is the Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) or rebeco, of which there are many sculptures around the park.\n\nSee also\nRedes Natural Park\nSan Glorio\nFlora of Cantabria\nPassage 9:\nNaranjo de Bulnes\nThe Naranjo de Bulnes (known as Picu Urriellu in Asturian) is a limestone peak dating from the Paleozoic Era, located in the Macizo Central region of the Picos de Europa, Asturias (Spain). Its name Picu Urriellu is believed to be derived from the term Los Urrieles, which is used to describe the Macizo Central. Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe first written reference to \"Picu Urriellu\" as \"Naranjo de Bulnes\" is credited to the German geologist and engineer, Wilhelm Schulz, who, in 1855, published the first topographic and geological map of Asturias. As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as \"Picu Urriellu\". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: \"No me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo dar, llamadme Picu Urriellu que es mi nombre natural\". (Don't call me Orange tree, because fruit I cannot bear, call me Picu Urriellu which is my natural name).\nIt has an altitude of 2,529 metres and although it is by no means the highest peak of the Cantabrian mountain range, it can be considered the best-known summit in the world of Spanish mountaineering, especially the 550m high vertical wall of the west face for big wall climbing. At its foot lies Vega Urriellu, a glacial valley from the quaternary period.\n\nHistoric ascents\nThis mountain was first scaled via the north face (by the route now known as the Vía Pidal) on 5 August 1904 by Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, accompanied by the shepherd Gregorio Perez, called \"El Cainejo\" based on his place of birth, Caín in León.The German geology professor and expert mountain climber Gustav Schulze made the second ascent of Urriellu on 1 October 1906, also via the north face, making him the first man to make the climb solo. He was also the first to use climbing pins to rappel down the south face. Accustomed to the large cliffs of the Alps and the Dolomites, Schulze described the climb as short and difficult.\nUsing the same face and route as Pidal, Victor Martínez Campillo, a local of the nearby town of Bulnes, made the ascent on 31 August 1916. On this climb, Campillo recovered parts of the rope that Pidal and Perez had left attached to the rock during their descent from the peak. He made the same climb again on 22 September 1923, and on 19 August 1924, also opened a more gentle route, located to the left of the south face and now known as Vía Victor.\nOn 7 July 1928, the mountaineer Andrés Espinosa from Biscay scaled the south face alone without ropes. This was only the second climb of this kind on the mountain and the first at a national standard.\nOne month later, on 8 August, Manuel Martinez Campillo (a cousin of Victor) opened a new path known as the Horizontal Pass. This route was created to the right of the south face and has since become one of the most used routes.\nOn 13 August 1944, two sons of Victor Martínez, Alfonso and Juan, opened the route on the south face known as the \"Vía Sur\", or the \"Martínez Direct Line\", which is one of the most used and safest routes.\nOn 23 March 1954, Antonio Moreno, Rafael Pellús, Máximo Serna and Agustín Faus from the Peñalara High Mountain Group tried to make the first winter climb. This attempt was called off due to the threat of avalanches. On 8 March 1956, Ángel Landa Bidarte from the Baracaldo Alpine tourism group and Pedro Udaondo from the Bilbao Juventus mountain group were the first to succeed in reaching the summit in winter conditions.\nOn 21 August 1962, the Aragonese mountaineers Alberto Rabadá and Ernesto Navarro completed the first ascent via the difficult West Face.\nOn 8 February 1973, two parties, one formed by Miguel Ángel García Gallego (from Murcia) and José Ángel Lucas, and the other formed by César Pérez de Tudela and Pedro Antonio Ortega (from Ardilla), made the first winter climb using the \"Vía Rabadá y Navarro\" on the West Face. This ascent was followed closely by the media as that winter had already claimed several lives and a few spectacular rescues had been required.\nOn 4 September 2009, the brothers Iker and Eneko Pou conquered Urriellu in 8 hours via the Orbayu route, a path with one of the most difficult cliff faces in the world with a gradient of 8c+/9a.\nThe \"Pandébano Col\" can also be reached from the town of Bulnes; however, this town can only be reached using a footpath or the Funicula railway. Although the most direct way of getting to the \"Vega Urriellu\" from Bulnes would be along the Balcosín channel and the \"Majada de Camburero\", this path is more difficult.\n\nClimbing routes\nA list of the most important routes (most of which are for big wall climbing):\nWest Face\n-Rabadá y Navarro (750m, MD+, 6a, A1 [6c+])\n-Leiva.

The team is a member of the America East Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. It plays home games at Varsity Field on the university's campus in Albany, New York. The Great Danes are coached by Jon Mueller.\n\nHistory\nAlbany's baseball program played its first season in 1958.  After spending several decades in Division III, it began the transition to Division I in the mid-1990s along with the school's other teams.\n\nDivision I\nIt played its first season in Division I in 2000, also hiring head coach Jon Mueller that year.  After competing as an independent in 2000 and in the New York State Baseball Conference in 2001, it played its first season in the America East in 2002.  In 2004, the Great Danes set a program record with 37 wins and reached their first Division I postseason, going 1–2 at that season's America East tournament.  In 2007, the team won the AEC tournament as the third seed to reach its first NCAA tournament at any level.  As the fourth seed at the Fayetteville Regional, Albany went 0–2, losing 9–0 to host Arkansas and 21–11 to second seed Creighton.\n\nYear-by-year results\nBelow is a table of Albany's yearly records as an NCAA Division I baseball program.\n\nMLB Draft\nAs of 2020, nine players have been selected from Albany in the Major League Baseball draft and none have reached the majors.

Stony Brook currently competes in the CAA and plays its home games on Joe Nathan Field. Matt Senk has coached the team since the beginning of the 1991 season. The team has won the America East tournament six times in 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2019. In 2011, the Seawolves claimed their first America East regular season championship. Stony Brook has participated in the NCAA tournament on six separate occasions, winning its first game in 2010.\nIn 2012, the Seawolves clinched their second consecutive regular season championship and their fourth America East Conference baseball tournament championship, earning the league's automatic bid to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The team went on to win the Coral Gables Regional and the Baton Rouge Super Regional, becoming the first ever team from the America East Conference to advance to the College World Series.\n\nHistory\nPre-Division I era (1966–98)\nStony Brook first fielded NCAA–sanctioned baseball in 1966. The program struggled hard initially, posting only six winning seasons until the hiring of Matt Senk as head coach in 1991. Senk's leadership helped the team succeed at the Division III level, and Stony Brook finished 1995 with a 30–8 record and a trip to their first Division III NCAA tournament. Stony Brook shortstop Joe Nathan was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the sixth round with the 159th overall pick in the 1995 MLB Draft. He debuted for the Giants in 1999 as a pitcher, becoming the first player in program history to play in the MLB.\n\nEarly years in Division I (1999–2004)\nStony Brook began in Division I as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference. In 2002, the Seawolves joined the America East Conference. In 2003, Stony Brook advanced to its first America East Tournament title game, needing to beat Northeastern twice to win the championship. While they won 11–10 in game one, they were blown out 11–0, leaving them one game away from its first NCAA tournament berth. In 2004, the fourth-place Seawolves upset first-place Northeastern 15–6 in the first round of the America East Tournament, and advanced to the championship game for a second straight year, this time defeating Maine 3–1 to win their first America East championship and advance to their first NCAA tournament in the program's Division I history. Stony Brook was assigned as the fourth seed in the Kinston Regional, where they lost to host East Carolina 8–2 and Tennessee 1–0 and were eliminated from the tournament in two games.\n\nProgram on the rise (2005–11)\nAfter reaching their first NCAA tournament in 2004, Stony Brook followed up with its first losing season since 1997, not qualifying for the America East Tournament. Stony Brook suffered another losing season in 2006 and a quick elimination from the America East Tournament in 2007. On December 6, 2006, Joe Nathan's No. 22 was retired, becoming the first retired number in Stony Brook athletics history. In 2008, Stony Brook finished 34–26 (14–10 America East) in second place in the regular season behind the Binghamton Bearcats. In the double-elimination tournament, the Seawolves beat UMBC and Binghamton twice to clinch their second tournament championship and advance to their second NCAA tournament Regionals. In the Tempe Regional of the NCAA tournament, Stony Brook lost 9–7 to Arizona State and 9–4 to Vanderbilt, resulting in another early exit from the tournament.The 2009 season was less promising and the Seawolves ended the regular season in third place with a 29–23 (14–10) record. Stony Brook was ousted early in the America East tournament after consecutive losses against second-seeded Albany and fourth-seeded Vermont. In 2010, Stony Brook ended 30–27 (15–9), entering the tournament as the third seed but surprising with victories against Maine and consecutive victories against Albany to earn its third tournament championship. In the NCAA tournament, the Seawolves played in the Myrtle Beach Regional. They lost to Coastal Carolina 6–0, but defeated NC State 6–2 in the loser's bracket to earn their first victory in the tournament. The Seawolves were then eliminated in a rematch with Coastal Carolina, losing 25–7.In 2011, Nathan's donation allowed for the construction of a new venue, Joe Nathan Field, which was unsuitable for play entering the season. As a result, the Seawolves played their home games at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, New York. Joe Nathan Field opened on May 20, 2011. Stony Brook won its first conference regular season title in 2011 after going 22–2 in America East play; the Seawolves ended with a program-record 42 wins and went 42–12. However, Stony Brook was upset twice in the America East Tournament, once by Albany and again by Maine to eliminate the Seawolves before reaching the title game, putting their record-breaking season to a stunning halt.\n\nCollege World Series run (2012)\nStony Brook opened its 2012 campaign with a perfect 4–0 weekend at Thibodaux, Louisiana, with a pair of victories over Alabama State and Nicholls State in the Colonel Round Robin. The Seawolves' only losses in conference play came against East Carolina in a sweep, Kansas, Minnesota, Yale and Holy Cross. When conference play started, Stony Brook was 17–8.\nStony Brook went 21–3 in conference play, losing two games to Binghamton and one to Albany. The Seawolves continued to earn non-conference wins against Iona, Marist, Rhode Island, Central Connecticut and Fairfield in the middle of the conference season, entering the America East tournament with a 43–11 record. Stony Brook beat Maine 14–6, Binghamton 7–4 and Maine 13–6 to win the conference title, advancing to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with a 46–11 record, the best record in Division I.The Seawolves were the first team in the America East since 2002 to earn both the regular season and conference tournament championships in the same season. For the first time in the history of the program, Stony Brook found itself ranked, sitting at No. 25 in the Baseball America poll and No. 29 in the NCBWA poll.Stony Brook traveled to South Florida to play in the Coral Gables Regional as the fourth seed. In the first game the Seawolves knocked off top-seeded Miami and went on to the winner's bracket. Following a loss to second-seeded Central Florida, Stony Brook beat Missouri State in dramatic fashion, striking out Luke Voit in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded in a 10–7 win. The Seawolves topped Central Florida 12–5 and 10–6 in consecutive days to win the regional and advance to face the LSU Tigers in the Super Regionals.\n\nIn a rain-soaked Baton Rouge Super Regional, Stony Brook fell in the first game to LSU, who started pitcher Aaron Nola, in an extra-innings affair that spanned two days due to rain. In game two, LSU started pitcher Kevin Gausman, who had closed out the game one victory hours before, with Stony Brook winning 3–1 behind a 127-pitch complete game. In a winner-take-all game three, Stony Brook won 7–2 and advanced to the 2012 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The Seawolves were the second team to be the fourth seed in its regional and advance to the College World Series. Stony Brook was the first Northeast school to reach Omaha since 1986 and the first school from New York to do so since St. John's in 1980.In the College World Series, Stony Brook's Cinderella run came to an end, losing to UCLA 9–1 and Florida State 12–2. Stony Brook ended the season with a 52–15 record, the most wins in college baseball, a No. 8 national ranking in the NCBWA poll and seven players selected in the 2012 MLB Draft, including outfielder Travis Jankowski being selected in the first round by the San Diego Padres.\n\nFinal America East years (2013–2022)\nStony Brook followed up its College World Series campaign with a disappointing 25–34 season, finishing fourth in the America East and being eliminated in the first two games of the tournament. In 2014, Stony Brook won its third America East regular season title with a 35–18 (18–5) record. The Seawolves advanced to the championship round of the conference tournament in the winner's bracket but lost to Binghamton in both games, 4–3 and 8–7, and were eliminated.Stony Brook won back-to-back regular season championships in 2015, reaching the finals from the winner's bracket again, and this time beat UMBC 16–11 to reach its fifth NCAA tournament. Playing in the Fort Worth Regional, the Seawolves lost to North Carolina State 3–0, beat Sacred Heart 11–6 and were eliminated with an 8–3 loss to TCU.In 2016, Stony Brook finished in third place in the America East, advancing to the tournament championship from the loser's bracket before falling to Binghamton. In 2017, Stony Brook finished in third again but lost two quick games in the playoffs. Stony Brook finished in fourth place in 2018, again reaching the championship game from the loser's bracket and losing to Hartford.The Seawolves won their fifth regular season title and sixth America East Tournament title in 2019, beating Binghamton in the championship. In the NCAA tournament, Stony Brook was placed in the Baton Rouge Regional, scheduled to face LSU in a rematch of the 2012 series that sent the Seawolves to Omaha. LSU won the rematch 17–3. The Seawolves were eliminated from the NCAA tournament with a following 13–5 loss to Arizona State, which rostered future number-one MLB draft pick Spencer Torkelson.The 2020 season was canceled on March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stony Brook played 15 games to a 6–9 record. Stony Brook won its sixth regular season title in 2021, setting the America East all-time record for most conference wins in a season (25). Hosting the conference tournament at Joe Nathan Field, Stony Brook advanced to the championship but did so from the loser's bracket. Up 1–0 against NJIT, the game was halted due to rain and never resumed. The America East controversially awarded the title and NCAA tournament bid to NJIT since the Highlanders were in the winner's bracket.Before the 2022 season began, the America East controversially prohibited Stony Brook from participating in the conference tournament because of the school's impending move to the Colonial Athletic Association.\n\nNCAA tournament appearances\nAlumni in Major League Baseball\nThe following Stony Brook Seawolves baseball alumni have reached Major League Baseball:\n\nJoe Nathan (1999–2016)\nTom Koehler (2012–2017)\nNick Tropeano (2014–present)Travis Jankowski (2015–present)\nDaniel Zamora (2018–present)\n\nFacilities\nJoe Nathan Field\nJoe Nathan Field, located in the north end of the Stony Brook campus, is the home field of Seawolves baseball.

The mountain range is considered to be low altitude within Colorado as all of the peaks are under 11,000 feet (3,400 m). Located within Routt and Moffat counties, the Elkhead Mountains are far from metropolitan areas and have few lakes and streams, so they attract relatively few visitors.\nThe mountain range is of volcanic origin and all of the peaks were formed by volcanic action.

The park area is important as a water catchment to supply water into various river in the west coast and interior districts of Sabah including Papar River, Kimanis River, Bongawan River, Membakut River, Padas River and Melalap River that flow west to the park while the Pegalan River, Pampang River, Apin-Apin River, Tendulu River, Melalap River, Liawan River and Tikalod River flow the opposite direction.\n\nHistory\nThe area surrounding Mount Kinabalu has been a state park since 1964 and was the country's first World Heritage Site. Part of the mountain range has been gazetted for protection as Crocker Range National Park since 1984. Through the Bornean Biodiversity and Ecosystems Conservation Programme (BBEC), a technical co-operation existed between the government of Sabah and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to innovate Community Use Zone (CUZ) concept as a management option to address the issues concerning indigenous communities living and utilising resources within the protected areas. Mount Kinabalu, one of the highest mountains in Southeast Asia, is a part of this mountain range. In 2014, the range was recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, becoming the second Malaysian site to be designated, after Chini Lake in the Malay Peninsula of Pahang.\n\nBiodiversity\nThe Crocker Mountains Forest Reserve area has a wide range of flora and fauna diversity and having the highest diversity of nocturnal insects in all the 20 forest reserves surveyed within the Heart of Borneo area in Sabah and recorded a number of endemic species.\nPassage 3:\nYutmaru Sar\nYutmaru Sar is a mountain in the Hispar mountain range, a subrange of the Karakoram. At an elevation of 7,283 m (23,894 ft) it is the 88th highest mountain in the world. Yutmaru Sar is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It was first climbed in 1980.\nPassage 4:\nRimo I\nRimo I is the main summit of the Rimo massif with an elevation of 7,385 metres (24,229 ft).\n\nGeography\nIt lies in the northern part of the remote Rimo Muztagh, a subrange of the Karakoram range. It is located about 20 km northeast of the snout of the Siachen Glacier and is the world's 71st highest mountain. Rimo means \"striped mountain\". The Rimo Glacier, originating here, drains to the Shyok river.\nDue to its remote location in the heart of the eastern Karakoram, Rimo was little-known and almost entirely unvisited until the twentieth century. Explorers Filippo De Filippi and Philip and Jenny Visser visited the area in 1914 and 1929 respectively. Adding to its isolation is the unsettled political and military situation between India and Pakistan in the region, especially on the nearby Siachen Glacier. This means that India controls access to the massif.\n\nRimo massif\nThe Rimo massif consists of six peaks sharing the Rimo name. In addition to Rimo I, they are:\n\nRimo II is a minor subpeak located about 150 m (490 ft) northeast of Rimo I, on its north ridge. The others are more independent peaks further north. Rimo III is the 98th highest mountain in the world (Rimo II is unranked, lacking sufficient prominence).\nThe massif heads the large Central Rimo Glacier (on the north side) and South Rimo Glacier (on the east side), as well as the smaller North Terong Glacier (on the west side).\n\nClimbing history\nThe first attempts on the Rimo massif were in 1978, by a Japanese expedition which had little success, in 1984 (first ascent of Rimo IV, by an Indian army expedition) and in 1985, by a well-organized Indian/British expedition led by famed Himalayan expert Harish Kapadia. That expedition climbed Rimo III (Dave Wilkinson and Jim Fotheringham were the summit party) but did not succeed on Rimo I.\nThe first, and so far only, the ascent of Rimo I was made in 1988 by an Indian/Japanese team led by Hukam Singh and Yoshio Ogata. They climbed the south face to the southwest ridge, starting from a significant pass called Ibex Col on the south side of the mountain. The ascent involved 1500m of significant technical climbing.\n\nSee also\nList of highest mountains\nHarish Kapadia\nPassage 5:\nKrucze Mountains\nThe Krucze Mountains (Czech: Vraní hory, German: Rabengebirge Polish: Góry Krucze) are the Eastern part of the Stone Mountains, which belong to the Central Sudetes on the border of the Czech Republic and Poland. To the West and North-Western part the mountain range borders the Lubawska Plateau and the Karkonosze Mountains, to the North-Eastern part they border the mountain range Czarny Las, from the East they border the sediment basin Kotlina Krzeszowska and the Zawory mountain range and to the South the mountain range borders the Czech part of the Stołowe Mountains. To the Southern ridge of mountain range is the Polish-Czech border. The border crossing for cars is in Lubawka and for tourists is in Okrzeszyn.\n\nSpecification\nThe mountain range stretches North to South, which is irregular for the Sudetes Mountains, this is due to their geological build. To the very North of the mountain range is Kościelna with a height of 513 metres, which is on the outskirts of the settlement of Kamienna Góra. The most important highest peaks in the Northern part of the mountain range are: Długosz at 612 metres, Anielska Góra at 651 metres, Czarnogóra at 621 metres, Kierz at 662 metres, Skowroniec at 581 metres,  Pustelnia at 683 metres,  Święta Góra at 701 metres,  Krucza Skała at 681 metres, Polska Góra at 792 metres, Szeroka at 844 metres, Głazica at 798 metres, Wiązowa at 800 metres, Jaworowa at 786 metres,  Owcza Głowa at 753 metres,  Końska at 813 metres, Kobyla Góra at 758 metres, Bogoria at 645 metres, Jański Wierch at 697 metres. On the Czech side of the mountain range, from the West of the border ridge is Královecký Špičák, the highest peak of the Krucze Mountains and Mravenčí vrch at 836 metres.\nThe Jańskiego Wierchu Massif is separated from the Krucze Mountains by the Szkła Valley, and according to Czech geographers the Jestřebí hory mountain range.\n\nSettlements\nOn the Polish side of the mountain rangeBłażejów, Błażkowa, Janiszów, Kamienna Góra, Lipienica, Lubawka, Okrzeszyn, Przedwojów and Uniemyśl.\n\nOn the Czech side of the mountain rangeBečkov, Bernartice, Královec.\nPassage 6:\nPassu Sar\nPassu Sar (Urdu: پسو سر; or Passu Sar, Passu I) is a mountain peak in the Batura Muztagh, a sub-range of the Karakoram mountain range, in the Hunza District of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the high point of the Passu massif, which also includes Passu Diar (or \"Passu East\", \"Pasu II\"). The peak lies on the main ridge of the Batura Muztagh, about 7 km (4 mi) east of Batura Sar.\nThe date of the first successful ascent of Passu Sar is disputed. It has been reported as first climbed on 7 August 1994 by the German team of Max Wallner, Dirk Naumann, Ralf Lehmann, and Volker Wurnig. Another report claims it was climbed in 1978 by a Japanese-Pakistani team.\n\nSee also\nGojal\nPassu\nHunza\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nHighest Mountains of the World\nPassage 7:\nKanjut Sar\nKanjut Sar (Urdu: کنجت سر), or Kunjudh Sar as pronounced in Wakhi, is a mountain located in the Shimshal Valley, part of the Karakoram mountain range. The name Kunjudh Sar in Wakhi means \"that which overlooks Kunjudh\", or \"above Kunjudh\", while Khujudh is the Wakhi name for Central Hunza. It is the 28th-highest mountain on Earth and the 11th-highest in Pakistan. According to many residents of Shimshal, Kanjut Sar is the name of the adjacent peak Yukshin Gardan Sar, and vice versa. In Shimshal village, the original namings are widely accepted and used, as opposed to what is recognised internationally.\nKanjut Sar consists of two peaks:\n\nKanjut Sar I at 7,760 metres (25,459 ft).\nKanjut Sar II, to the southeast of I, at 6,831 m (22,411 ft).Kanjut Sar I was first climbed in 1959 by Camillo Pellissier, member of an Italian expedition directed by Guido Monzino. Between 4 and 6 August 1981, seven Japanese climbers of the same expedition climbed to the top. In 2010, a Russian–American expedition attempted to climb on the Eastern Ridge of Kanjut Sar and reached 7450 m, but turned back in bad weather.The first ascent of Kanjut Sar II was achieved by a Swiss team in 1985.  Expedition leader Toni Spirig, Ueli Stahel and Richie Ott finally carried it out in alpine style after several attempts . The climbers reached the summit on July 10. The ascent route led over the north-west side.\nOn July 29, 1990, a Dutch expedition made the second ascent of Kanjut Sar II in alpine style via the south face. Expedition members were Peter Kok, Frank Schmidt, Franck van den Barselaer, Hendrik Freie and Pieter de Kam.\n\nSee also\nHighest mountains of the world\nList of Ultras of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nPassage 8:\nBashagard Mountains\nThe Bashagard Mountains or the Bashagerd Mountains (also known as Bashagird or Bashakerd) is a mountain range that is located in southeast of Iran. The mountain range runs in an arc almost in a northwest-southeast direction from eastern parts of Hormozgan Province along the border with Kerman Province and stretching into southern part of Sistan and Baluchestan Province. With an elevation of 2185 metres, Mount Buniken (Kuh-e Buniken) is the highest point of the range located in the western section of the Bashagard Mountains, east of Sardasht in Bashagard County in Hormozgan Province, and in the vicinity of a place that marks the borders of Kerman, Hormozgan, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. Made of ophiolite, an assemblage of mafic igneous rocks representing remnants of former oceanic crust, the mountain range was formed finally in the Miocene and the Pliocene during the Alpine orogeny. The mountain range is located in a region with a hot semi-desert climate.\n\nPeaks\nMorderaz\nPassage 9:\nMingli Sar\nMinglik Sar (Urdu: منگلی سر) is a mountain located in the Shimshal valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.   The mountain, located in the Karakoram mountain range, is 6050 meters high and located at the southernmost part of the Pamir mountain range. It was first climbed in 1988 by the famous Pakistani climber Nazir Sabir.  Shimshal lake sits at the base of the mountain. China is located to the north, while to the left is the Hindukush mountain range. K2 is located on the south eastern side of the valley.\nDespite being climbed many times in the summer, it is a nearly impossible task in the months before June. The snow is deep and it requires extreme mountaineering, climbing and alpine experience. It has been attempted several times for winter ascents but none have been successful.\nSummers are beautiful in the area and the base camp can be set close to the summit and several attempts can be made.\n\nGuinness World Records\nThe Guinness World Record for the world's highest altitude dance party and the world's highest altitude DJ set were performed on Miniglik Sar in July, 2020 at the height of 5,909 metres. This record was made by local musicians and mountaineers under the banner of Team Khimor, and was supported by HBL as a part of their CSR initiative. The team-members included Nosher Ali Khan Zapoo, DJ Ghasuray, Saad Ata Barcha, Zulqarnain Saleem, Ali Musa, Rameez Ahmed, Mohsin Kamal, Junaid Alam, Noman Asmet, and Misyab Khan (all hailing from Hunza, Pakistan).\nPassage 10:\nDistaghil Sar\nDisteghil Sar or Distaghil Sar (Urdu: دستاغل سر) is the highest mountain in the Shimshal Valley, part of the Karakoram mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the 19th-highest mountain on Earth, the 7th-highest in Pakistan, and the first of the high peaks after Shishapangma to be the tallest independent summit of its own subrange. Disteghil sar is a Wakhi language word suggested by the Wakhi people of Shimshal, meaning \"above the inner ranch.\" The mountain has a 3-kilometre-long (1.9 mi) top ridge above 7,400 meters elevation, with three distinct summits: Northwest, 7885 m; Central, 7760 m; and Southeast, 7696m or 7535m.\n\nClimbing history\nDistaghil Sar was first climbed in 1960 by Günther Stärker and Diether Marchart of an Austrian expedition led by Wolfgang Stefan. The expedition climbed the western part of the south face and continued over the southwest ridge to the highest summit. Three years earlier, in 1957, an English expedition had attempted to climb the mountain from the south and the west, but failed due to bad weather. Likewise, weather foiled a 1959 Swiss attempt over the southeast ridge.\nThe highest, western summit has been scaled twice since in 1980 and 1982 over the original route. Two attempts over the daunting north face, in 1988 and 1998, were unsuccessful. The eastern summit was first climbed in 1980 by a Polish expedition over the east face, and was reascended in 1983.\n\nSee also\nList of mountains in Pakistan\nHighest Mountains of the World", "answers": ["Karakoram mountain range"], "length": 2466, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a5b6031f24f2af89a8ea917c39ba1652e5608649660bb138"}

The Company of Five ran for one series of six episodes.\n\nSynopsis\nA man walks through central London on his way to a job interview, perceiving his surroundings as resembling a zoo. He behaves oddly, bumping into people, speaking gibberish, and avoiding the cracks between paving stones. Meanwhile, Johnson (Ray Smith), the boss of the Bideawhile Organisation, a hotel chain and leisure conglomerate, is trying to persuade his colleague Mr James (Cyril Luckham) that the methods of a new consultant he has contracted from the Transatlantic Corporation will aid their ability to identify potential employees who may suffer from stress and poor health. Johnson is taken aback when the consultant, Parker (Derek Godfrey), arrives wearing an obviously false nose, but Mr James is unfazed.\nThe man seen earlier, Wilkie (John Neville), arrives for his interview, and is kept waiting on Parker's insistence as a test of his vulnerability. He is interviewed for a management position by Mr James and by Parker—who is now wearing a woman's blonde wig. Wilkie displays extensive knowledge, from the financial and business press, of the company's history and prospects—which he does not think are very promising. He is repeatedly shocked that the firm does not possess a computer. Parker, meanwhile, insists on knowing about Wilkie's relationship with his mother; also about any bedwetting; and pounces on him when he admits to suffering from headaches. Parker concludes (correctly) that Wilkie is recovering from a nervous breakdown.\nAfter Mr James recites a limerick with lines ending on 'Bristol' and 'pistol', Wilkie aims his gun at the two men. Now intent on revenge, he recounts a story about the 'Rary', a (fictional) now-extinct species, and threatens Mr Parker for his insulting fixations. Johnson returns to the office, but flees. He tells the receptionist (Ann Bell) that he should never have taken on Parker. They hear two shots, but Johnson hurriedly leaves. The receptionist discovers that James and Parker are dead, and faints. She comes round at the open window to which Wilkie has moved her. He again tells his 'Rary' story, before jumping to his death from a window of the tall office block.\n\nReputation\nThe recording of \"Shaggy Dog\" was long thought to be lost; its rediscovery was announced in January 2005. The play's director Gareth Davies recalled the work as \"a sad piece about a madman applying for a job. Not a great play. A sort of sour joke.\" Once described as \"perhaps the most bizarre of all Potter's single plays\", it shows Potter continuing with themes begun in The Confidence Game in 1965. \"Shaggy Dog\" has been issued on DVD in Region 2, along with the other plays Potter wrote for LWT.\nPassage 5:\nMartin Ruhe\nMartin Ruhe (born 1965) is a German cinematographer working on films, commercials, and music videos.

Based on the 1990 novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth, it was loosely adapted to screenplay by Rowan Joffé. The film was released on September 1, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $67 million worldwide.\n\nPlot\nJack and his lover, Ingrid, are relaxing in Sweden. As they walk in the wilderness outside their cabin, Jack becomes alarmed by a trail of footprints in the snow and pulls Ingrid towards shelter. Sniper gunshots ring out. Ingrid sees Jack pull a gun from his pocket and shoot the sniper. With little hesitation, Jack also kills Ingrid before locating and killing another armed man. He flees to Rome and contacts a man named Pavel, who insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome. Pavel sends him to Castelvecchio, a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo. Jack becomes nervous, and disposing of the cell phone that Pavel gave him, goes to nearby Castel del Monte instead, where he now uses the name Edward.\nWhile in Abruzzo, Jack contacts Pavel, who sets him up with a job. He meets a woman named Mathilde, who wants him to build her a custom sniper rifle. A local priest named Father Benedetto takes notice of Jack, and befriends him. Jack also begins patronizing a local prostitute named Clara, and they begin a relationship.\nIn the meantime, Jack suspects that he's being followed by a man, but he still meets with Mathilde in a secluded area next to a river to test the weapon. She is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks Jack to make a few more adjustments to the rifle, and to provide her with specific types of ammunition before they complete their transaction.\nLater, the man who has been following Jack attempts to assassinate him, but Jack kills him after a chase through town. The next day the priest asks Jack if he has anything to confess. Jack has been tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid, but shares nothing with the priest. When Father Benedetto tells Jack that he senses he lives in a special kind of hell, \"a place without love\", Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara and envisions a life with her.\nJack calls Pavel to ask how the Swedes found him, and Pavel tells Jack that he's losing his edge. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse. Jack takes Clara on a picnic to the same secluded river where he tested the rifle with Mathilde, and prepares to kill Clara. But when she doesn't try to kill him, Jack begins to trust Clara and agrees to meet with her later back in town.\nFinally, Jack agrees to deliver the completed weapon and ammunition to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment, he re-opens the briefcase holding it. During the drop-off with Mathilde, Jack becomes suspicious that she plans to kill him. But before anything can happen, a bus load of school children arrives. Mathilde gives Jack his payment—a thick envelope full of cash, and the two separate. As Mathilde drives away, Pavel contacts her and asks if she has killed Jack. She tells him she has not, but says she is following him.\nClara then meets Jack at a religious procession in town. Jack asks her to go away with him and she agrees. While they embrace, Mathilde attempts to shoot Jack from a nearby rooftop with the rifle that Jack built. But the rifle backfires in her face, confirming Jack's suspicion and his last-minute decision to sabotage the rifle. Seeing Mathilde fall from the roof, Jack gives Clara the envelope of cash and tells her to wait for him at the river where they had picnicked before. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers that she also works for Pavel.\nAs Jack walks away to go meet Clara, he hears someone behind him. Jack turns, and they quickly exchange gunfire. Pavel drops dead, having come to finish Mathilde's failed assassination. As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river, he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot. Jack arrives at the picnic spot, and as he sees Clara waiting for him, collapses behind the wheel of his car.\n\nCast\nProduction\nFilming began in September 2009 and took place in Castel del Monte, Sulmona, Castelvecchio Calvisio, Calascio and Campo Imperatore in the Province of L'Aquila (Abruzzo); in Rome, and in Östersund, Jämtland and other locations. As the Clooney character drives from Rome to Castel del Monte, there is an impressively long drive through the 4600-meter long San Domenico Tunnel (Galleria San Domenico) that is between the exits of Pescina and Cocullo on the A25 highway that connects Rome to Torano and Pescara. The car driven by Jack in the movie is a Fiat Tempra with Pescara licence plates.\nThe film's \"most romantic moment\", according to director Anton Corbijn—when Jack takes Clara to a restaurant of her choice, their \"actual date\"—was filmed at a restaurant in Pacentro, near Sulmona. The comic-acting waiter in this restaurant scene was directed to stand in front of a two-bulb lamp fixture so that he appeared to have \"devil's horns\". Photographs on the restaurant's walls are reportedly all of the lovers of Gabriele D'Annunzio. Clara orders Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wine for the dinner, and Corbijn said the film's company enjoyed many of the fine wines of the region during the months of production there.The film score was written and composed by German singer-songwriter (and longtime friend of Corbijn) Herbert Grönemeyer. A 1967 song called \"Window of My Eyes\" by the Dutch blues band Cuby + Blizzards is played over the ending credits. The aria \"Un bel dì, vedremo\" (\"One fine day we'll see\") from Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly can be heard in the background of one scene, and \"Tu vuò fà l'americano\" in another. In another scene, the Italian song \"La bambola\" by Patty Pravo plays.\n\nWestern films and other influences\nOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968), with Henry Fonda facing off as a villain in a gunfight, is playing on television on the back wall of a modest restaurant where Jack has been eating. In the DVD commentary, Corbijn notes this homage and says the American Western—and more specifically the Italian-American Spaghetti Westerns by Leone and others—were explicit models for The American. Corbijn also notes the Ennio Morricone scores made famous in Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), and other films. Speaking of the narrow, labyrinthine streets of the Italian hill towns where much of the action of The American occurs, Corbijn says he was thinking, in filming, of the streets of Venice and the way they appeared in Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973).Large segments of the dialogue between Jack and Clara are taken verbatim from Graham Greene's novel The Honorary Consul (1973).\n\nRelease\nMarketing\nThe first official poster was released on June 17, 2010. The first trailer was attached to Robin Hood and the second official trailer on June 19, 2010, and was attached to Jonah Hex, Grown Ups, Inception and The Other Guys.\n\nBox office\nThe American grossed $35.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $32.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total $67.9 million, against a production budget of $20 million.The film debuted to $13.2 million, including a total of $16.7 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, topping the box office. It fell 57% to $5.7 million in its second weekend, finishing third, and another 53% to $2.7 million in its third weekend.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating 66% based on 224 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"As beautifully shot as it is emotionally restrained, The American is an unusually divisive spy thriller—and one that rests on an unusually subdued performance from George Clooney.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D−\" on an A+ to F scale. The score was attributed to disappointment after the film was marketed as being action-packed instead of focusing on suspense and drama.Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that director Anton Corbijn \"holds his film to a steady, often glacial pace\", and that the result is of \"startling austerity\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, writing, \"Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in Le Samouraï, by Jean-Pierre Melville.\" Leonard Maltin called it a \"slowly paced, European-style mood piece, short on dialogue and action and long on atmosphere\".\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 28, 2010.\nPassage 8:\nRobert Baberske\nRobert Baberske (1 May 1900 – 27 March 1958) was a German cinematographer.

He grew up in a musical family of four, a brother and three sisters with most of McCann's family singing in church choirs. His father was a fan of jazz music and his mother was known to hum opera tunes around the house. As a youth, he played the tuba and drums and performed in his school's marching band. As a pianist McCann was largely self-taught. He explained he only received piano lessons for a few weeks as a six-year-old before his teacher died.\n\nCareer\nDuring his service in the U.S. Navy, McCann won a singing contest which led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After leaving the Navy, McCann moved to California and played in his own trio. He declined an offer to work in Cannonball Adderley's band so that he could dedicate himself to his own music. The trio's first job was at the Purple Onion in 1959 accompanying Gene McDaniels.The main part of McCann's career began in the early 1960s when he recorded as a pianist with his trio for Pacific Jazz. In 1969, Atlantic released Swiss Movement, an album recorded with saxophonist Eddie Harris and trumpeter Benny Bailey earlier at that year's Montreux Jazz Festival. The album contained the song \"Compared to What\", and both the album and the single reached the Billboard pop charts. \"Compared to What\" criticized the Vietnam War. The song was written by Eugene McDaniels years earlier and recorded and released as a ballad by McCann in 1966 on his album, Les McCann Plays the Hits. Roberta Flack's version appeared as the opening track on her debut album First Take (1969).\nAfter the success of Swiss Movement, McCann, primarily a piano player emphasized his vocals. He became an innovator in soul jazz merging jazz with funk, soul, and world rhythms. He was among the first jazz musicians to include electric piano, clavinet, and synthesizer in his music.\nIn 1971, he and Harris were part of a group of soul, R&B, and rock performers–including Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, Santana, and Ike & Tina Turner–who flew to Accra, Ghana, to perform a 14-hour concert for over 100,000 Ghanaians. The March 6 concert was recorded for the documentary film Soul to Soul. In 2004, the movie was released on DVD with an accompanying soundtrack album.\nMcCann had a stroke in the mid-1990s, but he returned to music in 2002 when Pump it Up was released. He has also exhibited his work as a painter and photographer.\n\nDiscography\nAs leader\nLes McCann Ltd. Plays the Truth (Pacific Jazz, 1960)\nLes McCann Ltd.

It would be later reissued on CD in 1999, with only 13 tracks. The trio performances were recorded at the same sessions that produced At Shelly's Manne-Hole (1963) and were first released on Bill Evans: The Complete Riverside Recordings (1984). The four solo performances (\"Danny Boy\", \"Like Someone in Love\", \"In Your Own Sweet Way\", and \"Easy to Love\") were recorded in a separate session in April 1962 in New York City. \"Some Other Time\" was recorded in December 1958, in New York City.\n\nReception\nThe Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states \"This is one of the finest recordings by this particular trio. Worth searching for\".\n\nTrack listing\nThe track listing differs between the original LP and the CD re-issue. This was an attempt to rationalise the Bill Evans catalogue; the LP version was essentially an expanded version of the At Shelly's Manne-Hole album with an additional 8 tracks. The 13 track 1999 CD version removes all the common tracks and adds the solo numbers recorded the month before plus Some Other Time. The CD reissue of At Shelly's Manne-Hole adds All the Things You Are, not featured on either original LP.\n1983 LP Track ListingSide 1:\n\n\"Who Cares?\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:22\n\"In a Sentimental Mood\" (Duke Ellington) - 4:23\n\"Everything Happens to Me\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:46\n\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48 *Side 2:\n\n\"Time Remembered\" (Bill Evans) - 5:37\n\"My Heart Stood Still\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:33\n\"Lover Man\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06 *\n\"Blues in F/Five\" (Chuck Israels/Bill Evans) - 5:41 *Side 3:\n\n\"Love Is Here to Stay\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 4:48 *\n\"'Round Midnight\" (Thelonious Monk, Cootie Williams) - 8:58 *\n\"Stella by Starlight\" (Victor Young, Ned Washington) - 4:59 *\n\"How About You?\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:04 *Side 4:\n\n\"Isn't It Romantic\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 4:39 *\n\"The Boy Next Door\" (Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane) - 5:24 *\n\"Wonder Why\" (Nicholas Brodzsky, Sammy Cahn) - 5:16\n\"Swedish Pastry\" (Barney Kessel) - 5:48*Indicates selections recorded on May 30, 1963, all others May 31.\n1999 CD Track Listing\n\"Danny Boy\" (Frederick Weatherly) - 10:41\n\"Like Someone in Love\" (Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen) - 6:27\n\"In Your Own Sweet Way\" (Dave Brubeck) - 2:58\n\"Easy to Love\" (Cole Porter) - 4:42\n\"Some Other Time\" (Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, Adolph Green) - 6:12\n\"Lover Man\" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) - 5:06\n\"Who Cares?\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:24\n\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" (Cole Porter) - 5:48\n\"How About You?\" (Ralph Freed, Burton Lane) - 4:06\n\"Everything Happens to Me\" (Tom Adair, Matt Dennis) - 4:47\n\"In a Sentimental Mood\" (Duke Ellington, Manny Kurtz, Irving Mills) - 4:26\n\"My Heart Stood Still\" (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) - 4:34\n\"Time Remembered\" (Bill Evans) - 5:35\n\nPersonnel\nBill Evans - piano\nChuck Israels - bass\nLarry Bunker - drums\nPassage 8:\nLive at Shelly's Manne-Hole\nLive at Shelly's Manne-Hole is an album by pianist Les McCann recorded on New Year's Eve 1965 at Shelly's Manne-Hole and released on the Limelight label.\n\nReception\nAllmusic gives the album 4 stars stating \"This album is one of the best from this artist's early acoustic days\".\n\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Les McCann except as indicated\n\n\"She Broke My Heart (And I Broke Her Jaw)\" - 4:23\n\"I'll Be On Home\" - 5:00\n\"All Alone\" (Irving Berlin) - 4:04\n\"My Friends\" - 5:15\n\"I Could Have Danced All Night\" (From My Fair Lady) (Frederick Loewe, Alan Jay Lerner) -  \t3:32\n\"That Was the Freak That Was\" - 5:35\n\"Young and Foolish\" (From Plain and Fancy) (Albert Hague, Arnold B.

The trio featured Chuck Israels, who followed Scott LaFaro on bass in autumn 1961, and Larry Bunker on drums, who just joined the reformed trio, after Paul Motian had left. An additional eight performances recorded during the trio's May, 1963 engagement at Shelly's Manne-Hole were released on the album Time Remembered.\n\nReception\nWriting for Allmusic, music critic Daniel Gioffre wrote of the album: \"This particular trio may lack some of the sheer combustive force of the better-known lineup, but it is, if possible, even more sensitive, melancholic, and nostalgic than the previous band...

Andrews attended Hitherfield Primary School in South-East London before moving with his family to Park North, Swindon, at the age of seven. He attended Park North Junior School, Richard Jefferies Secondary School and Park Senior High School, leaving full-time education in 1976.\n\nCareer\nOn leaving school, Andrews played keyboards in covers bands in Swindon and Exeter before joining XTC in 1978. He played on the band’s first two albums, White Music and Go 2, before leaving in 1979. That same year, he recorded the solo EP Town and Country (Virgin) and played on Iggy Pop’s Soldier (Arista) with David Bowie, Ivan Král, Glen Matlock, Klaus Krüger and Steve New.\nIn 1980 he recorded the single Rossmore Road/Win a Night Out with a Well-Known Paranoiac on Virgin. Also in 1980, Andrews joined Robert Fripp's The League of Gentlemen with Sara Lee and Jonny TooBad. They recorded one album for E.G. Records before Fripp dismissed the band. Andrews then formed Restaurant for Dogs with Kevin Wilkinson, Dave Marx and Bruce McRae. Latterly Clare Hirst, Sara Lee and Carlo Asciutti joined the band.\n\nIn 1981, Andrews met up with bassist Dave Allen who had recently left Gang of Four and the pair, along with guitarist/vocalist Carl Marsh, formed Shriekback. Shriekback have been active for 41 years, recording 17 studio albums. \n\nIn 2003, Andrews began releasing solo projects through his own Shriekprods label. These form two main strands: the Haunted Box of Switches series of piano and voice albums which feature original material alongside minimalist reimaginings of Shriekback songs; and the Stic Basin series of albums of experimental electronica, of which there are now three volumes.\nIn 2005, Andrews played keyboards on Brian Eno’s album Another Day on Earth. 2007 saw Andrews reunite with former XTC bandmate Andy Partridge alongside Shriekback drummer Martyn Barker on Monstrance, a double album of instrumental improvisations. In 2015, Andrews recorded a six-track EP called Juju Grid with Mike Tournier from Fluke, under the name of Anaxaton6. Contaminated Pop in 2019 was Andrews’ first solo album released under his own name.\nDuring a six-year hiatus from music from 1996 to 2001, Andrews began to design furniture and sculpture and studied for a degree in 3D Design in Metals at Camberwell and Middlesex universities. He also ran The Hoxton Gift Shop with Régine de la Hey in 2001, a gallery which sold original artworks.\n\nPersonal life\nAndrews lives in London and Stroud, Gloucestershire. He has a son, Finn Andrews, the lead singer/songwriter of The Veils, from his marriage to Vivienne Kent in the early 1980s.\n\nDiscography\nPassage 2:\nHoppípolla\n\"Hoppípolla\" (pronounced [ˈhɔʰpiˌpʰɔtl̥a]) is a song by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós from their 2005 album Takk.... It was released as the album's second single on 28 November 2005. The song title is a univerbation of hoppa í polla (the -a in hoppa is not pronounced), which is Icelandic for \"hopping into puddles\", and the lyrics are mainly in Icelandic, with some nonsensical phrases, a \"language\" the band calls Vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"). As with many of the band's songs, it was given a nickname in the early stages of writing. \"Hoppípolla\" was \"The Money Song\", as the band was certain they had written a song which would have commercial success.\"Hoppípolla\" is the band's most successful single, charting at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart in May 2006. It is also considered the best-known song within its genre. The single also features \"Með blóðnasir\", an instrumental coda to \"Hoppípolla\", which is also featured on Takk...; and a studio remake of \"Hafssól\", a song previously released on the band's 1997 debut album, Von. The title appears as \"Hafsól\" on the single.\n\nTrack listings\nCD (CDEM 673) / 12-inch (12EM 673)\n\n\"Hoppípolla\" – 4:36\n\"Með blóðnasir\" – 2:24\n\"Hafsól\" (2005 version) – 9:477-inch (EM 673)\n\n\"Hoppípolla\" – 4:36\n\"Heysátan\" – 4:09\n\nMusic video\nA promotional music video for \"Hoppípolla,\" directed by Arni & Kinski, was filmed in November 2005. It depicts two groups of elderly friends strolling around the suburbs of Reykjavík and acting like children; pulling pranks on people and battling with water balloons and wooden swords near a cemetery. When one old man is injured and suffers a nosebleed (as referenced in the lyrics), the opponents run away in fear, while the others celebrate their victory. The video shows several shots of the friends \"hopping in puddles\" of water along a path.\nThe band members are featured in the video: keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson plays the victim of a Knock, Knock, Ginger trick, guitarist and vocalist Jón Þór Birgisson plays the cashier at a shop where an old man steals and eats some pears, drummer Orri Páll Dýrason can be seen repairing his bicycle, and bassist Georg Hólm can be seen cleaning.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nChicane cover version – \"Poppiholla\"\nIn July 2009, Chicane released an instrumental re-work of the song, titled \"Poppiholla\" and released it as a five track single EP on 13 July 2009. \"Poppiholla\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven on 19 July 2009, spending three weeks in the top ten as of 2 August 2009. A video to promote the song was made, and Chicane's The Best of Chicane collection was re-released to include the song. The re-released album reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, beating the compilation's previous peak of number 16 (without \"Poppiholla\" on it). The song was used in the UK by Sky Sports for their coverage of the Guinness Premiership in 2009–10.\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nRelease history\nUse in film and television\n\"Hoppípolla\" was used in 2006 advertisements for the BBC's Planet Earth television series, giving the band exposure to a mainstream audience. A high demand for the single led to it being republished in May 2006, distributed by EMI. This re-release of the single brought critical acclaim for the band in the mainstream music media. It was used again in 2016 for Planet Earth II, as well as Blue Planet II the following year.\nThe song has been used as background music in BBC shows, including dramas, documentaries and its 2006 football coverage. It appeared in the trailers for the films Children of Men and Slumdog Millionaire, the soundtrack of the 2006 film Penelope, the 2011 film We Bought a Zoo, and the 2021 film The Mitchells vs. the Machines, the latter of which was composed by Jónsi and has been used in advertisements for Thomson Reuters, Oxfam and Viasat. The song has also been used in the film of Italian capital Rome's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. While it does not appear on the film's soundtrack album, it is also featured in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\nPassage 3:\nLike Light to the Flies\n\"Like Light to the Flies\" (or \"Like Light\", as it is often referred to) is a song by American heavy metal band Trivium and is the first single and music video from their 2005 album, Ascendancy. The band originally considered using the song \"Ember to Inferno\" as their first single but changed their minds after recording this song (along with \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\" and \"The Deceived\"). \"Like Light\" was released in January 2005 and features a mix of screaming and singing. The song contains two guitar solos which are played nearly consecutively to sound as one longer solo; a small interlude is played in the middle of them. The music video features original member Brent Young, and the version of the song used in the video is not the album version but rather the demo version, found previously on the MTV compilation album MTV2 Headbanger's Ball: Volume 2.\n\nMeaning\n\"This song is about people's attraction to all forms of tragedy. It seems like everywhere you turn to today (e.g., television, newspaper, magazine, movies, etc.) it's all about murder, violence, war, cruelty- and it's because this is what sells; people are totally captivated by subjects in this vein.

Prior to the album, Trademarc appeared on Cena's first WWE DVD Word Life.\nIn August 2007, Trademarc appeared at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) Hard Justice pay-per-view as the \"new boyfriend\" of Karen Angle, later revealed to be a ruse when Karen and Trademarc helped Karen's \"estranged\" husband Kurt Angle win the match. He appeared again on iMPACT! the next week. While working with TNA he also re-recorded Kurt Angle's entrance music, mixing in a rap he did over a Lunatic Fringe beat with the TNA-composed \"My Quest\" to form the hip hop theme \"Gold Medal\". In 2008, he released his first solo debut album Inferiority Complex.\n\nEast Coast Avengers\nIn August 2008, Tha Trademarc collaborated with Massachusetts rappers Esoteric and DC The Midi Alien to create the East Coast Avengers. Their group debut album Prison Planet was released in late 2008. The group released their song \"Kill Bill O'Reilly\" which caused a media controversy due to lyrics that centered on violently killing Bill O'Reilly. Michelle Malkin's criticism of the song led to the group recording \"Dear Michelle\" in response.

In October, Cena and Billy Kidman took part in a tag team tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions of the SmackDown! brand, losing in the first round. The next week, Cena turned on and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss, becoming a villain. Shortly after the Kidman attack, on a Halloween themed episode of SmackDown, Cena dressed as Vanilla Ice performing a freestyle rap. The next week, Cena received a new character: a rapper who cuts promos while rhyming.He performed his own theme song, \"Basic Thugonomics\", and it was featured on the WWE soundtrack album WWE Originals. He also recorded a song, \"Untouchables\", for the company's next soundtrack album WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6. He collaborated on the song H-U-S-T-L-E remix along with Murs, E-40, and Chingo Bling.

Having recorded the album with Cena, Predka was featured on virtually every track of the album. Production was handled by Jake One. The song contains samples of \"Ante Up\" by M.O.P. which in turn samples \"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar\" by Sam & Dave, and Pete Schofield and The Canadians' rendition of \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" originally by Vicki Lawrence.On October 14, 2008, M.O.P. filed suit in a New York Federal Court against Sony BMG, Stephanie Music Publishing, Cherry Lane Music Publishing Company, WWE and John Cena. The group alleged that Cena and the WWE stole parts of their song \"Ante Up\" for his theme song, arguing that the song was unlawfully sampled and clearly repeated three times, during the introduction, the second and third chorus. M.O.P. sought the destruction of the song and $150,000 in damages. They dropped the lawsuit two months later.\n\nUsage in video games\nThe song was used in the video games WWE Day of Reckoning 2, Scooby Doo: WrestleMania, SmackDown! vs RAW 2006, SmackDown vs RAW 2007, SmackDown vs RAW 2008, SmackDown vs RAW 2009, SmackDown vs RAW 2010, SmackDown vs RAW 2011, WWE All Stars, WWE '12, WWE '13, WWE 2K14, WWE 2K15, WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17,  WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19,WWE 2K20, WWE 2K Battlegrounds, WWE 2K22, and WWE 2K23.\nPassage 8:\nFresh Azimiz\n\"Fresh Azimiz\" (\"fresh as I'm is\") is a single featured on rapper Bow Wow's 2005 album Wanted. It is the third song after his singles \"Let Me Hold You\" with singer Omarion and \"Like You\" with Ciara. It features J-Kwon & Jermaine Dupri. The song was produced by Jermaine Dupri. The song became his third Top 40 single from his 2005 album Wanted, peaking at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAlthough released through Columbia Records, the lyrics on the 2nd verse of the original song explains that Bow Wow still has close ties to So So Def Recordings (\"Records say Columbia, but I'm So So man\").\n\nRumored diss to Romeo\nRumors circulated that the song was meant to attack rapper Lil' Romeo, with the line, \"18 nigga, making more than your Dad.\" The line in question is actually borrowed from LL Cool J's song, \"The Do Wop\" on the classic album Bigger and Deffer. Bow Wow later confirmed that the line was not aimed at Miller's father,  Master P or  Miller himself. Because of that, Romeo dedicated the song of God's Gift entitled \"U Can't Shine Like Me\" with the line \"You a Mama's boy I'm a son of a hustler\".\n\nLive performance\nOn April 1, 2006, Bow Wow performed \"Fresh Azimiz\" at the 2006 Kids' Choice Awards as part of a musical duel with singer Chris Brown that was inspired by the 1986 Run-D.M.C. music video \"Walk This Way\".\n\nRemix\nA remix of this song features rapper Mike Jones, replacing Bow Wow's 2nd verse. There is a video for the remix, with additional scenes with Bow Wow & Jones throughout the video and Bow Wow's verse removed and Mike Jones' instead comes in and raps. Jones also makes an appearance on the original version's video.\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nPassage 9:\nSpiritual Unity (Marc Ribot album)\nSpiritual Unity is a 2005 album by guitarist Marc Ribot released on Pi Recordings.

{"input": "The Pappas house is the largest of the Usonian Automatics built after a house located in what village?", "context": "Passage 1:\nGerald B. and Beverley Tonkens House\nThe Gerald B. and Beverley Tonkens House, also known as the Tonkens House, is a single story private residence designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954. The house was commissioned by Gerald B. Tonkens (an automobile dealer) and his first wife Rosalie. It is located in Amberley Village, a village in Hamilton County, Ohio.\nWright designed the home in the Usonian Automatic style. It is considered one of the finest and most intact examples of Usonian Automatic architecture ever produced and was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1991.\n\nDescription\nThe Tonkens House is a single story, three bedroom, two bathroom private residence, designed in the Usonian Automatic style. The house is situated on a partially developed 3.54-acre property in Amberley Village, Ohio and measures some 2,100 square feet. An early 20th-century guest cottage also occupies the property, a remnant of its earlier use as a farm.\nThe Usonian Automatic style was Frank Lloyd Wright's final architectural period and is based on a modular design system that employed interlocking, precast concrete blocks. It was first conceived by Wright in the wake of the Depression in 1936 and later developed as a response to a lack of low-cost housing and rising construction costs following World War Two.\nLike many of Wright's Usonian style buildings, the floor plan of the Tonkens House mimics the shape of a polliwog. The tail of the polliwog is represented by the bedroom wing, with each room opening off into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway leads into 'the body' of the house, which consists of a bright and expansive living room or Great Room, alongside a kitchen and foyer. The configuration allowed for additional rooms to be added to the bedroom wing if required. The Great Room was designed as a large, warm and welcoming space, a room in which the family and their guests could gather throughout the day and night.\nThe master bedroom contains an en-suite and private study, which opens off to a private patio. Ceilings in the bedroom wing are low (7.5 feet) and gilded in 18 karat gold leaf. On the other hand, those in the Great Room, kitchen and foyer are high (10.5 feet and 13.5 feet respectively) and unembellished. The Great Room contains a cantilevered fireplace and east-facing wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and French doors that open onto a lanai at the rear of the house. Philippine mahogany was used for interior paneling and furniture. Piano hinges (hinges extending from the top to the bottom of a door) were used for all doors in the house, including closet doors.The house was constructed using eleven styles of precast concrete blocks, reinforced by steel rods. It has a total of 492 windows, which consist of glass contained within the precast concrete blocks. Instead of gutters, copper flashing and downspouts allow for water to run off the roof, which is protected by insulation, a rubber membrane and pea gravel.Two Wright designed gates guard a Cherokee red concrete driveway leading towards the house. The dwelling has no garage or basement, keeping with Wright's well known dislike for such spaces. Instead, two carports—divided by concrete and glass pillars—and two storage sheds occupy the property.\n\nHistory\nGerald B. Tonkens was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1919 where he was exposed to many examples of Frank Lloyd Wright’s architecture from a young age. This had a lasting effect on Tonkens, who later stated “I always admired Mr Wright’s work. I always knew that I would never build a house on my own unless it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright”.After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in the early 1940s, Tonkens joined the U.S military, fighting with the Eighth Air Force during World War Two. Tonkens met and married his first wife, Red Cross nurse, Rosalie Robbins, while stationed with the military in Europe.By 1953 the couple had two daughters and decided to move to Hamilton County, where Gerald established the 'Tonkens Oldsmobile-Cadillac' dealership in Hamilton, Ohio. In 1954 Gerald and Rosalie purchased a 2.75 acre block in Amberley Village, Ohio for $6,000. The land was cheap in comparison to surrounding lots, many of which sold for an average price of $25,000 per acre. When Rosalie queried the price, she was told that the property was considered a “problem lot” as no architect had been able to engineer a driveway up the steep incline from the road to the house. When this was raised with Wright, he replied \"They built the Suez Canal, didn't they? We'll go right up the middle with a big shovel\".Once the purchase was finalized, the couple who were on a tight budget, yet still wanted a Frank Lloyd Wright-esque home, approached a local architect who had studied under Wright in the 1930s. Although early meetings were successful, Gerald and Rosalie were ultimately unhappy with the architect's design and cancelled their agreement in early 1954. After some discussion, they decided to contact Wright himself with a proposal for the house and a budget of $25,000.  Shortly thereafter, Wright invited them to Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin to discuss the design. Their meeting was a success and the first half of 1954 was spent discussing designs via letter and telegram between the Tonkens and Wright's personal assistant Eugene Beyer \"Gene\" Masselink. In mid-1954 Wright asked if the couple would be interested in being his ‘guinea pigs’ stating his desire to design their home as “an experiment in Usonian Automatic architecture”. They agreed, and Wright's preliminary designs for the home were completed in October of the same year.\nDrawings for the Tonkens House were completed by Frank Lloyd Wright, his grandson and apprentice, Eric Lloyd Wright, and John H. \"Jack\" Howe. John deKoven Hill and Cornelia Brierly were landscape designers on the project. Engineering drawings were completed by William Wesley Peters, Edmond Thomas \"Tom\" Casey and Mendel Glickman. Glickman was also solely responsible for the ceiling block engineering.  Furniture, upholstery and fabric selections for the house were supervised by John deKoven Hill. Final drawings and specifications were presented to Gerald and Rosalie on February 25, 1955, and approved soon after. The 'Tonkens House' would be assigned project number 5510 by the Taliesin Foundation.The final design featured three bedrooms, one study, two bathrooms, Philippine mahogany paneling throughout, a grand living room (the Great Room) with a cantilevered fireplace, two carports and two storage sheds. A comprehensive furniture plan included built-in pieces as well as Frank Lloyd Wright designed furniture from his collection for Henredon Furniture, and Wright designed upholstery.\nThe house remained in the Tonkens family for over six decades, until it was sold to a private buyer in 2015.\n\nConstruction\nThe Tonkens hired local contractor, Horace Wersel, to be the project lead and Cincinnati firm Harvard Construction Co. to build the house. The construction of the Tonkens House was overseen by the Taliesin Fellowship, which was represented by Eric Lloyd Wright. Wright spent over a year living in Cincinnati while overseeing the construction of the home. Such close supervision was unusual, and the Tonkens House was the first Usonian Automatic structure to be solely directed by a Taliesin fellow.\nThe home incorporated Wright's iconic precast concrete blocks. These were made using metal molds into which concrete was poured and then set. The Tonkens house is built using eleven block variations, which allowed for infinite modifications to the design. Masonry subcontractors were used to lay the foundation, while carpentry subcontractors were used to lay the blocks. Blocks were two feet wide by one foot high for walls, and two feet high by two feet wide for ceilings. Blocks were adhered to a reinforced concrete slab, unlike Wright's Californian homes, in which ceiling blocks were adhered to wooden slabs. Concrete blocks for the Tonkens House were made as a lightweight cinder block. Because cinder blocks are porous, a sand based sealer was applied to the exterior of the building to waterproof the house.\n\nBy mid-1955 the total cost of construction, including Wright's 10 percent fee and additional costs for interior furnishings, was up to $59,000. The increase was due in part to rising values of materials such as steel, concrete and wood.  Complications associated with casting concrete blocks also raised construction costs. Expenditure continued to increase throughout the duration of the construction and Cindy Damschroder estimates that the final cost of construction was likely to have been around $118,000.\nThe Tonkens House was completed in late-July 1956. Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959. Prior to his death he was in the midst of designing the Beth Sholom Congregation in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, as well as a number of residential homes. Therefore, he would never see the completed Tonkens House. He did however meet with the Tonkens soon after it was completed, presenting them with a hand signed, Cherokee red glazed tile to attest his approval of the home. The tile was permanently placed on the exterior wall, just outside the front entrance.\n\nVariations in design\nOver the eighteen month construction period, a number of minor changes were made to the original design. These included modifying the driveway, installing additional electrical outlets to the exterior of the house and increasing the size of the master bedroom.  A pool was included in initial designs and registered by Taliesin. In late 1955, Eric Lloyd Wright proposed that the pool be relocated as it was positioned above solid ground, with only earth fill below.  Although the pool was relocated and re-sized, it was never built. A cabana and covered porch were also envisioned for the home, but these did not make it onto the final designs.\n\nRepair and restoration\nIn July 2001, renovations were undertaken to restore and upgrade the home's aging roof, original plumbing, wiring and kitchen. During this time, a heavy rainstorm hit the Greater Cincinnati area. In addition to flooding more than 70 homes and killing three people, strong winds blew protective tarp off the roof, exposing it to the heavy downpour. The Philippine mahogany walls and cabinetry in the living room, dining room and kitchen all suffered significant water damage, as did the home's precast concrete block ceiling. These elements required replacement, a project that took almost a year to complete. Care was taken to ensure the renovations were sympathetic to the original design and character of the home and it continues to be the only largely unaltered Frank Lloyd Wright house in the Greater Cincinnati area.In mid-2015, the new roof was found to have failed. Additional repairs are currently underway, a complex task due to the unique design of the structure.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\n\nNotes\nStorrer, William Allin.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The client for this house was the editor of the Chicago Daily News. This is a two-story house located near the Des Plaines River.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 3:\nA. H. Bulbulian Residence\nThe A. H. Bulbulian Residence is a house located at 1229 Skyline Drive, Rochester, Minnesota, United States.  Designed by noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright it was completed in 1947 for Arthur H. Bulbulian, a pioneer in the field of facial prosthetics. It is down the street from the Thomas Keys House and not far from the James McBean Residence, all three examples of Wright's Usonian genre of architecture. The Bulbulian Residence is a one-story house built with one 120-degree angle, and is constructed of cement brick and cypress. The house has recently been restored to near-original condition.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 4:\nTheodore A. Pappas House\nThe Theodore A. Pappas House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian house in St. Louis, Missouri. The Pappas house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, when it was only 15 years old. It is one of two houses in St. Louis designed by Wright, and the only Usonian Automatic in Missouri. Wright designed it between 1955 and 1959 at the Pappas’ request, and Theodore and Bette Pappas built the house together with the help of day laborers between 1960 and 1964. The Pappas house is a rambling four-bedroom house, and after the Gerald B. and Beverley Tonkens House, is the largest of the Usonian Automatics built.\nThe entire body of the Pappas House, including the roof, is made up of plain concrete blocks standardized to a module. These blocks were placed on top of and next to one another with no mortar. The hidden sides of each block had hollows through which steel rods were inserted, running vertically and horizontally, creating a \"knit\" effect. Grout was used to fill the hollows after the rods were in place. Theoretically, all elements of the house could be manufactured and sent to the owners as a sort of “do-it-yourself” kit, the “automatic” aspect of an Usonian Automatic. However, metal molds for the blocks were not available, and the blocks had to be cast in molds created by a local craftsman. The concrete was pretinted according to Wright's idea that color should be in and not on the surface. The color scheme throughout the house is monochromatic, a warm natural, earthen color, complemented by a uniform unstained Philippine mahogany for trim and built in furniture. (Storrer, 422)\nIn 1985, Bette Pappas wrote a book titled \"No Passing Fancy\" (ASIN B000IZVEES) about her house. Bette Pappas died at the home in February 2018 at the age of 91.In 2020, the house was sold by the Pappas children to the Frank Lloyd Wright Revival Initiative, a non-profit created by filmmaker Michael Miner.  It is anticipated the house will be refurbished and turned into a museum and event center. In May 2021, the house was opened for public tours by appointment.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 5:\nRobert H. Sunday House\nThe Robert H. Sunday House is located in Marshalltown, Iowa, United States.  It was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Usonian style, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  Initially the Sunday's choose the Usonian Automatic, a natural concrete block model, for their home.  When it provided unworkable, Wright sent the plans for this house. In style and materials it is very similar to the 1953 Usonian Exhibition House.  It was the sixth of seven houses designed by Wright and built in this style in Iowa.  Sunday, who owned Marshall Lumber in Marshalltown, acted as his own general contractor.  In fact, he and his wife did much of the work themselves.  It is also believed to be last of this style built in brick.  John H. \"Jack\" Howe, a Wright assistant who supervised the initial construction, designed an addition to this house in 1970 that conforms seamlessly with the original.  It includes the family room, family room terrace, and the dining room.  The original house followed an \"L\" shaped plan, and with the addition it is now a \"T\" shaped plan.  Howe had previously designed (1964) the building for Sunday's business.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 6:\nGildersleeve House\nThe Gildersleeve House was a house located at 108 Broadway in Hudson, Illinois. Settler James T. Gildersleeve built the Greek Revival house for his family in 1836. Gildersleeve founded the village of Hudson and named it after the area of New York where he formerly lived. The house was the village's first frame house and was its finest home in its early years; as a result, it hosted local events and was the village's first post office. Gildersleeve planted five oak trees outside the house; the trees grew together at their base, giving the house the name \"Five Oaks\". The house was demolished in 2000.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 28, 1977, and was delisted in 2020.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nHause House\nThe Hause House project was one of the many un-built works designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1939.  This building structure was one of his Usonian designs that was a short-tailed rectangular plan to be located in Lansing, Michigan.  Although the structure was never built, it was developed into working drawings and was utilized in the creation of another Frank Lloyd Wright design for the Florida Southern College Faculty House.  The Hause House was a Usonian based on the design of wood board and batten exterior as many of them are, while the Florida Southern College Faculty House was a concrete structure.  Many similarities are seen on each floor plan with only minor changes due to the Hause projects site location.\nPassage 8:\nPaul J. and Ida Trier House\nThe Paul J. and Ida Trier House is a historic building located in Johnston, Iowa, United States. It is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home that was constructed in 1958.  It was the last of seven Wright Usonians built in Iowa.  While it is now located in a residential area, it was constructed in an area surrounded by rural farmland.  The Trier house is a variation on the 1953 Exhibition House at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.  The north wing of the house was designed by Taliesin Associates and built in 1967.  It was originally the carport, which was enclosed for a playroom.  The present carport on the front and an extension of the shop was added at the same time.\nThe exterior of the house is composed of hollow clay tile blocks, while the addition is brick matching the tiles.  A low, flat roof caps the home.  The interior features red concrete slab floors, with the exception of the kitchen where they are slate.  Philippine mahogany is used for the woodwork.  A large fireplace is located in the living room.  The living room, kitchen, and bedrooms all face south with window walls in the living room and master bedroom.  A deep overhang shades the rooms in the summer.  The other bedrooms and the study have a band of windows.  Typical of a Wright-designed home, the house is integrated into the site and opened to the outdoors.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nPassage 9:\nRitcher House\nThe Ritcher House is considered to be one of the best examples of Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian mode of design in North Carolina. Located near downtown Raleigh, the house is one of many Modernist houses that were built in the city during the mid-20th century. Most of these homes were designed by faculty members of the North Carolina State University School of Design. Established in 1948 by Henry Kamphoefner, the school hired several Modernist architects as faculty members. Kamphoefner was awarded the North Carolina Award for Fine Arts in 1978 for his work and for his encouragement of other Modernists to build and design homes in the state. On September 21, 1994, the Ritcher House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is also a Raleigh Historic Landmark.George Matsumoto, a professor teaching architectural classes at North Carolina State University, designed the Ritcher House in 1951 along with Henry Kamphoefner. The house was built on a modest budget and is an example of modular constructivism and timber framing.\n\nSee also\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\nPassage 10:\nZimmerman House (Manchester, New Hampshire)\nThe Zimmerman House is a house museum in the North End neighborhood of Manchester, New Hampshire. Built in 1951, it is the first of two houses in New Hampshire designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (the other is the Toufic H. Kalil House, built in 1955 on the same street), and one of a modest number of Wright designs in the northeastern United States. The house was built for Dr. Isadore Zimmerman and his wife Lucille. The house is now owned by the Currier Museum of Art because of the Zimmermans' decision to donate the home to the public after their death. The museum provides tours of the building, which is the only legal access to the grounds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Zimmerman House is located in a residential setting in northern Manchester, New Hampshire. It is a single-story structure, set on a floating concrete slab. It is organized around a large L-shaped central chimney, and covered by a deeply overhanging roof. The rooms are arranged in a single line, except with an open carport at one end. The interior is largely finished in cypress wood.\nThe house was designed in 1950 by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian style for Dr. Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman. It has two bedrooms, is based on a four-foot module, and is constructed of red glazed brick with Georgia cypress trim (less expensive than tidewater cypress). John Geiger, then an apprentice in Wright's Taliesin Fellowship, was sent to New Hampshire to supervise the construction of the Zimmerman house. He was responsible for the completion of the project and much of its final changes for the clients. Wright redesigned the house around a rock just outside the front entrance. Wright's design extended to include the interior furniture and furnishings. This includes a musical quartet stand, as well as the mailbox. Wright also specified the plantings for the garden.The property was maintained by the Zimmermans according to Wright's plan, and was donated to the Currier Museum of Art in 1988. The museum offers tours of the property with shuttle service to the house, in order to minimize traffic in the residential neighborhood. No other access to the property is permitted.\n\nSee also\nList of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire", "answers": ["Amberley Village"], "length": 3704, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8e6601795d9fc7f058d0ddda2a16f2529eadaada16a006d0"}

It is the sister resort of the Walt Disney World Swan. Both hotels were designed by Michael Graves. The Dolphin opened on June 4, 1990, as part of a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company, Tishman Hotel Corporation, MetLife and Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which was merged into Marriott International in 2019. The land the resort occupies is owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the buildings themselves are leased by Disney to the Tishman Hotel Corporation and MetLife but operated by Marriott International under the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts brand. The Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin are a part of the Walt Disney Collection of resorts; because of this they are Disney branded and guests of the resort have access to special Disney benefits available to Disney Resort Hotel guests only.\n\nThe Dolphin and Swan share similar elements, but each has a distinctive appearance. The Dolphin is composed of a 257-foot (78 m) tall triangular tower bisecting a 12-story rectangular mass with four 9-story wings on the Swan-side of the structure. The roof of each half of the main mass is adorned with a 56-foot (17 m) tall Dolphin statue. On the main colored facade there is a turquoise banana-leaf pattern echoed by a similar wave pattern on the Swan.\n The statues on top of the Dolphin hotel are not mammalian dolphins, but a stylized version of a nautical dolphin, a common symbol used on old world nautical maps. The design of the creatures is based on Triton Fountain in Rome.\nIn 2008, The Walt Disney Dolphin Resort was awarded a One Palm Designation through the Florida Green Lodging Program, established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nDining\nFine dining\nTodd English's BlueZoo - Seafood\nShula's Steak House - Steak and Seafood\n\nCasual dining\nCabana Bar and Beach Club - Poolside\nThe Fountain - Food and Ice Cream Shop\n\nQuick service\nFuel - Snacks and Treats\nPicabu - Cafeteria Style Restaurant\n\nLounges\nShula's Lounge\nTodd English's Bluezoo Lounge\nPhins\n\nHistory\nIn the late 1980s, Disney saw that they were losing business to area hotels that catered to conventions and large meetings, so Michael Eisner decided to build a convention-oriented hotel near Epcot. The Tishman Group, the contractor who was hired to build Epcot and who also had hotels in the nearby Disney hotel zone, claimed that the Epcot deal gave them exclusive rights to operate convention hotels on the Disney property, so Disney partnered with Tishman to develop the Swan and Dolphin complex. The Swan was managed by Westin Hotels & Resorts, and the Dolphin by Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. Eisner had used Graves for other company projects and wanted to continue to build striking, unique buildings.Tishman and MetLife own the buildings, but have a 99-year lease on the land from Disney. Disney also receives a share of the hotel's revenues, and has a say in any design or architecture changes to the interior or exterior of the buildings.\n\nWalt Disney World privileges\nWalt Disney World Swan and Dolphin guests are provided complimentary transportation to all Walt Disney World theme parks and attractions on the Disney Transportation System, via boat (to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios). Length-of-stay park passes are available, as is package delivery from Disney theme park shops to the resort. There is a Walt Disney World guest services desk located in the lobby of each resort. Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin guests can also use Extra Magic Hours, and can make dining reservations 60 days prior to their arrival at the resort. However, room charging (using hotel key as a credit card at Walt Disney World) is not available and hotel restaurants only participate in the Tables in Wonderland Dining Plan, not the Disney Dining Plan. Room charging within the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort Complex is available. Also, guests staying at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin have free theme park parking and priority access to the Disney theme parks during sell out situations.\nPassage 3:\n2012 Ms. Olympia\nThe 2012 Ms. Olympia contest was an IFBB professional bodybuilding competition and part of Joe Weider's Olympia Fitness & Performance Weekend 2012 was held on September 28, 2012, at the South Hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester, Nevada and in the Orleans Arena at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada.

{"input": "Which genus has more species, Apium or Elodea?", "context": "Passage 1:\nApium bermejoi\nHelosciadium bermejoi, synonym Apium bermejoi, is a critically endangered species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.\n\nTaxonomy\nIt is not closely related to the wild form of celery, A. graveolens, being more properly placed in the genus Helosciadium in the tribe Oenantheae.\n\nDistribution\nH. bermejoi is endemic to Menorca in the Balearic Islands of Spain, and the total population is now restricted to a single locality in the northeast part of the island. Across the two populations at this spot, there are fewer than a hundred individuals surviving.\n\nEcology\nIts natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, known as matorral.\n\nConservation\nIt was classified as 'critically endangered' in the IUCN Red List in 2006. In the European Union it has been designated as a 'priority species' under Annex II of the Habitats Directive since 1992, which means areas in which it occurs can be declared Special Areas of Conservation, if these areas belong to one of the number of habitats listed in Annex I of the directive.\nPassage 2:\nTricholoma apium\nTricholoma apium is a mushroom of the agaric genus Tricholoma that is found in Europe. It is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nSee also\nList of North American Tricholoma\nList of Tricholoma species\nPassage 3:\nApiaceae\nApiaceae () or Umbelliferae is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium and commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family, or simply as umbellifers. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera, including such well-known and economically important plants as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip and sea holly, as well as silphium, a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct.The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species, such as giant hogweed, and a smaller number of highly poisonous species, such as poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool's parsley, and various species of water dropwort.\n\nDescription\nMost Apiaceae are annual, biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as Bupleurum fruticosum.: 35  Their leaves are of variable size and alternately arranged, or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate, or pinnatifid, but simple and entire in some genera, e.g. Bupleurum. Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to fetid, but absent in some species.\nThe defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence, the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect (hermaphroditic) and actinomorphic, but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot (Daucus carota) and coriander, with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in Acronema), with a distinct calyx and corolla, but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five petals and five stamens.\nThere is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant (geitonogamy) is common. The gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of Daucus spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle Sanicula europaea and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily endosperm and often contain essential oils, containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise, cumin and coriander. The shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level.: 802\n\nTaxonomy\nApiaceae was first described by John Lindley in 1836. The name is derived from the type genus Apium, which was originally used by Pliny the Elder circa 50 AD for a celery-like plant. The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the inflorescence being generally in the form of a compound umbel. The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 Historia generalis plantarum. With Robert Morison's 1672 Plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.\nThe family is solidly placed within the Apiales order in the APG III system. It is closely related to Araliaceae and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit morphology, and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly paraphyletic or polyphyletic.\n\nClassification and phylogeny\nPrior to molecular phylogenetic studies, the family was subdivided primarily based on fruit characteristics. Molecular phylogenetic analyses from the mid-1990s onwards have shown that fruit characters evolved in parallel many times, so that using them in classification resulted in units that were not monophyletic. In 2004, it was proposed that Apiaceae should be divided into four subfamilies:\nApioideae Seem.\nAzorelloideae G.M.Plunkett & Lowry\nMackinlayoideae G.M.Plunkett & Lowry\nSaniculoideae BurnettApioideae is by far the largest subfamily with about 90% of the genera. Most subsequent studies have supported this division, although leaving some genera unplaced. A 2021 study suggested the relationships shown in the following cladogram.\nThe Platysace clade and the genera Klotzschia and Hermas fell outside the four subfamilies. It was suggested that they could be accommodated in subfamilies of their own. Phlyctidocarpa was formerly placed in the subfamily Apioideae, but if kept there makes Apioideae paraphyletic. It could be placed in an enlarged Saniculoideae, or restored to Apioideae if the latter were expanded to include Saniculoideae.The subfamilies can be further divided into tribes and clades, with many clades falling outside formally recognized tribes.\n\nGenera\nThe number of genera accepted by sources varies. As of December 2022, Plants of the World Online (PoWO) accepted 444 genera, while GRIN Taxonomy accepted 462. The PoWO genera are not a subset of those in GRIN; for example, Haloselinum is accepted by PoWO but not by GRIN, while Halosciastrum is accepted by GRIN but not by PoWO, which treats it as a synonym of Angelica. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website had an \"approximate list\" of 446 genera.\n\nEcology\nThe black swallowtail butterfly, Papilio polyxenes, uses the family Apiaceae for food and host plants for oviposition. The 22-spot ladybird is also commonly found eating mildew on these plants.\n\nUses\nMany members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), carrot (Daucus carota) and Hamburg parsley (Petroselinum crispum) produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley (Petroselinum crispum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), culantro, and dill (Anethum graveolens). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (Coriandrum sativum), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), and caraway (Carum carvi).\nOther notable cultivated Apiaceae include chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium), angelica (Angelica spp.), celery (Apium graveolens), arracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza), sea holly (Eryngium spp.), asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida), galbanum (Ferula gummosa), cicely (Myrrhis odorata), anise (Pimpinella anisum), lovage (Levisticum officinale), and hacquetia (Sanicula epipactis).\n\nCultivation\nGenerally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm.  Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a companion plant. One reason is that the tiny flowers, clustered into umbels, are well suited for ladybugs, parasitic wasps, and predatory flies, which drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants. Some of the members of this family considered \"herbs\" produce scents that are believed to mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.\n\nOther uses\nThe poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous Oenanthe crocata has been used as an aid in suicides, and arrow poisons have been made from various other family species.\nDaucus carota has been used as coloring for butter.\nDorema ammoniacum, Ferula galbaniflua, and Ferula moschata (sumbul) are sources of incense.\nThe woody Azorella compacta Phil. has been used in South America for fuel.\n\nToxicity\nMany species in the family Apiaceae produce phototoxic substances (called furanocoumarins) that sensitize human skin to sunlight. Contact with plant parts that contain furanocoumarins, followed by exposure to sunlight, may cause phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. Phototoxic species include Ammi majus, Notobubon galbanum, the parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and numerous species of the genus Heracleum, especially the giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). Of all the plant species that have been reported to induce phytophotodermatitis, approximately half belong to the family Apiaceae.The family Apiaceae also includes a smaller number of poisonous species, including poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool's parsley, and various species of water dropwort.\nSome members of the family Apiaceae, including carrot, celery, fennel, parsley and parsnip, contain polyynes, an unusual class of organic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic effects.\nPassage 4:\nElodea\nElodea is a genus of 6 species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog’s-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis, which serves as a common name in North America.The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.\nElodea canadensis, sometimes called American or Canadian water weed or pond weed, is widely known as the generic water weed. The use of these names causes it to be confused with similar-looking plants, like Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa) or hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). American water weed is an attractive aquarium plant and is a good substitute for Brazilian elodea. It can be used for science experiments in classrooms demonstrating how plants use carbon dioxide with the usage of bromothymol blue.\nThe American water weed lives entirely underwater with the exception of small white flowers which bloom at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It produces winter buds from the stem tips that overwinter on the lake bottom. It also often overwinters as an evergreen plant in mild climates. In the Autumn, leafy stalks will detach from the parent plant, float away, root, and start new plants. This is the American water weed's most important method of spreading, while seed production plays a relatively minor role.Silty sediments and water rich in nutrients favor the growth of American water weed in nutrient-rich lakes. However, the plants will grow in a wide range of conditions, from very shallow to deep water, and in many sediment types. It can even continue to grow uprooted, as floating fragments. It is found throughout temperate North America, where it is one of the most common aquatic plants.American water weed is an important part of lake ecosystems. It provides good habitat for many aquatic invertebrates and cover for young fish and amphibians. Waterfowl, especially ducks, as well as beaver, muskrat and aquatic turtles eat this plant. It is also of economic importance as an attractive and easy to keep aquarium plant, although in the states of Alabama, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, and Washington it has been deemed an invasive species and is illegal to sell.\nSpeciesElodea bifoliata H.St.John - Canada (AB, SK), W United States (OR + CA to NM + MN)\nElodea callitrichoides (Rich.) Casp. - Argentina, Uruguay\nElodea canadensis Michx. - most of United States + Canada\nElodea granatensis Humb. & Bonpl. - much of South America\nElodea nuttallii (Planch.) H.St.John - much of United States + Canada\nElodea potamogeton (Bertero) Espinosa - Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador\n\nChemical control\nChemical methods are ineffective in eradicating Elodea – at best they only slow growth for a season or two. As Elodea spreads into new ecosystems, it experiences rapid growth for 5–6 years and then slows as soil nutrients are used up. Elodea is threatening aquatic environments across Europe. Chemicals may be used in places that cause undue economic concerns, but very few aquatic herbicides are registered for aquatic use in the EU. Fluridone, the most commonly used aquatic herbicide is highly effective against Hydrilla, but only marginally effective against Elodea, especially at lower use rates.\n\nMechanical control\nThe plants can also be removed from lakes and rivers mechanically. They are extracted either by hand or by using rakes, chains, mowing boats or weed buckets. The problem is that through vegetative reproduction via fragments, mechanical removal methods can contribute to the spread of the plant. Torn fragments can be transported downstream or are introduced to new environments via attachment to boats and anchor chains.\n\nSee also\nStormy Lake (Alaska) a lake where Fluoridone was successfully used to eliminate elodea\nPassage 5:\nApium annuum\nApium annuum is one of the 20 species of the genus Apium of the family Apiaceae. It is an annual herb with a distribution in salt-marsh and saline habitats of Victoria, south and western Australia.\nPassage 6:\nApium\nApium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels. Some species are edible, notably Apium graveolens, which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. Apium bermejoi from the island of Menorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.The genus is the type genus of the family Apiaceae and the order Apiales.\n\nSpecies\nAs of January 2023, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:\nApium annuum P.S.Short\nApium australe Thouars\nApium chilense Hook. & Arn.\nApium commersonii DC.\nApium fernandezianum Johow\nApium graveolens L. - celery, wild celery\nApium insulare P.S.Short - Flinder's Island celery\nApium larranagum M.Hiroe\nApium panul (Bertero ex DC.)

Lee Ermey. It is a remake of the 2003 film Midsommer.\n\nPlot\nTeenager Megan (Elisabeth Harnois), still distraught over her twin sister Sophie's suicide, reluctantly agrees to join her friends on a summer trip to a lake house in the bayous of Louisiana. On the way, at a gas station, they meet Nick (Tyler Hoechlin), who provides the group with information on voodoo and other local superstitions.\nAs soon as they arrive at the house, Megan suspects Sophie is trying to communicate with her, as a solstice — the time when our world and the next are closest — approaches. Megan goes running and trips, splitting her nail (something she had foreseen in several nightmares). As she limps back to the house, she meets a suspicious local resident, Leonard (R. Lee Ermey); inside his pickup truck, she finds a hat identical to one Sophie had owned.\nThe night before the solstice, Nick joins the group at the house for dinner. Megan tells him about Sophie's key chain, something she is trying to get rid of but it keeps returning, and that she thinks she is being haunted by Sophie's lost ghost. The six of them later go swimming and Nick calls for any spirits with wine; Megan is dragged under the water. Megan then, advised by Nick, wraps the key chain in a white cloth and buries it outside, which he says should expel the spirit. She goes for a bath, finding mud running out of the taps, and then sees the key chain lying on the floor.\nThe following day, Megan goes to Leonard's house and, inside, finds a young girl's bedroom (presumably his daughter); newspaper cuttings explain a young girl called Malin disappeared from the town a year earlier. Megan realises she is being haunted by Malin, not Sophie. Megan takes Nick to where she tripped on her run, followed by the group of friends, including Christian (Shawn Ashmore) who brings a gun. Nick and Megan get split up, and Christian almost shoots Nick. Megan then digs up Malin's body and finds that the key on the key chain is for Malin's bicycle, which was buried with her. They call the local police.\nChristian finally admits that the year before, when they all came to the lake house without Megan, he and Sophie were on a drive and accidentally hit Malin. In fear of being arrested, they buried her in the forest, and Sophie later committed suicide as she could not bear the guilt. Malin's ghost appears, and Christian runs away towards the road. Megan chases him through the forest but before she can reach him, he is hit by the police car that had been called out.\nThe ending shows Megan at Malin's grave. When Leonard arrives home, he finds Malin's key chain on the porch, put there by Megan. Megan and Nick decide to go to the city to start a life together.\n\nCast\nElisabeth Harnois as Megan, a teenager who travels with her friends to a remote lake house during the summer solstice. Once there, she begins to feel a presence she believes to be that of her deceased twin sister Sophie, who has recently committed suicide.\nShawn Ashmore as Christian, Megan's love interest.\nTyler Hoechlin as Nick, a resident of the town who works at a nearby gas station.\nAmanda Seyfried as Zoe, Megan's best friend.\nHilarie Burton as Alicia, Mark's girlfriend and a friend of Megan's.\nMatt O'Leary as Mark, Alicia's boyfriend.\nR.

He said he hoped that it would \"hark back to elemental horror films like Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.\"  The film met with problems due to Hurricane Katrina and production was postponed. Filming commenced in New Orleans in April, 2006, shooting in the Garden District and in bayous around Louisiana.  Endgame Entertainment developed, produced, and fully financed the film.\n\nRelease\nSolstice released direct to video on January 1, 2008 by The Weinstein Company. Throughout the year, the film had international releases in Germany, Philippines and Greece. It had a theatrical release on June 19 in Russia, and a US television debut on Lifetime Television on July 26, before release in South Korea, Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, Iceland and Mexico.\n\nCritical response\nSolstice has received mixed reviews upon release.\nDon Sumner of Best Horror Movies felt the production values were comparable with large-budget films and that both the story and performances were believable and genuine, making the film interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention. However, he also felt that the expected scares and suspense might make for an argument that the film was not a horror and was actually a ghostly drama/thriller. Bloody Disgusting felt that the music score was the only highlight in an otherwise boring film, granting that as a remake of the Danish film Midsommer, where the story, overused locale, etc. could not be attributed to Myrick or the other new writers, it is wondered why the choice was made to not make it more interesting, as even the feeling of danger was not present. For Dread Central, Steve Barton also found the pacing to be lagging when they wrote \"The pacing of Solstice drags the viewer to the finish line nearly half asleep\". And in referring to director Daniel Myrick, \"Coming from a guy whose body of work has been anything but cookie-cutter, Solstice disappoints with its surprising blandness and heavy-handed mediocrity.\"  E-Splatter was also disappointed in Myrick's work, comparing it negatively to The Blair Witch Project and writing that it was \"a bit of a bummer to see the filmmaker behind such a kick-ass movie helming a direct-to-video horror film that's as tame as this. As reviled as it was by some horror fans, 'The Blair Witch Project' definitely had an edge. This film absolutely, positively has none.\"\nPassage 5:\nA Special Cop in Action\nSpecial Cop in Action (Italian: Italia a mano armata, lit. 'Italy at gunpoint') is a 1976 Italian poliziottesco film directed by Marino Girolami, here credited as Franco Martinelli. The film is the final chapter in the Girolami's Commissioner Betti Trilogy, after Violent Rome and Violent Naples, though a spin-off in the series entitled Weapons of Death would be released the following year.\nThe main theme of the film was used in the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.\n\nPlot\nA crime syndicate starts a crime wave in Turin, they rob a bank, taking a hostage to get away from Police Inspector Betti and Ferrari, his partner. However, the hostage turned out to be their accomplice in disguise. Later, they hijack a school bus full of children to use as ransom.\nBetti and Ferrari sees through the syndicate's scheme and ambushes them on their next robbery attempt, arresting all but one armed criminal. The remaining criminal takes one of their unarmed mules as hostage, trying the trick they used last time. However Betti sees it through and closes in on them, refusing their demands for a getaway. The armed bandit gambles by releasing all other individuals in the bank to appear genuine, but the \"customer\" taken hostage was a career criminal known to the police and Betti. The police close in on them, forcing the crooks to give up.\nThe remaining criminals hide the schoolchildren in a nearby farm and lay low, but their cover is blown when one of the criminals try to rape a female cyclist nearby, leading Betti and the police close to in on them. They demand a large sum of cash and a getaway car, executing one child in the process. The child's mother, Anna, confronts Betti and blames him for her son's death. All other kids are released except the last one, Betti then offers to take the child's place to secure her release. The criminals agree and blindfolds him and take him away in the getaway car instead.\nBetti is dumped on the highway and sustained injuries, impressed by his bravery, Anna visits him in the hospital and apologizes for her earlier comments. Betti then begins to round up the syndicate members, first chasing two of them through a wet market. The two crooks flee, but Betti hijacks a car and goes after them. After a lengthy chase, Betti destroys their car and arrests them. Another crook was chased by Betti across the rooftops, the crook panics and shoots him, nearly making Betti fall off the building. They then climb down the scaffolding, the crook tries to hijack a nearby car but was T-boned by a speeding truck, killing him.\nBetti then goes to the syndicate headquarters, the local sailors' club in Turin. The criminals there set him up by having one of them shoot him. When Betti retaliates in self-defense, the criminals coming to aid the dead crook kicks away his gun and plays the victim card, framing Betti. Betti is then placed under arrest and is awaiting trial.\nAnna visits Betti in detention and gives him courage. During a pre-engineered prison riot, the arrested syndicate members also in detention climbs over the wall to solitary confinement and tries to kill Betti, but was beaten down. With enough evidence against the syndicates, Betti had his charges dropped and was reinstated.\nBetti and the police plan a major assault on the sailors' club. Leading to the death of many crooks, one of them escapes in a detective car, running over Ferrari in the process. Betti gives chase but was blocked by a piece of damaged scaffolding.\nThe boss of the syndicate prepares a meeting to consider the situation, but was run over by a biker gang as he prepares to board his limo. He was taken to a private hospital. Upon hearing the police are on their way, he escapes through a broken window and hails a taxi, with Betti following him. Being stalked at every turn and their arrests imminent, the remaining criminals gathers at the airport and prepares to flee Italy, with Betti watching their every move in a nearby car.\nAs revenge for taking down their operations, the syndicate orders a hit on Betti. While on a date with Anna, Betti was gunned down in a hail of bullets from a drive-by thus ending the trilogy story of Commissar Betti. However his death was not present in all versions of the film, leaving doubts on which ending is canon.\n\nCast\nMaurizio Merli: Commissioner Betti\nJohn Saxon: Jean Albertelli\nRaymond Pellegrin: Commissioner Arpino\nToni Ucci: Raffaele Cacace\nMirella D'Angelo: Luisa\nSergio Fiorentini: Salvatore Mancuso\nAldo Barberito: Maresciallo Ferrari\nMassimo Vanni: Fabbri\nEnzo Andronico: Antonio Boretti\nNello Pazzafini: Prisoner\n\nProduction\nSpecial Cop in Action is the final chapter in the trilogy about Commissioner Betti, after Violent Rome and Violent Naples.\n\nRelease\nSpecial Cop in Action was distributed theatrically in Italy by Fida on 27 November 1976.\n\nReception\nIn a contemporary review, John Pym reviewed a dubbed version of the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin. Pym found the film to be an \"over-plotted picture, filled with irrelevant characters (and character names), which attempts to justify its moments of thoroughly nasty (or thoroughly ludicrous) violence by the last-minute addition of the usual moral about the unhappiness of the policeman's lot\".\n\nSee also\nList of Italian films of 1976\nPassage 6:\nMarino Girolami\nMarino Girolami (1 February 1914 – 20 February 1994) was an Italian film director and actor.\n\nBiography\nMarino Giorlami was born on 1 February 1914 in Rome, Italy. Formally a Professional boxer, Girolami ended his boxing career when he was 20. Following this, he got a degree as a physical therapist and opened a gym which specialized in therapeutic massages. Girolami entered into Italy Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. Among the people Girolami met was Anna Magnani who took her son Luca to meet him which led to close relationship between them. Girolami gave her the script he had been working on of Campo de'fiori which was passed on to Aldo Fabrizi. The story was re-written by Girolami and Federico Fellini and directed by Mario Bonnard, which led to Girolami working in film. He debuted as an actor in 1940, and became an assistant director for Mario Soldati, Marcello Marchesi, Vittorio Metz. In 1949 he debuted as a director with La strada buia, a variation on the film Fugitive Lady. He pursued his career as film director with several musical comedies and melodramas.Film historian and critic Roberto Curti described Girolami as one of Italy's most prolific genre directors, directing 78 films in three decades. Girolami worked in several genres and trends such as the Western with Between God, the Devil and a Winchester, the crime film (Violent Rome) and horror with Zombie Holocaust. Girolami also made hardcore pornography such as Sesso profondo. He died on 20 February 1994 in Rome.\n\nPersonal life\nGirolami was the older brother of director Romolo Girolami, who worked with Marino as an assistant director on some of his films such as Il Mio amico Jekyll and later directed under the name Romolo Guerrieri. Marino Girolami is also the father of actor Ennio Girolami and director Enzo G.

Simon Gray's writing is sharp, funny and clever, and, more than 20 years after the piece's premiere, the dramatist's assumption of intelligence and cultural knowledge on the part of his audience seems breathtakingly daring.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nSaint George's Church, Garnahovit\nThe church of Saint George (Armenian: Սուրբ Գեւորգ Եկեղեցի; pronounced Surp Gevork) is located centrally in the village of Garnahovit, Aragatsotn Province, Armenia. Its imposing architecture dominates the surrounding village and landscape.\n\nArchitecture\nSt. Gevorg has a single large Byzantine-style red tile, octagonal umbrella dome that is centered over the church. The style of domed roof is uncommon in Armenia, especially on larger structures. The dome sits above an octagonal drum that is pierced by twelve small windows; pairs of windows on each of the four sides, and single windows on the other four sides. The church was renovated at least once.\nPassage 4:\nGeorge G. Finch\nMajor General George Griffin Finch (April 11, 1902 – January 3, 1986) was a senior officer in the United States Air National Guard who served as Chief of the Air Division, National Guard Bureau from 1948 to 1950. In 1953 he replaced General Mark W. Clark on the UN command delegation to the Korean armistice talks.\n\nMilitary career\nGeorge Griffin Finch was born on April 11, 1902, in Dade City, Florida. He began his military career during World War I, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the United States Army's Signal Corps in 1918. He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war and, in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group. In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned Finch to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard. The unit was mobilized into the United States Army in September 1941, with Major Finch as commander.\nAfter World War II, Finch was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime. He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948. Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War. As a result of Finch's vision and perseverance, 45,000 officers and airmen of 22 wings and 65 squadrons gave the Air Force the strength it needed in the early phase of the Korean War. Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955. Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force at Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force. Finch had a career of \"firsts\", including the United States Army's first night landing with a single, five-million-candlepower floodlight in 1927. He also established and endowed the General John P. McConnell Award at the United States Air Force Academy.\n\nRetirement and legacy\nConsidered by many as the father of the Air National Guard, Finch retired in 1957. A graduate of the University of Georgia and a member of the Georgia Bar, Finch was enshrined in the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame May 18, 1996.\nPassage 5:\nSaint Gevork Monastery of Mughni\nSaint Gevork Monastery or Saint George's Monastery of Mughni (Armenian: Սուրբ Գեւորգ Եկեղեցի or Սուրբ Գեւորգ Վանք ; pronounced Surp Gevork) is located just off of the main road that runs through the village of Mughni near Ashtarak in the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia. It was built to house some of the remains of Saint George who was known as the \"Slayer of Dragons\".\n\nArchitecture\nThe church of Saint Gevork stands within a rectangular walled monastery. It has a single cylindrical drum notable for the horizontal alternating striped pattern that surrounds it, and a conical umbrella type dome above. The striped pattern repeats some within the interior portion of the dome. The front façade is made up of a triple-arched walkway with an arch on either side adjacent that leads underneath a belfry. The belfry consists of sixteen equally spaced columns with an equal amount of smaller arches that support the weight of the cupola above.\nA main portal leads into the church decorated by an intricately carved arched lintel and door frame. Another smaller doorway is located on the façade to the right of the front of the church. It is almost as intricately carved as the main entry door.\nMany portions of the stonework on the church of Saint Gevork use two colors of stone; a darker grey tuff and an apricot colored tuff. In particular the doorways, the drum, the peaks of the façades, and the capitals of the rectangular columns of the triple-archway in front are accentuated by the alternating stone colors.\nIn the interior of the church there are numerous religious frescoes around the apse and on the left wall leading to the tomb of S. George of whom the church is named after. They were most likely painted in the 17th century by Naghash Hovnatan whose other works include decoration of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and other churches near Yerevan and Agulis. A single marble tomb sits in a room adjacent to the apse with semi-circular stone of green marble on top worn down from the many people who have touched it. It is said to come from Jerusalem. A chapel built in the 6th century had at one point served to house the remains of S. George, but was later replaced by the church of Saint Gevork.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of churches under the patronage of Saint George\nPassage 6:\nSaint Gevork of Mughni Church, Tbilisi\nThe Saint Gevork of Mughni Church (Armenian: Մուղնեցվոց Սուրբ Գևորգ Եկեղեցի Georgian: წმინდა გიორგის მუღნის ეკლესია) also known as Saint George of Mughni Church (Gevork in Armenian is cognate with George) is a 13th-century Armenian church in Tbilisi, Georgia that was entirely rebuilt in 1756.  It is made of brick and its architectural typology is that of a cross within a rectangular perimeter, with four free-standing supports.\n\nCurrent state\nUntil the mid-1980s, the church served as a museum of folk art.  By 1990, it was no longer a museum and its interior lay in ruin.The vestibule attached to the western facade of the church was destroyed in May, 1991. The large cracks in the church walls served as an excuse to Georgian authorities to destroy the church instead of repairing it.During the night of November 18, 2009, the dome of the church collapsed. According to locals, recent rains had further weakened the already badly damaged structure of the church. Georgian television station Rustavi 2 reports that the district governor promised to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of the church after visiting the ruin on November 19, 2009.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nArmenians in Georgia\nPassage 7:\nGeorge Stambolian\nGeorge Stambolian (born April 10, 1938 – December 22, 1991, New York City) was an American educator, writer, and editor of Armenian descent. Stambolian was a key figure in the early gay literary movement that came out of New York during the 1960s and 1970s.  He was best known as the editor of the Men on Men anthologies of gay fiction.\nStambolian graduated from Dartmouth College and carried out graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, earning a Ph.D. in 1969 with a dissertation that was subsequently published as Marcel Proust and the Creative Encounter (1972). From 1966 until his retirement in 1991, Stambolian was a professor in the Department of French at Wellesley College, where he taught courses on French language and literature.  He wrote and edited Twentieth Century French Fiction: Essays for Germaine Brée (1975) and, with Elaine Marks, Homosexualities and French Literature (1979).\nMen on Men: Best New Fiction, edited by Stambolian and including an introduction he wrote, was published by New American Library (Plume) in 1986. The anthology featured the work of some prominent gay authors of that period as well as others less well established. The critical acclaim accorded this volume and its popular success led to the publication of three sequels which Stambolian likewise edited and introduced.  He was awarded the 1990 Lambda Literary Award in the category Gay Men's Anthologies for editing Men on Men 3.  The fourth of these anthologies was released after his death in December 1991 from complications of AIDS at the age of 53.\nStambolian's parents were Armenian immigrants, and he explored his Armenian heritage in a short story entitled \"In My Father's Car\" in the third volume of Men on Men.  He inspired the gay Armenian American character in Armistead Maupin's Maybe the Moon.\nPassage 8:\nGevorgyan\nGevorgyan or Gevorgian, sometimes also spelled Gevorkian (Armenian: Գևորգյան) is an Armenian surname meaning \"son of Gevorg\", the equivalent of \"son of George\" (compare English Georgeson).

Rotigotine is a drug developed to mimic the actions of dopamine in the brain to help cope with restless legs syndrome and  the abnormal movements(dyskinesia) found in Parkinson's disease patients. This drug is an alternative to oral medications for treatment of Parkinson's disease, considered by the VCU Department of Chemistry as \"an unprecedented medication for the benefit of millions of Parkinson's patient worldwide.\" Minaskanian’s main contribution to Neupro was improving the efficiency of manufacturing rotigotine, thereby making the process commercially viable and enabling patients to afford this important medication.

Nelson proposes 'ontogenetic depth' as evidence of specified complexity, and a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, in opposition to modern evolutionary theory.\nNelson subsequently stated that ontogenetic depth is \"Currently Impossible to Measure\".\n\nCriticism\nBiologist PZ Myers, who works in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, dismissed the concept, stating in 2010 that \"Nelson is a creationist who made up this wacky claim of \"ontogenetic depth\", saying he had a way of objectively measuring the complexity of the developmental process in organisms with a number that described the distance from egg to adult. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell us how one calculated this number, or how it actually accounted for the complexity of a network, or even how we'd get a number that was different for a sponge and a cat. But he did say he'd get back to us with the details tomorrow...six years ago.\" Myers concludes that \"ontogenetic depth is a sloppily-defined concept with no theoretical support for its validity and no apparent operational utility.\"The concept of 'ontogenetic depth' has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal, there are no methods described that would allow to measure this value in any organisms, nobody other than Nelson and his collaborator, Marcus Ross, do anything with the idea.\nPassage 4:\nKevin Avery\nKevin Avery (born June 24, 1957) is an American biographer, short story writer, and editor. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, he now lives in Brooklyn, New York. His first two books, Everything Is an Afterthought: The Life and Writings of Paul Nelson and Conversations with Clint: Paul Nelson's Lost Interviews with Clint Eastwood, 1979 - 1983, were published within weeks of each other by two different publishers, Fantagraphics Books and Continuum Books, respectively, in 2011.\n\nEarly life\nKevin Avery was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nCareer\nPrior to publishing his first book, Avery was vice-president of Yield Management for Motor Cargo, a Western regional transportation company that was acquired by UPS Freight, the Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) trucking division of UPS.Avery's first published works were short stories, which were published by periodicals including City Weekly, Gallery, Weber Studies, Utah Holiday, California Quarterly, and Mississippi Review.In 1992, he began writing nonfiction, mainly rock & roll criticism, for CATALYST Magazine, The Event, Penthouse, and Salt Lake magazine. Interview subjects included NBA star Shaquille O’Neal, musical acts Radiohead, Freedy Johnston, Los Lobos, Tori Amos, Moody Blues, Graham Parker, and Sheryl Crow, cartoonist John Callahan, and late impresario Eugene Jelesnik. Avery's music criticism was greatly influenced by the work of Paul Nelson (critic), whose work he'd begun reading as a teenager.Beginning in 2006, upon learning of Nelson's death, Avery spent four years researching and writing Everything Is an Afterthought: The Life and Writings of Paul Nelson, an anthology-biography compiling some of Nelson's best works while also documenting the critic's tragic life.

Nelson (born 1958) is an American philosopher, noted for his advocacy of the pseudosciences of young earth creationism and intelligent design.\n\nBiography\nNelson is the grandson of the creationist author and Lutheran minister Byron Christopher Nelson (1894–1972) and edited a book of his grandfather's writings.  He is married to Suzanne Nelson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University.\nIn 1998, Nelson gained a PhD in philosophy from the University of Chicago.\nNelson is a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture and of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design.\n\nControversies\nThe Discovery Institute's Wedge Document, and other sources have said that Nelson publishes works derived from his dissertation, \"Common Descent, Generative Entrenchment, and the Epistemology in Evolutionary Inference\", in which he criticizes the principle of common descent as it is expounded in the Evolutionary Monographs series.\nNelson is frequently cited by opponents of intelligent design as an example of ID's \"big tent\" strategy in action. He has written about \"Life in the Big Tent\" in the Christian Research Journal. In an interview for Touchstone Magazine Nelson said that the main challenge facing the ID community was to \"develop a full-fledged theory of biological design\", and that the lack of such a theory was a \"real problem\".As shown in the Peabody Award-winning documentary Nova: Intelligent Design on Trial, in the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, Barbara Forrest presented a quote from Nelson to demonstrate that Intelligent Design proponents know that it is not a theory in the scientific sense:\n\nEasily, the biggest challenge facing the I.D. community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don't have such a theory right now, and that's a real problem. Without a theory, it's very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions, such as irreducible complexity, but as yet, no general theory of biological design.\n\nYoung Earth views\nNelson was a contributor to the book Three Views on Creation and Evolution, edited by J. P. Moreland and John Mark Reynolds, in which he, along with Reynolds, represented the young Earth creationist position. In their discussion in that book he and Reynolds acknowledged that \"natural science at the moment seems to overwhelmingly point to an old cosmos.\" Ideas consistent with present-day Young Earth creationism were abandoned around the start of the 19th century. Today, such proposals are rejected by the scientific community, and the courts have ruled Young Earth creationism to be a religious belief.In a discussion with historian of science Ronald Numbers, Nelson made a distinction between his theological understanding of Earth history, which is informed by the biblical account as presented in the book of Genesis, and his advocacy for intelligent design. Nelson acknowledged that his young-Earth views are unpopular with many other intelligent design advocates.Nelson was a cast member in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?. After the film's release, he published an article stating that the film distorted his arguments and presented \"a false dichotomy\" between naturalistic evolution and young Earth creationism while omitting other viewpoints. Director and Producer Thomas Purifoy wrote a response entitled A Tale of Two Dichotomies in which he presented the full film interview with Nelson as evidence and stated that \"as a philosopher, Paul seemed to be shifting back to viewing things from a philosophical perspective. The film, however, was not about comparing two different philosophies, but two different histories.\"\nPassage 10:\nOld Coyote Town\n\"Old Coyote Town\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Don Williams.  It was released in January 1989 as the fourth single from the album Traces.  The song reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song previously appeared on co-writer Larry Boone's 1988 album Swingin' Doors, Sawdust Floors, and was the B-side to that album's single \"Wine Me Up\".  Boone wrote the song with Paul Nelson and Gene Nelson.\n\nChart performance\nYear-end charts", "answers": ["intelligent design"], "length": 3776, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d3b42d558b1a0e6d38a3cd63521f90726d0a0726bd3400c1"}

It was founded in 1958 as a land-grant college and occupies a 644-acre (2.61 km2) campus that is shared with North Central State College. The campus offers ten bachelor degree programs and graduate level coursework in education. The campus practices open admissions. Students can start at Mansfield and finish their degrees at The Ohio State University, Columbus, with one or more of Ohio State’s 200+ majors. The Bromfield Library of the Ohio State Mansfield campus provides access to all the resources of the Ohio State University and Ohio Link.\n\nHistory\nThe Ohio State University at Mansfield was founded in 1958 as a land-grant college and was created through a partnership between Mansfield-area citizens and the state of Ohio. Soon after the Ohio Board of Regents designated Mansfield as the site for an Ohio State regional campus, Mansfield-area citizens mounted a major campaign to acquire land for the campus.OSU-Mansfield, in 1989, hosted a weekend school for Japanese students.\n\nStudent life\nStudent organizations\nThere are about 30 student organizations on the Mansfield Campus.\n\nDepartment of Athletics and Recreation\nOhio State Mansfield is a member of the Ohio Regional Campus Conference.

Completed in 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut, the building houses Yale University's School of Architecture. Until 2000, it also housed the School of Art.\n\nConstruction\nDesigned by the building's namesake, architect Paul Rudolph, the complex building contains more than 30 floor levels in its seven stories. The building is made of ribbed, bush-hammered concrete. The design was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York, and the later buildings of Le Corbusier.\n\nHistory\nThe building was dedicated on November 8, 1963, to wide praise by critics and academics. It received several prestigious awards, including the Award of Honor by the American Institute of Architects. New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable called it \"a spectacular tour de force.\" But the building also had detractors from the start. In a speech at the dedication ceremony, architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner bemoaned what he called the structure's oppressive monumentality.Over the following decade, the critical reaction to the building became more negative.A large fire on the night of June 14, 1969, caused extensive damage. The fire was rumored to have been set by anti-establishment protesters, but this charge has remained unproven.During the repairs, many changes were made to Rudolph's original design. Mezzanine levels were inserted, spaces broken up, and double-glazing added. Later, a renovation scheme by Beyer Blinder Belle was commissioned but only partially executed, if at all.In 2000, the School of Art moved out to its own building.  \nAs the building approached its 40th year, appreciation of the structure had increased to the point that Yale began planning a renovation and addition. In 2001, initial commissions were given to David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill for the former and Richard Meier for the latter. Then Yale \"parted ways\" with those two, and gave the commission to Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, whose Charles Gwathmey was a Yale Architecture alumnus and former student of Rudolph's. Yale spent $126 million on the project between 2007 and 2008, including a $20 million gift for the purpose from alumnus Sid Bass. The renovation returned the building to more closely hew to Rudolph's design. At the same time, an addition was built with classroom and office space, two lecture theatres, a cafe, and a ground-floor library.In 2014, the building received the Landmark Plaque, the highest honor bestowed by the New Haven Preservation Trust.\n\nSee also\nYale School of Architecture\nYale School of Art\nPassage 5:\nKyle Ezell\nKyle Ezell (born Jonathan Kyle Ezell in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee) is an American urban planning practitioner, writer, and theorist.  Ezell focuses on vibrant downtowns and expressing local culture in the built environment. He is currently a professor and head of the undergraduate planning program of the Knowlton School at Ohio State University.Ezell received a Master of Science in Geography from South Dakota State University in 1994. Prior to joining Ohio State University's Knowlton School, he practiced as an urban planner in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Dublin, Ohio, and Columbus, Ohio.

Knowlton School of Architecture (KSA) at The Ohio State University. The building was completed in 2004. The School of Architecture offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees in the fields of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and City and Regional Planning. Knowlton Hall serves as the replacement for Ives Hall, the previous home of the school of architecture which was demolished in July 2002. The namesake of Knowlton Hall is Austin E. \"Dutch\" Knowlton. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1931 with a Bachelor's in Architectural Engineering and provided a $10 million donation that spearheaded the funding for the creation of the building.\n\nArchitecture\nInitially, the brief for the building was to renovate the existing building, Ives Hall, and plan an addition to accommodate anticipated programming. As the architect, Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects, worked, they realized it would be better to build anew with the primary goal of the building to inspire its students.The structure is post-tensioned concrete construction and white Georgia marble as stipulated by the donor. The marble was used as shingles in a rainscreen that could be easily replaced and allow light inside.The resulting building form is monumental with enclosing, defining, and confronting space and adjacent buildings with a sense of elegance reflected in its green space. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the landscape attempts to increase nature on the site through landform strips around the building's perimeter and construction of an arboreal bosque.\n\nDesign and organization\nKnowlton Hall houses a 30,000 volume library, 65 offices, 45 studio spaces, a workshop, its own café, and a large auditorium that serves not only as one of the six classrooms in Knowlton but also as a stage for the KSA lecture series.  The KSA lecture series bring students into close contact with prominent researchers and practitioners of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning. As one member of an award jury for the American Institute of Architects (AIA) said in regards to Knowlton Hall:\n\nWhat architect would not have liked to have gone to school here? This project embodies everything I would want in an architecture building. It is full of unique spaces, an open flexible hall that beckons people to participate, and seems to have surprises around every corner. 'Our buildings shape us,' as Churchill said, and to have future generations of architects learn and grow as designers within an inspiring building such as this ... is exhilarating.\n\nRecognition\nSince its completion in 2004, Knowlton Hall has been the subject of a lot of attention, not only within the local community of Columbus but also nationally. Knowlton Hall has gained recognition by national publications, such as Architecture, Competitions, Dwell, Praxis, and Architectural Record, and has also been the recipient of numerous awards:\nAmerican Institute of Architects, National; Architecture Honor Award, 2010\nAmerican Institute of Architects/American Library Association; Award of Excellence, 2005\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Georgia; Honor Award, 2006\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Ohio; Honor Award, 2005\nAmerican Institute of Architects, Columbus; Honor Award, 2009\nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies; National Recognition Award, 2005\nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies, Ohio; Grand Award, 2005\n\"International Masonry Institute\", Ohio; Golden Trowel Award, 2005\nPost Tensioning Institute; Award of Excellence, 2004\nColumbus Landmarks; James B.

Built from 1909 to 1910, it is the oldest building still standing at Cal Poly. \nThe design of the building was long mis-attributed to William H. Weeks, who had designed the original Cal Poly power house at the northern end of campus. However, the architectural plans for the 1909 building were created by the State of California Department of Engineering, under State Engineer Nat Ellery.The building is designed in the Mission Revival style. The building originally served as a power plant run by students and two full-time supervisors; it also held Mechanics and Electrical Engineering classes. The Powerhouse stopped generating power in the 1940s and was replaced entirely and abandoned in 1955. In 1967, the building found a new use when the school's College of Architecture and Environmental Design decided to hold classes there. The college continued to hold classes in the building even after the construction of a new architecture building, and only stopped in 1990 when the school's administration ordered the building to be abandoned.The Powerhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1993.\nPassage 9:\nJohn Quigley (academic)\nJohn B.

The first issue was published in 1970. The Smithsonian holds events such as the American Ingenuity Awards, Future Con and Museum Day.\n\nHistory\nThe history of Smithsonian began when Edward K. Thompson, the retired editor of Life magazine, was asked by the then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, to produce a magazine \"about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.\"Thompson would later recall that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it \"would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old Life.\"In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time. In 1980, Thompson was replaced by Don Moser, who had also worked at Life, and circulation reached upwards of two million, in turn, by Carey Winfrey upon his retirement in 2001.

Major agricultural products include pork, beef, and tea. Other industries are chemical production, coal power, metallurgy, textiles, building materials, and processed food.\n\nTourism\nDazhou is blessed with both cultural and natural attractions. There are several national and provincial cultural sites and many national and provincial protected forests and nature reserves.

Consul et dux 961, vir illustrissimus 980, praefectus navalis 999. He was the son of Alberic II (son of Alberic I of Spoleto and Marozia), and Alda of Vienne (daughter of Hugh, King of Italy and his second wife, Alda (or Hilda)). His half-brother was Pope John XII.\nHe held the cities of Galeria, Arce, and Preneste and the title count palatine, the palace referred to being that of the Lateran. He was the first to carry the title \"Count of Tusculum\" and he passed it to all his descendants. They also received the titles of excellentissimus vir' (most excellent man) and apostolic rector of Sant'Andrea, which Gregory received in 980. In 981, Gregory bore the title Romanorum consul, dux et senator: \"Consul, duke, and senator of the Romans.\"\nAs well as being an intimate and ally of the popes, especially Sylvester II, Gregory also served as praefectus navalis of Holy Roman Emperors Otto I and Otto II. However, on 6 February 1001, he was named \"Head of the Republic\" by the Romans for leading the revolt against Otto III and expelling the Crescentii. In 1002, the latter returned to power and he had to renounce his title.\nHis death is attested before the 11 June 1012, when his successor, Theophylact, was elected Pope.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBy his wife Maria (died 1013) he had three sons and a daughter:\n\nTheophylact, who became Pope Benedict VIII.\nAlberic III who succeeded him in Tusculum and in his titles.\nRomanus, who became Pope John XIX\nMarozia III, who married Thrasimund III of Spoleto. Together, the houses of Tusculum and Spoleto were the dominant secular powers in the central Italian peninsula, the one representative of the imperial power and the other, Gregory's, of papal.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPassage 3:\nAlberic II of Spoleto\nAlberic II (912–954) was ruler of Rome from 932 to 954, after deposing his mother Marozia and his stepfather, King Hugh of Italy.\nHe was of the house of the counts of Tusculum, the son of Marozia by her first husband, Duke Alberic I of Spoleto. His half-brother was Pope John XI. At the wedding of his mother to King Hugh of Italy, Alberic and his new stepfather quarreled violently after Hugh slapped Alberic for clumsiness. Infuriated by this and perhaps motivated by rumors that Hugh intended to have him blinded, Alberic left the festivities and incited a Roman mob to revolt against Hugh. In December 932 Hugh fled the city, Marozia was cast into prison, and Alberic took control of Rome.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 936 Alberic married his stepsister Alda, the daughter of King Hugh of Italy and had one son by her, Count Gregory I of Tusculum. According to Benedict of Soracte, he also had one illegitimate son, Octavianus, by an unknown mistress. On his deathbed Alberic had Roman nobility and clergy swear they would elect Octavianus as pope.\n\nSources\nWilliams, George L. (1998). Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes. McFarland & Company, Inc.\nLexikon des Mittelalters.\nPassage 4:\nMarozia\nMarozia, born Maria and also known as Mariuccia or Mariozza (c. 890 – 937), was a Roman noblewoman who was the alleged mistress of Pope Sergius III and was given the unprecedented titles senatrix (\"senatoress\") and patricia of Rome by Pope John X.\nEdward Gibbon wrote of her that the \"influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora was founded on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman tiara, and their reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. The bastard son, two grandsons, two great grandsons, and one great great grandson of Marozia—a rare genealogy—were seated in the Chair of St. Peter.\" Pope John XIII was her nephew, the offspring of her younger sister Theodora. From this description, the term \"pornocracy\" has become associated with the effective rule in Rome of Theodora and her daughter Marozia through male surrogates.\n\nEarly life\nMarozia was born about 890. She was the daughter of the Roman consul Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, and of Theodora, the real power in Rome, whom bishop Liutprand of Cremona characterized as a \"shameless whore... [who] exercised power on the Roman citizenry like a man.\"\nAt the age of fifteen, Marozia became the mistress of Theophylact's cousin Pope Sergius III, whom she knew when he was bishop of Portus. The two had a son, John (the later Pope John XI). That, at least, is the story found in two contemporary sources, the Liber Pontificalis and the Antapodosis sive Res per Europam gestae (958–62), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920–72). But a third contemporary source, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894–966), says John XI was brother of Alberic II, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Alberic I. Hence John too may have been the son of Marozia and Alberic I.\nMarozia married Alberic I, duke of Spoleto, in 909, and their son Alberic II was born in 911 or 912. By the time Alberic I was killed at Orte in 924, the Roman landowners had won complete victory over the traditional bureaucracy represented by the papal curia. Rome was virtually under secular control, the historic nadir of the papacy.\n\nGuy of Tuscany\nIn order to counter the influence of Pope John X (whom the hostile chronicler Liutprand of Cremona alleges was another of her lovers), Marozia subsequently married his opponent Guy of Tuscany. Together they attacked Rome, arrested Pope John X in the Lateran, and jailed him in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Either Guy had him smothered with a pillow in 928 or he simply died, perhaps from neglect or ill treatment. Marozia seized power in Rome in a coup d'état. The following popes, Leo VI and Stephen VII, were both her puppets. In 931 she managed to impose her twenty-one years old son as pontiff, under the name of John XI.\n\nHugh of Arles, and death\nGuy died in 929, and Marozia negotiated a marriage with his half-brother Hugh of Arles, the King of Italy. While in Rome Hugh quarreled with Marozia's son Alberic II, who organized an uprising during the wedding ceremonies in 932. Hugh escaped, but Marozia was captured.\nMarozia died after spending some 5 years in prison. Her descendants remained active in papal politics, starting with Alberic II's son Octavian, who became Pope John XII in 955. Popes Benedict VIII, John XIX, and Benedict IX, and antipope Benedict X of the House of Tusculani, were also descended from Marozia. By Guy of Tuscany she had a daughter named Berta Theodora, who never married.\n\nFamily tree\nSources\nChamberlin, E. R. (1969). The Bad Popes. New York: Dial Press. ISBN 9789030041801.

He was son of Alberic III of Dammartin and Mathilde of Clermont.Brought up at the French court, he was a childhood friend of Philip Augustus. At his father's insistence he fought for the Plantagenets. Received back into Philip's favour, he married Marie de Châtillon, daughter of Guy II de Châtillon and Adèle of Dreux, a royal cousin.\nIn 1191, Renaud's father, Alberic, kidnapped and had Renaud marry Ida, Countess of Boulogne. The County of Boulogne thereby became vassal to the French king, rather than the count of Flanders. While this marriage made Renaud a power, it also made enemies in the Dreux family and that of the count of Guînes, who had been betrothed to Ida.\nIn 1203, Renaud and his wife gave a merchant's charter to Boulogne. This was probably made for financial consideration. Philip made Renaud Count of Aumale the following year, but Renaud began to detach himself. Following the acquisition of Normandy in April 1204, King Philip granted Renaud the county of Mortain and the honor of Warenne which was centered on the fortresses of Mortemer and Bellencombre.  Both Mortain and Warenne had been held by William I of Boulogne and it would appear that King Philip recognized the Boulogne claim to them.\nIn 1211, he refused to appear before Philip in a legal matter, a suit with Philippe de Dreux, bishop of Beauvais. Philip II seized his lands and on 4 May 1212 at Lambeth, Dammartin made an agreement with King John who had also lost possessions to Philip. Renaud brought other continental nobles, including the Count of Flanders, into a coalition with John against Philip. In return he was given several fiefs in England and an annuity. Each promised not to make a separate peace with France.With the Emperor Otto IV and Ferdinand of Flanders, he took part in the attack on France in 1214 culminating in the Battle of Bouvines. Commanding the Brabançons, he was on the losing side, but was one of the last to surrender, and refused submission to Philip Augustus. His lands were taken away, and given to Philip Hurepel. Renaud was kept imprisoned at Péronne for the rest of his life, which ended in suicide.  His daughter Matilda II was married to Philip Hurepel.\nPassage 6:\nAlberic II, Count of Dammartin\nAlberic II (died 1183) was the Count of Dammartin, possibly the son of Aubry de Mello, Count of Dammartin, and Adela, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Dammartin.What little is known for sure about Alberic II is confounded by the preponderance of noblemen of the same name in both France and England. What is known is that he married Clémence of Bar, daughter of Reginald I \"One-Eyed\", Count of Bar, one of the leaders of the Second Crusade, and Gisèle de Vaudémont, daughter of Gerard I, Count of Vaudémont.\nAlberic and Clémence had one son:\n\nAlberic III, Count of Dammartin.Alberic II was succeeded by his son Alberic III as Count of Dammartin upon his death.\nThe discussion in Aubry, Count of Dammartin, provides some insight into how Alberic III came to claim the countship. Further complicating the genealogy, Clémence, widowed, married Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, her second husband and his second wife. Renaud and his first wife, Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois, were the parents of Mathilde, wife of Alberic III.\n\nSources\nMathieu, J. N., Recherches sur les premiers Comtes de Dammartin, Mémoires publiés par la Fédération des sociétés historiques et archéologiques de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France, 1996\nPassage 7:\nAlberik II\nAlberic II was a bishop of Utrecht from 838 to 844.\nAlberic was the brother of his predecessor Frederick of Utrecht. Nothing is known about his administration. He was buried in the Saint Salvatorchurch in Utrecht.\nPassage 8:\nPope Agapetus II\nPope Agapetus II (died 8 November 955) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 10 May 946 to his death. A nominee of the princeps of Rome, Alberic II of Spoleto, his pontificate occurred during the period known as the Saeculum obscurum.\n\nPontificate\nAgapetus was born to a Roman father (a descendant of Consul Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius) and a Greek mother. He was elected pope on 10 May 946 after the death of Marinus II. The existence of an independent republic of Rome, ruled by Alberic II of Spoleto, meant that Agapetus was prevented from exercising any temporal or secular power in Rome and the Papal States. The struggle between Berengar II and Otto I for the Kingdom of Italy allowed Alberic to exercise complete control over Rome and Agapetus, meaning the pope was largely limited to managing internal church affairs. Even Agapetus’ invitation to Otto to intervene in Italian affairs in 951 was done at the instigation of Alberic, who was growing concerned at Berengar's growing power. However, when Otto's envoys, the bishops of Mainz and Chur, were sent to the pope to discuss Otto's reception in Rome and other more important questions, they were turned away by Alberic.Agapetus was forced to intervene in the dispute over the occupancy of the See of Reims. He ordered a synod to be held at Ingelheim in June 948 to resolve the rights of the rival claimants, Hugh of Vermandois and Artald of Reims. He sent his legate Marinus of Bomarzo to act on his behalf, while Agapetus wrote to a number of bishops, asking them to be present at the council. Through his legate the pope indicated his support for King Louis IV of France, and gave his support for reinstalling Artald as bishop of Reims. This council was followed up by another one at Trier, where Agapetus was again represented by Marinus of Bomarzo. In 949, Agapetus held a synod in Rome, which confirmed the rulings of the two councils. It condemned the former bishop Hugh and it excommunicated his father, Count Herbert II of Vermandois, for his opposition to King Louis IV.After receiving requests from both Louis IV of France and Otto I of Germany, Agapetus granted privileges to monasteries and nunneries within their respective kingdoms. He also was sympathetic towards Otto's plans to restructure the bishoprics within Germany, which were eventually aborted due to pressure exerted by William of Mainz. Around 948, Agapetus, granted the Archbishop of Hamburg the right of consecrating bishops in Denmark and other northern European countries instead of the pope. The pope was also allegedly asked by a Danish king named Frode, now considered legendary, to send missionaries to his kingdom.Agapetus was also asked to intervene in a dispute between Herhold, archbishop of Salzburg and Gerard, bishop of Lauriacum, who both claimed the title of metropolitan of all Pannonia. Agapetus dispatched a letter to the two claimants, in which he stated that the diocese of Lauriacum had been the metropolitan church of all Pannonia before the invasion of the Huns. However, following the ravages inflicted by them, the metropolitan had transferred his see to another city, and since that time Salzburg had been raised to an archbishopric. Consequently, both lawfully occupied their respective sees, and both were to retain their rank and diocese. Agapetus ruled that jurisdiction over western Pannonia would rest with Herhold, while the eastern part, along with the regions occupied by the Avars and the Moravians, would fall under Gerard.In Italy, Agapetus wrote to the dukes of Beneventum and Capua, demanding that monasteries be returned to the monks whom they had displaced. He also deposed the bishops of Termoli and Trivento who were accused of simony. Hoping to rejuvenate the religious life of the clerics in Italy, Agapetus, with the blessing of Alberic, asked for the abbot of Gorze Abbey to send some of his monks down and join the monastic community attached to the church of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.Agapetus died on 8 November 955, and was succeeded by Alberic's son, Octavian, who took the papal name of John XII. He was buried in the Lateran basilica, behind the apse, and close to the tombs of Leo V and Paschal II. Agapetus was noted for his caution and for the sanctity with which he led his life.\nPassage 9:\nPope Leo VII\nPope Leo VII (Latin: Leo VII; died 13 July 939) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from 3 January 936 to his death.\n\nElection\nLeo VII's election to the papacy in 936, after the death of Pope John XI, was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time. Alberic wanted to choose the pope so that the papacy would continue to yield to his authority. Leo was the priest of the church of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk. He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.\n\nPontificate\nAs pope, Leo VII reigned for only three years. Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny. Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and King Hugh of Italy. Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh's daughter Alda and Alberic. Leo VII also appointed Archbishop Frederick of Mainz as a reformer in Germany. Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.Leo VII died on 13 July 939, and was interred at St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Stephen VIII.\nPassage 10:\nSimon, Count of Ponthieu\nSimon of Dammartin (1180 – 21 September 1239) was a son of Alberic III of Dammartin (Aubry de Dammartin) and his wife Mathildis of Clermont,  heiress to the county of Clermont and daughter of Renaud II, Count of Clermont.\n\nBiography\nSimon was the brother of Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, who had abducted the heiress of Boulogne, and forced her to marry him. It is thought that in order to strengthen the alliance with the Dammartins, King Philip Augustus of France allowed Simon to marry Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, who was a niece of the king, in 1208. Renaud and Simon of Dammartin would eventually ally themselves with John, King of England. In 1214 the brothers stood against Philip Augustus in the Battle of Bouvines. The French won the battle, and Renaud was imprisoned, while Simon was exiled.\nMarie's father William IV, Count of Ponthieu had remained loyal to Philip Augustus. When William died in 1221, Philip Augustus denied Marie her inheritance and gave Ponthieu in custody to his cousin Robert III, Count of Dreux. After the death of Philip Augustus, Marie was able to negotiate an agreement with his successor Louis VIII in 1225. Ponthieu was held by the king, and Simon would only be allowed to enter this or any other fief if he obtained royal permission. In 1231 Simon agreed to the terms and added that he would not enter into marriage negotiations for his daughters without consent of the king.\n\nFamily\nSimon married Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, the daughter of  William IV, Count of Ponthieu and Alys, Countess of the Vexin. Marie became Countess of Ponthieu in 1225.Simon and his wife Marie had four daughters:\n\nJoan, Countess of Ponthieu (1220–1278), married 1) Ferdinand III of Castile. Mother of Eleanor of Castile, the wife of Edward I of England. Married 2) Jean de Nesle, Seigneur de Falvy et de La Hérelle.\nMathilda of Dammartin (-1279), married John of Châtellerault\nPhilippe of Dammartin (-1280), married 1) Raoul II of Lusignan, 2) Raoul II, Lord of Coucy, 3) Otto II, Count of Guelders.\nMaria of Dammartin, married John II, Count of Roucy.", "answers": ["Pope John X"], "length": 3293, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b6235b32ffcb6ea10641007b8fcddc811f28f8dd666db5eb"}

During his managerial career he managed the Dutch Guyana national team (now known as Suriname), DFC, DOS, RBC, Go Ahead, SC Veendam, VV Oldenzaal, Quick '20 and Tubantia.\n\nCareer\nBorn 19 June 1896 in Steenwijk, Overijssel, De Bois relocated to Amsterdam to play for AFC Ajax. De Bois made 64 appearances in the attack of Ajax, scoring 11 goals and helping his team to win the national championship in the 1930–31 season, his final season with the club.\n\nManagerial career\nAs one of the first football managers to be certified by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), De Bois took a managerial position with BVV De Kennemers in 1931. After three seasons he became manager of Hermes DVS, only to manage Sportclub Enschede three seasons later. From 1941 to 1948 he was the manager of DFC (now known as FC Dordrecht).\nIn 1948, De Bois became the manager of the Dutch Guyana national team, Dutch Guyana being the predecessor of Suriname, as the Dutch colony was known prior to 1976. He made his first appearance as newly appointed manager on 18 December 1948 in a 4–3 loss to Martinique.After his brief stint in South America, De Bois returned to the Netherlands, taking the manager position at VV DOS in Utrecht. In 1952 he then relocated to Roosendaal to manage RBC. In 1957 he became manager of SC Veendam, whom he led to a Tweede Klasse championship, and promotion to the Eerste Divisie in 1959. He later managed VV Oldenzaal, Quick '20 and Tubantia, before retiring as a manager.\n\nDeath\nOn 1 August 1975, De Bois was killed in a car accident near his home in Oldenzaal, it was the day that his former club AFC Ajax had organized a ceremonial friendly match between the senior teams of Ajax and FC Twente in honor of De Bois, who had officially declared his retirement from the sport that same year.\n\nCareer statistics\nPlayer\nHonours\nPlayer\nAFC AjaxNational championship: 1930–31\n\nCoach\nSC VeendamTweede Divisie: 1958–59\nPassage 3:\nMarije Brummel\nMarije Brummel (born 19 March 1985) is a Dutch football coach and former defensive midfielder.

It is the capital of the province of Overijssel and the province's second-largest municipality after Enschede with a population of 130,592 as of 1 December 2021. Zwolle borders on the province of Gelderland and is east of the river IJssel.\n\nHistory\nArchaeological findings indicate that the area surrounding Zwolle has been inhabited for a long time. A woodhenge that was found in the Zwolle-Zuid suburb in 1993 was dated to the Bronze Age period. During the Roman era, the area was inhabited by Salian Franks.\nThe modern city was founded around 800 CE by Frisian merchants and troops of Charlemagne. Previous spellings of its name include the identically pronounced Suolle, which means \"hill\" (cf. the English cognate verb \"to swell\"). This refers to an incline in the landscape between the four rivers surrounding the city, IJssel, Vecht, Aa and Zwarte Water. The hill was the only piece of land that would remain dry during the frequent floodings of the rivers. Zwolle was established on that incline.\n\nA document mentions the existence of a parish church dedicated to St Michael. That church, the Grote of Sint Michaëlskerk (St. Michael's church), was renovated in the first half of the 15th century and exists to this day. The church contains a richly carved pulpit, the work of Adam Straes van Weilborch (about 1620), some good carving and an exquisite organ (1721).\nOn 31 August 1230, the bishop of Utrecht granted Zwolle city rights. Zwolle became a member of the Hanseatic league in 1294, and in 1361 joined the war between the Hanseatic League and Valdemar IV of Denmark. In the 1370 Treaty of Stralsund that ended the war, Zwolle was awarded a vitte, a trade colony, in Scania, then part of Denmark. Zwolle's golden age came in the 15th century. Between 1402 and 1450, the city's Gross Regional Product multiplied by about six.In July 1324 and October 1361, regional noblemen set fire to Zwolle. In the 1324 fire, only nine buildings escaped the flames.\nZwolle was also, with Deventer, one of the centers of the Brethren of the Common Life, a monastic movement. 5 km (3 mi) from Zwolle, on a slight eminence called the Agnietenberg, (hill of St Agnes), once stood the Augustinian convent in which Thomas à Kempis spent the greatest part of his life and died (in 1471).At least as early as 1911, Zwolle had a considerable trade by river, a large fish market, and the most important cattle market in the Netherlands after Rotterdam. The more important industries comprised cotton manufactures, iron works, boat-building, dyeing and bleaching, tanning, rope-making, and salt-making.\nIn World War II, Zwolle was single-handedly liberated from the Germans by French-Canadian soldier Léo Major. He was made an honorary citizen of Zwolle in 2005 and a street is named after him, Leo Majorlaan.\n\n21st century\nIn 2004, Zwolle's De Librije restaurant was honored with 3 stars by Michelin Guide; as of 2018, it is one of only three restaurants so honored in the entire country.In 2023, Tewelde Goitom, an Eritrean convicted in Ethiopia of migrant smuggling, kidnapping in Sinai and human trafficking appeared at a pretrial hearing in Zwolle, which made international headlines.\n\nBlauwvingers\nCitizens of Zwolle are colloquially known as Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This dates back to 1682, when the St Michael's church tower collapsed. The authorities were strapped for cash and saw no option but to sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the counting of money.\n\nGeography\nBesides the Grote of Sint Michaëlskerk (St. Michael's church), the latter which houses a majestic Baroque organ built by Arp Schnitger, there are several other historic monuments in Zwolle. The Roman Catholic Onze Lieve Vrouwe ten Hemelopneming-basilica (Our Lady of the Assumption) dates back to 1399. The church tower, called Peperbus (pepperpot), is one of the tallest and most famous church towers in the Netherlands. The modernized town hall was originally built in 1448.Mention should also be made of the Sassenpoort (one of the old city gates), the city walls, the Mosterdmakerstoren (mustard makers' tower)(the complex where local mustard used to be made), a guild-house (1571), the former provincial government offices, a Dominican monastery, and on the Melkmarkt, two museums; the Stedelijk Museum Zwolle of antiquities and natural history, and the Vrouwenhuis. Museum de Fundatie, the fine art museum of the province of Overijssel, is hosted in the former Justice Hall on Blijmarkt Square.\nIn the western part of the city, west of the railway station, there is a quarter of Art Nouveau buildings, concentrated mostly on Koningin Wilhelminastraat, Prinses Julianastraat, and Prins Hendrikstraat. These three-store living houses were built in 1900s by various Dutch architects. Eleven of the buildings are protected by the Dutch government (rijksmonumenten).\nThe Broerenkerk church was part of the Dominican monastery founded in 1465. The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled. From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983–1988 it has been used for cultural events and it is now a bookstore.\n\nImage gallery\nNotable residents\nSee also People from Zwolle\nArts, culture, entertainment and the mediaWillem Victor Bartholomeus (1825–1892), organist and conductor\nHein Boele (born 1939), actor, Dutch voice of Elmo\nJonnie Boer (born 1965), chef with three Michelin stars\nGerard ter Borch (1617–1681), painter\nGerard ter Borch the Elder (1583–1662), painter\nMoses ter Borch (1645–1667), painter\nTooske Breugem (born 1974), television host actress\nHerman Brood (1946–2001), painter/rock star\nFunda Eryiğit (born 1984), Turkish actress\nWillem Grasdorp (1678–1723), painter\nAleida Greve (1670–1742), painter\nAnna Cornelia Holt (1671–1692), painter\nSophia Holt (1658–1734), painter\nAntonina Houbraken (1686–1736), draughtswoman\nMarnix Kappers (1943–2016), actor\nThomas à Kempis (c. 1380–1471), canon and mystic\nMaster I.

This is reflected in the high traffic volumes in and around the city. The A28 serves Zwolle with 4 exits, and runs from Utrecht to Groningen. It is being widened to 8 lanes across the IJssel River and 6 lanes from Zwolle to Meppel in 2010 and 2011. The motorway initially opened between 1964 and 1970. Another motorway, the A50, interchanges with A28 just west of the city, offering a route for southbound traffic to Apeldoorn and Eindhoven.\nThe N35 highway starts in Zwolle, where it forms the eastern section of the ring road of Zwolle, it runs as a non-motorway to Almelo and continues to Enschede as A35 motorway. The ringroad is mainly a 4-lane road, with numerous traffic lights. It forms a full ring, and also exists out of the N337 highway that runs to Deventer. Other sections of the ring road are not numbered. Parts of the ring road were widened to six lanes in 2010. Other numbered highways running from Zwolle are N331 to Hasselt, N758 to Nieuwleusen, N340 to Ommen and N764 to Kampen.\n\nBridges\nDue to nearby rivers, there are several major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most important bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during World War II.

The centre-back and full-back positions are essential in most modern formations. The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialised for certain formations dependent on the manager's style of play and tactics. Centre-backs are usually tall and positioned for their ability to win duels in the air.\n\nCentre-back\nThe centre-back (also known as a central defender or centre-half, as the modern role of the centre-back arose from the centre-half position) defends in the area directly in front of the goal and tries to prevent opposing players, particularly centre-forwards, from scoring. Centre-backs accomplish this by blocking shots, tackling, intercepting passes, contesting headers and marking forwards to discourage the opposing team from passing to them. In the modern game, most teams employ two or three centre-backs in front of the goalkeeper. The 4–2–3–1, 4–3–3, and 4–4–2 formations all use two centre-backs.\n\nIn possession of the ball, centre-backs are generally expected to make long and pinpoint passes to their teammates, or to kick unaimed long balls down the field. For example, a clearance is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender's goal. Due to the many skills centre-backs are required to possess in the modern game, many successful contemporary central-defensive partnerships have involved pairing a more physical defender with a defender who is quicker, more comfortable in possession and capable of playing the ball out from the back; examples of such pairings have included David Luiz, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho with Chelsea, Sergio Ramos, Raphaël Varane or Pepe with Real Madrid, Diego Godín and José María Giménez with Atlético Madrid and Uruguay, Nemanja Vidić and Rio Ferdinand with Manchester United, or Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Medhi Benatia with Juventus.Under normal circumstances, centre-backs are unlikely to score goals. However, when their team takes a corner kick or other set pieces, centre-backs may move forward to the opponents' penalty area; if the ball is passed in the air towards a crowd of players near the goal, then the heading ability of a centre-back is useful when trying to score. In this case, other defenders or midfielders will temporarily move into the centre-back positions.\nThere are two main defensive strategies used by defensive lines: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch; and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of tracking a particular opposition player. In the now obsolete man–to–man marking systems such as catenaccio, as well as the zona mista strategy that later arose from it, there were often at least two types of centre-backs who played alongside one another: at least one man–to–man marking centre-back, known as the stopper, and a free defender, which was usually known as the sweeper, or libero, whose tasks included sweeping up balls for teammates and also initiating attacks.\n\nSweeper (libero)\nThe sweeper (or libero) is a more versatile centre-back who \"sweeps up\" the ball if an opponent manages to breach the defensive line. This position is rather more fluid than that of other defenders who man-mark their designated opponents. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as libero, which is Italian for \"free\".Austrian manager Karl Rappan is thought to be a pioneer of this role, when he incorporated it into his catenaccio or verrou (also \"doorbolt/chain\" in French) system with Swiss club Servette during the 1930s, deciding to move one player from midfield to a position behind the defensive line, as a \"last man\" who would protect the back-line and start attacks again. As coach of Switzerland in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive sweeper called the verrouilleur, positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper.During his time with Soviet club Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev in the 1940s, Aleksandr Abramov also used a position similar to a sweeper in his defensive tactic known as the Volzhskaya Zashchepka, or the \"Volga clip\". Unlike the verrou, his system was not as flexible and was a development of the WM rather than the 2–3–5, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs.In Italy, the libero position was popularised by Nereo Rocco's and Helenio Herrera's use of catenaccio. The current Italian term for this position, libero, which is thought to have been coined by Gianni Brera, originated from the original Italian description for this role libero da impegni di marcatura (i.e., \"free from man-marking tasks\"); it was also known as the \"battitore libero\" (\"free hitter\", in Italian, i.e. a player who was given the freedom to intervene after their teammates, if a player had got past the defence, to clear the ball away). In Italian football, the libero was usually assigned the number six shirt.One of the first predecessors of the libero role in Italy was used in the so–called \"vianema\" system, a predecessor to catenaccio, which was used by Salernitana during the 1940s. The system originated from an idea that one of the club's players – Antonio Valese – posed to his manager Giuseppe Viani. Viani altered the English WM system – known as the sistema in Italy – by having his centre-half-back retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centre-forward, instead leaving his full-back (which, at the time, was similar to the modern centre-back role) free to function as what was essentially a sweeper, creating a 1–3–3–3 formation; he occasionally also used a defender in the centre-forward role, and wearing the number nine shirt, to track back and mark the opposing forwards, thus freeing up the full-backs from their marking duties. Andrea Schianchi of La Gazzetta dello Sport notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man–to–man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.\n\nIn Italy, the libero is also retroactively thought to have evolved from the centre-half-back role in the English WM system, or sistema, which was known as the centromediano metodista role in Italian football jargon, due to its association with the metodo system; in the metodo system, however, the \"metodista\" was given both defensive and creative duties, functioning as both a ball–winner and deep-lying playmaker. Juventus manager Felice Borel used Carlo Parola in the centre-half role, as a player who would drop back into the defence to mark opposing forwards, but also start attacks after winning back possession, in a similar manner to the sweeper, which led to the development of this specialised position. Indeed, Herrera's catenaccio strategy with his Grande Inter side saw him withdraw a player from his team's midfield and instead deploy them further-back in defence as a sweeper.Prior to Viani, Ottavio Barbieri is also thought by some pundits to have introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as Genoa's manager. Like Viani, he was influenced by Rappan's verrou, and made several alterations to the English WM system or \"sistema\", which led to his system being described as mezzosistema. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a terzino volante (or vagante, as noted at the time by former footballer and Gazzetta dello Sport journalist Renzo De Vecchi); the latter position was essentially a libero, which was later also used by Viani in his vianema system, and Rocco in his catenaccio system.Though sweepers may be expected to build counter-attacking moves, and as such require better ball control and passing ability than typical centre-backs, their talents are often confined to the defensive realm. For example, the catenaccio system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, often employed a predominantly defensive sweeper who mainly \"roamed\" around the back line; according to Schianchi, Ivano Blason is considered to be the first true libero in Italy, who – under manager Alfredo Foni with Inter and subsequently Nereo Rocco with Padova – would serve as the last man in his team, positioned deep behind the defensive line, and clearing balls away from the penalty area. Armando Picchi was subsequently also a leading exponent of the more traditional variant of this role in Helenio Herrera's Grande Inter side of the 1960s.The more modern libero possesses the defensive qualities of the typical libero while being able to expose the opposition during counterattacks by carrying or play the ball out from the back. Some sweepers move forward into midfield, and distribute the ball up-field, while others intercept passes and get the ball off the opposition without needing to hurl themselves into tackles. If the sweeper does move up the field to distribute the ball, they will need to make a speedy recovery and run back into their position. In modern football, its usage has been fairly restricted, with few clubs in the biggest leagues using the position.\n\nThe modern example of this position is most commonly believed to have been pioneered by Franz Beckenbauer, and subsequently Gaetano Scirea, Morten Olsen and Elías Figueroa, although they were not the first players to play this position. Aside from the aforementioned Blason and Picchi, earlier proponents also included Alexandru Apolzan, Velibor Vasović, and Ján Popluhár. Giorgio Mastropasqua was known for revolutionising the role of the libero in Italy during the 1970s; under his Ternana manager Corrado Viciani, he served as one of the first modern exponents of the position in the country, due to his unique technical characteristics, namely a player who was not only tasked with defending and protecting the back-line, but also advancing out of the defence into midfield and starting attacking plays with their passing after winning back the ball. Other defenders who have been described as sweepers include Bobby Moore, Daniel Passarella, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Fernando Hierro, Miodrag Belodedici, Matthias Sammer, and Aldair, due to their ball skills, vision, and long passing ability. Though it is rarely used in modern football, it remains a highly respected and demanding position.\nRecent and successful uses of the sweeper include by Otto Rehhagel, Greece's manager, during UEFA Euro 2004. Rehhagel utilized Traianos Dellas as Greece's sweeper to great success, as Greece became European champions. For Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan, Brazilian international Lúcio adopted the sweeper role too, but was also not afraid to travel long distances with the ball, often ending up in the opposition's final third.\nAlthough this position has become largely obsolete in modern football formations, due to the use of zonal marking and the offside trap, certain players such as Daniele De Rossi, Leonardo Bonucci, Javi Martínez and David Luiz have played a similar role as a ball-playing central defender in a 3–5–2 or 3–4–3 formation; in addition to their defensive skills, their technique and ball-playing ability allowed them to advance into midfield after winning back possession, and function as a secondary playmaker for their teams.Some goalkeepers, who are comfortable leaving their goalmouth to intercept and clear through balls, and who generally participate more in play, such as René Higuita, Manuel Neuer, Edwin van der Sar, Fabien Barthez, Marc-André ter Stegen, Bernd Leno and Ederson, among others, have been referred to as sweeper-keepers.\n\nFull-back\nThe full-backs (the left-back and the right-back) locate the holding wide positions and traditionally stay in defence at all times, until a set-piece. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.In the early decades of football under the 2–3–5 formation, the two full-backs were essentially the same as modern centre-backs in that they were the last line of defence and usually covered opposing forwards in the middle of the field.The later 3–2–5 style involved a third dedicated defender, causing the left and right full-backs to occupy wider positions. Later, the adoption of 4–2–4 with another central defender led the wide defenders to play even further over to counteract the opposing wingers and provide support to their own down the flanks, and the position became increasingly specialised for dynamic players who could fulfil that role as opposed to the central defenders who remained fairly static and commonly relied on strength, height and positioning.\n\nIn the modern game, full-backs have taken on a more attacking role than was the case traditionally, often overlapping with wingers down the flank. Wingerless formations, such as the diamond 4–4–2 formation, demand the full-back to cover considerable ground up and down the flank. Some of the responsibilities of modern full-backs include:\n\nProvide a physical obstruction to opposition attacking players by shepherding them towards an area where they exert less influence. They may manoeuvre in a fashion that causes the opponent to cut in towards the centre-back or defensive midfielder with their weaker foot, where they are likely to be dispossessed. Otherwise, jockeying and smart positioning may simply pin back a winger in an area where they are less likely to exert influence.\nMaking off-the-ball runs into spaces down the channels and supplying crosses into the opposing penalty box.\nThrow-ins are often assigned to full-backs.\nMarking wingers and other attacking players. Full-backs generally do not commit to challenges in their opponents' half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the side. Markers must, however, avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organization.\nMaintaining tactical discipline by ensuring other teammates do not overrun the defensive line and inadvertently play an opponent onside.\nProviding a passing option down the flank; for instance, by creating opportunities for sequences like one-two passing moves.\nIn wingerless formations, full-backs need to cover the roles of both wingers and full-backs, although defensive work may be shared with one of the central midfielders.\nAdditionally, attacking full-backs help to pin both opposition full-backs and wingers deeper in their own half with aggressive attacking intent. Their presence in attack also forces the opposition to withdraw players from central midfield, which the team can seize to its advantage.Due to the physical and technical demands of their playing position, successful full-backs need a wide range of attributes, which make them suited for adaptation to other roles on the pitch. Many of the game's utility players, who can play in multiple positions on the pitch, are natural full-backs. Two rather prominent examples are former A.C. Milan left-back Paolo Maldini and the PSG full-back Sergio Ramos, who have played on the flanks as full-backs and in central defence throughout their career. In the modern game, full-backs often chip in a fair share of assists with their runs down the flank when the team is on a counter-attack. The more common attributes of full-backs, however, include:\n\nPace and stamina to handle the demands of covering large distances up and down the flank and outrunning opponents.\nA healthy work rate and team responsibility.\nMarking and tackling abilities and a sense of anticipation.\nGood off-the-ball ability to create attacking opportunities for their team by running into empty channels.\nDribbling ability. Many of the game's eminent attacking full-backs are excellent dribblers in their own right and occasionally deputize as attacking wingers.\nPlayer intelligence. As is common for defenders, full-backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full-backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full-back to focus on holding their defensive line.Full-backs rarely score goals, as they often have to stay back to cover for the centre-backs during corner kicks and free kicks, when the centre backs usually go forward to attempt to score from headers. That said, full-backs can sometimes score during counterattacks by running in from the wings, often involving one-two passing moves with midfield players.\n\nWing-back\nThe wing-back is a variation on the full-back, but with a heavier emphasis on attack. Wing-backs are typically some of the fastest players on a team, when employed. Wing-backs are typically used in a formation with three centre-backs and are sometimes classified as midfielders instead of defenders. They can, however, be used in formations with only two centre-backs, such as in Jürgen Klopp's 4–3–3 system that he uses at Liverpool, in which the wing-backs play high up the field to compensate for a lack of width in attack. In the evolution of the modern game, wing-backs are the combination of wingers and full-backs. As such, this position is one of the most physically demanding in modern football. Successful use of wing-backs is one of the main prerequisites for the 3–4–3, 3–5–2 and 5–3–2 formations to function effectively.\nWing-backs are often more adventurous than full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and defend effectively against opponents' attacks down the flanks. A defensive midfielder may be fielded to cover the advances of wing-backs. It can also be occupied by wingers and side midfielders in a three centre-back formation, as seen by ex-Chelsea, ex-Inter Milan, and ex- Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte.\nExamples of players who could and did play as wing-backs were AC Milan teammates Cafu and Serginho, Barcelona player Dani Alves, Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid's Galácticos era, former River Plate's defender Juan Pablo Sorín, World Cup winning German Andreas Brehme, Parma's legend Antonio Benarrivo, Angelo Di Livio of Juventus and Italy and former Corinthians, Arsenal and Barcelona star Sylvinho.\n\nSee also\nPassage 8:\n1982 Bulgarian Cup Final\nThe 1982 Bulgarian Cup final was the 42nd final of the Bulgarian Cup (in this period the tournament was named Cup of the Soviet Army), and was contested between Lokomotiv Sofia and Lokomotiv Plovdiv on 12 June 1982 at Slavi Aleksiev Stadium in Pleven.

Many of the scenes take advantage of well-known sites around an empty, still New York City. John the Baptist gathers a diverse band of youthful disciples to follow and learn from the teachings of Jesus. These disciples then proceed to form a roving acting troupe that enacts Jesus's parables through the streets of New York. They often make references to vaudeville shtick.\n\nCast\nVictor Garber as Jesus Christ\nKatie Hanley as Katie, a diner waitress\nDavid Haskell as John the Baptist and Judas Iscariot\nMerrell Jackson as Merrell, a garment trader\nJoanne Jonas as Joanne, a ballet dancer\nRobin Lamont as Robin, a window shopper\nGilmer McCormick as Gilmer, a model\nJeffrey Mylett as Jeffrey, a taxi driver\nJerry Sroka as Jerry, a parking attendant\nLynne Thigpen as Lynne, a college studentGarber, Haskell, Jonas, Lamont, McCormick and Mylett had performed in one, or more, of the original 1970 Carnegie Mellon creation or the earliest commercial productions: 1971 Off-Broadway, 1971 Melbourne, and 1972 Toronto.\n\nMusical numbers\n\"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\" - John the Baptist\n\"Save the People\" - Jesus\n\"Day by Day\" - Robin Lamont\n\"Turn Back, O Man\" - Joanne Jonas\n\"Bless the Lord\" - Lynne Thigpen\n\"All for the Best\" - Jesus, Judas\n\"All Good Gifts\" - Merrell Jackson\n\"Light of the World\" - Jerry, Gilmer, Jeffrey, Robin\n\"Alas for You\" - Jesus (Tebelak voices the Pharisee Monster)\n\"By My Side\" - Katie\n\"Beautiful City\" - Company\n\"Beautiful City\" (Instrumental Reprise)\n\"On the Willows\"\n\"Finale\" - Jesus\n\"Day by Day\" (Reprise) - Company\n\nDifferences from the musical\nThe song \"Beautiful City\" was written for and first included in the film, while the songs \"Learn Your Lessons Well\" and \"We Beseech Thee\" were omitted. The melody for \"Learn Your Lessons Well\" is used briefly in an early scene of the film and again as incidental music, and snippets of both \"Learn Your Lessons Well\" and \"We Beseech Thee\" are heard in the scene inside Cherry Lane Theatre when Jesus plays their melodies on the piano during the story of The Prodigal Son.\nWhile the play requires very little stage dressing, the film places emphasis on dramatic location shots in Manhattan. (Except for the opening scenes and the final scene, the city streets and parks are devoid of people other than the cast.) Locations include the following:\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge, where John the Baptist walks down the pedestrian walkway while humming \"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\" in the opening sequence;\nBethesda Fountain in Central Park, in which the new disciples are baptized by John while singing \"Prepare Ye\";\nThe Andrew Carnegie Mansion, in which they sing \"Turn Back, O Man\";\nTimes Square, where Jesus and John are silhouetted by a screen of lights as they dance to \"All For the Best\";\nThe central fountain at Lincoln Center, where Jesus and Judas dance on the fountain's stone lip as they sing \"All for the Best\";\nThe top of North Tower of the World Trade Center, which was nearing completion at the time of the film's production;\nThe Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument on Riverside Drive;\nA bird's-eye view of Fifth Avenue from above and behind St. Patrick's Cathedral, looking down on the Tishman Building  during \"Beautiful City\";\nThe exterior and interior of the Cherry Lane Theatre – where the first musical version of Godspell began its off-Broadway run the year before the film was shot – where the story of The Prodigal Son is told.\nThe long approaches of the Hell Gate Bridge on Randall's Island, where the disciples switch to their colorful clothing after baptism near the start of the film, and where they carry Jesus' body through the arches, creating a barrel-vaulted cathedral effect, after his crucifixion on a chain-link fence.Vocally, the chorus is very much in the same style, but solo parts are, at times, more lyrical. Notably, in \"All Good  Gifts\", whereas Lamar Alford had used a dramatic tenor voice, Merrell Jackson uses a lighter voice and falsetto for the high ornament, which creates a joyous effect.\nRegarding the band, all four of the musicians from the original stage production and cast album were retained for the film recording. These musicians were Steve Reinhardt on keyboards, Jesse Cutler on acoustic and lead guitar and bass, Richard LaBonte on rhythm guitar and bass, and Ricky Shutter on drums and percussion. Reviewer William Ruhlmann explains that by having a larger budget than had been available for the stage, Schwartz was able to expand the line-up by adding key studio personnel such as lead guitarist Hugh McCracken (on \"Prepare Ye (The Way of the Lord)\"), keyboardist Paul Shaffer, bass player Steve Manes, a horn section, and six strings.Ruhlmann describes Schwartz as being \"better able to realize the score's pop tendencies than he had on the cast album... this was a less complete version of the score, but it was much better performed and produced, making this a rare instance in which the soundtrack album is better than the original cast album.”\n\nReception\nThe film was entered into the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.Godspell received generally positive reviews in 1973. Allmovie Guide gives the film a three out of five rating. Various bands have covered songs from the film/musical.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 15 critics.The film was recognized by the American Film Institute in 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers – Nominated.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nGodspell (1971 Off-Broadway Cast)\nJesus Christ Superstar\nJesus Christ Superstar (film)\nPassage 3:\nMadame Sin\nMadame Sin is a 1972 British thriller film directed by David Greene and starring Bette Davis, Robert Wagner, Denholm Elliott and Gordon Jackson.

The few friends whom they make among the locals, including Susannah's aunt Agatha, warn them that the family mill is cursed and urge the Keltons to leave immediately and never look back.\nRefusing to bow to superstition, the couple consider rebuilding the abandoned mill. They become the target of a gang of local thugs led by Susannah's lecherous cousin, Ethan. Their reign of terror is ended by something still living in the shuttered attic room of the mill, something that caused Susannah to have nightmares as a child.\n\nCast\nGig Young as Mike Kelton\nCarol Lynley as Susannah Whately Kelton / Sarah\nOliver Reed as Ethan\nFlora Robson as Aunt Agatha\nJudith Arthy as Emma\nRick Jones as Luther Whately\nAnn Bell as Mary Whately\nWilliam Devlin as Zebulon Whately\nCharles Lloyd-Pack as Barge Master\nBernard Kay as Tait\nDonald Sutherland as Zebulon (voice)\nCelia Hewitt as Aunt Sarah\nRobert Cawdron as Luther Whately\nMurray Evans as gang member\nClifford Diggins as gang member\nPeter Porteous as gang member\nAnita Anderson as Susannah as a child\n\nProduction\nThe script was originally written by Alexander Jacobs and Nathaniel Tanchuck.

(also known as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane...?) is a 1991 American made-for-television thriller film directed by David Greene and adapted for the small screen by Brian Taggert. It is based on the 1960 novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? by Henry Farrell and the 1962 theatrical film of the same name. It stars real-life sisters Lynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson and Vanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson, in the roles previously played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the 1962 adaptation.\nThe film was adapted to contemporary times, with Blanche's film success taking place in the 1960s instead of the 1930s. Her films were being rediscovered on home video instead of television reruns. Jane had been a child film star (replacing the original's vaudeville success), though her films were unavailable, leading to her jealousy.\n\nPlot\nIn the 1940s, \"Baby\" Jane Hudson is a world-famous child star. Jane dominates her shy sister Blanche, who, as Jane's understudy and stunt double, longs to have an acting career of her own. By the 1960s, Blanche has become a serious and celebrated actress, while Jane's career fades into obscurity. Blanche's own career is ultimately cut short by a car accident that paralyzes her from the waist down, after which Jane was committed to a psychiatric hospital. Everyone believes that Jane, jealous of her sister's popularity, had run her over with her car and then gone insane with guilt.\nIn the present day, the aging sisters live together in a crumbling Brentwood mansion, where Jane, who still dresses herself in her old Baby Jane clothes and makeup, cares for the paraplegic Blanche. Blanche's films have recently become available on home video and television, launching her into a modest comeback. Jane resents both her sister's enduring popularity and her own role as caretaker and takes out her resentment on Blanche with vicious pranks. She intercepts all of the mail addressed to her sister, particularly fan letters, and constantly reminds Blanche that she never would have had a career if not for Jane's success. Blanche and her physical therapist, Dominick, worry that Jane's pranks might turn violent if she finds out Blanche is selling the house without her knowledge.\nHoping that she can also stage a comeback, Jane goes to a video store to see which of her old films are available on tape. Billy Korn, the store's owner, recognizes her as Baby Jane, much to her delight. Korn offers to manage her comeback and promises to arrange a spot in a talent show for $1,000. Jane agrees without realizing that he is a con artist only after her money.\nBack at home, Blanche tries to call her sister's psychiatrist, only to have Jane overhear the conversation and then physically attack her. Blanche tries to escape, but Jane locks her in her upstairs bedroom with no means of communication. After being starved for days, Blanche rummages through Jane's bedroom drawers for food and discovers that she has been forging her signature on checks to steal her money. Dominick arrives for his physical therapy session and discovers that Jane has bound and gagged her sister with duct tape. As he is attempting to cut her loose, Jane stabs Dominick to death with a pair of scissors and hides his body in the basement screening room.\nJane is shocked to learn that the \"talent show\" Korn arranged is actually a drag revue, complete with Korn himself dressed as Blanche. When they try to perform a duet from their childhood, the audience ridicules Jane's appearance and her poor singing voice, leading her to suffer a mental breakdown and be forced offstage. Korn drives to the mansion and finds Blanche, bound and gagged, near death. Jane stabs him to death with a broken trophy.\nJane puts Blanche in her car and drives to the beach, where their fondest memories took place during their childhood. Blanche admits she had been driving the car on the night of the accident but had allowed Jane to take the blame. She apologizes for never telling Jane the truth, and they are momentarily reconciled. The police arrive to find Blanche unconscious and near death. As they radio for help, Jane walks into the sea, attempting suicide before a police officer drags her out. The last shot is of Jane's smiling face as she goes willingly with the police.\n\nCast\nVanessa Redgrave as Blanche Hudson\nLynn Redgrave as Baby Jane Hudson\nBruce A. Young as Dominick\nAmy Steel as Connie Trotter\nJohn Scott Clough as Frank Trotter\nJohn Glover as Billy Korn\nVinny Argiro as Abe\nPat Skipper as Director\nBarry Dennen as Stage Manager\nSamantha Jordan as Young Baby Jane Hudson\nJ. Michael Flynn as Ray Hudson\nErinn Canavan as Young Blanche Hudson\nBeans Morocco as Drag Queen\nRoy Fegan as Police Officer\n\nDifferences from the novel\nBeing set during the 1990s as opposed to the 1960s in the original story, the film takes a modern overtone including Baby Jane being a film actress instead of a vaudevillian, and Blanche's use of the stairlift and cassette tape. Characters Elvira Stitt, the cleaning lady, and Edwin Flagg are replaced with Dominick, the physical therapist, and Billy Korn. The film also features scenes depicting the 1990s downtown district of Hollywood. Another change is Jane getting arrested at the end of the film.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a retrospective review, TV Guide awarded the film two stars, saying it \"fares admirably when compared with the well-remembered original\".", "answers": ["Godspell"], "length": 3964, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3f73dcdfb096a95f16485ba2632ca6424220d373502b7247"}

They took their name from the Fatima Mansions corporation flats in Rialto, Dublin.The Fatima Mansions were a popular live band, and gained indie chart success with their albums Viva Dead Ponies, Bertie's Brochures, Valhalla Avenue and Lost in the Former West.\nThey entered the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in 1992 with a heavily reworked version of Bryan Adams' song \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", taken from an NME tribute album in aid of the charity, the Spastics Society. The single was a double A-side; the flip-track, Manic Street Preachers' version of \"Suicide Is Painless\" received most of the radio airplay.\nThey also gained mainstream exposure by opening a European leg of U2's Zoo TV Tour in 1992, although they were nearly booed off the stage and almost started a riot when front man Coughlan swore at a Milan audience and insulted the Pope. The band often courted controversy with religion, dictators, empires and general authority being targets for Coughlan's vitriol. Despite this, The Guardian newspaper described him as \"the most underrated lyricist in pop today\", and DJ John Peel said he could \"listen to Cathal Coughlan sing the phone book\".\nThe album and singles campaign for 1994's Lost in the Former West was styled on the glamour of Liberace, and featured a cover version of The Walker Brothers's \"Nite Flights\".\n\nDiscography\nSingles\n\"Only Losers Take the Bus\" (1989), Kitchenware\n\"Blues for Ceausescu\" (1990), Kitchenware\n\"Hive\" E.P.

Their second album The Clock Comes Down the Stairs reached number one in the UK Indie Chart. They developed cult followings in the Irish and UK indie music scenes before breaking up in 1988.\nCoughlan went on to lead the harder-edged The Fatima Mansions, who found critical success with their aggressive live shows and five consistent albums, but broke up in 1995.\nIn the following years Coughlan released intermittent solo material with musicians such as O’Hagan, Jonathan Fell and Nick Allum. His solo career and reputation peaked in 2021 with the well received album Song of Co-Aklan (composed from the point of view of his alter ego \"Co Aklan\") which was released to critical acclaim fifteen years after his previous solo album Foburg (2006).\n\nCareer\nMicrodisney\nBorn in the village of Glounthaune, just outside of Cork city, Coughlan was active on the local Cork scene in the late 1970s, and after meeting Sean O'Hagan formed Microdisney as a duo in 1980. Following early local success, they moved to London, and recorded for the independent record label Rough Trade and, later and unsuccessfully, for the major label Virgin Records.His lyrics with Microdisney focus on politics, relationships and the interplay between the two, and incorporate surreal imagery and literary and historical references. His voice on these records has been compared to Scott Walker, whom Coughlan considered a major influence. They broke up in 1988, after which O'Hagan and Coughlan formed separate bands, the High Llamas and the Fatima Mansions.Microdisney reunited after three decades and performed together in London, Dublin and Cork in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, Coughlan and his bandmates received the IMRO/NCH Trailblazer Award, given to \"culturally important\" Irish albums (in this instance, for the 1985 album The Clock Comes Down The Stairs).\n\nThe Fatima Mansions\nCoughlan formed the Fatima Mansions in 1988, naming the band after the large public housing complex in the working class area of Rialto in Dublin's inner city. They became known for their aggressive music and song titles, including the early tracks \"Blues for Ceausescu\" and \"Bugs Fucking Bunny\". Their 1989 debut album was Against Nature followed by Viva Dead Ponies in 1990 and the 1991 EP Bertie's Brochures and the acclaimed albums Valhalla Avenue (1992) and Lost in the Former West (1994). Due to intra-band tension and contractual difficulties with Virgin Records, Fatima Mansions broke up in 1995.\n\nSolo work and collaborations\nContractual issues prevented Coughlan from performing in the aftermath of break up of the Fatima Mansions. His following album was released in August 2010 with the single Rancho Tetrahedron, credited to \"Cathal Coughlan and the Grand Necropolitan Quartet\". He later admitted that the supporting live performances were aggressive \"because there was just all this business nonsense going on and I wasn’t able to perform new stuff in public at all because I was in certain contractual difficulties\". Reviewing the album, The Irish Times wrote that \"Coughlan's mixture of acerbity and dark lyricism is sustained on his fifth solo album, that there is a subtle Latin influence on the music, and Coughlan's Scott Walker inflected voice has never sounded better.\"He recorded with comedian Sean Hughes, High Llamas drummer Rob Allum (under the name of his alter-ego \"Cod\"), and Paul Jarvis of SLAB! as \"Bubonique\", releasing a number of CDs parodying current musical trends, including the albums 20 Golden Showers and Trance Arse Volume 3. He collaborated in 2011 with the British The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder vocalist Luke Haines on the song/speech show The North Sea Scrolls which premiering at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011. The studio recording of The North Sea Scrolls was released on 19 November 2012.Coughlan's last album Song of Co-Aklan was completed at the end of 2019 in collaboration with Nick Allum, Aindrias O'Gruama, Jon Fell, Luke Haines, Audrey Riley, James Woodrow and Rhodri Marsden. It was preceded by the single \"Song of Co-Aklan\" and released in March 2021 on Dimple Discs. He formed the duo Telefís with US-based Irish producer and musician Jacknife Lee with whom he released the album A hAon in 2022. and a further release A Dó  in October 2022.\n\nPersonal life\nCoughlan, survived by his wife, Julie, died aged 61 in hospital on 18 May 2022 after a long illness.\n\nDiscography\nMicrodisney\nKaught at the Kampus (compilation EP) – 1980\nWe Hate You South African Bastards! – 1984\nEverybody Is Fantastic (1984)\nThe Clock Comes Down the Stairs – 1985, re-issued in 2013\nCrooked Mile – 1986\n39 Minutes – 1988\n\nFatima Mansions\nAgainst Nature – 1989\nViva Dead Ponies – 1990\nBertie's Brochures – (mini-album) 1991\nValhalla Avenue – 1992\nLost in the Former West – 1994\n\nSolo\nGrand Necropolitan – 1996\nBlack River Falls – 2000\nThe Sky's Awful Blue – 2002\nFoburg – 2006\nRancho Tetrahedron– 2010\nSong of Co-Aklan - 2021\n\nTelefís\na hAon – 2022\na Dó - 2022\n\nCitations\nGeneral sources\nMcDermott, Paul. \"Get That Monster Off the Stage\".

A review from Allmusic stated \"Coughlan's lyrics are similarly aggressive throughout, with actions of overt and implicit violence in nearly every song and a grouchily misanthropic, almost nihilistic lyrical world-view throughout\".Against Nature reached #12 in the UK Indie Chart.This album would later be compiled with other pre-Viva Dead Ponies work of The Fatima Mansions on the 1992 Come Back My Children compilation album, while \"Only Losers Take The Bus\" would also feature on the American edition of Viva Dead Ponies.\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed and arranged by Cathal Coughlan\n\n\"Only Losers Take the Bus\" (3:08)\n\"The Day I Lost Everything\" (4:16)\n\"Wilderness on Time\" (3:15)\n\"You Won't Get Me Home\" (3:01)\n\"13th Century Boy\" (4:00)\n\"Bishop of Babel\" (2:53)\n\"Valley of the Dead Cars\" (3:19)\n\"Big Madness/Monday Club Carol\" (4:38)\n\nPersonnel\nCathal Coughlan – vocals, keyboards, programming\nAndrías Ó Grúama – guitar\nZac Woolhouse – keyboards\nJohn Fell – bass guitar\nNicholas Tiompan Allum – drums, windTechnicalBill Gill, Jamie Lane, Martin Harrison, Ralph Jezzard - engineer\nLawrence Bogle - cover illustration\nPassage 9:\nThe Back of the Pipes, Dublin\nThe Back of the Pipes was the name of a lane and pipe route in Dublin 8, Ireland, located between Dolphin's Barn and James's Walk. The lane replaced a branch of the Grand Canal which ultimately feed the Dublin city basin (now replaced with Basin Lane / Basin Street) and the Grand Canal Harbour. \nIt ran along the remote end of the back gardens of the houses on Rubens Street from the Dolphin's Barn end across from the Leinster Cinema, down the back of Fatima Mansions, on past the back gardens of the houses between Mallin Ave and Lourdes Road, past the \"stone sofa\" and finally came out at James's Walk across from the old iron footbridge.\nIt took its name from an important part of the Dublin water supply originally erected in the years following 1245.\n\nThe City Watercourse\nThe main water supply for the city of Dublin prior to the arrival of the Hiberno-Normans in the twelfth century was the river Poddle. The Liffey was tidal up to Islandbridge and thus undrinkable. Due to increased growth and development after their arrival it became imperative for the authorities to provide a greatly increased water supply. The monks of the Abbey of St. Thomas in 1242 diverted part of the River Dodder at Balrothery near Firhouse via a man-made channel to the River Poddle at Kimmage. This canal passed through Templeogue and joined the River Tymon, forming the Poddle. The flow was separated at Mount Argus, near Mount Jerome Cemetery, by a construction known as the Tongue, one third of the flow being allocated to the city basin or cistern. This part of the flow left the Poddle proper and proceeded to St. James Terrace in Dolphin's Barn. It advanced on to James's Walk on the summit of an elevated rampart of earth and stone which became known as the \"Back of the Pipes\" or the \"Ridges\", to a cistern near the present Waterworks Headquarters at Marrowbone Lane.\n\nHistory\nThis watercourse supplied the city for over five hundred years. It also supplied the mills of the Abbey of St. Thomas at Thomas Court, and was a source of bitter contention between the citizens and the Abbot; the latter eventually agreeing to pay \"yerly out of ther myllis without any contradiction, unto the Keper of the watyr of the cittie for the tyme beyng eyght busselis of corn, that ys to say four peckes of whet and four peckes of malt,\" for the use of the said water-course. In 1555 the Mayor of Dublin was given authority to keep the whole course from the Dodder to Dolphin's Barn. However disputes arose between the city authorities and the Earl of Meath, who controlled the Liberty of St. Thomas, so that in the 18th century it was the joint property of the city and the Earls of Meath.The ancient records of Dublin city have numerous references concerning the upkeep of these water works. One of the earliest is a request from King Henry III in 1245 for a supply of water for the King's Hall. The lead pipe which carried this supply was uncovered in Castle Street, next to Dublin Castle, in 1787, with an inscription from the 13th century. The rebel followers of Silken Thomas in 1534, according to Hollinshed's Chronicles, \"cut the pipes of the conduits whereby (the city) should be destitute of fresh water\".In 1721 the Corporation reconstructed and raised the level of the City Basin at St James Gate, in the final development of the Poddle supply.\nThe lane was taken into the surrounding properties but the rampart remains at the end of the gardens backing onto its former location.\n\nThe locality\nThe locality contained the Old Leinster Cinema (later the Dublin Ice Rink, now modern apartments) near Reuben Street and Emerald Square. Fatima Mansions and Lourdes Road backed on to the \"Pipes\". This part of the Grand Canal has been filled in and the Luas now runs along it. The visitors' centre at Guinness's brewery is a few minutes walk away from the other end of the \"Pipes\". \nThe Back of the Pipes was a popular meeting place for courting couples in the 19th century and much later into the 20th century. A place nearby where they would stroll was called the \"Stone Sofa\", located at St. James Walk.In Dublin slang \"at the back of the pipes\" became a response to an enquiry regarding the unknown whereabouts of an object or person.\nPassage 10:\nFatima Mansions (housing)\nFatima Mansions is an extensive public housing complex located in Rialto, Dublin. In the early 21st century, it underwent a substantial urban renewal programme with the assistance of public and private funding. All existing apartment blocks were demolished to make way for 600 accommodation units, consisting of social, affordable and private housing along with community, business and leisure facilities at a cost of €200 million. The blocks have since been renamed Herberton Apartments, but the area is still referred to locally as Fatima, which is the name of the adjacent Luas Red Line tram stop.\n\nHistory\nWork on the original complex started before World War II under the direction of Dublin Corporation (now Dublin City Council) but construction was held up due to material shortages. The first phase of construction was finally completed after the war and the first tenants began to move in during 1947: the development consisted of fifteen blocks, each of four floors in height. They replaced tenement housing for the area's working-class residents, and provided a great improvement in living conditions. In the mid 1980s the area became notorious for its high levels of heroin use and drug dealing, which eventually led to the original complex's demolition due to the drug problem's severity.The Fatima Mansions were an Irish art rock group named after the flats. Speaking in 2021, lead singer of the band Cathal Coughlan agreed that he had a \"pang of guilt\" for calling the band Fatima Mansions and said that the name of the band was \"emphatically not poking fun at poor social conditions that were being foisted upon people in inner-city Dublin\".", "answers": ["The Fatima Mansions"], "length": 3630, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "47cd5e5112b2781b51123ef1de243e4e0818c2dd36fdaf5c"}

Starost of Owrucz.\nHe took part in the Magnate wars in Moldavia and supported False Dmitriy I and False Dmitriy II during the Muscovite Time of Troubles and the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18). He was also involved in extinguishing Nalyvaiko Uprising.\nHis son Jeremi after his death was raised by his relative, Konstanty Wiśniowiecki and eventually became a powerful magnate, one of the most famous members of the Wiśniowiecki family. His daughter Anna Wiśniowiecka was a potential marriage candidate to the king Władysław IV Waza in 1636. Although Władysław was quite supportive of the marriage, it was blocked by the Sejm.

The Polish throne was vacant again, so another free election was necessary. As in 1669, the main candidates were French Duke Louis, Grand Conde, Philip William, Count Palatine of Neuburg (both supported by Louis XIV of France), and Charles V, Duke of Lorraine.\nHetman John Sobieski, who was a very influential figure in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not express interest in the Polish crown, and before the election stated that he did wish to be elected. Sobieski was hated by Lithuanian magnates of the Pac family, who in January 1674, during the Convocation Sejm, demanded that a bill prohibiting native Poles (or Piasts) from running in the election should be introduced.\nThe fact that the Pac family promoted such a bill means that Sobieski was regarded by many as a possible candidate. His name was mentioned by envoys of the House of Habsburg, and by French newspaper La Gazette. French diplomats later stated that Sobieski himself hesitated between running in the election, and supporting the Grand Conde.\nThe election began on Saturday, June 19, 1674. Despite the protests of Lithuanians, the Bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki initiated the process, by singing the hymn Veni Sancte Spiritus. The next day, Sunday, June 20, was dedicated to religious ceremonies and behind the scenes negotiations. On Monday, June 21, the Bishop of Vilnius, Michał Pac stated that Lithuania agreed to the Piast candidate. In the afternoon of the same day, John III Sobieski became King of Poland.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Poland in the Early Modern era (1569–1795)\nRoyal elections in Poland\nGolden Liberty\nHenrician Articles\n\nSources\nU.

She was a wife of Michał Wiśniowiecki and patron of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nShe was a daughter of Moldavian hospodar Ieremia Movilă and Elisabeta Movilă and a cousin of Metropolitan of Kiev Peter Mohyla. Due to the conflict with Michael the Brave, 1600 Ieremia was forced to move his family to Galicia, according to the Polish Biographical Dictionary to town of Ustia (today it is a village of Ustia-Zelene in Chortkiv Raion).\nAt age 14 Regina married Polish magnate of Ruthenian origin Michał Wiśniowiecki in 1603 in the city of Suceava, Moldavia.\n\nFamily\nRegina was married only to Michał Wiśniowiecki and had at least four children with him.\nJeremi Wiśniowiecki (1612-1651)\nAlexander Wiśniowiecki (?-1629)\nJerzy Wiśniowiecki (?-1629)\nAnna (?-1648), married Zbigniew Firlej\nPassage 7:\nKatarzyna Ostrogska (1602–1642)\nPrincess Katarzyna Ostrogska (1602–1642) was a Polish–Lithuanian noblewoman, founder of the city of Biała (modern Janów Lubelski). She was the maternal grandmother of King of Poland Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki.\n\nLife\nShe was the daughter of voivode of Wołyń Prince Oleksander Ostrogski h. Ostrozky, and Anna Kostka h. Dąbrowa. She married voivode of Podole and Kijów (Kyiv, also Kiev) Chancellor Tomasz Zamoyski h. Jelita. She became the mother of Jan \"Sobiepan\" Zamoyski (1627-1665), voivode of Kijów and Sandomierz (married Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien, the later consort to King John III Sobieski), Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska (1623-1672), mother of King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, and Joanna Barbara Zamoyska (1626-1653).\nWidowed in 1638, she took over the management of the Zamoyski Estate. 21 July 1640, the king granted her the privilege to found the city of Biała. She was also granted the right to organize the government of the city and appoint its officials. She wrote several documents regulating the life in her city.\nPassage 8:\nMichał Korybut Wiśniowiecki\nMichael I (Polish: Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, Lithuanian: Mykolas I Kaributas Višnioveckis; 31 May 1640 – 10 November 1673) was the ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 29 September 1669 until his death in 1673.Michael was chosen partly because of the merit of his father, prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, a powerful border magnate who had helped suppress the Cossacks in eastern Poland during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. After Michael's early death, these setbacks were reversed at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 by his successor, John III Sobieski, who defeated an Austrian candidate in the election.In 1670 Michael I was married to Eleonora Maria of Austria (1653–1697), daughter of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his third wife Eleonora Gonzaga.\n\nBiography\nMichael was the son of Jeremi Wiśniowiecki and his wife Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska. His parents likely met each other in September 1637 in Warsaw during the crowning of Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Queen of Poland and consort to Władysław IV. They were engaged on 13 February 1638, over a month after the death of Gryzelda's father, Tomasz Zamoyski.\nThe wedding took place in Zamość on 27 February 1639, and over a year later, on 31 May 1640, Michael Korybut was most likely born in the village of Biały Kamień as Michał Tomasz Wiśniowiecki. The infant was then taken to Zamość, where he spent first two years of his life under care of his grandmother Katarzyna Zamoyska (née Ostrogska). In 1642, Michał was taken by his mother to Lubny. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he fled Left-bank Ukraine with his family and first settled in Wiśniowiec in Volhynia, before arriving in Zamość in autumn 1648.\n\nJeremi Wiśniowiecki died in 1651, when most of his enormous estate remained under Cossack or Russian control. From 1651 – 1655, young Michał was under the care of  Karol Ferdynand Vasa, the bishop of Wrocław and Płock. The boy stayed at the residence of the Bishops of Płock, in the town of Brok. After the death of Bishop Vasa on 9 May 1655, he was taken in by his wealthy uncle, Jan Zamoyski, Voivode of Sandomierz, who funded his education. Sometime in mid-1655, Michał found himself at the court of King John II Casimir.\nFollowing the Swedish invasion of Poland, Michael, together with the royal court, fled to Głogówek in Upper Silesia. On 18 November 1655, following the request of the king, he went to Nysa, to study at the Jesuit College Carolinum and stayed there until March 1656.\nIn mid-1656, thanks to the support of Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, Michał Korybut began studying at Charles University in Prague. He returned to Poland in June 1660, but soon afterwards, headed to Dresden and Vienna to meet Empress Eleonora Gonzaga. There he saw his future wife Eleanor of Austria, who was a child at that time, for the first time. On this trip, Michael improved his knowledge of languages; he spoke Latin, German, Italian, French and also likely Tatar and Turkish as well.\nIn 1663, Michel took part in the Russo-Polish War, and during the Lubomirski Rebellion, he loyally supported the king.\n\nElection\nOn 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish throne and left the country to live in France, making a new election necessary. The Bishop of Chełmno, Andrzej Olszowski, suggested that Michał Korybut should be listed as one of candidates for the throne. Wiśniowiecki was supported by the Polish nobility, who sensed that a poor and inexperienced prince would not pose a threat to their rights enshrined in the Golden Liberty.\nThe Free election of 1669 took place in May and June of that year. Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 19 June and became known as Michael I. Most of the gathered nobility voted for him as they wished to choose a native, Polish candidate (the so-called \"Piast\"), over foreign candidates. Wiśniowiecki won 11,271 votes and was crowned on 29 September 1669 in Kraków.\nHis election was immediately opposed by the pro-French camp, led by Primate of Poland Mikołaj Prazmowski and Crown Hetman John Sobieski.\nOn 27 February 1670 Michael I married Austrian princess Eleanor, and the ceremony was celebrated by Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti, as Primate Prazmowski refused to attend. The reception took place at the Denhoff Palace in Kruszyna.\n\nInternal conflicts\nFollowing the 1669 election, the Commonwealth was divided between two camps – pro-French, and royal. The pro-French camp had several influential members, including Primate Prazmowski, Hetman Sobieski, Andrzej Morsztyn, Voivode of Kraków Aleksander Michał Lubomirski, Voivode of Ruthenia Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski, Voivode of Poznań Krzysztof Grzymultowski, and Bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki.\nIn November 1669, the French camp broke the Coronation Sejm, hoping to dethrone Michael and elect Count Charles-Paris d'Orléans-Longueville. In 1670, the internal struggle moved to the local sejmiks, during which the nobility demanded to bring a Sejm lawsuit against Hetman Sobieski. To defend their commander, Sobieski's soldiers formed a Confederation near Trembowla.\nTo make matters worse, the divided Commonwealth was under constant Turkish threat. In 1671, the king supported a rebellion of a unit of Stanisław Wyżycki, who, against the explicit order of Sobieski, abandoned Volhynia, leaving the province defenceless. King Michael ordered Wyżycki and his men to spend the winter of 1671/72 in the wealthy starostwo of Sambor, and paid them their salaries, while Sobieski and his soldiers did not receive any money.\n\nIn 1672, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Commonwealth, and the Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–76 began. Despite this, the situation in the Polish Crown was still chaotic, with the danger of a civil war. The nobility formed a confederation near Gołąb, demanding the removal of Primate Prazmowski. Its members looted real estate owned by Hetman Sobieski and his family. On 22 November 1672 Lithuanian soldiers formed their own confederation in Kobryń, declaring their support for the Gołąb confederation. In response, soldiers under Sobieski formed a confederation in Szczebrzeszyn. John Sobieski, together with his troops, headed to Łowicz, to meet Primate Prazmowski.\nNegotiations between the two factions were carried out by Papal Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi and Bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki. Furthermore, Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire sent an offensive letter to Warsaw, demanding complete subordination of the Commonwealth. This greatly enraged the Poles but due to chaotic internal situation of the Commonwealth, both sides of the conflict reached an agreement in March 1672.\n\nWar with the Ottoman Empire\nIn June 1672, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army, under Mehmed IV, besieged the city of Kamieniec Podolski, which capitulated after 26 days. The invaders then approached Lwów, which paid a ransom. Mounted Crimean Tatar units penetrated as far as Hrubieszów, Jasło and Biecz.\nIn October 1672, Hetman John Sobieski, upon request of the senators, tried to stop the invaders, defeating them in the Battle of Niemirów, Battle of Komarno, and Battle of Petranka. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Buchach was signed on 18 October, in which the king ceded Podolia to the Ottomans and agreed to pay a yearly tribute. Under these terms, the once mighty Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was humbled by the Turks.\nSoon afterwards, Michael I began preparation for a new military campaign against the Ottomans. On 8 October 1673 at Skwarzawa near Złoczów, some 40,000 Polish soldiers concentrated, with 50 cannons. Due to poor health, the king handed the command of the army to Sobieski, and the Poles marched southwards, to Chocim.\n\nDeath, funeral, and legacy\nKing Michael I Korybut died in the Palace of the Archbishops of Lwów, on 10 November 1673. His early demise seems to have been brought about by a severe case of food poisoning, although rumours persisted that he had been actually murdered by traitorous generals angered at the declining power of the Commonwealth.\nThe day after his death, John Sobieski won the  Battle of Chocim, which reversed some of the losses under Michael I's reign. On 19 May 1674 Hetman John Sobieski was elected the new monarch after the Free election of 1674.\nAfter the funeral, the heart of the king was buried at a Camedule Monastery in the Bielany district of Warsaw. The bowels were placed in a wall of the Latin Cathedral in Lwów, while the body was buried in Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 31 January 1676, the same day that John Sobieski was crowned as John III.\nMichael's reign was considered to be less than successful as his ability to be a capable monarch were greatly hurt by Poland's quarrelling factions. His father's military fame notwithstanding, Michael lost the first phase of the Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–1676.\n\nGallery\nRoyal titles\nOfficial Latin version: Michael I, Dei Gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniae, Smolensciae, Kijoviae, Volhyniae, Podoliae, Podlachiae, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque, etc.(citation from one contemporary document: \"Michael primvs, Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dvx Lituaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masouiae, Samogitiae, Kiiouiae, Volhyniae, Podlachiae, Podoliae, Liuoniae, Smolensciae, Seueriae Czernihouiaeque etc\")\n\nEnglish translation: Michael I, by the Grace of God, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Livonia, Smolensk, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlaskie, Severia and Chernihiv, etc.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Poland (1569–1795)\nWiśniowiecki family\nPassage 9:\nZbigniew Firlej\nZbigniew Firlej (c. 1613–1649), of Lewart coat of arms, was a noble of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

{"input": "Hardley Flood is an area of lagoons that support populations of the waterfowl that are a medium sized version of what animal?", "context": "Passage 1:\nZencap\nZencap was a German company, operating a peer-to-peer lending platform, which allowed private savers to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. Using the crowdfunding model, the company based in Berlin, Germany aimed to create a direct link between private lenders and small businesses seeking loans. As of December 2014, Zencap had facilitated 5 million Euro in loans to small and medium-sized firms.In October 2015, the company was merged with Funding Circle, being active on UK and US.\n\nOrigin\nThe company, based in Berlin, was founded in March 2014 by Christian Grobe and Matthias Knecht, with support from Rocket Internet.\n\nLending\nThe business model resembled the US peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club and UK-based company Funding Circle.\nZencap facilitated small business loans from 10,000 to 250,000 euros.  Zencap determined whether the borrower was creditworthy and assigned a credit grade that determined the payable interest rate and the fees. Zencap itself charged borrowers a 1% to 4.5% origination fee. The loan period ranged between 6 and 60 months while the loan could be repaid without an early repayment fee at any time. Conditions varied between countries.\nDer Tagesspiegel quoted founder Christian Grobe, \"We are very strict with the risk assessment.\" Once approved, businesses posted their loan request on the Zencap marketplace, where private lenders were able to choose which businesses they wanted to lend money to.\n\nFunding Circle acquisition of Zencap\nIn October 2015, Zencap was acquired by UK based Funding Circle, another lending platform in Europe. Zencap was active in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. The merge made Funding Circle one of the main peer to business lending leaders in Europe.\n\nSee also\nDebt-to-income ratio\nComparison of crowd funding services\nDisintermediation\nPassage 2:\nCommon pochard\nThe common pochard (; Aythya ferina) is a medium-sized diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek aithuia, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin  ferina, \"wild game\", from ferus, \"wild\".\n\nDescription\nThe adult male has a long dark bill with a grey band, a red head and neck, a black breast, red eyes and a grey back. The adult female has a brown head and body and a narrower grey bill-band. The triangular head shape is distinctive. Pochards are superficially similar to the closely related North American redhead and canvasback. Females give hoarse growls. Males have whistles cut off by a final nasal note aaoo-oo-haa.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nTheir breeding habitat consists of marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern Europe and across the Palearctic. They are migratory, and spend winter in the south and west of Europe.In the British Isles, birds breed in eastern England and lowland Scotland, in small numbers in Northern Ireland with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. While uncommon, individuals are also occasionally seen in the south of England, and small populations are sometimes observed on the River Thames. Large numbers stay overwinter in Great Britain, after the birds retreat from Russia and Scandinavia.\n\nEcology\nThese are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks such as the tufted duck.\nThese birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. They often feed at night, and will up-end for food as well as the more characteristic diving. According to the article 'Patterns in the diving behaviour of the pochard, Aythya ferina: a test of an optimality model' Pochard's have a behavioral preference when it comes to their feeding patterns. This behavioral preference is that Pochards prefer shallower water in comparison to deeper water even though the food concentration in deeper water may be higher.In a number of countries the population of Common Pochard is decreasing mainly due to urbanization of the natural habitats and their transformation, as well as due to overhunting.\nThe pochard is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nBusiness Growth Fund\nBGF, established in 2011 as the Business Growth Fund, is an investment company that provides growth capital for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK and Ireland.From a network of 16 offices in the UK and Ireland, the company has invested more than £3 billion in more than 400 small and mid-sized companies. Around three-quarters of its investments have been in companies based outside London and South East England.BGF typically takes minority, non-controlling shareholdings in investee companies. BGF has completed more than 150 exits by selling businesses in its portfolio.\n\nHistory\nBGF was founded in 2011 by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered banks, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.The launch followed lobbying of both Conservative and Labour politicians by businessman Sir Nigel Rudd, who had argued for the creation of an organisation to provide equity funding to help close a perceived funding gap for small and mid-sized businesses. A shortfall in funding for small and mid-sized businesses in the UK had been identified as long ago as 1931 by the Macmillan Committee.BGF was seen as a successor to the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), set up by the Bank of England in 1945 and subsequently renamed 3i. BGF has been described as the “modern 3i”.Stephen Welton, founding CEO, said that a new organisation was needed because 3i’s business model, in line with the private equity industry generally, had evolved to focus on large buyout deals, meaning it had less of a focus on providing growth capital to small and mid-sized businesses.In 2017, BGF opened an office in Dublin to administer a €250 million fund to invest in small and mid-sized Irish companies. The Irish fund is backed by AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and BGF’s existing shareholders.BGF’s model has been replicated in Canada with the Canadian Business Growth Fund, launched in 2018 and backed by financial institutions including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Manulife. In 2019, the Australian Business Growth Fund was launched with backing from banks including Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank.\n\nLeadership\nAndy Gregory has been chief executive officer of BGF since 1 September 2022. He took over from Stephen Welton, formerly of JP Morgan & Co, who led BGF since inception in 2011. From 1 January 2023, Welton will serve as non-executive chair of the business.In 2013, Welton was appointed as an adviser to the government regarding the establishment of the British Business Bank, and, in 2017, he was invited to join the Industry Panel for the UK Government’s Patient Capital Review.\n\nInvestment approach\nBGF typically makes initial investments of between £2-15 million, with the possibility for follow-on investments.The firm provides patient capital, which has been defined by HM Treasury as “long-term investment in innovative firms led by ambitious entrepreneurs who want to build large-scale businesses”.BGF typically invests as a minority, non-controlling shareholder. Investments are usually structured as ordinary shares, loan notes or a combination.When an investment is sold, the returns are reinvested in the fund. This model has been called an “evergreen balance sheet”.BGF invests in a range of companies including start-ups, growth-stage businesses and quoted companies across almost every region and sector of the UK and Irish economy, barring financial services.BGF has been recognised as the most active growth investor in the world by number of investments, averaging about one investment a week.\n\nNotable investments\nRecipe box delivery company Gousto first received funding from BGF in 2015. Gousto became a unicorn in 2020 when it completed a funding round valuing the business at more than $1 billion.\nSocial video advertising platform Unruly received financing from BGF in a funding round announced in 2012. The business was acquired by News Corp for £58 million in 2015.\nM Squared, which develops lasers and photonic optical instruments, received funding from BGF in 2012. BGF exited the majority of its shareholding in the company in 2020 when the Scottish National Investment Bank became a shareholder.\n\nThe growth economy\nThe historian Sir Anthony Seldon has described the market segment of small and mid-sized companies in which BGF seeks to invest as “the growth economy”. Research by PwC found there were 21,400 growth economy companies in the UK in 2018, defined as fast-growing businesses that report turnover of between £2.5-100 million.BGF provides an alternative source of funding for these companies, which have traditionally relied on bank loans to finance growth.\nPassage 4:\nHardley Flood\nHardley Flood is a 49.8-hectare (123-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. It is part of the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.This area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds provides a spillway for the River Chet. The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. Three rare flies have been recorded, Elachiptera uniseta, Elachiptera scrobiculata and Lonchoptera scutellata.The site is open to  the public.\nPassage 5:\nChina IPR SME Helpdesk\nThe China IPR SME Helpdesk is a project funded by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR). It provides European  small and medium-sized enterprises with free, practical support on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China. According to its website, The China IPR SME Helpdesk's mission is to \"support European Union (EU) small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to both protect and enforce their Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in or relating to China, through the provision of free information and services\".A pilot programme of The China IPR SME Helpdesk was established in 2008 under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and it was announced in January 2011 that the Helpdesk project has been extended for an additional three years (through the end of 2013).\nPassage 6:\nScathophaga\nThe genus Scathophaga are small to medium sized predatory flies that for the most part, have larvae that feed on other insect larva within animal dung or decaying vegetable matter. Many are highly variable, sometimes producing small, infertile males that superficially resemble females. This species is an example of an organism which may selectively store the sperm of multiple males, as females have three to four spermathecae.\n\nSpecies\nThese 99 species belong to the genus Scathophaga:\n\nData sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net\nPassage 7:\nPalmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge\nThe Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge is located in Alaska, south of Wasilla and north of Anchorage. It is composed of 28,800 acres (11,655 ha; 45 sq mi) of coastal marshy areas adjacent to Knik Arm that support populations of moose, muskrat, foxes, coyotes, eagles, and migratory waterfowl. In springtime, tens of thousands of migratory geese, swans, shoebirds, and ducks rest and refuel. Many of these stay in the summer. The Knik River, the Matanuska River, Rabbit Slough, Wasilla Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Spring Creek flow through it.It is a popular location for hunting, skiing, iceskating, and hiking, and other uses.  It is bisected by the Glenn Highway.\nIt can be accessed at Rabbit Slough, from the Glenn Highway, Nelson Road, Scout Ridge and other locations.\n\nHistory\nAn indigenous people called the Knikatnu first settled the land that would become the Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge before Alaskan annexation into the United States. The indigenous people left behind a trail that would become the Iditarod Trail. Prior to the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the land was dry grassland. The name of the refuge stems from the hay farming that went on before the earthquake.\nPassage 8:\nGobizkorea\nThe GobizKOREA is operated by Korean SBC (Small & Medium Business Corporation), a non-profit, government-funded organization established to implement government policies and programs for the growth and development of Korean Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). GobizKorea supports for overseas marketing and promotion of Korean small and medium sized corporations.\n\nMain Activities\nSearch of Korean companies and products\nBusiness Matching Service between Korean supplier and international buyers\nVisitor Assistant Program\nPassage 9:\nRiver Chet\nThe River Chet is a small river in South Norfolk, England, a tributary of the River Yare. It rises in Poringland and flows eastwards through Alpington, Bergh Apton, Thurton and Loddon. At Loddon it passes under the A146 through Loddon Mill and into Loddon Staithe. From this point onwards the river is navigable. It then passes Hardley Flood to the north, a nature reserve part-managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The river finally joins the River Yare one mile west of Reedham at Hardley Cross, erected in 1676, which marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and the Borough of Great Yarmouth. The total navigable length is some 3½ miles.\n\nFishing\nFishing is permitted between Loddon and Hardley Cross, bream and roach being the most common catch.\n\nChurches\nA number of churches along the river are known as the \"Chet Valley Churches\". Most belong to the Church of England but they include the Church in Loddon, a combined Anglican and Methodist congregation.\nPassage 10:\nChañaral Island\nIsla Chañaral (sometimes referred to as Isla Chanaral or Chanaral Island) is located 6 km off-shore from the northern Central Chilean coast, some 100 km north of the city of La Serena. Together with Isla Choros and Isla Damas, the island forms the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve, which is administered by the Chilean Forestry Corporation. All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American marine otter. In recent years the reserve has experienced a strong increase in tourist activities, mainly due to being an important feeding ground in the summer months of different marine mammal species like fin whales, blue whales, humpback whales, and bottlenose dolphins that reside in the waters of the reserve. The local fishermen formed an association in cooperation with the National Tourism Service Sernatur to conduct whale watching activities in a sustainable manner, implementing responsible whale watching guidelines.\nIsla Chañaral is the biggest of the reserve's islands. Access to the island restricted by permit only. The island consists of two plateau levels. The main plateau between 50 and 70 meters above sea level is divided into a western and an eastern part by a second high plateau (>100 m). The vegetation of the plateaus differs considerably. While the main plateau is dominated by shrub and cacti the high plateau has a barren appearance with only few small cactus aggregations.\n\nExternal links and references\nChanaral Island: the biggest Humboldt Penguin Colony in the world\nThe Humboldt Penguin Colonies at Chanaral Island, Chile\nHumboldt penguins from the International Penguin Conservation Web Site", "answers": ["duck"], "length": 2491, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0c3cd45c98cc3577c0ca66908cfea21344e42aba1b031fcf"}

Towers, a singer-songwriter formerly signed to Interscope Records, formed the band in January 2013 during a visit to Olmsted Falls, Ohio after meeting and befriending local musicians Matthew Gibson and Schigel at a bar, eventually heading to a studio and recording the song \"Reverse\".The band later signed to Downtown Records and released their self-titled debut studio album on June 16, 2014. \"Reverse\" (written the night they met in a bar just outside of Cleveland Ohio) was released as their debut single and garnered initial support from Los Angeles modern rock station KROQ, eventually peaking at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band went on a US tour supporting New Politics and Bad Suns in Fall 2014. Spring 2015 they did a US Headlining tour, \"Burn It Up Tour,\" supported by Marc Scibilia. Following all of this, each of the members, except Jordy Towers (Lead Singer), decided to retire from the touring life to start families.\nIn 2016, Towers decided to start creating new SomeKindaWonderful music. SKW was his brain child and did not want to give it up since the success of \"Reverse\" kept fans wondering where SKW had gone. In July of the same year, Towers connected with German producer Nikolai Potthoff and started creating a new sound for SKW. Towers says, \"I think Nikolai and I have captured the natural progression of where SKW should be. As we all know the musical landscape changes so rapidly and I think we've created some timeless records here and have changed with the times nicely\".The EP is forthcoming. The lead single, released in July 2017, is titled \"Wheels Up\" and featured rapper Casey Veggies. Towers says, \"the track is a bass heavy alt soul song we wrote in 10 minutes one night on sleep deprivation and weed.\"Towers came into music as a rapper.

Their debut album, Ministry of Love, was released in 2013 on Iamsound in the US. Previously, the band released \"While You Were Sleeping\" single in 2010 and a self-titled EP in 2012 on the same label. Io Echo's style combines rock music compositions with instruments such as a Japanese koto harp and Chinese violins. Io Echo were hand-picked by Trent Reznor to open for Nine Inch Nails at the last show of their Wave Goodbye Tour. Io Echo have also recently composed the score to the Harmony Korine and James Franco film project Rebel.  In 2013, the band played Coachella, Lollapalooza, and toured with Bloc Party and Garbage.  As well as recording and touring, after seeing them perform live Jeffrey Deitch asked the band to curate an audio visual festival at the Museum of Modern Art Los Angeles. Io Echo named it PLAY MOCA and played alongside Salem, Cults, Zola Jesus, Active Child, and more.Gika and Ross were introduced by a friend and bonded over a mutual love for The Velvet Underground, in particular the song “Venus in Furs”. They released the EP Io Echo in October 2012. While working on their debut album, the band opened for The Big Pink, Florence + the Machine, The Drums, Nine Inch Nails, and Garbage. Leopold Ross also played bass for The Big Pink.\nTheir last release was the 2017 single \"Harm\".

On their debut EP, the band worked with producer Justin Long (U.S. Royalty).  They have played shows alongside bands such as Sam Roberts Band, The Trews, SomeKindaWonderful, and Saintseneca.\n\nHistory\nFormation and influences\nIn the summer of 2012, after their former band The Blue Line dissolved, Payes, Scialli, and then-guitarist Dave Chaletzky recruited drummer Brian Abbott to start a new musical project.  The name \"Clones of Clones\" was conceived as an ironic play on words; Payes has stated that they have always strived for \"uniqueness with a hint of familiarity.\"  The band recorded the \"Neighborhoods\" EP and began playing shows to support its release.In early 2013, Chaletzky left the band and was replaced by Todd Evans of Florida's A New Way To Live Forever, completing the current line-up.\n\nName meaning\nThe band name Clones of Clones was conceived as a way of expressing frustration with the artistic cycle of copying and reproducing pre-existing ideas at the expense of risk-taking novelty. According to Payes, \"Nothing is completely original...I’m not sure things have been original for awhile. I envision a clone to be a less perfect version of its former self.”\n\n\"Neighborhoods\" EP (2013)\nShortly after forming in Summer 2012, Clones of Clones recorded the \"Neighborhoods\" EP with Justin Long (U.S. Royalty) in Potomac, MD.  The EP was released in early 2013 with the following track listing:\nThe Neighborhood\nBully\nHomie\nTake Care of Yourself\n\n\"Mr. Sanity\" single (2013)\nThe band continued its work with Justin Long in 2013, recording the single \"Mr. Sanity.\"  This was the first material recorded with Evans in the band.\n\nI Don't Need Your Love (2014)\nThe title track \"I Don't Need Your Love\" was released along with \"Out Loud\" and \"The Battle Between\" on November 11, 2014.\n\nBand members\nBen Payes - Guitar, synth, vocals\nTodd Evans - Guitar, synth, vocals\nNick Scialli - Bass, guitar, vocals\nBrian Abbott - Drums\n\nFormer members\nDave Chaletzky - Guitar, vocals\n\nDiscography\n\"Neighborhoods\" EP (2013)\n\"Mr. Sanity\" Single (2013)\n\"I Don't Need Your Love\" Single (2014)\n\"Monster Heart\" Album (2015)\n“That Wasn’t Me” EP (2017)\n\nSingles\nNotable performances\nSince releasing their \"Neighborhoods\" EP, Clones of Clones has toured in Washington, D.C. and nearby mid-atlantic states.  The band has played four shows in Washington, D.C. opening for nationally and internationally touring acts.\nPassage 10:\nI, Human\nI, Human is the second full-length album by Singaporean death metal band, Deus Ex Machina, and the first to feature a permanent vocalist, giving it more uniformity in contrast to The War Inside, which had a different singer for each track. Musically, it is an edgy mixture of thrash metal, melodic death metal and progressive metal interjections, coupled with a diversified vocal approach. The lyrical content of the album deals with the future: Cloning. Specifically, questions regarding its use, legality, implications and the possibility of a world full of clones fighting to gain their own identity. The concept is based on Isaac Asimov's novel I,Robot, but also is influenced by other science fiction works such as Blade Runner, The 6th Day, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Warhammer 40,000. Each songs discusses the ethical issues pertaining to cloning, shifting from first person to second person to third person perspective. The band further divulges the mind frame of an unnamed clone character as it gradually realizes it is a clone, upon awaking from what it thought was a dream. In their pursuit of equality and acceptance, the band delves deep into their thoughts, fears, and plans, channeling these emotions into a powerful auditory experience accompanied by thought-provoking lyrics.\n\nTrack listing\nM(n)emo(nic)ries – 1:58\nThe Mask – 3:42\nReplicant – 5:47\nJigsaw – 4:52\nThe Human Strain – 2:45\nI – 5:19\nThe Omega Directive – 3:53\nAssent / Dissent – 5:30\nHidden Track – 3:08\n\nPersonnel\nRyan Prashant Joseph – guitar\nShailendra Singh – drums\nMithun MK – lead vocals\nCaspar Francis – bass", "answers": ["Cleveland, Ohio"], "length": 2928, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c1139ce1c2c80bfe4dbf57d4a465d08a581afff06460cbcf"}
{"input": "Which genus has more species, Quesnelia or Honeysuckle?", "context": "Passage 1:\nQuesnelia strobilispica\nQuesnelia blanda is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to southeastern Brazil. It was first described in 1856 as Bromelia blanda. As of November 2022, the Encyclopaedia of Bromeliads listed it under the synonym Quesnelia strobilospica, which it spelt Quesnelia strobilispica.\nPassage 2:\nHoneysuckle\nHoneysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae, native to northern latitudes in North America and Eurasia. Approximately 180 species of honeysuckle have been identified in both continents. Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\n\nDescription\nMost species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including Lonicera hildebrandiana from the Himalayan foothills and L. etrusca from the Mediterranean) are tender and can only be grown outside in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, 1–10 cm (0.39–3.94 in) long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.\nMany of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \"twinberry\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.\nThe fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably Lonicera caerulea) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as L. japonica and L. maackii spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of Lonicera are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species—see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\n\nInvasive species\nThe spread of L. japonica in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.  Invasive species include L. japonica, L. maackii, L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and the hybrid between the last two, L. × bella.\n\nCultivation\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved L. nitida are used as low, narrow hedges.The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\nThe honeysuckle species L. japonica is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.\n\nPhytochemicals and sensory effects\nHoneysuckle is renowned for its colorful, fragrant flowers and variously colored fruit, indicating the presence of complex phytochemicals underlying these properties. Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.\n\nInteraction with other species\nMany insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth Deilephila elpenor. This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.\n\nSelected species\nSome 180 species of Lonicera are documented.\nSeveral fossil species are known from the Miocene of Asia.\nPassage 3:\nQuesnelia dubia\nQuesnelia dubia is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (the state of Bahia).

The genus is named after French businessman and patron of botany Edouard Prosper Quesnel, of Le Havre (1781–1850). Endemic to eastern Brazil, this genus contains 22 known species. This genus has two recognized subgenera: the type subgenus and Billbergiopsis Mez.\n\nSpecies\nAs of November 2022, Plants of the World Online accepted 24 species:\nPassage 7:\nQuesnelia violacea\nQuesnelia violacea is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, endemic to Brazil (southeastern  São Paulo).

It has a well-formed rosette of about 20 plain green leaves.  These leaves have lightly serrated edges and are tipped by a sharp spine.  The bloom reaches about a foot high. The inflorescence bears rosy red bracts and violet or white petals. It is a semi-cold hardy bromeliad that can tolerate temperatures down to 25 °F for a few hours.\n\nCultivars\nQuesnelia 'Farro'\n× Quesmea 'Lymanii'\nPassage 10:\nLonicera caprifolium\nLonicera caprifolium, the Italian woodbine, perfoliate honeysuckle, goat-leaf honeysuckle, Italian honeysuckle, or perfoliate woodbine, is a species of perennial flowering plants in the genus Lonicera of the family Caprifoliaceae. It is native to parts of Europe, and naturalised in South East Britain and northeastern North America.  It can readily be distinguished from Europe's most common species, Lonicera periclymenum, by its topmost leaves, which are perfoliate as the Latin name suggests (that is, the stem appears to grow through the centre of the leaf). It is a vigorous, deciduous climber growing up to 8 metres.  It bears masses of very fragrant, cream-coloured flowers, tinged with pink, appearing in midsummer.", "answers": ["Honeysuckle"], "length": 1274, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "14ca92f00403adf71a96bdad86851af3debf79c23a990e5f"}
{"input": "The publication of which magazine ended first, Right On! or Castle of Frankenstein?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Pitchfork Review\nThe Pitchfork Review was an American quarterly music magazine, available in print only, that included long-form feature stories, photography, and illustrations, and also included selected recent pieces from Pitchfork's online content. The magazine ended after 11 issues in November 2016.\n\nLaunch\nIn December 2013, Pitchfork Media debuted The Pitchfork Review, a quarterly print journal focused on long-form music writing and design-focused content. J.C. Gabel, its first editor, had been the publisher of The Chicagoan and founding publisher of Stop Smiling.According to the New York Times, Pitchfork Media planned a limited-edition quarterly publication of about 10,000 copies of each issue, perfect bound, and printed on glossy, high-quality 8-by-10¼ paper. It was expected that about two-thirds of the content would be original, with the remaining one-third recycled from the Pitchfork website.\nCovering the launch, the International Business Times likened the publication's literary aspirations to The New Yorker and Paris Review, and editorialized: But as impressive as it is, is it a step back in time for a brand more known for looking ahead? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean it's a step backwards; rather, it can be seen as a show of confidence. And there is reason to believe it could turn a profit. Print still has a currency, in terms of perception and ad revenue, and a well-produced print glossy can still resonate with readers in a way that pixels can't.\nThe Hollywood Reporter quoted the magazine's creative director as saying that moving into print was \"not a nostalgic move, because print has never left our lives,\" adding that Pitchfork's goal was to \"create a permanent object of a moment through music journalism and documentation... a compendium of what we'll remember from the last few months and what's going through our minds as music fans right now.\"Converse was secured as an exclusive advertising partner for the first four issues, and agreed to sponsor a series of 7-inch records included with the 2014 issues of the publication, beginning with No. 2.\n\nIssues\n2013–2014 issues\nNo. 1 (Winter 2013)\nThe inaugural issue of The Pitchfork Review included original articles about Van Morrison, Otis Redding, Glenn Danzig, and the history of the jukebox, as well as a retrospective on the glory days of the U.K. weekly music press.\n\nNo. 2 (Spring 2014)\nAmong its original pieces, the second issue included a feature article by Franklin Bruno about Game Theory's frontman and songwriter Scott Miller, who died in 2013. Also featured were an appreciation of Ellen Willis, and articles about Kate Bush, Stanley Kubrick, Sun Kil Moon, and Holger Czukay.A 7-inch split single was included with the second issue, with two exclusive tracks by Kurt Vile and the Lovetones, \"Off with His Tongue!\" and \"Let's Bury the Hatchet,\" and a B-side, \"Meg's Dreamcatcher,\" from Philadelphia-based punk band Watery Love.\n\nNo. 3 (Summer 2014)\nThe third issue, which went on sale July 18, 2014, featured articles about Jason Molina, Don Drummond and Margarita Mahfood, John Fahey, and Joe Tex, as well as short pieces on Kanye West, Weezer, and others.

The publication was started by Wallace Thurman, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, John P. Davis, Richard Bruce Nugent, Gwendolyn Bennett, Lewis Grandison Alexander, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes. \nThe magazine's title referred to burning up old ideas, and Fire!! challenged the norms of the older Black generation while featuring younger authors. The publishers promoted a realistic style, with vernacular language and controversial topics such as homosexuality and prostitution. Many readers were offended, and some Black leaders denounced the magazine.   \nThe endeavor was plagued by debt, and its quarters burned down, ending the magazine after just one issue.\n\nHistory\nFire!! was conceived to express the African-American experience during the Harlem Renaissance in a modern and realistic fashion, using literature as a vehicle of enlightenment. The magazine's founders wanted to express the changing attitudes of younger African Americans. In Fire!! they explored controversial issues in the Black community, such as homosexuality, bisexuality, interracial relationships, promiscuity, prostitution, and color prejudice.Langston Hughes wrote that the name was intended to symbolize their goal \"to burn up a lot of the old, dead conventional Negro-white ideas of the past ... into a realization of the existence of the younger Negro writers and artists, and provide us with an outlet for publication not available in the limited pages of the small Negro magazines then existing.\" The magazine's headquarters burned to the ground shortly after it published its first issue, ending its operations.\n\nReception\nFire!! was plagued by debt and encountered poor sales. It was not well received by the Black public because some felt that the journal did not represent the sophisticated self-image of Blacks in Harlem. Other readers found it offensive for many reasons, and it was denounced by Black leaders such as the Talented Tenth, \"who viewed the effort as decadent and vulgar\". They disapproved of content relating to prostitution and homosexuality, which they considered degrading to \"the race.\" They also thought many pieces published were a throw-back to old stereotypes, as they were written in the slang and language of the southern vernacular. They felt the \"undignified\" contents reflected poorly on the Black race. As an example, the critic at the Baltimore Afro-American wrote that he \"just tossed the first issue of Fire!! into the fire\".But, The Bookman applauded the journal's unique qualities and its personality. Although this magazine had only one issue, \"this single issue of Fire!! is considered an event of historical importance.\"\n\nFeatures\nThe magazine covered a variety of literary genres: it includes a novella, an essay, stories, plays, drawings and illustrations, and poetry.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nThe story of the rise and fall of Fire!! is showcased in the 2004 movie Brother to Brother. It features a gay African-American college student named Perry Williams. he befriends an elderly gay African American named Bruce Nugent. Williams learns that Nugent was a writer and co-founder of Fire!!, and associated with other notable writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\"Fire!!\" is heavily mentioned in the play \nFIRE! written by Jenifer Nii. The play premiered in 2010 at Salt Lake City, Utah's Plan B Theatre Company. \nThe 45 minute play, with one actor playing Wallace Thurman, covers the man's life, with a focus on the production of \"Fire!!\" and the writing he did following it. The play is performing for the last time and touring schools in the process; to teach Utahn students about Wallace Thurman, who is rarely taught off in the schooling system of his native state; as of April 2023.\nPassage 4:\nCastle of Frankenstein\nCastle of Frankenstein was an American horror, science fiction and fantasy film magazine, published between 1962 and 1975 by Calvin Thomas Beck's Gothic Castle Publishing Company, distributed by Kable News. Larry Ivie—who also was cover artist for several early issues—and Ken Beale edited the first three issues. Writer-artist Bhob Stewart edited the magazine from 1963 into the early 1970s. Although promoted and sold as a \"monster magazine,\" readers were aware that Castle of Frankenstein, at the time, was the only nationally distributed magazine devoted to a legitimate and serious coverage of B movies. In addition to its central focus on classic and current horror films, Castle of Frankenstein also devoted pages to amateur filmmakers and fanzines. Its advertising pages sold full-length silent feature films such as The Lost World and The Golem: How He Came into the World.\nFollowing employment as an editor for publisher Joe Weider, Calvin Beck (1929–1989) entered the monster magazine arena in 1959 with his one-shot issue Journal of Frankenstein, which featured John Zacherle on the cover and had a small circulation. As an experiment, Beck printed part of the run on slick paper. After a hiatus and a title change, Beck returned with Castle of Frankenstein #1 in 1962.\nBeck claimed that since his magazine carried no outside advertising, a standardized schedule was unneeded. Issues were published whenever they were completed, leading to an erratic, irregular schedule. Distribution also varied; while many well-stocked periodical outlets did not carry the magazine, some less-likely outlets (such as grocery stores) did.\nThe magazine ran 25 issues, plus one annual (the 1967 Fearbook); the final issue was published in 1975. Beck cancelled his magazine not because of poor sales, but to devote his energy to writing books. During its primary run, Castle of Frankenstein outlasted the majority of monster magazines that filled the market for two decades, with the notable exception of Famous Monsters of Filmland.\nIn 1999, publisher Dennis Druktenis revived both Castle of Frankenstein (releasing 10 more issues) and the original title Journal of Frankenstein (releasing five more issues).\nIn 2021, publishers Don and Vicki Smeraldi once again revived \"Castle of Frankenstein,\" issuing #36 in October, with plans to release new issues twice a year every spring and fall.\n\nContributors\nIn addition to book reviews by Charles Collins and Lin Carter, contributors included Barry Brown, Richard A. Lupoff and William K. Everson.\nInspired by the ratings and reviews of films in Cahiers du Cinéma, Stewart introduced a similar system with the \"Comic Book Council\", the first critical coverage of comic books to appear in a national magazine. Commentary and ratings of underground comics were juxtaposed with reviews of mainstream comics. Another key feature was the \"Frankenstein Movieguide\", an attempt to document all fantastic films seen on television with \"mini-reviews\" written by Joe Dante and Stewart. Unlike some genre commentators, these reviewers were not limited only to monster-style films. Instead, the many brief, tightly-written fantasy film reviews also covered experimental and foreign art films. The capsule review format enforced a brevity and economy that inspired many younger writers.\nWith new art and reprints of vintage fantasy art, the magazine published such artists as Aubrey Beardsley, Hannes Bok, Harry Clarke, Virgil Finlay, Jim Steranko, Wally Wood and Weird Tales illustrator Matt Fox. To cut costs, color photos rather than paintings were used on the covers of issues six through 14. With issue 11's cover photo of Leonard Nimoy, Castle of Frankenstein was the first magazine to feature Star Trek as a major cover story. Other issues displayed cover paintings by Robert Adragna, Marcus Boas, Bok, Frank Brunner, Maelo Cintron, Larry Ivie, Russ Jones, Ken Kelly, Los Angeles painter Tom Maher and Lee Wanagiel.\nInterior art included graphic stories by Ivie, Brunner, Bernie Wrightson and the team of Marv Wolfman and Len Wein, plus the first published comics page by Marvel artist-writer-editor Larry Hama. Castle of Frankenstein also carried an unusual original comic strip, Baron von Bungle by Richard Bojarski, which gave a humorous twist to the world depicted in Universal horror films.\n\nBooks\nBeck, with an editorial assist by fantasy fiction scholar Haywood P. Norton, assembled the paperback anthology, The Frankenstein Reader (Ballantine Books, 1962). The two brought together a roster of vintage horror-fantasy tales by E. F. Benson, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Ralph Adams Cram, Charles Dickens, Amelia B. Edwards, Katharine Fullerton Gerould, Richard Middleton, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, Robert Louis Stevenson and H. G. Wells.\nIn Heroes of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1975), Beck wrote illustrated biographies of six leading horror film stars (Lon Chaney Sr., Lon Chaney Jr., Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price) and writers such as Robert Bloch and Richard Matheson. The book reworked information previously unearthed for Castle of Frankenstein articles.\nBhob Stewart and Beck then collaborated on a companion volume, Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1978), illustrated biographical profiles of 29 fantasy film actresses and directors. The book included an article by actor Barry Brown, plus research by Drew Simels, author of the TV movie entries in early editions of Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide series. With articles on Alice Guy-Blaché, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Veronica Lake, Elsa Lanchester, Agnes Moorehead, Mary Philbin, Barbara Steele, Vampira, Fay Wray and others, Scream Queens also incorporated material from the Castle of Frankenstein files of manuscripts and still photographs.\nBeck's fourth book, Sense of Wonder, about fantasy films of the 1940s, was never published.\n\nSee also\nScience fiction magazine\nFantasy fiction magazine\nHorror fiction magazine\nPassage 5:\nNylænde\nNylænde (Norwegian: New Frontiers) was a Norwegian political and cultural magazine that focused on women's rights.

{"input": "Who died first, Chester Erskine or Sam Taylor?", "context": "Passage 1:\nSam Taylor (director)\nSam Taylor (August 13, 1895 – March 6, 1958) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer, most active in the silent film era. Taylor is best known for his comedic directorial work with Harold Lloyd and Mary Pickford, and also later worked with Laurel and Hardy. He was born in New York City.\nA notorious cinematic legend over the decades has suggested that Taylor's 1929 adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew had the screen credit \"additional dialogue by Sam Taylor\".  However, no extant prints of the film contain this credit, and there is no documentary evidence that it ever existed.\nTaylor directed seven feature films with Lloyd as star, second only to Fred C. Newmeyer (the two co-directed Lloyd in five features). He also directed Pickford in her first \"talkie\" feature with Coquette (1929), which garnered the latter an Academy Award. \nTaylor died at the age of 62 in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPartial filmography\nExternal links\n Media related to Sam Taylor (director) at Wikimedia Commons\n Works by or about Sam Taylor at Wikisource\nSam Taylor at IMDb\nPassage 2:\nLord Cardross\nLord Cardross is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, since 1695 a subsidiary title of the earldom of Buchan. It was created in 1606 for John Erskine, Earl of Mar, with remainder to his heirs male and assignees whatsoever and with the power to nominate his successor. In 1617 he nominated his second son by his second wife Marie Stewart, Henry Erskine, Master of Cardross, to be his successor in the lordship of Cardross. The Earl of Mar died in 1634 and was succeeded in the earldom of Mar by his son by his first wife, John, and in the lordship of Cardross by his grandson David Erskine, the second Lord Cardross, the son of Henry, Master of Cardross, who had died in 1628. The second Lord was a supporter of The Engagement and was barred from sitting in Parliament in 1649. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Lord. He emigrated to North America to escape religious persecution and established a colony in what is now Carolina. His son, the fourth Lord, succeeded his kinsman in the earldom of Buchan in 1695. However, it was not until 1698 that his claim was established by the Scottish Parliament. For further history of the title, see Earl of Buchan.\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Erskine family have also gained distinction. John Erskine of Cardross, younger son of the second Lord, was a soldier and politician. John Erskine of Carnock, son of John Erskine of Cardross, was a noted jurist. John Erskine, leader of the Evangelical Party in the 18th century Scottish Church, was the son of John Erskine of Carnock by his first wife. John Elphinstone Erskine, grandson of James Erskine, son of James Erskine of Carnock by his second wife, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Sir David Erskine, son of James Erskine, brother of John Elphinstone Erskine, was Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons between 1885 and 1915 and held several positions at the British court. James Francis Erskine (1862–1936), eldest son of Sir David Erskine, was a brigadier-general in the Scots Guards. His son Malcolm David Erskine (1903–1949), was a brigadier in the Scots Guards. Seymour Elphinstone Erskine (1863–1945), second son of Sir David Erskine, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Walter Hugh Erskine (1870–1948), third son of Sir David Erskine, was Deputy Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons between 1929 and 1940. Ian David Erskine (1898–1973), son of Alan David Erskine, fourth son of Sir David Erskine, was a major-general in the British Army. Sir Arthur Erskine, fifth son of Sir David Erskine, was a soldier and courtier. Sir James Elphinstone Erskine, brother of Sir David Erskine, was an admiral of the fleet. George Elphinstone Erskine (1841–1912), son of George Keith Erskine, brother of John Elphinstone Erskine, was a major-general in the Bombay Cavalry in the Indian Army.

Heggie, Henry Hull and Margaret Wycherly. It was based on a Theatre Guild play with the same name by Paul and Claire Sifton. The film was produced for Universal and was shot on a modest budget of $50,000 at Thomas Edison Studios, which producer/director Chester Erskine had re-opened specifically for the shoot.Humphrey Bogart had a supporting though key role. The film was re-released as Call It Murder by Screen Guild Productions (Guaranteed Pictures) in 1949 after Bogart became a star; he was given top billing, although he is present in few scenes and was credited eighth in the original release.\n\nPlot\nThe movie begins at the murder trial of Ethel Saxon, a woman who shot her lover in a crime of passion. During the trial, Edward Weldon, the jury foreman, asks the defendant a question, which ultimately leads to a guilty verdict and a death sentence for her.\nThe rest of film takes place on the evening of the execution, mostly in the Weldon home. Edward is dealing with the consequences of his role as foreman. Friends have come to the house to support the family. An unscrupulous journalist who has bribed Weldon's son in law is also in attendance. Weldon's daughter Stella is upset by the departure of her gangster boyfriend, Gar Boni, whom she met during the trial. The evening culminates at midnight in a sequence in which three scenes are cross cut together: the switch is pulled at the death house, a gun is fired apparently in Boni's parked car, and a press photograph is taken of Edward Weldon's reaction. Moments later, Stella returns home, under the impression that she has shot Gar Boni. Weldon, torn between love for his daughter and his past pronouncements about the rule of law, contacts the district attorney to come to the house.\n\nCast\nSidney Fox ...  Stella Weldon\nO.P.

It was the first sound film adaptation of the Shakespearean play of the same name. The film was adapted by Taylor from William Shakespeare's play.\n\nCast\nMary Pickford as Katherina\nDouglas Fairbanks as Petruchio\nEdwin Maxwell as Baptista\nJoseph Cawthorn as Gremio\nClyde Cook as Grumio\nGeoffrey Wardwell as Hortensio\nDorothy Jordan as Bianca\n\nProduction\nThe first sound version of the play on film, this version was planned as a sound film from the start. Pickford had already made her sound film debut in Coquette (1929) so The Taming of the Shrew marked her second talkie. This version of the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves through the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca, unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. Pickford and Fairbanks' marriage was breaking down even before filming began, and animosity between the couple increased during filming. In later years, Pickford stated that working on the film was the worst experience of her life, although she also acknowledged that Fairbanks' performance was one of his best.\nFor many years it was believed that one of the credits read \"Additional Dialogue by Sam Taylor\", but there is no evidence any print ever contained such a credit and experts on Shakespeare films, such as Kenneth S. Rothwell and Robert Hamilton Ball, think it unlikely.\n\nReception\nFairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2008, believes \"Taming of the Shrew has never received the recognition it deserves as the first talking film of a Shakespeare play. It was not only technically superior to the majority of talking pictures in 1929 but would unquestionably be the finest translation onto film of Shakespeare for some time to come.\" Vance also sees the film as a window into the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage: \"As a reenactment of the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage, Taming of the Shrew continues to fascinate as a rather grim comedy. The two willful, larger-than-life personalities working at cross-purposes and conveying their resentment and frustration to each other through blatant one-upmanship and harsh wounds is both the movie and the marital union.\"Leonard Maltin described the film as “defeated by its lack of pacing and downright embarrassing performances, though it's undeniably fascinating to see Doug and Mary together in their only co-starring appearance. This is the film with the infamous credit, ‘By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.’”\n\nHome media\nAfter many years out of circulation, the film was re-released in 1966 in a new cut supervised by Pickford herself. New sound effects and music were added throughout, much of the voice dubbing was enhanced with newly available technology, and seven minutes were cut from the initial print. This re-released version is the only version now available on DVD or VHS.\n\nSee also\nList of early sound feature films (1926–1929)\nPassage 7:\nBlackfoot Mountains\nThe Blackfoot Mountains, also called the Blackfoot Range, is a small range of mountains located east of Blackfoot, Idaho. Most of the area is private property, including the range's tallest mountain, Taylor Mountain. This mountain was named after Sam Taylor, an early settler and brother of Matt Taylor. The Blackfoot River carves through the region. Within this range is Wolverine Canyon, a public area that features sites for hiking, camping, kayaking, rock climbing and other recreational pursuits.\n\nEcology\nThis area is mainly a hilly shrub-steppe, covered in sagebrush and juniper.  However, there are many springs and small streams which form microclimates with more water-loving plants. The mountains themselves are mainly basalt.\nPassage 8:\nA Girl in Every Port (1952 film)\nA Girl in Every Port is a 1952 American comedy film directed by Chester Erskine. The film stars  Groucho Marx, Marie Wilson, and William Bendix. It was based on the short story They Sell Sailors Elephants by Frederick Hazlitt Brennan.\n\nPlot\nBenjamin Franklin 'Benny' Linn and Timothy Aloysius 'Tim' Dunnovan are two sailors assigned to the same ship.  Tim spends some inheritance money he received to purchase a race horse named Little Aaron.  Tim’s division officer considers that an ill-advised action and orders Ben to go help Tim get his money back. \nBen and Tim go ashore to seek a return of Tim's money, but it's not a simple matter, as Tim had already hired a team to train Little Aaron.  They also discover that Little Aaron has a history of weak ankles and can't run very well.  However, they also learn that Little Aaron has an identical twin, Little Shamrock, who has good ankles and can run fast.  \nBen and Tim decide they might be able to work things out, so that they can switch the horses and make a lot of money in a horse race.  They find themselves trying to juggle the expectations of their division officer, the former owner of Little Aaron, a car hop named Miss Jane, some local mobsters, and their fellow sailors, who all want in on the action.\nThere’s lots of confusion leading up to the horse race, risks to the participants depending on the outcome, and some unexpected results that follow.\n\nCast\nGroucho Marx as Benjamin Franklin 'Benny' Linn\nMarie Wilson as Jane Sweet\nWilliam Bendix as Timothy Aloysius 'Tim' Dunnovan\nDon DeFore as Bert Sedgwick\nGene Lockhart as 'Doc' Garvey\nDee Hartford as Millicent Temple\nHanley Stafford as Fleet Admiral Temple\nTeddy Hart as 'High Life'\nPercy Helton as Drive-In Manager\nGeorge E. Stone as SkeezerThis was Dee Hartford's film debut. It was through her that Groucho Marx met and later married her sister Eden Hartford.\n\nReception\nA.W. of The New York Times wrote in his review: \"The parlay of Groucho Marx, Marie Wilson, William Bendix, to say nothing of a horse-racing mix-up, the United States Navy and sabotage should have paid off in plenty of laughs. But 'A Girl in Every Port,' which breezed into the Paramount yesterday, brimming with these ingredients, is merely an involved mélange of obvious antics and gags, only one or two of which are likely to generate chuckles.\"\n\nSee also\nList of films about horse racing\nPassage 9:\nTake One False Step\nTake One False Step is a 1949 American film noir crime film directed by Chester Erskine and starring William Powell, Shelley Winters and Marsha Hunt.

Catherine's friend Martha Wier, whom Andrew had also known previously, informs him that Catherine had been romantically involved with Freddie Blair, a crime partner of Catherine's husband. Andrew tries to retrieve Catherine's diary containing evidence of the affair from her bedroom, but he is attacked by a dog and suffers a deep cut on his hand.\nAndrew flees but soon hears a news report that the dog who had attacked him was found to be rabid. As doctors in the area have been advised to immediately report all dog bites, Andrew is unable to receive medical treatment and believes that he is dying. Later, he watches in hiding as Freddie is killed by a passing train.\nAndrew discovers that Catherine is alive and well and that no crime had occurred. No longer eluding capture, he is told that the dog that had attacked him was not actually rabid; the police had concocted the ruse to force the suspect to reveal himself.\n\nCast\nReception\nNew York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called Take One False Step a \"curiously mixed-up mystery picture\" and wrote: \"Something of the same drollery that was displayed by William Powell in his saturnine performance of Nick Charles in the Thin Man films is flashed by him on a few occasions ... But for the most part our erstwhile detective and comedian is forced to play a role of rather painful proportions with forbidding austerity ... Powell is propelled into troubles that are neither funny nor flattering to him. Nor, for that matter, are they gripping as action drama to any great degree.\"\nPassage 10:\nChester Erskine\nChester Erskine (November 29, 1905 – April 7, 1986) was an American director, producer, and writer.\n\nBiography\nChester Erskine was born in Hudson, New York and studied for a short time at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His first directing job was Harlem, a 1929 all-black revue. He also directed Spencer Tracy in the Broadway production of The Last Mile in 1930. Erskine's likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi's, the New York City theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library.In 1932, he began working in Hollywood, where his best-known work includes the direction of The Egg and I and the screenplay adaptation of All My Sons.Other films directed by Erskine include the 1949 mystery Take One False Step starring William Powell and the 1952 comedy A Girl in Every Port featuring Groucho Marx.\nErskine produced a number of films, notably The Wonderful Country, a 1959 western with Robert Mitchum.\nHe died in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 80.", "answers": ["Sam Taylor"], "length": 3361, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "cf5c4cd4af1cb98d9c38964f3511f5845d5a57a0b7764ffb"}

It is part of the Central Coast Council local government area. It consists of residential housing as well as acreage blocks and small farms with many houses backing onto natural bushland and reserves. It is close to the M1 and is 20 minutes from Shelly Beach. A peaceful community with rural aspects and a large technology driven primary school, Niagara Park is ideal for families with young children.\nThe suburb contains Niagara Park railway station, which is on the Main North railway line. A shopping centre, timber mill, primary school, and sports centre are also located within Niagara Park.\n\nEvents\nOn the second Saturday of every month a large market is held at the shopping centre where residents set up tables selling various goods. There are also competitions for children held by the town crier.\nA jobs convention is held annually at the local youth centre for  students from various schools. The event is aimed at years 11 and 12.\nEvery year there is a large fete held at the local Niagara Park Primary School which features many rides and in the hall there are many baked goods stores.\nThe small shopping centre has a Spar supermarket and takeaway, cupcake shop, and community centre. It also boasts two factory outlets: the Sara Lee factory outlet and Scholastic Books, as well as the Bottle-O Valley Tavern.\n\nNotable residents\nJulie Goodwin, chef, won the first Australian Masterchef\nPassage 2:\nCity of Newcastle\nThe City of Newcastle is a local government area in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. The City of Newcastle incorporates much of the area of the Newcastle metropolitan area.\nThe Lord Mayor of City of Newcastle Council is Councillor Nuatali Nelmes, a Labor politician. Nelmes was elected at a by-election on 15 November 2014 following the resignation of Jeff McCloy, the former Lord Mayor. The Awabakal and Worimi peoples are acknowledged by council as the traditional custodians of the land and waters of Newcastle.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the passing of the Municipalities Act 1858 by the New South Wales parliament, the Municipality of Newcastle was proclaimed on 7 June 1859. The new Municipality was divided into three wards – City, Macquarie, and Honeysuckle.  Eight years later, the Municipalities Act 1867 classified the Newcastle Municipality as a \"Borough\".The Greater Newcastle Act 1937 merged the City of Newcastle with 10 of its suburban municipalities to form the City of Greater Newcastle. The Act also transferred parts of the Lake Macquarie Shire and Tarro Shire to the new city. The amalgamations and transfers took effect from 2 April 1938.The newly created City of Greater Newcastle was subsequently renamed to City of Newcastle on 23 March 1949.\n\nProposed amalgamation\nAfter a 2015 review by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal found that Newcastle City Council was not \"fit for the future\", it was recommended that the City of Newcastle merge with Lake Macquarie City Council. However, the Minister for Local Government subsequently proposed that Newcastle City Council instead merge with Port Stephens Council to form a new council with an area of 1,045 km2 (403 sq mi) and support a population of approximately 230,000. The outcome of an independent review was completed by mid–2016. On 14 February 2017, the NSW Government announced it would not be proceeding with further regional council mergers, including the Newcastle City Council and Port Stephens Council merger.\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2016 census, there were 155,411 people in the City of Newcastle local government area, of these 49.3 per cent were male and 50.7 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.5 per cent of the population, which was higher than the national and state averages of 2.9 and 2.9 per cent. The median age of people in the City of Newcastle was 37 years, just below the national median of 38. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 16.9 per cent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 16 per cent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 40.7 per cent were married and 15.4 per cent were either divorced or separated.Population growth in the City of Newcastle between the 2001 census and the 2006 census was 3.91 per cent; and in the subsequent ten years to the 2016 census, population growth was 9.64 per cent. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78 per cent and 17.86 per cent respectively, population growth in the City of Newcastle local government area was significantly lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the City of Newcastle was marginally lower than the national average.At the 2016 census, over 80% of residents in the City of Newcastle local government area stated their country of birth as Australia significantly exceeding the national average of 66.7%. Almost 60% of all residents in the City of Newcastle nominated a religion with Catholicism being at almost 25%, which was slightly higher than the national average of 22.6%. As at the 2016 census, households in the City of Newcastle local government area had a significantly lower than average proportion (11.6%) where a language other than English is spoken (national average was 22.2%).\n\nCouncil\nCurrent composition and election method\nNewcastle City Council is composed of thirteen councillors, including the Lord Mayor, generally for a fixed four-year term of office. The Lord Mayor is directly elected while the twelve other Councillors are elected proportionally as four separate wards, each electing three Councillors. The most recent election was held in September 2021.  The Lord Mayor elected at that time, Jeff McCloy, resigned in 2014, and a by-election for Lord Mayor was held on 15 November 2014.  The current makeup of the council, including the Lord Mayor, is as follows:\n\nThe current Council, elected in September 2021, in order of election by ward is:\n\nSister cities\nNewcastle Council has sister city relations with the following cities:\nPassage 3:\nShelly Beach, New South Wales\nShelly Beach is a coastal suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, located east of Tuggerah Lake and bordering the Pacific Ocean south of The Entrance. It is part of the Central Coast Council local government area. It is 66 km south of Newcastle & 93 km north of Sydney.  Shelly Beach is considered one of the most popular surfing beaches on the Central Coast.\nShelly Beach Golf Club (previously Tuggerah Lakes Gold Club) is an 18-hole golf course located at the eastern end of Shelly Beach Road, overlooking Shelly Beach. It was formally established in 1930, originally being located at Killarney Vale until 1954 when it moved to its present location.\nWithin the suburb there is the Shelly Beach Surf Club and the Shelly Beach Fossils soccer club.\n\nTransportation\nRed Bus Services operates routes through Shelly Beach (11, 12, 21, 22, 23).  Bus 21 operates from The Entrance North to Gosford regularly.\n\nNotable people\nNikki Garrett – golfer\nBanjo Paterson – poet\n\nAccommodation\nShelly Beach Cabins\nBluewater Resort\nSun Valley Tourist Park\nPassage 4:\nShelly Beach (Manly)\nShelly Beach (also known as Shelley Beach) is a beach located in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is adjacent to North Head and Fairy Bower. Shelly Beach is a western facing beach on the eastern coast of Australia.  \nShelly Beach is part of the no take Cabbage Tree Bay Aquatic Reserve.\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of occupation of Aboriginal people in the area; in particular a shell midden has been recorded near the Fairy Bower car park. This is the reason for its name even though the beach itself is not that shelly. One hundred years ago Shelly Beach was a haven for boat owners, Providing protection from winds and seas from the south. What's also changed is the hillside, which in the early 1920s was home to only several buildings but is now covered with expensive homes from which their occupants can take advantage of the expansive views to the north. There is an old motorbike standing on the seabed in the middle of the bay in around 8m of water.\nOn the weekend of June 4 & 5, 2016 a severe storm caused extensive damage to the walkway between Manly Beach and Shelly Beach.  This included considerable damage to the pathway - with large slabs of concrete being lifted and displaced, the complete disappearance of a small toilet block, damage to an iconic sculpture at Fairy Bower pool and large sections of the safety railing being destroyed. Due to safety concerns, a large barrier and warning signs were installed to discourage people from walking along the path until repairs were made. Despite this, many people ignored the warnings and simply climbed around the rocks to get back to the path. The barriers were removed in August 2016, following the completion of remediation work.\n\nGeography\nShelly Beach is protected from the ocean swell by the reef that lies on the right hand side of the beach (when facing the ocean) and faces west. Cabbage Tree Bay is a small north-facing embayment that includes two small beaches. Shelly Beach is a reflective beach about 100 metres long. Shelly Beach is a protected marine reserve since it is part of Cabbage Tree Bay.\nThe visibility is good and a large variety of marine life can be seen there.\nIt is excellent for scuba divers, and also for snorkelers as Shelly beach does not get very deep, its maximum depth being about 12 metres. Many areas are shallow with depths ranging from 2 to 6 metres. This particularity makes it popular for casual and regular snorkelers. Cabbage Tree Bay was declared a 'No Take' Aquatic Reserve on 31 March 2002.On the western point of the beach is a surf break known as \"Bower\" which offers one of the most shallow breaking waves in Sydney. Further along from Bower are Winki and Deadman's, two other well-known breaks which are popular with surfers, especially on south-east, and east swells. Shelly Beach is also one of only a handful of west-facing ocean beaches on the east coast of Australia.\n\nInfrastructure\nFacilities include 2 free electric barbecues, showers, toilets and a kiosk selling meals, drinks and coffee. There is a restaurant on the beach called The Boathouse Shelly Beach. There is a bush track around the headland with views of the Northern Beaches and North Head. The facilities also include parking at the rate of $8.00 an hour. Many scuba diving centres take students because it offers excellent conditions for an environment in which to learn SCUBA.\n\nWildlife\nThe report also states that 'more than 160 species of marine fish have been recorded within the reserve, including protected species such as the weedy or common sea dragon, the elegant wrasse and the threatened black cod.\n\nFame\nIn the opening scene of the 1983 film BMX Bandits, two characters ride their bicycles down the walkway between Manly Beach and Shelly Beach.\n\nSee also\nBeaches in Sydney\nShelly Beach in Cronulla\nPassage 5:\nBucketty\nBucketty is a locality in the City of Cessnock local government area (LGA), in New South Wales, Australia. It is in the south of the LGA, immediately adjacent to the border with the City of Hawkesbury and Central Coast Council, in the Hunter Region, about 105 km (65 mi) north of Sydney, and 55 km (34 mi) from Cessnock, New South Wales, the council seat. Bucketty is presumably the Aboriginal word for mountain spring.Bucketty is situated on a ridge of ironstone hills separating Yengo National Park from the Central Coast.Bucketty has no services and the nearest general stores are located in Laguna and Kulnura. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service maintains the Bucketty & District Rural Fire Brigade and the Fire Shed is the social centre of the town. When rural addressing was introduced, the numbering was based on the distance from Broke, and some of the streets were also given names.\n\nBackground\nBucketty and the surrounding bushland contains some of the country's most significant Aboriginal sites, including Mt Yengo.  In the early 1800s pioneers settled in Murrays Run, and one of the most significant roads of the colony, the 220 km-long (136 mi) Great North Road between Sydney and Newcastle, was built using convict labour.\nThe current community of Bucketty (186 people) was only established in 1972.  It was in Bucketty that the Convict Trail Project was conceived – a heritage initiative that manages the restoration, maintenance and promotion of the convict-built road [1]. The community is also involved in the Wombat Rescue Project which has attracted national attention and has an MoU with the NPWS to self-manage the Convict Wall site that is part of the Yengo National Park. This site is a focal point for community activities, such as the Concerts under the Stars and the annual Carols by Candlelight. The community has received several awards for its various activities and initiatives [2].\nPassage 6:\nGrahamstown Dam\nGrahamstown Dam is a major off-stream earthfill Embankment dam with a controlled labyrinth spillway and baffle chute that stores water from the Williams River. The dam is located north of Newcastle and within the Port Stephens Council local government area in the Lower Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam's main purpose is water supply; it provides about 40 per cent of the potable water for the Hunter region; and is the Hunter's largest drinking water supply dam.\nThe impounded reservoir is called Grahamstown Lake or the Grahamstown Storage Reservoir.\n\nLocation and features\nGrahamstown Dam is immediately adjacent to residential areas in the town of Raymond Terrace, less than 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Raymond Terrace CBD.\nCommenced in 1955, completed in 1965, and commissioned in 1969, Grahamstown Dam is a major dam that receives its main inflow from the Williams River as well as its own catchment. Water flows into the Grahamstown Dam from the Williams River, upstream from the Seaham Weir, which limits the inflow of tidal seawater; via Balickera Canal and pumping station, which are used to transfer water from the Williams River to Grahamstown Dam. The Campvale Pumping Station; George Schroder Pumping Station and delivery mains are used to deliver water from the dam to the water treatment plant; and Grahamstown Water Treatment Plant.The storage was formed by building an embankment across the outlet of a natural depression known as the Grahamstown Moors. Construction began in 1955, and although all the elements of the entire scheme were not completed until 1965, water was first supplied in 1960 during the severe drought from 1960 to 1963. The dam was built by the NSW Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission on behalf of the Hunter Water Corporation to supply water to the Hunter Region.The dam wall consists of 2,124 cubic metres (75,000 cu ft) of earthfill with an internal earth core. It is 12 m (39 ft) high and 4.8 km (3 mi) long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back 190,000 megalitres (6,700×10^6 cu ft) of water. The surface area of Grahamstown Lake is 2,460 ha (6,079 acres) and the catchment area is a relatively small 97 km2 (37 sq mi). The controlled labyrinth spillway is capable of discharging 800 cubic metres per second (28,000 cu ft/s).\n\nUpgrade of facilities\nSince the dam was completed, major modifications include:\n1973: a bentonite clay core 2.02 km (1.3 mi) in length was installed in the central section of the embankment to provide a watertight seal, the 1.5 m (5 ft) thick core has an average depth of 21.3 m (70 ft);\n1985: the Full Supply Level of the dam was reduced from 11.1 m (36.4 ft) to 10.6 m (34.8 ft) as a temporary measure to reduce the risk of damage to the main embankment from major flooding;\n1994: further work was undertaken to raise the level of the clay core to road level over the full length of the embankment and rock armouring of the main embankment was also undertaken; and\n2005: the Full Supply Level was increased to 12.8 m (42 ft) and provided 50 per cent more storage capacity by constructing a spillway northeast of Raymond Terrace and a new discharge channel under the Pacific Highway.\n\nCriticism\nAt the time of the proposal for the construction of a dam at Tillegra, it was claimed that Hunter Water Corporation deliberately allowed the water storage levels in Grahamstown Dam run down in order to inflate the case for the A$477 million Tillegra project.\n\nSee also\nIrrigation in Australia\nList of dams and reservoirs in New South Wales\nPassage 7:\nGillieston Heights\nGillieston Heights is a suburb of the City of Maitland local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, approximately 5.1 km (3.2 mi) from the Maitland CBD. Prior to 1967, the village was named East Greta however this was changed to honour former Maitland mayor and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly John Gillies following a poll of residents. At the 2016 census, Gillieston Heights had a population of 3,150.\n\nHistory\nThe Traditional Owners and Custodians of the Maitland area are the Wonnarua people.Following the discovery of high quality coal by prospector T.W. Edgeworth David in 1888, a group of local businessmen purchased 245 acres (99 ha) of land surrounding present-day Gillieston Heights and were within weeks able to produce coal which was transported by dray to Maitland for sale. To capitalise on this success, the East Greta Coal Mining Company was established in 1891. The company constructed a railway line from West Maitland to the East Greta colliery, completed in 1893. Orders to supply coal for power companies in Sydney, Melbourne and Bundaberg saw the company declare a dividend in 1896 and expand its operations, sinking a second mine shaft the same year.\n\nAs the coal mining activities in the area were expanded, the railway line from Maitland was extended further to the south, and a station platform was opened at East Greta in 1902, with passenger services to Stanford Merthyr near the town of Kurri Kurri. Initially, passengers had to walk to Maitland railway station to connect with trains operated by New South Wales Government Railways, but in 1903 this service was extended to Maitland, and a year later to Cessnock on the newly extended South Maitland Railway. Mining operations at the East Greta colliery ceased following a miners strike in 1929 and subsidence caused by floods in 1930s damaged the workings. After closure the plant & rail sidings at the 2 collieries were soon removed. The village consisting of permanent dwellings which had been erected to house miners remained. After the closure of the mine, the town continued to be served by passenger trains until 1967 when the privately run passenger service over the line between Cessnock and Maitland ended. Coal traffic over the line to services to collieries in the Cessnock area continued.\nSince 2005, Gillieston Heights has experienced rapid population growth, with large residential developments approved as part of the Maitland City Council's urban settlement strategy. The population doubled between 2005 and 2011, with the rapid growth placing pressure on Gillieston Public School, leading to the acquisition of more land for future expansion.\n\nPopulation\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,150 people in Gillieston Heights.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.3% of the population.\n88.3% of people were born in Australia and 91.8% of people spoke only English at home..\nThe most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.4%, Catholic 25.1% and Anglican 24.8%.\n\nTransport\nGillieston Heights is served by Rover Coaches route 164 to Cessnock and Maitland. The rapid population growth in the suburb and other former mining villages in the area has led to calls by Maitland and Cessnock councils to reinstate passenger services on the South Maitland Railway, connecting to Newcastle to ease congestion on regional roads. A new station at Gillieston Heights has been identified as a priority.\nPassage 8:\nMount View, New South Wales\nMount View, New South Wales is a rural locality located in the Hunter Region wine region in New South Wales Australia. It is located Between Cessnock and Wollombi and is a part of the City of Cessnock local government area. It has ideal climate, soil, and temperature for viticultural pursuits, which have been practised here since the mid-19th century. The road from Cessnock to Mount View provides access to the Great North Walk, and to lookouts with excellent views of the Hunter Region.\n\nGeography\nMount View is located in the Hunter Valley region, it is blanketed in a dense forest with periodic clearing throughout its foothills. The area around the mountain is mostly rural pastures, littered with small farmhouses. There are some creeks that run down from the mountains peak, these provide water to the surrounding rural area.\nPassage 9:\nUnincorporated Far West Region\nThe Unincorporated Far West Region is an unincorporated area in the Far West region of New South Wales, Australia. The area is one of only two areas in New South Wales that are not part of any local government area (the other is Lord Howe Island). The region includes several small towns including Tibooburra, Milparinka and Silverton. Silverton and Tibooburra have village councils. The region surrounds Broken Hill, but does not include it, which is in the separate City of Broken Hill local government area.\nThe region has an area of 93,299 square kilometres (36,023 sq mi) which is slightly larger than Hungary and smaller than South Korea.\n\nDemographics\nAs at the 2016 census, all unincorporated areas of NSW had a population of 1056; around 400 of these were on the distant and unrelated Lord Howe Island. The statistics below refer to a combination of all unincorporated areas of NSW.

{"input": "Which as more species Cassiope or Deutzia?", "context": "Passage 1:\nEricaceae\nThe Ericaceae () are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the heath or heather family, found most commonly in acidic and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with c. 4250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).\n\nDescription\nThe Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. Their leaves are usually evergreen, alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules. Their flowers are hermaphrodite and show considerable variability. The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus Rhododendron are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). Anthers open by pores.\n\nTaxonomy\nMichel Adanson used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but Antoine Laurent de Jussieu first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus Erica, which appears to be derived from the Greek word ereíkē (ἐρείκη). The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning 'heather'. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before Linnaean times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described Erica in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.Historically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, Ericoideae, Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae). Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, Rhododendron L. (including Azalea L. pro parte), Therorhodion Small, Ledum L., Tsusiophyllum Max., Menziesia J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into Rhododendron, along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.In 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework. The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4000 species:\nEnkianthoideae Kron, Judd & Anderberg (one genus, 16 species)\nPyroloideae Kosteltsky (4 genera, 40 species)\nMonotropoideae Arnott (10 genera, 15 species)\nArbutoideae Niedenzu (up to six genera, about 80 species)\nCassiopoideae Kron & Judd (one genus, 12 species)\nEricoideae Link (19 genera, 1790 species)\nHarrimanelloideae Kron & Judd (one species)\nEpacridoideae Arn. (=Styphelioideae Sweet) (35 genera, 545 species)\nVaccinioideae Arnott (50 genera, 1580 species)\n\nGenera\nSee the full list at List of Ericaceae genera.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nThe Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.The family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile conditions. Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Epacridoideae) form a distinctive accumulation of mycorrhizae, in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients. The Pyroloideae are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.In many parts of the world, a \"heath\" or \"heathland\" is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in the Ericaceae. A common example is Erica tetralix. This plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include Rhododendron groenlandicum and Kalmia polifolia. In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak-heath forest.In heathland, plants in the family Ericaceae serve as hostplants to the butterfly Plebejus argus.Some evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as Erica tetralix to grasslands. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.\nPassage 2:\nDeutzia silvestrii\nDeutzia silvestrii is a species of Safflower in the family Hydrangeaceae. It is found in central China (红花溲疏; hóng huā sōu shū).\nPassage 3:\nCassiope mertensiana\nCassiope mertensiana is a species of flowering plant known by the common names western moss heather and white mountain heather.\nThis heather is native to subalpine areas of western North America, from Alaska to the mountains of California. It is a small, branching shrub which forms patches along the ground and in rocky crevices.\n\nDescription\nCassiope mertensiana has short, erect, snakelike stems that are covered in tiny leathery scalelike leaves only a few millimeters long. From between the layers of scale leaves emerge reddish  pedicels each bearing a petite, hanging, down-facing, bell-shaped flower. The bractlets are red and the contrasting flower is white.\n\nAlthough the shrub tends to grow in areas where there is a lot of accumulation of snow, adequate rain precipitation is needed for the continued growth of Cassiope Mertensiana. The shrub must be exposed to enough sunlight and warmer conditions for proper growth during the growing season.\nPassage 4:\nCassiope lycopodioides\nCassiope lycopodioides, Haida Gwaii mountain-heather or clubmoss mountain heather, is a plant species native to North America.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found in southern Alaska, British Columbia, and the US State of Washington.\nIt is found on rocky slopes in arctic and alpine tundra at elevations up to 2000 m. In Washington, it is reported only from King County. The specific epithet \"lycopodioides\" refers to the plant's superficial resemblance to some species of clubmoss (Lycopodium sensu lato).\n\nSubspecies\nCassiope lycopodioides subsp. cristapilosa, known only from the Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands), is recognized as a distinct taxon by some authorities but not others.\n\nDescription\nCassiope lycopodioides is a perennial herb forming mats lying close to the ground. Leaves are narrow, up to 3 mm long, closely pressed against the stem. Flowers are white, bell-shaped, up to 20 mm across.\nPassage 5:\nDeutzia\nDeutzia ( or ) is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and central Asia (from the Himalayas east to Japan and the Philippines), and Central America and also Europe. By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.\nThe species are shrubs ranging from 1–4 m (3 ft 3 in – 13 ft 1 in) in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.\nDeutzia is named after the 18th century Dutch patron of botany, Johan van der Deutz.\n\nSelected species\n\nCultivation and uses\nThe deutzias are fairly new to gardens: the exception, D. scabra, was noticed in Japanese gardens by Engelbert Kaempfer (1712) and Carl Peter Thunberg (1784) but not actually seen in Europe till the 1830s; two-thirds of the species noted in the R.H.S. Dictionary were gathered in from the wild during the 20th century.Deutzias are commonly grown as ornamental plants for their white and pink flowers. Many cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use, including selections with double flowers. For example, Deutzia × lemoinei is a hybrid of D. gracilis and D. parviflora. The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-\n\nThe temperate deutzias are mostly hardy shrubs from far eastern regions where winters are dependably frozen; in milder climates, like much of England, the early-flowering species and hybrids are coaxed into premature bloom by mild spells, then spoilt by frost. Alice Coats remarks that deutzias have done better in Edinburgh, on the chilly east coast of Scotland, than in London. A solution in milder climates might be to site deutzia in the garden's most exposed, coldest microclimate, as is often done with early-flowering magnolias.\nIdentification can be difficult, and in particular, many of the plants in cultivation sold as D. scabra are actually D. crenata (Huxley 1992). The selected hybrid white double \"Pride-of-Rochester\", already in cultivation in 1881, was originated by the Rochester, New York nurserymen Ellwanger and Barry.Deutzia scabra is used by joiners in Japan to polish wood.\nPassage 6:\nCassiope\nCassiope is a genus of 9-12 small shrubby species in the family Ericaceae. It is the sole genus in the subfamily Cassiopoideae. They are native to the Arctic and north temperate montane regions. The genus is named after Cassiopeia of Greek mythology. Common names, shared with several other similar related genera, include heather and heath. They have scale-like leaves lying against the stems, and produce solitary bell-shaped flowers in late spring. Though hardy, flowers can be damaged by late frosts.\nThey are cultivated in gardens, suitable sites being rock gardens, peat banks or glades in woodland areas.,\nPassage 7:\nHarrimanella\nHarrimanella is a genus of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, with a single species, Harrimanella hypnoides, also known as moss bell heather or moss heather.   It was originally named Cassiope hypnoides by Linnaeus (1737) in his Flora Lapponica, but Harrimanella hypnoides is now the accepted name at Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The species name hypnoides means 'like Hypnum ', which is a genus mosses.\nThe plant is a cold hardy dicot perennial found growing on rock crevices in the Canadian arctic, Quebec, the Northeastern United States, Greenland, Iceland, the mountains of Norway, Sweden and Finland, Svalbard and arctic Russia, including the Ural mountains.Harrimanella hypnoides produces moss-like cushions, about 5 cm high, often of prostrate stems with ascending shoot tips. The leaves are scale-like, looking like those of a moss. The flowers are conspicuous, white and bell shaped with five fused petals and five sepals. They are borne singly on short reddish pedicels. The fruit is an erect capsule.\nPassage 8:\nDeutzia ningpoensis\nDeutzia ningpoensis is a shrub in the family Hydrangeaceae.  The species is endemic to China.

Draper had accepted an offer from Sam Stosur to play in the mixed doubles at the 2005 Australian Open which also finished on 30 January. Draper and Stosur reached the semi-final, which meant that Draper had to play in the first round of the golf in the morning and the semi-final of the tennis in the afternoon. Draper played his second round on the following day but missed the cut. This meant he was free to compete in the final of the mixed doubles on 30 January. On 11 February 2007, Draper won the New South Wales PGA Championship on the Von Nida Tour. He finished the four-round event with a score of 268, 20-under-par, one stroke ahead of Andrew Bonhomme and Aaron Townsend.

Made by Hammer Films, it was adapted by Nigel Kneale from the 1960 novel The Devil's Own by Norah Lofts, published under the pseudonym Peter Curtis.\n\nPlot\nSchoolteacher Gwen Mayfield comes back to England after suffering a nervous breakdown caused by an attack by witch-doctors while working in a mission in Africa. She's hired by the wealthy Reverend Alan Bax, who runs a school in the remote village of Heddaby. Once there, Gwen finds out Alan is not actually a minister, and only wears a clerical collar out of \"a sense of security\"; the only church in the village is in ruins. Meanwhile, she befriends Alan's sister, an esteemed journalist.\nThe romance between two of Gwen's students, Ronnie Dowsett and Linda Rigg, is sternly opposed by adults in the village for reasons Gwen can't understand. Linda lives with her grandmother, who's rumoured to be a witch and Ronnie fears is abusing Linda.\nAs Ronnie is a gifted student, Alan proposes to pay for his stay at a prep school outside the village, but the boy's father is against it. Gwen volunteers to tutor the boy.\nRonnie gives Linda a male doll as a mate to her female one, to represent them as a couple. The next day, Ronnie falls into a coma, and Gwen finds the male doll with pins stuck through it and its head missing. She shows it to Stephanie, who indicates someone might be dabbling in witchcraft. Impressed by Gwen's knowledge of magical practices in Africa, Stephanie invites her to coauthor an article about witchcraft in contemporary England.\nRonnie's superstitious mother becomes upset when Gwen asks her about Ronnie's state. Later, she goes to Granny Rigg's house to work out a deal. The next day, Ronnie is out of the coma and is quickly taken by his mother to stay with her relatives in Wales. Ronnie's father confronts Granny Rigg about it and is later found drowned in a nearby pond.\nGwen starts to think people who believe themselves to be witches are behind these incidents, and realizes that if they're trying to keep Ronnie apart from Linda, it could mean they might be planning to sacrifice her as a virgin. She announces her will to testify at the inquest into Ronnie's father's death. Following an injury caused by Stephanie's dogs, Gwen is taken to the Baxes' home where she is treated by the local doctor. During the night, she gets frightened by the sudden appearance of an African totem, and suffers another nervous breakdown.\nMonths later, Gwen is recovering in a nursing home with no recollection of ever leaving Africa. After a visiting little girl's doll triggers the return of her memories, she escapes the hospital and hitchhikes back to Heddaby, where she's welcomed to stay at the Baxes' again. One of the villagers whispers to her that Linda, officially in vacation at her cousin's, has actually been taken by the witches.\nOne night, Gwen sees from the Baxes' window a group of people scurrying toward the ruined church, and goes to investigate, finding a witches' coven led by Stephanie, who reveals she had planned to initiate Gwen into their ranks. Stephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden, planned for the next night, in occasion of Lammastide. The place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie's robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\nWeeks later, freed of Stephanie's influence, Heddaby has returned to normal. Gwen chooses to stay and work as a schoolteacher for Alan.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe village of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, was the filming location for the fictional village of Heddaby. Interiors were filmed at Hammer's usual studio at Bray in the same year that the famous horror film company vacated their home altogether for (mainly) Elstree and Pinewood. The cast featured child-actor Martin Stephens, then 17. The supporting cast also included Hammer regular Duncan Lamont, as well as John Collin, Michele Dotrice, Leonard Rossiter and Bryan Marshall. The score was by Richard Rodney Bennett.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety called the film \"routine entertainment\". The Hammer Story: The Authorised Biography of Hammer Films called the film \"unsettling, though compromised by a hysterical climax\", writing, \"when The Witches strikes the right balance it ultimately succeeds as an engrossing thriller, even if it ultimately disappoints as Hammer horror.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 9 critics' reviews are positive.\nPassage 7:\n1999 Stella Artois Championships – Singles\nScott Draper was the defending champion but lost in the third round to Sargis Sargsian.\nPete Sampras won in the final 6–7(1–7), 6–4, 7–6(7–4) against Tim Henman.\nThis was the only year in which Roger Federer competed in this tournament.\n\nSeeds\nThe top eight seeds received a bye to the second round.\n\nDraw\nKey\nFinals\nTop half\nSection 1\nSection 2\nBottom half\nSection 3\nSection 4\nExternal links\n1999 Stella Artois Championships draw\nPassage 8:\n2005 Australian Open – Mixed Doubles\nSamantha Stosur and Scott Draper defeated Liezel Huber and Kevin Ullyett in the final 6–2, 2–6, [10–6] to win the mixed doubles title at the 2005 Australian Open.

There is a small but fiercely devoted cult following for the band. \nFor the majority of the band's career, Thinking Fellers consisted of multi-instrumentalists Brian Hageman, Mark Davies, Anne Eickelberg, Hugh Swarts, and Jay Paget.\n\nHistory\nThe band achieved their greatest critical and commercial success in the mid-1990s, when they signed with the indie rock label Matador Records. It was during this time that Thinking Fellers produced their most prominent albums, Lovelyville, and Strangers from the Universe. They toured the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK in 1994 and made an appearance on the John Peel radio show on the BBC. In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the alternative rock band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase. Thinking Fellers has been largely dormant since 1996, having toured sporadically and released only one full album, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, since.\nElf Power's 1999 album A Dream In Sound featured a cover of Thinking Fellers Union Local 282's song \"Noble Experiment.\"\nIn 2001, author Jonathan Franzen referenced the band in his novel The Corrections.

Formed in 1991, they achieved success with their 1993 album Dig, which featured the charting single \"Believe\". The band then released the album Defenders of the Universe in 1996. It was followed by their third album Life Like in 1999, in which they then disbanded that same year. They reunited briefly from 2004 to 2008, and again in 2016. Vocalist/guitarist Scott Hackwith and guitarist Jon Morris are the only members to stay in the band for its entire run, although the current lineup also consists of original guitarist Johnny Cornwell.\n\nHistory\nDig formed in 1991 within Los Angeles, as vocalist Scott Hackwith had previously produced for The Ramones and had worked in the studio for various bands. Hackwith and drummer Anthony Smedile formed the band together, and they then recruited Jon Morris on guitar and backing vocals, Johnny Cornwell on guitar, and Phil Friedmann on bass. After releasing a demo EP in 1992 titled Runt, they signed with Radioactive Records and issued their first full-length album in 1993, the self-titled Dig. It was produced by Dave Jerden, who was well-known for producing '90s albums by bands such as Alice in Chains and Anthrax. The album peaked at No. 153 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers charts. The single \"Believe\" was played regularly on MTV's Buzz Bin and it had reached No. 19 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart and at No. 34 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. Although \"Believe\" was the band's hit song, the record labels had done an unlikely move, and issued four other singles from the same album, although they all failed to chart in the United States. Overseas in the United Kingdom, Dig had fared a bit better on the UK Singles Chart, as \"Believe\" peaked at No. 83, \"Unlucky Friend\" peaked at No. 96, and \"I'll Stay High\" peaked at No. 97, all in 1994. The single \"Unlucky Friend\" had featured four tracks recorded by Dig while on Mark Radcliffe's FM radio show while they toured the UK. The band toured with the likes of Prong and Blind Melon to promote the album. Towards the end of 1994, Dig released the promotional Soft Pretzel EP, which included three original songs and also a Pink Floyd cover, \"Fearless\". Also in 1994, the band's song \"Curious George Blues\" was exclusively recorded for the soundtrack to the movie Airheads. The following year, their cover of the \"Theme From Fat Albert\" was included on the compilation Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits. They also recorded another exclusive song, \"Hu Hu Hu\", for the soundtrack of the movie Virtuosity.\nFrom the beginning of 1995 until the middle of 1996, the band had not gone on any tours due to their prior exhaustive schedule; however, in 1996, they released their second album, Defenders of the Universe. The album was almost entirely mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, a mixer with hundreds of credits to his name. The album and its touring cycle had guitarist Cornwell replaced by Dix Denney, and drummer Smedile replaced by Matt Tecu. Unlike the previous album, none of the songs charted, and the album itself had not charted either. The following year, Dig's record label parent MCA had shifted them from Radioactive Records to their other imprint, Uptown Records.\nAfter the label shift, the band released their third album Life Like in early 1999. Sylvia Massy took over mixing duties for the entirety. The album was recorded as a four-piece, since guitarist Denney left the band and both Hackwith and Morris handled guitar duties. Other changes in the lineup included original bassist Friedmann replaced by Jay Nicholas, and drummer Tecu replaced by Gene Trautmann. For the touring cycle, bassist Nicholas was replaced by Rob Redick, and guitarist Joel Graves was added into the band, to round out the five members; however, with a lack of support from the band's record label and only sporadic shows being played, the band was dropped from Uptown/MCA in July 1999, and the Uptown label itself officially went defunct later in the year. After the small touring cycle, new bassist Redick joined Candlebox and new drummer Trautmann joined Queens of the Stone Age. Original guitarist Morris had stepped away as well, and it signified the end of Dig.\nIn 2004, the band reappeared, and played sporadic one-off shows. The lineup included frontman Hackwith, original guitarists Morris and Cornwell, second drummer Tecu, and new bassist Jamie Carter; however, when 2007 rolled around, Tecu was replaced by Dave Stedronsky and Carter was replaced by prominent Rocket From the Crypt member Pete Reichert. They recorded the first new Dig song in years, titled \"No One's There\", and it appeared on a Poison Tree Records: Road to Nowhere compilation, alongside bands such as Fu Manchu and The Dwarves. Afterwards, various sessions of recording commenced; however, nothing ever surfaced.\nIn 2016, the band was revived yet again to play a singular show in West Hollywood. Along with Hackwith, Morris, and Cornwell, new bassist Marcus Blake and new drummer Charlie George had joined the lineup. After another period of only random updates, the band launched their own independent merch store in early 2020 and had started recording again, but with new bassist Tommy Black joining the band.

Founded as a studio-only project in 1990, the band's nucleus comprises musicians Dale Flattum, Eric Holland and Mike Morasky. Morasky and Flattum are also known for being founding members of the noise/industrial rock group Steel Pole Bath Tub, which the duo continued their involvement with concurrent to Milk Cult. Milk Cult is known for their found-sound experiments and dense sample-based compositions, as well as their collaborations with numerous musical acts, including Faith No More, Jawbreaker, Grotus, Neurosis, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and The Geraldine Fibbers.\n\nHistory\nMilk Cult was founded in 1990 and issued their debut album, titled Love God in 1992 on Boner Records. The album contained music inspired by the group's score for the Frank Grow film of the same title. Burn or Bury followed in 1994 and featured the collaborative efforts of Mike Patton, Billy Gould, Lars Fox, Carla Bozulich, Blake Schwarzenbach, Paul Reller, Dave Edwardson, Scott Kelly and Steve Von Till. Bruse Lee Marvin Gaye was released in 1995 and featured music recorded in 1994 with Japanese musicians Masaya Nakahara, Hideki Yoshimura, Hidekazu Miyahara and Pop Suzuki.\nIn 1997, Milk Cult was contacted by the French government and offered an opportunity to participate in a Marseille-based art collective. The group obliged and traveled to France to record for a year, with their efforts eventually surfacing as the material for their fourth album. Titled Project M-13, the album featured numerous guests and embraced world music while continuing to experiment with sampling and hip hop beats.After the release of Project M-13 the members of Milk Cult devoted themselves to separate projects. Morasky turned his focus to movie special-effects and worked as a technician on The Lord of the Rings films. Continuing the found-sound experiments of Milk Cult but in a more accessible form, Flattum and former Steel Pole Bath Tub drummer Darren Morey formed Novex, who released an album titled Kleptophonica in 2002. Eric Holland released his debut solo album Borders, Battles & Beers in 2010 and continues to work as a music engineer, recording with musical acts such as Mike Patton and his band Tomahawk.\n\nDiscography\nLove God (Boner Records, 1992)\nBurn or Bury (Priority Records, 1994)\nBruse Lee Marvin Gaye (ZK Records, 1995)\nProject M-13 (0 To 1 Records, 2000)\nPassage 9:\nI Hope It Lands\nI Hope It Lands is an album by the American band Thinking Fellers Union Local 282.

LaValle Stadium\nThe Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium is the main stadium for Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, United States. Construction began in 2000 at a cost of approximately $22 million. With a capacity of 12,300 people (10,300 seating and 2,000 standing), it is the largest outdoor facility in Suffolk County. The stadium is home to the Division I Stony Brook Seawolves and their football, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's lacrosse, and women's lacrosse teams.The stadium opened on September 14, 2002. It was named in honor of New York state senator Kenneth LaValle on October 19, 2002. LaValle played a key role in the development and creation of the stadium. The stadium consists of a three-tier press box on the east side, as well as six luxury suites, a press box, television and radio booths, and a camera deck on the roof. Its most recent expansion came in 2017, with the addition of 2,000 seats in the north end zone and a new concessions and restrooms facility.\nLaValle Stadium has hosted the 2006 and 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship quarterfinals, as well as the 2011, 2012 and 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship final fours and title games.LaValle Stadium was listed at No. 22 on a 2012 Yahoo! Sports list of \"College Football's Top 25 Toughest Places to Play\".\n\nHistory\nAs Stony Brook planned its transition to Division I from Division III, a new football stadium was immediately deemed necessary to replace Seawolves Field, a 1,000-seat bleacher stadium with muddy sinkholes that had existed since 1984. The first proposal in 1994 called for a $4 million multi-use stadium for football and lacrosse. However, 500 professors petitioned Governor Mario Cuomo to stop the stadium from being built along with Stony Brook's transition to Division I, because they worried a new stadium would add more traffic to the Three Villages, attract a rowdy crowd on weekends and take money from academic programs.Construction on a new stadium began in 2000. Originally slated to cost $12 million, the final structure cost $22 million and was fully supported by Stony Brook president Shirley Strum Kenny, who said she was \"serious about the athletic program, serious about Division I\", and expected Stony Brook to became \"important\" and \"a contender.\"Seawolves Stadium opened on September 14, 2002 as the Stony Brook Seawolves football team faced the St. John's Red Storm in Stony Brook's first game as a Division I program. Stony Brook won 34–9, and the opening kickoff was returned for a touchdown by the Seawolves. At the time of its opening, the 8,136-seat stadium was the largest in Suffolk County, a record that is still held today.On October 19, 2002, the date of Stony Brook's Homecoming game against Sacred Heart, the stadium was renamed the Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium in honor of New York state senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a key figure in the development and creation of the $22 million facility. Before its opening, the Stony Brook Director of Marketing and Promotions for Athletics had opened up the possibility of renaming the stadium for a corporate partnership or a former president of Stony Brook University.The stadium's name has been the subject of numerous controversies, including in 2009 after LaValle voted against the legalization of gay marriage in New York and in 2019 when LaValle voted against a ban on gay conversion therapy.\n\nExpansions\nIn October 2012, Stony Brook University allocated $5.7 million for the addition of at least 2,000 seats to LaValle Stadium, bringing the seating capacity from 8,300 to 10,300, with a standing capacity of 2,000 bringing the stadium's total capacity to 12,300.New York governor Andrew Cuomo vetoed a $22 million upgrade to the stadium in 2015, money which was originally allocated for a \"computational biomedicine visualization and drug development magnet facility.\" The Senate had attempted to change the usage of the funds in the state budget as the intended programs no longer existed.An expansion was completed in the summer of 2017 and added 2,000 seats in the north end zone, as well as a new concessions and restrooms facility. Before the 2018 season, a new turf field was installed in LaValle Stadium, also adding red end zones and a new midfield logo.\n\nEvents hosted\nIn October 2005, LaValle Stadium was chosen to be the host site for the two North Region contests in the 2006 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, with both of the games aired on ESPN2. It was the first time that Stony Brook had hosted any NCAA postseason championship even since the program's move to Division I in 1999. A sold-out crowd of 8,335 attended the events. Stony Brook was again chosen to host the North Region games in the 2011 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament quarterfinals.A sold-out crowd of 10,024 watched the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship quarterfinals at LaValle Stadium, where No. 8-seeded Stony Brook fell 10–9 to No. 1-seeded Virginia, falling one goal short of the Final Four.LaValle Stadium first hosted the Final Four and championship game of the NCAA women's lacrosse tournament in 2011, after three consecutive seasons of being held at Towson University's Johnny Unitas Stadium. A crowd of 8,011 witnessed Northwestern beat Maryland in the title game. The event resulted in 20,000 people visiting the Stony Brook region and $100,000 in hotel revenue. Stony Brook was chosen to host the 2012 Final Four as well. The Final Four returned to Stony Brook in 2018.LaValle Stadium was set to host three games of the 2020 Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) season, including a nationally televised game on NBC in June, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league held its season in a bubble in Utah instead.\n\nAttendance records\nThe most attended game in Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium history occurred on October 5, 2019, when 12,812 showed up for a Homecoming game against James Madison in which Stony Brook lost, 45–38, in overtime.\nAsterisks indicate Homecoming games.\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums\nPassage 9:\n2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Lacrosse Tournament\nThe 2015 Big Ten Men's Lacrosse Tournament took place April 30 to May 2 at Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium in  College Park, Maryland.

{"input": "Since what historic period has the area known for its Crottin de Chavignol goat cheese been inhabited?", "context": "Passage 1:\nChabichou\nChabichou (also known as Chabichou du Poitou) is a traditional semi-soft, unpasteurized, natural-rind French goat cheese (or Fromage de Chèvre) with a firm and creamy texture.  Chabichou is formed in a cylindrical shape which is called a \"bonde\", per the shape of the bunghole of a wine barrel. and is aged for 10 to 20 days. It is the only goat cheese that is soft ripened allowed by Protected Designation of Origin regulations to be produced using pasteurized milk. Chabichou is very white and smooth, and flexible to the palate, with a fine caprine odor.\n\nHistory\nThe legend of Chabichou goes back to 732, at the time of the defeat of the Arabs in the area, in the 8th century, after the Battle of Poitiers. Many of them left the area but some settled there with their families and, in particular, their goat herds. The countryside was appropriate for grazing the \"poor man's cow\", as the pastures were excellent. The cheese was then named cheblis (\"goat\", in Arabic), which would become \"chabichou\" thereafter. However, the domestication of the goat in this area is supposed to date back to Roman colonization, and extends up to the present.\n\nLe Chabichou du Poitou\nChabichou du Poitou, made exclusively in the north of Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, acquired its AOC status in 1990  with the assistance of the efforts of Ségolène Royal. It is known for its characteristic label. Its production rose to 555 tons in 2003.\nSince 1782, Chabichou du Poitou has been mentioned in the French \"Guide du voyageur à Poitiers et aux environs\". When regional wine production slowed in the late 1800s due to the European phylloxera crisis, production of Chabichou increased; production increased again with the development of the cooperative dairies (1906 in Bougon).\n\nThe AOC production zone is limited to an area south of Haut-Poitou: the south of Vienne, the Deux-Sèvres and the north of the Charente.\nSee the official website of Chabichou du Poitou at http://www.chabichou-du-poitou.eu.\n\nManufacture\nChabichou of Poitou is made of fresh and whole goat's milk. It is quickly but slightly pressurized: less than 100 microliters per liter of milk. They then let the milk coagulate during a 24-hour period between 20 and 22 °C. This curd is then moulded manually with a ladle or mixer into perforated and truncated moulds and left to drain for another 18 to 24 hours while turning it over it two or three times, maintaining it at 22 °C. Afterwards, they are removed from the moulds and salted with dry salt or sometimes in a brine bath. It is then laid out in drying rooms, i.e. it is drained while being placed in moulds for 24 to 48 hours. Afterwards it is left to mature in cellars at between 10 and 12 °C and within 80% to 90% humidity. It remains there for at least 10 days, but generally for two or three weeks. Some are even preserved for months for a more vigorous flavor.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 2:\nLoire Valley\nThe Loire Valley (French: Val de Loire, pronounced [val də lwaʁ]; Breton: Traoñ al Liger), spanning 280 kilometres (170 mi), is a valley located in the middle stretch of the Loire river in central France, in both the administrative regions Pays de la Loire and Centre-Val de Loire. The area of the Loire Valley comprises about 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi). It is referred to as the Cradle of the French and the Garden of France due to the abundance of vineyards, fruit orchards (such as cherries), and artichoke, and asparagus fields, which line the banks of the river. Notable for its historic towns, architecture, and wines, the valley has been inhabited since the Middle Palaeolithic period. The oldest known Neanderthal engravings have been found a cave in La Roche-Cotard which have been dated to more than 57,000 years ago. In 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the Loire River valley to its list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nGeography and climate\nThe valley includes historic towns such as Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Montsoreau, Orléans, Saumur, and Tours.\nThe climate is favorable most of the year, the river often acting as a line of demarcation in France's weather between the northern climate and the southern. The river has a significant effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding a few degrees of temperature. The climate can be cool with springtime frost while wine harvest months may have rain. Summers are hot; however, influences from the Atlantic moderate the temperature with breezes.\n\nWine\nThe Loire Valley wine region is one of the world's most well-known areas of wine production and includes several French wine regions situated along the river, from the Muscadet region on the Atlantic coast to the regions of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé just southeast of the city of Orléans in north-central France. Loire wines tend to exhibit a characteristic fruitiness with fresh, crisp flavors.\n\nCulture\nOn 2 December 2000, UNESCO added the central part of the river valley, between Chalonnes-Sur-Loire and Sully-sur-Loire, to its list of World Heritage Sites. In choosing this area that includes the French départements of Loiret, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, and Maine-et-Loire, the committee said that the Loire Valley is: \"an exceptional cultural landscape, of great beauty, comprised of historic cities and villages,  great architectural monuments - the châteaux - and lands that have been cultivated and shaped by centuries of interaction between local populations and their physical environment, in particular the Loire itself.\"The Loire Valley chansonniers are a related group of songbooks attributed to the composers of the Loire Valley and are the earliest surviving examples of a new genre that offered a combination of words, music, and illuminations.A new Contemporary Art offer is developing all along the Loire River from Montsoreau to Orléans with such places as Château de Montsoreau-Contemporary Art Museum, CCCOD Tours, the Domaine Régional de Chaumont sur Loire and the Frac Centre Orléans. They are a rare association of Renaissance architecture with contemporary art.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architectural heritage in the valley's historic towns is notable, especially its châteaux, such as the  Château d'Amboise, Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, Château de Chambord, Château de Chenonceau, Château de Chinon, Château de Montsoreau, Château du Rivau, Château d'Ussé, and Château de Villandry. The châteaux, numbering more than three hundred, include the necessary castle fortifications built in the 10th century but also the splendour of those built half a millennium later. When the French kings began constructing their huge châteaux here, the nobility, not wanting or even daring to be far from the seat of power, followed suit. Their presence in the lush, fertile valley began attracting the very best landscape designers. In addition to its many châteaux, the cultural monuments illustrate to an exceptional degree the ideals of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment on western European thought and design. Many of the châteaux were designed to be built on the top of hills, one example of this is the Château d'Amboise. Many of the châteaux had extremely detailed and expensive churches on the grounds, or within the actual château itself.\n\nEconomy\nThe European Commission reported that in 2016, three categories accounted for most of the economy in the Pays-de-la-Loire region: services (including tourism) provided 66.7% of employment, industry 26.5% and agriculture, 3.9%. The unemployment rate was 8.8%. In 2015, the region ranked eighth in France in terms of economic performance producing 5.0% of the gross domestic product. Important economic sectors included leather goods, textile, shipyard/construction and aeronautics, agriculture and food-processing as well as the plastics industry. The EC did not produce a report for the larger Loire Valley region.\nAccording to another source, tourism in the Loire Valley was supported by over 700 hotels and 550 restaurants in the region. In addition to the chateaux and some 700 other listed Historic monuments, attractions included three Regional nature Parks, 550 km of cycling tracks, 800 listed Historic monuments, over 100 museums and 30 golf courses.In April 2019, The Guardian's travel section included one Loire Valley location in its list of 20 of the most beautiful villages in France: Montrésor, \"a fairytale village with a rich history\" evidenced by \"the wool market, the Halle de Cardeux, ... the 16th-century Logis du Chancelier, ... a riverside walk, Balcons de l'Indrois, [and] ... Jardinier Bridge\".According to a 2017 report by CNN, the 42 chateaux that make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site receive over 3.3 million visitors per year. The Daily Telegraph newspaper (2014) listed the following as the premiere chateaux for tourists: Chinon, Cité royale de Loches, Chaumont, Blois, Meung, Chenonceau, Rivau, Lemeré, Amboise, Clos Lucé, Amboise, Chambord, Villandry and Valençay.\n\nSee also\nOrléans\nPassage 3:\nBerber cuisine\nThe Berber cuisine (Arabic: المطبخ البربري), though lacking a singular and standardized culinary framework, encompasses a diverse range of traditional dishes and influenced by the numerous flavours from distinct regions across North Africa. There is no consistent Berber cuisine, and it has been exposed to various influences. Berbers' meal choices were shaped by local availability of foods and personal finances. Berbers follow the same dietary laws and hygiene requirements as other Muslims. Ken Albala noted that \"Describing meals as typically Berber is impossible–at best, they are samples of what is eaten in different regions by Berber families\".Berber cuisine differs from one area to another within North Africa and West Africa (Mauritania). For this reason, every dish has a distinct and unique identity and taste according to the specific region it originates from in North Africa, with some dishes estimated to be more than a thousand years old. Zayanes of the region of Khénifra around the Middle Atlas have a cuisine of a remarkable simplicity. It is based primarily on corn, barley, ewe's milk, goat cheese, butter, honey, meat, and game.\n\nSee also\nMoroccan cuisine\nLibyan cuisine\nMauritanian cuisine\nBerber culture\nPassage 4:\nCrottin de Chavignol\nCrottin de Chavignol is a goat cheese produced in the Loire Valley. This cheese is the claim to fame for the village of Chavignol, France, which has only two hundred inhabitants.\n\nHistory\nThe small cylindrical goat cheese from the area around Chavignol has been produced since the 16th century, but the earliest extant written record dates from 1829 when its name and brief details of the cheese were recorded by a tax inspector.The etymology is dubious: the word crot described a small oil lamp made from burned clay, which resembles the mould used to prepare the cheese. Another explanation is that old Crottin gets harder and browner and tends to look like dung, the French word for an animal dropping being crotte.\n\nQuality control\nProtected by the AOC Seal, Crottin de Chavignol is produced today with traditional methods. If a cheese is labelled \"Crottin de Chavignol\", it has to be from the area around Chavignol, and it has to meet the stringent AOC production criteria.\n\nFlavour and age\nCrottin de Chavignol is subtle and slightly nutty. In its youth (Chavignol jeune), its dough is solid and compact, and its rind is white. As it ripens (Chavignol bleuté), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. With full maturity (Chavignol affiné), the dough becomes crumbly and the mould on the rind matures into a bluish colour. The cheese is marketed and eaten at all three stages of maturity.\n\nRecipes\nA classic dish is baked Crottin de Chavignol on a green salad. The dish is said to go well with a Sancerre wine from its home region. Although commonly served as a baked starter, Chavignol is also often found cold as a component element of a cheese board selection.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 5:\nLaura Chenel\nLaura Chenel (born 1948–1949) is a cheese maker who was America's first commercial producer of goat cheese, and helped to popularize goat cheese in America. In 1979, she began producing chèvre in the Bay Area town of Sebastopol, California, after a fact-finding trip to visit goat cheese producers in France. After several months of working to sell her product to local markets (with mixed success, due to American unfamiliarity with goat cheeses at the time), she received her first major opportunity when Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California placed a standing order for her cheese in 1980. Waters listed the cheese by name on her menu (as \"Laura Chenel's Chèvre\", in what may have been the first American instance of goat cheese salad), which provided Chenel with a great deal of publicity. Eventually, her operation would grow to sell over two million pounds of cheese per year. The company primarily manufactures fresh chèvre, although aged cheeses make up roughly 10% of its business. In 2006, Chenel sold the company to the Rians Group fr, a French corporation which has purchased multiple small farming operations, while retaining ownership of her herd of five hundred goats.\n\nSee also\nList of cheesemakers\nPassage 6:\nPiute Pass Archeological District\nThe Piute Pass Archeological District is an archaeological district located along Piute Creek in eastern San Bernardino County, California. The district encompasses the area around the historic Fort Piute and includes a variety of prehistoric and historic resources. The Piute Pass area was inhabited by several Native American tribes dating back to the middle Holocene epoch. The Patayan people lived in the area during the late prehistoric period, while the Chemehuevi people lived there after the Patayan and through the early historic period. Both groups left petroglyphs in the area, and remains of Chemehuevi habitation sites have also been discovered. After European settlers came to the region, the pass became the site of Fort Piute, a U.S. Army redoubt which protected travelers along the Mojave Road.The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973.\nPassage 7:\nSantarém cheese\nSantarém is a goat cheese from Portugal produced in several different regions, most notably in the Santarém district and in Serra de Santo António in the Ribatejo province of Portugal. It is considered to taste best ripe after aging, in servings of between 50 grams to 100 grams. Best production practices call for its being preserved in good quality edible oil.\n\nSee also\nList of goat milk cheeses\nPassage 8:\nQueijo de Cabra Transmontano\nQueijo de Cabra Transmontano (Transmontano Goat's Cheese) is a type of cheese made from goat milk (goat cheese) from Alto Trás-os-Montes, Norte Region, Portugal. It has a Protected designation of origin (PDO) and is listed on the Ark of Taste.\nPassage 9:\nTine (company)\nTINE SA (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈtìːnə]) is the largest Norwegian dairy product cooperative consisting of around 15,000 farmers and 5,600 employees. As of 2013, it has a revenue of 20.4 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK) ($3.41bn, £2.04bn, €2.50bn). The parent company, TINE SA, is a cooperative society owned by its suppliers, the milk producers who deliver milk to the company. The corporation domestically offers the entire spectrum of dairy products, and in many dairy categories, Tine faces little or no domestic competition. This monopolistic position has led to criticism of Tine when shortages occur. Tine's internationally known products are Jarlsberg cheese, Snøfrisk goat cheese, Heidal cheese, Ridder cheese, and Ski-Queen (geitost). Tine is the most dominant of the thirteen agricultural cooperatives in Norway.\n\nHistory\nDairy cooperatives in Norway go back to 1856, with the first nationwide dairy co-op Den Norske Meieriforening (the Norwegian Dairy Association) being founded in 1881.  The company dates back to 1928, when \"Norske Meieriers Eksportlag\" (Norwegian Dairies' Export Company) was started. It changed its name to \"Norske Meieriers Salgssentral\" (Norwegian Dairies' Sales) in 1942, and to \"Norske Meierier\" (Norwegian Dairies) in 1984. The Tine name has been used as an easily identifiable brand name since 1992 for the company's dairy products.  In 2008, Tine was ranked the world's #1 cooperative by size by the International Cooperative Alliance. In 2010, the company was changed to a nationwide group adapted to the Cooperatives Act, which was introduced from 2008, and the name was changed to TINE SA. TINE SA is one of the 13 farmer-owned nationwide cooperatives that are members of the interest organization Norsk Landbrukssamvirke.\nThe \"tine\" is a traditional Norwegian wooden container, not unlike the Shaker-style pantry box, which could be used to keep butter and cheese fresh.\n\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries which are partly or fully owned by Tine:\nDiplom-Is, Scandinavia's largest ice-cream producer (100% owned by Tine)\nFjordland, a ready-made food company (51% owned by Tine)\nNorseland Ltd., Ireland and the United Kingdom division (100% owned by Tine)\nNorseland Inc., distributes and markets Tine's cheeses in Canada and the United States (100% owned by Tine)\nSunniva, produces and distributes juice and soft drinks in Norway (100% owned by Tine)\nOsteCompagniet, sells and markets expensive cheeses in Norway (100% owned by Tine)\nWernersson Ost, sells and markets domestic and international cheeses in Sweden and Denmark (100% owned by Tine)\nPassage 10:\nFlor de Guía cheese\nFlor de Guía cheese is a Spanish cheese (Spanish: Queso de Flor de guía) made on the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It has Denomination of Origin protection. The cheese is classified as fatty or semi-fatty and made from the milk from Canarian sheep, with milk from Canarian cows and/or goats. The milk from the sheep must constitute at least 60% and  cows’ milk content must never exceed 40%. Goat milk must never exceed 10% of the mixture. The cheese is presented in flat cylindrical cheeses which normally measure 4–8 cm (1.5-3 inches) high and 20–30 cm (8-12 inches) across and weighing between 2 and 5 kg (4.5-11 pounds). The cheese gets its name from an area in northern Gran Canaria called Santa María de Guía, where the cheese is made, and ‘flor’ from the fact that juice from the flowerheads of a species of cardoon and globe artichoke are used to curdle the milk.\n\nManufacture\nThe cheese is made in three varieties:\n\n“Flor de Guía”, which uses only the juice of the flowerheads of the cardoon in the coagulation.\n“Half Flor de Guía” (Sp: media Flor de guía) which uses 50% cardoon juice and 50% globe artichoke flower juice to coagulate the milk.\n“Guía cheese” which uses some vegetable coagulant and some animal coagulant, usually rennet from young goats or from lambs.In addition, the cheeses can be classified as semi-cured and cured, according to the length of maturation.\nThe cheese is made only in the neighbouring municipalities of Santa María de Guía, Moya and Gáldar and is seasonal in production only being manufactured between January and July.\n\nThe milk is provided by sheep which are kept on open terrain, free to move to new pastures within the designated geographical area. Their food is largely wild plants and grass supplemented by concentrates when necessary. The cows are kept stabled for most of the year but when conditions are favourable they are tethered in open pasture. The goats are grazed on fenced land within the specified area and gathered in at night. The animals may be milked mechanically or manually. The former are conditions of the Spanish Denomination of Origin.The curdling medium may be vegetable or animal depending on the type of cheese being made. Salt is added to the milk but not exceeding 30 grams (1.1 oz) per 100 litres (galls) of milk. For Flor cheese, the vegetable rennet (liquid extract of the cardoon) is added when the milk has been heated to between 28 °C and 35 °C and maintained for 60 to 90 minutes. For Half-Flor cheese the curdling agent must be 50% cardoon juice and 50% another vegetable or authorized rennet. It is heated to 28–38 °C and maintained for a maximum of 1 hour. For Guía cheese the rennet used may be animal, vegetable or chemical or a mixture. The milk is heated to 30–38 °C and maintained for as long as an analysis shows it to be ready.The curd is then cut to the size of between rice grains and chickpeas with the typical lyres. It stands and drains and is then put into moulds for pressing. The pressing and moulding may be done manually or mechanically. The moulds for Flor de guía cheese have marks on their interiors to impart the geometric shape of a flower on the rind. Salt is sprinkled lightly on the face of the cheese in addition to the previously added salt. The cheese remains inside the ring-mould for 24 hours. It must then be matured for a minimum of 15 days and may be matured up to 60 days. During this time the cheeses are turned regularly and smoothed to improved their appearance. They may also be oiled with olive oil or some other vegetable oil. The older cheeses may have pimentón or gofio applied to the exterior. Any products used on the exterior of the cheese must be indicated on the packing.\n\nFlavour\nOverall the flavour is of dairy products with a saltiness, varying slightly according to the milks used. It does not have a very intense flavour, a creaminess and sometimes can be a little acid or spicy.\n\nTexture\nThe texture is dense and without cavities. It can vary between firm and soft depending on its maturation. The colour is from ivory-white to yellow, depending on its age.\n\nRind\nThe rind can vary in colour from dark brown in long-matured cheeses to an ivory-white to cream on the less matured cheeses. The thickness of the rind depends on the maturation, a medium thick rind on older cheeses and a very thin rind on the less matured specimens. There may or may not be a flower design on the top face of the cheese.", "answers": ["Middle Palaeolithic period"], "length": 3618, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "742da520ae9d71cce87bd2fe8b9e1f379159e6d8aa5b9e76"}

He is the current Oceanian and Australian record holder in the 100 metres with a time of 9.93 seconds, which he achieved in Mito, Japan, on 5 May 2003. With that time he became the first person not of African ancestry to break the 10-second barrier (Frankie Fredericks, a Namibian, had been the first non-West-African in 1991). The time made him the 17th fastest man in history at the time and 38th man to crack the 10-second barrier. He was regarded as the fastest man of non-African descent before Christophe Lemaitre ran 9.92 seconds in French National Championships in Albi on 29 July 2011.He reached the finals in both the 100 and 200 metres at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and the 200m final in the 2005 World Championships, where he finished 6th.

At that time De Beers was continuing to pay off its \"$1 billion investment to build the mine and from now until it closes, the company expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalties.\" The mine completed mining and processing in 2019 and has moved to a shut-down phase including demolition of infrastructure and rehabilitation of the site.\n\nHistory\nDe Beers started looking for Kimberlite Pipes within Canada in the 1960s. \"The Victor Mine was developed within a cluster of 16 kimberlite pipes that were discovered in the James Bay Lowlands near Attawapiskat in 1987.\"  In 1995 the pipes of the James Bay Lowland area were re-examined and interest was renewed in the Victor Mine Project. The cost feasibility of mining Victor diamonds was done in 2002. In 2005, the Project gained approval after an environmental assessment by the Federal and Provincial government and soon after construction began. In 2007, the Moose Cree First Nations peoples signed in favour of the Victor mine and the first successful productions of diamonds began. June 20, 2008, Victor Mine entered the production phase. De Beers celebrated its opening July 26 and reached an agreement with the Government of Ontario to allow up to 10% of the mine's production to be available to the cutting and polishing industry in Ontario. In October 2009, the Victor Mine was voted “Mine of the year” by readers of the international trade publication called Mining Magazine.\n\nGeology\nThe area is composed of 18 kimberlite pipes of the Attawapiskat kimberlite field, 16 of which are diamondiferous, the Victor Mine sits on top of the Victor pipe and mines from Victor Main and Victor Southwest which have appeared close enough to the surface to be used in an open-pit mine. The Victor Kimberlite is a composition of pyroclastic crater facies and hypabyssal facies, and is considered to have a highly variable diamond grade.\n\nMining\nIt is an open-pit mine; the equipment there is 100 tonne trucks, large front-end loaders, bulldozers and other necessary support equipment used in the mining operation. The annual production rate is 2.7 million tonnes a year, which comes to about 600,000 carats a year in diamond grade.\n\nOperations\nThere is year-round access via air travel and only seasonal access over land depending on whether the weather permits travel. On the property are warehouses for storage, a processing plant, workshops, offices, fuel storage facilities, pit-dewatering machinery and an airstrip (the Victor Mine Aerodrome) for travel needs. The site also has recreational and dorm buildings for the permanent staff. The life of the mine is expected to be twelve years and the total project life is seventeen years and each year the processing plan is designed to treat 2.5 million tonnes of kimberlite per year (roughly 7100 tonnes a day).\n\nTom Ormsby, director of external and corporate affairs for De Beers Canada claims that the great colour (whiteness), natural shapes, clearness and quality of the Victor diamonds ranks them with the highest stones in the world.\"Victor is forecasted to have a 17-year cradle-to-grave life. That includes construction, an estimated 12 years of operation and then winding down to closure and rehabilitation of the site.\"\n\nPerformance\nThe mine had produced at a high level of performance leading to \"[f]urther exploration of the site\" with the \"hope that De Beers will uncover another source of diamonds within close proximity of the existing operation.\" 826,000 carats were mined at Victor Mine in 2010 and \"$93 million was spent on goods and services and $49 million (53 per cent) was supplied by Aboriginal businesses.\"\"No corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes were paid in 2010 as the company was in a loss position for tax purposes.\" However, De Beers Canada \"injected approximately $474,900,000 into the Canadian economy in 2010\" through both mines, Snap Lake and Victor Mines.In 2011, De Beers paid total wages and benefits of about $55.5 million to Victor employees. According to the Ontario Mining Association, in 2011 \"$101 million was spent on goods and services\" by De Beers \"with about $57 million, or 57%, being provided by Aboriginal businesses.\"\n\nExploration\nTom Ormsby, claimed that \"The high quality of the Victor diamonds and the vastness of the Canadian shield points to great potential for another diamond mine being developed in northeastern Ontario.\" The \"Canadian Shield has great potential to host diamonds\" and potential in Canada \"appears to be at least twice as good as what southern Africa has held for potential for diamonds.\"\"There are approximately eight years remaining on the forecast life of mine for Victor.  In efforts to keep things going and extend this time frame, advanced exploration is currently underway at Victor on 15 previously identified diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.\"\n\nEnvironmental and human concerns\nSo far, De Beers Canada employees and its contract partners have safely worked more than four million hours without a Lost Time Injury. Other human concerns are the mine's impact on the First Nations people and the company's pledge to help promote community growth will affect certain communities more than others.Concerns were brought up regarding the mine's impact on the surrounding area. Since it is an open pit mine it would disturb the natural environment. The impact area is 5,000 hectares of land. The first concern was raised in 2005, when environmental groups called on the Ontario government to perform its own environmental impact assessment aside from the Federal one as it was believed the Federal assessment did not fully assess the situation, including long term harm on the wildlife, wilderness and the water systems found there. However, the Project did receive an ISO 14001 certification.The environmental assessment process was later criticized for its restricted scope, namely for focusing primarily on the Attawapiskat First Nation, and largely excluding other potentially affected First Nations.\n\nAttawapiskat First Nation\nDe Beers Victor Diamond Mine is on Attawapiskat First Nation traditional land. An Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) was signed with community leaders in 2005 with Danny Metatawabin, acting as coordinator for the Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) between De Beers and Attawapiskat. Community members later protested the agreement through demonstrations and roadblocks claiming that the community's share of the \"bounty from the mine isn't getting back to the community.\" De Beers has negotiated a lease area. Although it is acknowledged that the mine is on Attawapiskat traditional land, the royalties from Victor Mine flow to the Government of Ontario, not Attawapiskat First Nation. As of 2015, De Beers was paying up to $2 million per year to Attawapiskat.  That payment is split between a trust fund controlled by the chief and council and the rest, which is used for community development and to pay Attawapiskat members who manage the band’s impact benefit agreement with De Beers, says Attawapiskat member Charlie Hookimaw.\nThe trust fund now totals $13 million. In 2014, the community received about $1 million; $480,000 went to business relations and $545,868 was spent on community development, Hookimaw says. They have 500 full-time employees with 100 from Attawapiskat First Nation. De Beers also employs Attawapiskat First Nation in winter road construction. The \"mine employs 100 people from Attawapiskat at any one time. It generates about $400 million in annual revenue for the company.\" Sub-contractors from Attawapiskat First Nation also work for the mine.\"A federal review of the relationship between De Beers' Victor mine and Attawapiskat showed that government support for training and capacity did not start soon enough to deal with the huge lack of skills in the First Nation.\"\"Training is carried out on a year-round basis at the Victor Mine site as well as at the De Beers Canada Training Facility in Attawapiskat.\"\n\nSee also\nDe Beers\nList of diamond mines\nLake Timiskaming kimberlite field\nNorthern Ontario\nPassage 2:\nDry Fork Mine\nThe Dry Fork mine is a coal mine located 8 miles north of Gillette, Wyoming in the United States in the coal-rich Powder River Basin. The mine is an open pit mine that utilizes truck and shovel mining method to mine a low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal that is used for domestic energy generation and shipped to customers via railroad. In 2011, the mine began supplying coal to the newly constructed Dry Fork power station that was constructed adjacent to the mine. The mine is currently owned and operated by Western Fuels Association.As of 2009, Dry Fork had reserves of 330 mm tons of sub-bituminous coal and a maximum permitted production capacity of 15mm tons per year. Typical annual production has been in 5.2mm ton range for the last several years though. In 2008, the mine produced just over 5.2 million short tons of coal, making it the 37th-largest producer of coal in the United States.The average quality of the coal shipped from Dry Fork is 8,050-8,200 BTU/lb, 0.20-0.42% Sulfur, 3.8-5.1% Ash, and 1.50% Sodium (of the ash). Train loading operations at the mine are done with a batch weigh bin system that is coupled to a \"weigh-in-motion\" track scale system. Silo capacity at the mine's rail loop, which can accommodate a single unit train, is 10,800 tons.\n\nHistory\nThe Dry Fork mine shipped its first coal to members of the Western Fuels Association in 1990 and is run by Western Fuels-Wyoming an associate of Western Fuels. Since opening, Dry Fork has shipped 69.5mm tons of coal.\n\nProduction\nPassage 3:\nTundra Mine\nThe Tundra Mine is a gold mine that operated in the Northwest Territories, of Canada between 1962 and 1968, producing 104,476 troy ounces (3,249.6 kg) of gold, from 187,714 tons of ore. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has a project to remediate the Tundra Mine site under their Northern Contaminants Program, funded by the Canadian Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan.\n\nExternal links\nTundra Mine: Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\nPassage 4:\nFranklin-Creighton Mine\nThe Franklin-Creighton Mine was a Georgia Gold Rush gold mine located off what is now Yellow Creek Road in the town of Ball Ground in Cherokee County, Georgia.  The mine, located along the Etowah River, was initially known as the Franklin Mine because it was started by a widow, Mrs. Mary G. Franklin, who obtained a 40-acre (160,000 m2) lot in the Gold Lottery of 1832.   Around 1883, the mine became known as the Creighton Mine or the Franklin-Creighton Mine.  This mine was one of the most productive and continued to operate many years after other area mines had ceased operations.  Some estimate that it was yielding $1000 per day in 1893 and others place its total production after 1880 at as much as $1,000,000.  The mine was shut down in 1913 as a result of a collapsed shaft which caused the mine to flood. As of 2022, only three major structures exist: The stamping mill's concrete foundation (which has been rebuilt into a pavilion for the nearby housing development site), the Franklin residence and doctor's office, and the \"Shingle House,\" the mine's former post office and general store.\n\nSources\nA Brief History of Cherokee County (accessed December 4, 2006)\nGeorgia Historical Marker – Cherokee County Gold (accessed December 4, 2006)\nPassage 5:\nTundra Mine/Salamita Mine Aerodrome\nTundra Mine/Salamita Mine Aerodrome (TC LID: CTM7) is a registered aerodrome that served the Tundra and Salmita Mines in the Northwest Territories, Canada.\nPassage 6:\nRaspadskaya coal mine\nThe Raspadskaya Coal Mine is a coal mine located in Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia. It is the largest coal and the largest underground mine in Russia. The mine was opened in 1973 and its construction was completed in 1977. In addition to the main underground mine, the mining complex also includes MUK-96 underground mine, Raspadskaya Koksovaya underground mine, and Razrez Raspadsky open-pit mine, as also the Raspadskaya preparation plant. The mine is the largest coal mine in Russia.Raspadskaya's total resources were estimated at 1,461 million tons and total coal reserves at 782 million ton (JORC standards, according to IMC Consulting report as of June 2006, of which 22 million tons produced by 31 March 2008). Based on the volume produced in 2007, reserves-to-production ratio amounts to about 55 years of production. The complex produces 10% of Russia's coking coal.The mine is owned and operated by Raspadskaya OAO, a Russian publicly listed coal company.\nIn March 2001, a methane explosion killed four miners and injured six. The mine was shut down for two weeks in 2008 due to safety violations and a worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010. On 8 May 2010, an explosion occurred killing 66 workers.In 2022, a remote sensing satellite found that the mine was releasing 87 metric tons, or 95 short tons, of methane each hour. Scientists who study methane leakage said the size was unprecedented. By contrast, the worst rate that occurred at the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California was 60 metric tons an hour.\nPassage 7:\nSalmita Mine\nThe Salmita Mine was a gold producer in the Northwest Territories, Canada during 1983 to 1987. The deposit was first discovered in 1945 and underground exploration was carried out in 1951–1952. It was reactivated for exploration by Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited in 1975 and entered production in 1983. They used the old camp and milling plant of the abandoned Tundra Mine, located a few kilometres to the south. The mine produced 179,906 troy ounces (5,595.7 kg) of gold from the milling of 238,177 tons of ore.\nThe area is now owned by Seabridge Gold.\nPassage 8:\nColomac Mine\nThe Colomac Mine was a privately owned and operated open pit gold mine located 200 km northwest of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories in Canada . The Colomac mine operated between 1990–1992, and 1994–1997. It was operated by Neptune Resources Limited that had little success in making a profit during its operation. In 1994, the mine had reopened under Royal Oak Mines Inc. Both Neptune Resources and Royal Oak Mines where both owned and operated by Peggy Witte.  Due to low gold prices and high cost of mining, Royal Oak Mines was forced into bankruptcy. The Federal Government of Canada became owners of the mine, along with the related environmental issues. A major cleanup effort was completed to prevent the mine from polluting the environment. On January 26, 2012, Nighthawk Gold Corporation completed an agreement to acquire 100% of the mineral claims and leases of the former producing Colomac Gold Mine and surrounding mineral leases (Colomac Property), from then Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) now Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC). The Colomac Property lies within the central portion of Nighthawk Gold’s 930 square kilometre property. Nighthawk Gold has since been responsibly exploring and advancing the Colomac Gold Project with the goal to restart gold mining operations in the future, assuming positive economics and the receipt of operating permits.\n\nProduction\nThe Colomac Mine processed a total of almost 12,300 Megagrams of ore, and produced 16.7 Megagrams (535,708 troy ounces) of gold, with an approximate value of $916 million. This figure is based on 2012 gold prices, averaging close to USD $55,000 per kg.\nIn April 2007, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada engaged the Professional Services company Deloitte & Touche LLP to become their solicitor, in order to find another independently-owned and -operated company to acquire the idle mine as well as the resources on the land it occupied. To generate interest, they featured the mine as  holding 6.6 Teragrams of untapped resources, a gold processing mill and related equipment, a maintenance building, a dorm room styled housing complex, power and fuel storage facilities, and mobile equipment (rock trucks, excavators and loaders). It was also featured on the popular reality television show Ice Road Truckers.\n\nCleanup\nAfter being shut down in 1997 and abandoned shortly after by Royal Oak Mines, it transferred into the Canadian Government's hands and responsibility in mid-December 1999. In accordance with water licensing laws and regulations in Canada, Royal Oak Mines had posted a $1.5 million security deposit and in 1999 they were charged with cyanide dumping by the Federal Government. The government of Canada had estimated the cost of the cleanup at $70 million due to high levels of cyanide and ammonia content, as well as acid mine drainage.\nFor the people of Indian Lake the tailing pond owned by the mine was at one stage threatening to overflow unless immediate action was taken to prevent a disastrous environmental impact.  A public hearing was called to cancel the mines' license and to begin a cleanup.\nIn 1999, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) awarded a one-year, $2 million contract to a consortium of aboriginal businesses from DetonÇho Corporation, the Dogrib Rae Band and the North Slave Métis Alliance to undertake final reclamation activities at the Colomac Mine. The consortium conducted studies into contamination and took responsibility for on-going environmental monitoring and maintenance of the site. After the contract was awarded, Royal Oak Mine was finally charged under the Water Act and the Fisheries Act for the pollution it had  caused, this was much too late, since the company was already in receivership.\nAccording to MineWatch Canada in a 2001 publication:\n\"Now, the water license has not been changed, the money needed to clean-up the site is not forthcoming, and the Dogribs are faced with a potential catastrophe if the tailings pond overflows. Says Dogrib leader Ted Blondin: \"I think there is a fiduciary responsibility that the federal government has to looking after the Dogrib interests, and these are the arguments that we will use towards ensuring that the quality of water and the work that has to be done for the cleanup is done.\"During the initial cleanup phase, many new and effective remediation procedures where developed and put into place, including the use of farmed micro-organisms to remove hydrocarbons from soil contaminated by poor management of the fuel tank farm located on site.\nOn 25 February 2010 a $19 million contract was awarded to two aboriginal firms, Tlicho Engineering/Environmental Services Ltd and Aboriginal Engineering Ltd for a final two year remediation contract, which will also create local jobs in the area. According to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada this two year remediation will cover:\n\"final remediation of the site, including: major demolition activities (primary and secondary crushing facilities, mill complex, maintenance shop and camp); hydrocarbon remediation (restoration of Steeve's Lake shoreline, free product recovery and soil treatment); site restoration (Truck Lake channel construction, stream crossing restoration) and capping of the non-hazardous landfill sites as well as continued provision of site services and maintenance. The contract, which follows a competitive process, will last until April of 2012 when the companies will conduct a full and final demobilization of the site.\"\nIn May 2010, officials suspended the remediation project due to an accident, which occurred at mine in April 2010. It occurred after a foremen working for Aboriginal Engineering Ltd suffered leg injuries after a 2.5 cm cable snapped. Human Resources and Skills Canada announced in May 2010 that they would not allow this remediation to continue until Aboriginal Engineering Ltd set out to implement the standards for health and safety set out by the Federal Government in relation to this type of task.\nPassage 9:\nMurowa diamond mine\nThe Murowa diamond mine is a diamond mine located in Mazvihwa, south central Zimbabwe, about 40 kilometres from the asbestos mining town of Zvishavane in the Midlands province. The mine is majority owned and operated by the Rio Tinto Group, which also owns the Argyle diamond mine in Australia and part of the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada. The mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD and mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne.\n\nGeology of the Deposit\nMurowa consists of three north-trending kimberlite pipes, intrusive into the Chivi suite granites of the Zimbabwe Craton. The kimberlites have been dated at 500 Ma.\n\nHistory\nThe Murowa site's possibilities were first realized in 1997 when three diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes were discovered; over a period of three years of study, the two larger pipes have been determined to be economically feasible as mines. Construction of mine facilities was completed in late 2004. Preparation for mining included the forced relocation of 926 people living on the mine site to six farms purchased by a government relocation program. Limited mining operations began in Murowa in 2004, with full capacity expected to be reached sometime in 2005, although permitting problems have slowed progress toward this milestone. Full-scale production is expected to process 200,000 tonnes of ore annually, although it is possible to push production to as much as one million tonnes annually through further capital investment.\nThe mine is a combination of open pit and underground construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD. Current estimates of mine reserves are 19 million tonnes of ore, with an ore grade of 0.9 carats (180 mg) per tonne. Rio Tinto estimates that over the life of the mine, prices for the Murowa's production will fetch an average price of $65 USD per carat (325 $/g).\nPassage 10:\nNegus Mine\nNegus Mine was a gold producer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, from 1939 to 1952. It produced 255,807 troy ounces (7,956.5 kg) of gold from 490,808 tons of ore milled. The underground workings were acquired by adjacent Con Mine in 1953 and were used for ventilation purposes until Con Mine closed in 2003.", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 3708, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "63dbf610a548f46c6ab48873e867d8ac279baed6641602e2"}
{"input": "Which genus is native to arid or semi-desert areas, Alopecurus or Echeveria?", "context": "Passage 1:\nEcheveria\nEcheveria is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert areas of Central America, Mexico and northwestern South America.\n\nDescription\nPlants may be evergreen or deciduous. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves. Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes. Often numerous offsets are produced, and are commonly known as \"hen and chicks\", which can also refer to other genera, such as Sempervivum, that are significantly different from Echeveria. Many species of Echeveria serve important environmental roles, such as those of host plants for butterflies. For example, the butterfly Callophrys xami uses several species of Echeveria, such as Echevelia gibbiflora, for suitable host plants. Even more, these plants are integral to the oviposition process of C. xami and some other butterfly species as well.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by A. P. de Candolle in 1828, and is named after the 18th century Mexican botanical artist Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy. As of June 2018, the genus consists of about 150 species, including genera such as Oliveranthus and Urbinia that have formerly been split off from Echeveria. Molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown the genus not to be monophyletic: species of Echeveria cluster with species of Cremnophila, Graptopetalum, Pachyphytum, and Thompsonella as well as species of Sedum sect. Pachysedum. The former Urbinia species do appear to form a monophyletic group within this grouping. Although it is clear that Echeveria is not monophyletic, its limits are not clear, and further analyses are needed to determine whether and how the genus should be split, or if it should be included in an expanded concept of Sedum.\n\nSpecies\nThe International Crassulaceae Network accepts the following species:\n\nCultivation\nMany Echeveria species are popular as ornamental garden plants. They are drought-resistant, although they do better with regular deep watering and fertilizing. Most will tolerate shade and some frost, although hybrids tend to be less tolerant. Most lose their lower leaves in winter; as a result, after a few years, the plants lose their compact appearance and need to be re-rooted or propagated. In addition, if not removed, the shed leaves may decay, harboring fungus that can then infect the plant.\n\nPropagation\nThey can be propagated easily by separating offsets, but also by leaf cuttings, and by seed if they are not hybrids.\n\nCultivars and Hybrids\nEcheveria has been extensively bred and hybridized. The following is a selection of available plants.\n\nAward winning\nThe following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit:\n\nFormerly in Echeveria\nDudleya – Alwin Berger placed this as a subtaxon of Echeveria, and species within were described as Echeveria.\nGraptopetalum paraguayense (N.E.Br.) E.Walther (as E. weinbergii hort. ex T.B.Sheph.)\nPachyveria clavifolia (as E. clavifolia)\nReidmorania occidentalis (as E. kimnachii)\n\nPhoto gallery\nPassage 2:\nBoscia foetida\nBoscia foetida, commonly known as the stink shepherd's tree and the smelly shepherd's bush, is an evergreen shrub or tree that is native to the warmer and drier parts southern Africa. It is found in semi-desert and arid bushveld, and in the west it occurs commonly in areas which are otherwise sparsely wooded. It is known for the particularly unpleasant smell of its flowers which appear during early spring, to which its specific name foetida alludes. Its freshly cut wood likewise has an unpleasant smell, and has traditional medicinal and magical uses, for instance as a protection against lightning. In central Botswana the village of Mopipi is named after this species.\n\nDescription\nHabit\nIt has several or many stems in the west, but is often single-stemmed in the east. It has a flattish, spreading crown, and is densely branched with some branches ending in spines. In Namibia it is often a shrub measuring about 1 m tall and 3 m wide, but it may also be a tree of up to 3 meters or over. It is similar to the closely related B. albitrunca, which is however distinguishable from most subspecies by its discolorous and distinctly larger leaves, and its smooth fruit. It may also be confused with Maerua parvifolia.\n\nBark\nThe smooth bark is pale grey to grey, with darker bark exposed in the fissures. Young branchlets have grey bark with a plum-coloured underlayer.\n\nFoliage\nThe shortly petiolate leaves are arranged in tight clusters on little knobs. The small, hard leaves usually measure less than 8 mm in length, but rarely up to 13 mm. They are grey-green in colour, concolorous in the west and discolorous in the east, and appear dark green from a distance. Foliage is browsed by game and livestock.\n\nFlowers\nThe small, greenish flowers lack petals but have prominent stamens, and a gynophore which equals the ovary and style in length. They are clustered in axillary racemes or may be reduced to axillary fascicles. They emit a rancid odour, after which the tree is named. Birds may feed on the flowers or use it as nesting material.\n\nFruit\nIt produces abundant globose fruit in summer that ripen to a yellowish or pale-brown colour. They have a velvet-textured exterior, as opposed to those of B. albitrunca, which are smooth. They are about 1 cm in diameter and are eaten by rodents, birds and people. The fruit usually contains a single brown seed.\n\nRange and habitat\nIt occurs in Namibia up to the Kunene region, the Northern Cape, central Botswana to southern Zimbabwe and the Transvaal bushveld and lowveld, eastern Eswatini, KwaZulu-Natal southwards to the Tugela valley, and in southernmost Mozambique. It grows mainly on plains in semi-desert or arid bushveld. It is also present on hillsides, rocky outcrops, termite mounds or along dry river courses. It grows on rocky, stony or gravel substrates in the west, and is absent from sand except where a rocky substrate is present.\n\nSubspecies\nThere are five subspecies:\n\nBoscia foetida subsp. filipes (Gilg) M.C.Lötter – Sandveld shepherd's treeRange: northern Limpopo, northern KZN, eastern Eswatini and southern Mozambique\nDescription: Up to 4 m tall shrub with greyish to yellowish-green bark, leaves 1.2–3.4 cm, somewhat shiny above and dull below, alternate or in fascicles of up to 4, petiole 1–2 mm long, flowers with 6–8 stamens and pedicels up to 7 mmBoscia foetida subsp. foetida Schinz – Stink shepherd's treeRange: Namibia to Northern Cape, South Africa\nDescription: Branches from ground level, leaves very small and concolorous, flowers with 11–15 stamensBoscia foetida subsp. longipedicellata (Gilg) Toelken – Tugela shepherd's treeRange: Tugela valley in central KwaZulu-Natal\nDescription: Single-stemmed up to 1 m, and large-leaved (1–3.5 cm), flowers with 11–15 stamens, long and slender flower stalks (for which it is named)Boscia foetida subsp. minima (Gilg) M.C.Lötter – Dwarf shepherd's treeRange: South Africa. North West province, northern Gauteng, western Limpopo, Tshokwane region of Kruger National Park.\nDescription: Small shrubletBoscia foetida subsp. rehmanniana  (Pestal.) Toelken – Bushveld shepherd's treeRange: Transvaal bushveld, incl. northern Mpumalanga, to central Botswana. Absent from lowveld.\nDescription: Single-stemmed up to 1 m, leaves up to 1.3 cm, flowers with 5–7 stamens\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nOrnithodoros savignyi\nOrnithodoros savignyi, known as sand tampan, African eyed tampan or Kalahari sand tampan, is one of some 37 species in the genus Ornithodoros and is a soft tick with a leathery, mammillated integument, causing paralysis and tampan toxicosis, two unrelated conditions. The sand tampan is an ectoparasite on humans, their livestock and wild animals, including birds and bats. Occurring in semi-desert areas of Africa, Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka and into Asia, it is able to survive for lengthy periods without feeding, spending most of its life burrowed under sand or loose soil, often in wait for animals that rest or sleep under trees or in the lee of rocks, but also in places where people or their animals congregate such as marketplaces, places of worship, cattle kraals and village squares. The timing of its activity is geared to coincide with that of potential hosts, but hot sunny conditions are usually avoided. Because of its habit of feeding and dropping from its host, adult dispersal is limited, whereas larvae may remain attached to their hosts for several days. During its life cycle it will feed on multiple hosts between moults.This species is of interest because of the pathogens it carries, and its salivary apyrases which prevent platelet activation and aggregation, that is, blood-clotting. In humans the tick may cause dermatitis, fever and lymphadenitis. It is also a carrier of Borrelia, a spirochaete bacterium, and is a carrier of a flavivirus causing Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHFV). The closely related Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is endemic to certain regions of India. That AHFV and KFDV diverged some 700 years ago would suggest that unknown tick-borne hemorrhagic/encephalitic viruses may exist between Saudi Arabia and India.Soft ticks of the family Argasidae lack the hard scutum or shield present in hard ticks of the family Ixodidae. Their gnathosoma or mouth structure is located on the underside of the body and is not readily visible. Their feeding method differs from that of the hard ticks in that they do not embed a capitulum in the host, but make an incision through the skin and sip the oozing blood. The feeding lasts up to 30 minutes during which time their body weight may increase as much as tenfold. Sand tampans by their concerted attack in large numbers are able to paralyse and kill sizeable mammals, especially penned livestock, by introducing toxins during feeding, mainly through coxal gland secretions, leading to symptoms similar to those of anaphylactic shock in older animals. These toxins affect the cardiac system, causing Mobitz type atrial-ventricular blocks and ventricular tachycardia. The defensins employed by O. savignyi are being studied for developing multifunctional peptides - shorter peptides derived from the defensin isoform 2 (OsDef2) have useful antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties.Ornithodoros spp are found worldwide in semi-arid regions, living in burrows, caves, dens, cliffsides, and bird colonies. O. savignyi and O. coriaceus are exceptional in having eyes. O. coriaceus occurs under hillside scrub oak from northern California and Nevada to Mexico, in deer beds under trees and in the lee of large rocks. O. gurneyi favours tree-shaded sand in the deserts of Australia, resting places of kangaroos and people. O. porcinus is found on warthogs, bushpigs and other pig species and occurs throughout Africa in suitable habitats - it plays a role in transmitting the virus causing African swine fever which in 2013 was found 35 km north of Pretoria. A salticid spider, Phidippus rimator, has been recorded from northern California as predating Ornithodoros coriaceus and is only the second predator recorded for this species.O. savignyi was named after the zoologist Marie Jules César Lelorgne de Savigny, a contemporary of Jean Victoire Audouin's.\nSince they are attracted by carbon dioxide, dry ice may be used for their collection, or they may be sifted from the soil. Ornithodoros tampans also fluoresce under ultraviolet light.\n\nDistribution\nThe extensive distribution of this species from Africa to Asia strongly suggests anthropogenic origins. \"Dispersal of the ancestral viruses of AHFV and KFDV may have been accomplished through the movement of animals, including camels presumably carrying ticks, along the Silk Road, which by the 1300s stretched from Europe to China.\"\n\nMating behaviour\nThe coxal secretion of adult female ticks, appearing during and after a blood meal, contains a sex pheromone provoking a mating response from males. Mating occurs off the host, hard ticks doing so on the host animal. Females lay a few hundred eggs in several batches, and may do so for several seasons—adults of Ornithodoros erraticus can live for 15–20 years (Encinas Grandes et al. 1993).  There is little seasonal fluctuation in their numbers as their microhabitats are quite stable.\n\nChemical and vaccine control\nAttempted chemical control of tampans by poisoning leads inevitably to their acquiring resistance and immunity to the drugs used. The long-term damage done to the environment by use of such chemicals outweighs any short-term benefits that may accrue. Natural controls in the form of pathogens, predators and parasites are sufficient to curb tampan numbers.\nA final possibility for the control of O. erraticus is the use of tick vaccines, the basic principle of which is to stimulate the host immune system to produce a response which damages feeding ticks (Manzano-Román et al. 2012a). This approach has been successful against hard ticks, and two recombinant anti-hard tick vaccines are currently available commercially (de la Fuente et al. 2007, Willadsen 2008). To date, attempts to develop anti-Ornithodoros vaccines have focused on either salivary gland antigens or gut antigens as candidate targets (Manzano-Román et al. 2012a). Although experiments using salivary gland proteins achieved mixed results, an approach using gut antigens was more promising, inducing a protective response in pigs, decreasing female fecundity in 50% and causing up to 80% mortality in nymphs (Manzano-Román et al. 2012a)\nPassage 4:\nEcheveria elegans\nEcheveria elegans, the Mexican snow ball, God's Throne, Mexican gem or white Mexican rose is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert habitats in Mexico.\n\nDescription\nEcheveria elegans is a succulent evergreen perennial growing to 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall by 50 cm (20 in) wide, with tight rosettes of pale green-blue fleshy leaves, bearing 25 cm (10 in) long slender pink stalks of pink flowers with yellow tips in winter and spring.\n\nCultivation\nEcheveria elegans is cultivated as an ornamental plant for rock gardens planting, or as a potted plant. It thrives in subtropical climates, such as Southern California\nIt has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Like others of its kind, it produces multiple offsets which can be separated from the parents in spring, and grown separately - hence the common name \"hen and chicks\", applied to several species within the genus Echeveria.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.Elegans means 'elegant' or 'graceful'.\nPassage 5:\nGround jay\nThe ground jays or ground choughs belong to a distinct group of the passerine order of birds in the genus Podoces of the crow family Corvidae. They inhabit high altitude semi-desert areas from central Asia to Mongolia.\nGround jays show adaptations to ground living such as long, strong legs adapted to fast running and the ability to leap and bound onto boulders and rocks with great agility. Their long, curved thick bills are adapted for digging and probing.\nWhile capable of flight (which they do infrequently and relatively weakly), they prefer running, and will readily perch on trees and bushes also.\n\nSpecies list\nThe ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis), previously Hume's ground jay, has changed its placement within the Passeriformes recently because of molecular and osteological testing. It has now been placed into the Paridae.\nPassage 6:\nMulga Island\nMulga Island is a small island 5.6 kilometres (3 nmi) off the coast and 9.3 kilometres (5 nmi) northeast of Kirkby Head, Enderby Land in Antarctica. Plotted from air photos taken from ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) aircraft in 1956.

Like other breeds of Turkmen horse, it is named for the Turkmen tribe that raised it, the Iomud. Both the name of the horse and the name of the Turkmen clan may be spelt in many ways, including Iomud, Yomud, Yamud and Yomut. The Iomud horse is raised in Turkmenistan, particularly in the velayat of Daşoguz; in Uzbekistan; in Karakalpakstan (now part of Uzbekistan), particularly in the Khwarezm region; and in Iraq, Iran and Turkey.: 30  Unlike the Akhal-Teke, it usually kept in herds in desert or semi-desert areas.: 297\n\nHistory\nLike other breeds of Turkmen horse – including the Akhal-Teke, the Ersari, the Goklan, the Salor and the Sarik – the Iomud breed is named for the Turkmen tribe that formed it, the Iomud. The Iomud people occupy the northern part of modern Turkmenistan, from the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea in the west to the area of Daşoguz, on the northern edge of the Karakum Desert, in the north-east. They are principally concentrated in the velayats of Balkan and Daşoguz,: 30  and this is considered the area of origin of the Iomud horse.: 297 The early history of the Iomud breed, like that of Turkmen horses in general, is not clear. The qualities of Turkmen horses, and the differences between the various breeds, were recognised by western travellers in the area in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Clement Augustus de Bode wrote in 1848 that the Tekke horses had the best endurance, and were preferred to pure-bred Arabs, while the Iomud and the Goklan were faster and more lightly built.In the twentieth century, numbers of the Iomud breed declined. In 1980, in the Soviet era, the total number was recorded as 964, of which 616 were considered pure-bred. In 1983 stud farms were set up with the aim of increasing the number of breeding mares from 140 to about 250.  A conservation farm was also established in the Gyzyletrek district, in south-west Turkmenistan.: 297 The Iomud contributed significantly to the development of the Lokai breed in Tajikistan.: 88\n\nCharacteristics\nIomud horses have remarkable endurance. According to local information collected in 1937, they could cover the 800 km from Daşoguz to Etrek in seven days. They can carry 120 kg without difficulty in mountain or desert terrain.: 31 Iomud horses are usually grey or chestnut; golden chestnut and black can occur. Stallions stand about 152 cm (15 hands), mares a little less. Thoracic circumference (girth) is about 168 cm, cannon bone measurement about 19 cm. The profile is straight or slightly convex, the legs fine and often bowed; the mane and tail are sparse, and the skin is delicate.: 297\nPassage 8:\nEcheveria setosa\nEcheveria setosa, the Mexican fire cracker, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert areas of Mexico and common throughout Puebla.\n\nDescription\nEcheveria setosa is an evergreen succulent growing to 4 cm (2 in) high by 30 cm (12 in) wide, with spherical rosettes of fleshy spoon-shaped leaves covered in white hairs. These white hairs, known as glochids, can cause irritation to the skin if touched. In spring it bears 30 cm (12 in) long stalks of red flowers with yellow tips.\n\nTaxonomy\nEcheveria setosa var. ciliata (Moran) Moran 1993\nEcheveria setosa var. deminuta J. Meyrán 1989\nEcheveria setosa var. minor Moran 1993\nEcheveria setosa var. oteroi Moran 1993\nEcheveria setosa var. setosa\n\nCultivation\nEcheveria setosa is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is grown outside in subtropical climates, such as Southern California. As it requires a minimum temperature of 7 °C (45 °F), it must be grown under glass with heat in colder temperate regions. It can be placed outside during the summer months.\n\nEtymology\nEcheveria is named for Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to Flora Mexicana.Setosa means 'covered with stiff, bristly hairs'.\nPassage 9:\nAgrotis orthogonia\nAgrotis orthogonia, the pale western cutworm, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Herbert Knowles Morrison in 1876. It is found in North America, more specifically dry, semi-desert areas of western North America from southern Canada to California, ranging eastward nearly to the eastern edge of the Great Plains.\nThe wingspan is about 34 mm.\nThe larvae feed on various forbs and grasses. The species is occasionally of economic importance on winter wheat and small grains.  It has also been reported from corn and sugar beets.\n\nSubspecies\nAgrotis orthogonia delorata\nAgrotis orthogonia duae\nPassage 10:\nAlopecurus\nAlopecurus, or foxtail grass, is a common and widespread genus of plants in the grass family. It is common across temperate and subtropical parts of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Americas, as well as naturalized in Australia and on various islands.Foxtails can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat leaves and blunt ligules (a small flap at the junction of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.\n\nSpeciesAlopecurus aequalis – Orange foxtail, shortawn foxtail – Eurasia, Americas\nAlopecurus albovii – Caucasus\nAlopecurus anatolicus – eastern Turkey\nAlopecurus apiatus – Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran\nAlopecurus arundinaceus – Reed foxtail, creeping foxtail, creeping meadow foxtail  – Eurasia, North Africa\nAlopecurus aucheri – Caucasus, Turkey, Iran\nAlopecurus baptarrhenius – Ethiopia\nAlopecurus bonariensis – Argentina, Uruguay\nAlopecurus borii – Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus bornmuelleri – Palestine\nAlopecurus brachystachus – Russia, China, Mongolia\nAlopecurus bulbosus – Bulbous foxtail – Mediterranean, western Europe\nAlopecurus carolinianus – tufted meadow foxtail – US, western Canada\nAlopecurus creticus – Greece, Turkey, Balkans\nAlopecurus dasyanthus – Caucasus, Iran\nAlopecurus davisii – Samos Island in Greece\nAlopecurus geniculatus –  Bent foxtail, marsh meadow foxtail – Algeria, Eurasia\nAlopecurus gerardii – Mediterranean\nAlopecurus glacialis – Caucasus, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan\nAlopecurus × haussknechtianus – central + northwestern Europe\nAlopecurus heliochloides – Chile\nAlopecurus himalaicus – Himalayas, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia, Xinjiang\nAlopecurus hitchcockii – Peru, Bolivia, Jujuy\nAlopecurus japonicus – China, Japan, Korea\nAlopecurus laguroides – Caucasus, Turkey\nAlopecurus lanatus – Turkey\nAlopecurus longiaristatus – Heilongjiang, Primorye, Khabarovsk\nAlopecurus magellanicus – northern Eurasia, North + South America, Falkland Is, South Georgia\nAlopecurus × marssonii – Ukraine\nAlopecurus mucronatus – Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan\nAlopecurus myosuroides – Slender meadow foxtail, black grass, twitch grass, black twitch – Eurasia, North Africa\nAlopecurus nepalensis – Himalayas, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus × plettkei – France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands\nAlopecurus ponticus – Caucasus\nAlopecurus pratensis – meadow foxtail – Eurasia from Azores to Mongolia\nAlopecurus rendlei – central + southern Europe, Algeria, Libya, Turkey\nAlopecurus saccatus – Pacific foxtail – United States (WA OR ID CA), Baja California\nAlopecurus setarioides – France, Greece, Italy, Balkans, Turkey\nAlopecurus textilis – Turkey, Caucasus, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkmenistan\nAlopecurus turczaninovii – Siberia\nAlopecurus × turicensis – France, Switzerland\nAlopecurus utriculatus – Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine\nAlopecurus vaginatus – Crimea, Caucasus, Turkey, Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan\nAlopecurus × winklerianus – France, Switzerland, Germany, Polandformerly includedNumerous species once considered part of Alopecurus but now regarded as better suited to other genera: Agrostis Chaetopogon Cornucopiae Crypsis Koeleria Milium Muhlenbergia Pennisetum Perotis Phleum Polypogon Rostraria Setaria Tribolium\n\nSee also\nList of Poaceae genera", "answers": ["Echeveria"], "length": 3796, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b25c605406d7d878df1dfab8199dbba951b14e1fb2a65a35"}

It is found in China, India, and Myanmar.\nPassage 2:\nPeristoreus viridipennis\nPeristoreus viridipennis is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. viridipennis was originally named Erirhinus viridipennis by Broun in 1880. Then, in 1926, Marshall described a new genus called Dorytomodes, into which he provisionally transferred all species placed by Broun in Erirrhinus [=Erirhinus]. Dorytomodes was subsequently sunk as a synonym of Peristoreus by Edwin S. (\"Ted\") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 3:\nPeristoreus fulvus\nPeristoreus fulvus is a species of true weevil. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is associated with plants of the genus Muehlenbeckia.P. fulvus was originally named Erirhinus fulvus by Broun in 1886.

(\"Ted\") Gourlay in 1950.\nPassage 4:\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides, the leafless pohuehue or leafless muehlenbeckia, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nMuehlenbeckia ephedroides are grey-green, grey to grey-black in colour. The stem is branched and is 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in diameter. It is also flexuous, striate, puberulent, and is grey to grey-black or grey-green in colour. The leaves are of the same colour, are glabrous and are 5–25 millimetres (0.20–0.98 in) long. Inflorescence is fascicled or racimed with pale pedicels that are 1–1.5 millimetres (0.039–0.059 in) long. Flowers have a pistillate and are staminate as well. Lobes are narrow-triangular, and are either white, pale yellow-green or just green in colour. Stigmas are obovoid trigonous and are 1.5 millimetres (0.059 in) long. They have white coloured and succulent tepals that are swollen also. The twigs are leafless.\n\nHabitat\nIt grows at elevations of 0–1,200 metres (0–3,937 ft) in coastal or subalpine climates. It can be found growing near rivers, on beaches, sand spits, and alluvial fans.\nPassage 5:\nEuptelea\nEuptelea is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the monogeneric family Eupteleaceae.  The genus is found from Assam east through China to Japan, and consists of shrubs or small trees:\n\nEuptelea pleiosperma\nEuptelea polyandraThe genus was previously placed in the family Trochodendraceae, but the family Eupteleaceae has been recognized by many taxonomists. The APG IV system (2016; unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998), recognizes it and places it in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The family consists of a single genus Euptelea, with two species, native to eastern Asia.\nEuptelea polyandra is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.\nThe flowers lack sepals and petals. The anthers are basifixed, and the leaves are arranged in whorls.The fossil range of the genus extends back to the Paleocene epoch, during much of the Cenozoic it was distributed widely over the Northern Hemisphere.\nPassage 6:\nMuehlenbeckia australis\nMuehlenbeckia australis, the large-leaved muehlenbeckia or pohuehue, is a prostrate or climbing plant native to New Zealand.\n\nDescription\nThe species grows up to 10 metres (33 ft) tall with grey bark. The leaves are on stiff petioles and are 25 millimetres (0.98 in) long. Lamina is 2–8 centimetres (0.79–3.15 in) by 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) long.\nIt has juvenile and adult leaf forms and loses its leaves in winter. The flowers are greenish and the fruits are juicy with black shiny seeds covered by a white, succulent cup of sepals, which are fed on by various birds and lizards.\nFlowers bloom from late spring to autumn, with it panicles occur usually in spring and summer. Fruits are present from November to April, sometimes till June.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1786 by Georg Forster, as Coccoloba australis. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1841 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard Muehlenbeckia adpressa as a synonym of this species. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nEcology\nM. australis prefers places with plenty of sunlight and climbing support, such as forest edges, cliff faces, scrub and regenerating vegetation. With its climbing and rapid growth form, it is capable of engulfing roadside trees, and has benefited from cleared habitats created since human settlement began, and is sometimes the only native species present in such areas.\n\nHost plant\nM. australis is a host plant for numerous New Zealand endemic insects including Pyrgotis eudorana, Apoctena orthropis, Argosarchus horridus, and Clitarchus hookeri.\nPassage 7:\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita\nMuehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita (syn. Duma horrida subsp. abdita). commonly known as remote thorny lignum, is a critically endangered shrub endemic to Western Australia.\n\nDescription\nIt is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers.\nThe subspecies was described in 1996 by Karen Wilson.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMuehlenbckia horrida subsp. abdita is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.\nIt grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed.\n\nConservation\nPopulations of M. h. subsp. abdita have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.It is listed as \"critically endangered\" under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as \"Rare\" under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The whole lake bed ecosystem has been classified as a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name Bryde.\nPassage 8:\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa\nMuehlenbeckia adpressa, commonly known as climbing lignum, is a prostrate or climbing plant, native to Australia. It has thin red-brown stems up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in length. The leaves are 1.5–6 centimetres (0.59–2.36 in) long and 1.5–3.5 centimetres (0.59–1.38 in) wide. It occurs in coastal areas of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardière, as Polygonum adpressum. It was transferred to the genus Muehlenbeckia in 1843 by Carl Meissner. Some sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nMuehlenbeckia\nMuehlenbeckia or maidenhair is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the borders of the Pacific, including South and North America, Papua New Guinea and Australasia. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Europe. Species vary in their growth habits, many being vines or shrubs. In some environments, rampant species can become weedy and difficult to eradicate.\n\nDescription\nSpecies of Muehlenbeckia vary considerably in their growth habits; they may be perennials, vinelike, or shrubs. All have rhizomatous roots. Their leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, usually with stalks (petioles), but sometimes stalkless (sessile). The brownish ocrea is short and tubular, soon disintegrating. The inflorescences may be terminal or axillary, and are in the form of spikes or clusters, with at most very short peduncles (flowering stems). Individual flowers have pedicels (stalks). The flowers may be bisexual or unisexual, with sometimes a mixture of staminate, pistillate and bisexual flowers on the same plant. There are five white to greenish white tepals, joined at the base. Staminate flowers have 8 (sometimes 9) stamens and a rudimentary pistil. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary stamens and three spreading styles. The fruit is in the form of a black or dark brown unwinged achene, three-sided to more or less globe-shaped, at least partly enclosed by the persistent tepals.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was erected by Carl Meissner in 1841, initially for two species that he distinguished from Coccoloba and Polygonum. The generic name honours Alsatian bryologist Heinrich Gustav Mühlenbeck (1798–1845).Muehlenbeckia is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Reynoutria and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called \"RMF clade\".\n\nSpecies\nAs of March 2019, Plants of the World Online recognized 24 species (see note below):\n\nSome sources, including Plants of the World Online, regard M. adpressa as a synonym of M. australis. Others treat them as separate species.Three species have been transferred to the genus Duma:\nMuehlenbeckia coccoloboides J.M.Black → Duma coccoloboides\nMuehlenbeckia florulenta Meisn. – tangled lignum → Duma florulenta\nMuehlenbeckia horrida H.Gross → Duma horrida\n\nDistribution\nNative\n\nAustralasia:\nAustralia: Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Norfolk Island, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia\nNew Zealand: Chatham Islands, New Zealand North, New Zealand South\nPapuasia: New Guinea\nNeotropic:\nCentral America: Honduras\nSouthern South America: Chile\n\nInvasiveness\nAll members of the RMF clade appear to have the potential to become invasive, in some cases via vigorous hybrids. The highly invasive Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) hybridizes with Muehlenbeckia australis. The related Muehlenbeckia complexa has established populations in southern parts of Britain and in the Channel Islands, and is a problematic invasive species in the San Francisco area.\nPassage 10:\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris\nMuehlenbeckia axillaris (creeping wire vine, sprawling wire vine, matted lignum) is a low evergreen shrub, forming wiry mats up to about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, native to New Zealand, and the Australian states of Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria. It has thin, red-brown stems, with glossy squarish to roundish leaves that are less than 1 cm (0.39 in) in diameter and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) thick. Flowers are inconspicuous, yellowish-white, 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) in diameter, and borne in groups of up to three in the axils. The fruit is black, shiny, and up to 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long, produced in late summer to fall.\nThe plant is hardy, drought-tolerant, and quick-growing, thriving in a range of light conditions. It can be cultivated as a ground cover and grows well in rocky ground, as well as standard potting soil. Although it grows fastest in warm seasons, it tolerates freezing weather.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1847, who used the name \"Polygonum (Muhlenbeckia) axillaris\". Both Stephan Endlicher (in 1848) and Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers (in 1849) later referred to it as just Muehlenbeckia axillaris.\n\nSynonyms\nPseudanthus tasmanicus", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 1838, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "36e5ab0a4991476aeab80eb9b897f09f27717796bc6aa908"}

It may feature food such as poi, kālua puaʻa (kālua pig), poke, lomi salmon, ʻopihi, and haupia, beer, and entertainment such as traditional Hawaiian music and hula. Among people from Hawaiʻi, the concepts of \"lūʻau\" and \"party\" are often blended, resulting in graduation lūʻau, wedding lūʻau, baby lūʻau, and birthday lūʻau.\n\nHistory\nIn ancient Hawaiʻi, men and women ate meals separately. Additionally, commoners and women were not allowed to eat foods that were rarely eaten  or foods that were only served during special occasions. However, in 1819, King Kamehameha II removed all the religious laws that were practiced. King Kamehameha II performed a symbolic act by eating with the women, thus ending the Hawaiian religious kapu (taboo) system. This is when the lūʻau parties were first created.\n\nFood\nEarlier, such a feast was called a pāʻina or ʻahaʻaina. The modern name comes from that of a food often served at a lūʻau: squid or chicken lūʻau, which consist of meat, lūʻau (or taro) leaves, and coconut milk. The main dish of the lūʻau is kālua puaʻa (kālua pig), slow-cooked in an imu (earth oven). Another dish that is served is poi, made from the roots of taro. This feast was usually served on the floor, on the mats often decorated with large centerpieces typically made of tī leaves. Utensils were never present during a lūʻau; everything was eaten by hand. For example, varieties of poi were identified by the number of fingers needed to eat it: \"three-finger\", \"two-finger\", or the thickest, \"one-finger poi\".\nA traditional lūʻau consists of food such as:\n\nChicken long rice\nHaupia\nʻUala (Hawaiian sweet potato)\nHawaiian sweet bread\nKālua puaʻa (Hawaiian roast pig)\nKulolo\nLaulau\nLomilomi salmon\nPoi\nPoke\nSquid lūʻau or chicken lūʻau\nTropical fruits\n\nLūʻau-themed parties\nLūʻau-themed or Hawaiian-themed parties vary in their range of dedication to Hawaiian traditions. For example, some extravagant affairs go so far as to ship food from the islands, while others settle for artificial lei, maitais, and a poolside atmosphere.To have a lūʻau-themed party, it is essential to have an open area, such as a backyard, because lūʻau are celebrated under large tents in outdoor areas. Also a lei is a very common item in a lūʻau. A lei is a necklace of flowers, ferns, or kukui nuts that men and women wear. At lūʻau-themed parties, the guests can make their own lei or they can be bought. At these types of parties entertainment is a must. The instruments used are typically the ukulele, guitar and sometimes drums. There are also often hula dancers.Some credit Donn Beach with the initial popularity and commercialization of lūʻaus within the continental United States.  A Life article from 1946 graphically displays one of his famous lūʻaus that he held in Encino, California. In a 1986 interview Beach described his role in shaping private, home based lūʻaus into larger public affairs, where he included entertainment from singers such as Alfred Apaka.\nPassage 3:\nPub cheese\nPub cheese is a type of soft cheese spread and dip prepared using cheese as a primary ingredient and usually with some type of beer or ale added. It can be made with smoked cheeses or liquid smoke added to impart a smoky flavor.  It is typically served with crackers or vegetables, whereby the cheese is spread onto these foods, or the foods may be dipped in it. It is also used as a topping on sandwiches, such as hamburgers. Pub cheese is a traditional bar snack in the United States.Pub cheese is sometimes prepared using a mix of processed cheese and pure cheese.It is a mass-produced product in the United States. For example, Président is a brand that includes pub cheese in its line, and Trader Joe's has a store brand of pub cheese.Some bars, breweries, public houses and restaurants produce their own versions of pub cheese.\n\nSee also\nPassage 4:\nUniversity station (CTA)\nUniversity was a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Green Line; The station was located at 1200 East 63rd Street in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago. University opened on April 23, 1893. From December 12, 1982, until January 9, 1994, University served as the terminal of the Jackson Park Branch. The station closed on January 9, 1994, when the entire Green Line closed for a renovation project. University did not reopen with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996. University was scheduled to be replaced by a new terminal at Dorchester. Instead the line was cut back to its current terminal at Cottage Grove. The University station was demolished in September 1997 when the City of Chicago demolished the rest of the Jackson Park branch east of Cottage Grove.\nPassage 5:\nBeurre Maître d'Hôtel\nBeurre maître d'hôtel, also referred to as maître d'hôtel butter, is a type of compound butter (French: \"beurre composé\") of French origin, prepared with butter, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It is a savory butter that is used on meats such as steak (including the sauce for Chateaubriand steak), fish, vegetables and other foods. It may be used in place of a sauce, and can significantly enhance a dish's flavor. Some variations with a sweet flavor exist. It is usually served cold as sliced disks on foods, and is sometimes served as a side condiment.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of beurre maître d'hôtel is derived from the manner in which it was commonly prepared from scratch by a restaurant's maître d'hôtel at diners' tables. It is also referred to as maître d'hôtel butter.\n\nPreparation\nBeurre maître d'hôtel is a savory butter prepared by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper has also been used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.\n\nUses\nBeurre maître d'hôtel is usually served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and sometimes as a side condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods during the last few minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.\n\nIn Chateaubriand sauce\nBeurre maître d'hôtel is used as an ingredient in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used in the preparation of Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, whereby after the sauce is strained, it is finished with beurre maître d'hôtel. Chopped tarragon may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nGeoff Beattie\nWilliam Geoffrey Beattie (born 1960) is a Canadian business executive and former lawyer.

It opened in 1938, on Cherry Hill's western side, on Route 38, nearby the Cherry Hill Mall (which later opened in 1961). The Cottage was established by Michael Egidi and Mary Egidi-Pietrafesa. Started as a roadhouse, the restaurant soon emerged into what was considered a South Jersey landmark.  The restaurant's exterior was known for its vivid yellow, pineapple-shaped dome, burning Polynesian torches at the entrance, and a Hawaiian atmosphere that included a luau show. After Mr. Egidi's death in a car accident in the early 1940s, Mrs. Egidi continued to operate the business. Her second husband, John Muresan, helped with the restaurant's growth. On July 1, 1978, the restaurant was destroyed by a fire.Both John and Mary Muresan died in 1997.\nPassage 8:\nA-ration\nThe A-ration (officially Field Ration, Type A) is a United States military ration consisting of fresh, refrigerated, or frozen foods. A-rations may be served in dining facilities, prepared in the field using field kitchens, or prepared at a fixed facility and transported to field locations in containers. Its modern successor is the Unitized Group Ration – A (UGR-A), which combines multiple types of rations, including the A-ration, under one unified system.The A-ration differs from other American alphabetized rations such as the B-ration, consisting of canned or preserved food; C-ration, consisting of prepared wet food when A- and B-rations are not available; D-ration, consisting of military chocolate; K-ration, consisting of three balanced meals; and emergency rations, intended for emergencies when other food or rations are unavailable.\n\nUnitized Group Ration A\nA-rations today may include the Unitized Group Ration – A, a hybrid meal kit designed to feed a group of 50 people for one meal. The UGR-A has several different varieties, including a tray-based heat and serve (T-rat) form, heated by hot water immersion when a field kitchen is not available, or the express form, with a self-heating module and disposable accessories. The UGR-A is used to sustain military personnel during worldwide operations that allow organized food service facilities.  \nThe UGR-A includes perishable/frozen type entrees (A-rations) along with commercial-type components and perishable/frozen type entrees to provide the luxury of an A-ration meal in the field, configured into individual meal modules for ease of ordering, distribution, and preparation. The UGR-A has at least 9 months shelf life (at 80 °F or 27 °C for semi-perishable modules and at 0 °F or −18 °C for perishable modules).\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nWebsite on Military Nutrition Research – This website documents more than a century of scientific inquiry conducted by, for, and about the U.S. military to promote and sustain the nutritional health of military personnel and citizens alike.\nPassage 9:\nRaw bar\nA raw bar is a small restaurant or a bar within a restaurant where live shellfish are shucked and served. Raw bars typically offer a variety of raw and cooked seafood and shellfish that is served cold. Seafood-based dishes may also be offered, and additional, non-seafood foods may also be part of the fare. Raw bars may offer alcoholic beverages such as oyster shooters, as well as wine and sake that is paired with various foods. Additional accompaniments may include condiments, sauces and foods such as lemon and lime. Several restaurants in the United States offer raw bars, some of which are seasonal.\n\nFare\nRaw seafood\nRaw bars may serve a selection of raw oysters, clams, quahogs (hard clams), scallops and mussels. Varieties of hard clam may include littlenecks, which are less than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in size, and cherrystones, which are up to 2 inches (5 cm). Various types of oysters may be served. Some raw bars may offer oyster shooters, a type of cocktail prepared with raw oyster. Some also offer ceviche, a dish prepared with raw seafood that is cured with citrus juices, particularly lime. Thinly sliced octopus (octopus carpaccio) is another raw bar item.\n\nCooked seafood\nRaw bars sometimes supplement the menu with cooked versions of the same and additional seafoods and shellfish that are typically served cold, such as clam chowder, oyster stew, poached shrimp, shrimp cocktail, cooked or seared scallops, mussels, crab legs, lobster, cured salmon, sea urchin and steamers (steamed clams).\n\nOther cooked foods\nSometimes lightly cooked liver or foie gras is a raw bar item.\n\nDishes\nThe plateau de fruits de mer is a seafood dish sometimes offered by raw bars that is prepared with raw and cooked shellfish and cold on a platter, usually on a bed of ice.\n\nAccompaniments and condiments\nRaw bars may offer wine or sake to accompany and be paired with the various foods. Condiments, such as cocktail sauce and lemon, may be available, which are typically served with raw oysters. These may also be used on other foods. Other food additions may include lime, tomato, chili peppers, mignonette sauce and caviar.\n\nRestaurants\nRaw bars exist in various cities in the United States, such as Jay's Restaurant in New York City, which has a raw bar. Some bistro-style restaurants offer a raw bar. Some restaurants offer a seasonal raw bar, such as Grand Banks restaurant in New York City and Bagley & Shakespeare in London.\n\nHealth risk\nConsuming raw oysters is potentially dangerous as they might contain harmful bacteria. People eating raw oysters might contract vibriosis, an illness typically caused by eating raw seafood. There are reports of human casualties caused by consuming raw oysters.\n\nSee also\nSeafood restaurant\nOyster bar\nSushi bar\nSalad bar\nList of oyster bars\nList of seafood dishes\nList of fish dishes\nPassage 10:\nDick W.

During the 2020/21 and 2021/22 periods, Aughton Park was the least used station on the Merseyrail Network.\n\nHistory\nThe station is below ground level built into a cutting. Opened by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, Aughton Park Station was originally coupled with a freight siding, Crook's Sand Siding, which serviced two nearby quarries. The station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\nWhen sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways on behalf of the Merseyside PTE until the privatisation of British Railways.\n\nFacilities\nThe station is staffed throughout the day (like all Merseytravel stations), with the ticket office open from start of service until the last train has called throughout the week. There are shelters on both platforms and a pay phone on platform 1. Train running information is provided by automated announcements and digital display screens. No step-free access to either platform is available.\n\nServices\nTrains operate every 15 minutes on Monday to Saturday daytimes between Ormskirk and Liverpool Central, and every 30 minutes at other times (evenings and Sundays).\nPassage 5:\nBueng Phra Railway Station\nBueng Phra railway station is a railway station located in Bueng Phra Subdistrict, Phitsanulok City, Phitsanulok.

It is the terminus of the Royal National Park railway line, formerly part of the Sydney commuter rail network and now operated by the Sydney Tramway Museum. The station opened in 1886 and was served by trains on the Sydney network until 1991 when the Royal National Park railway line was closed due to low patronage. The line and station were transferred to the Sydney Tramway Museum and re-opened in May 1993 for heritage tramway operations.\nThe museum operates services on the line on Wednesdays and Sundays, with the first service running at 10:15 am. Departures are hourly from then on, with the last one at 2:30 pm on Wednesday and 4:30 pm on Sunday. It is a popular means of access to the Royal National Park.\n\nHistory\nThe station opened as Loftus on 9 March 1886 (the station currently known as Loftus was then called Loftus Junction). It was renamed National Park on 1 May 1889, back to Loftus in January 1890 and back again to National Park on 1 December 1896. It was finally renamed Royal National Park on 16 July 1955. The original island platform could accommodate ten carriages. There was also a goods bank and five sidings.  Royal National Park was included in the electrification of the Illawarra railway line in 1926 and remained the southern limit of electrification until 1980 when overhead wiring was extended to Waterfall.\nAt its peak in the 1930s, the line was served by 25 trains a day on weekends. On 4 July 1967, three of the five sidings at the station were removed. In 1978, the original station was demolished to make way for a visitor's centre and a new single platform built. By 1988, the line was being served by only three trains a day.After the Cowan rail accident in 1990, the Royal National Park branch line was used for safety tests. Because of the small number of services running on the line, it was also used for driver training.Following the discovery of signalling faults, services ceased on 11 June 1991. With major expenditure required and average patronage having dwindled to three passengers per train, the line was formally closed. The line was taken over by the Sydney Tramway Museum with Royal National Park station re-opening as the line's terminus in May 1993.  Due to the design of the heritage trams running on the line, they are unable to use the actual station platform.In October 2010 a new low level tram platform was built next to Loftus Oval for the Breakfast Torque event held every October at Loftus Oval. The Sydney tramway museum was hired by Sutherland Council to run a scheduled tram shuttle service from the Tafe car park  next to the Tafe level crossing at Pitt street, to Loftus Oval and return picking up or setting down passengers at the other side of Pitt Street for Loftus station. This was in response to the limited availability of parking at Loftus Oval.\n\nServices\nPassage 7:\nOrmskirk railway station\nOrmskirk railway station in Ormskirk, Lancashire, England, is a cross-platform interchange between Merseyrail services from Liverpool Central and Northern Trains services from Preston on the Ormskirk branch line, 12+3⁄4 miles (20.5 km) northeast of Liverpool.  The station building and three arch road bridge are both Grade II listed structures.\n\nHistory\nThe station was built by the East Lancashire Railway's Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Junction section, and opened on 2 April 1849.  From 13 May 1859, the station was owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. From 1 January 1923 the station was owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. British Railways nationalised all railways on 1 January 1948 and the station became part of the London Midland Region.\nA branch line to Rainford Junction via Skelmersdale was opened by the ELR in March 1858 shortly before it was absorbed by the L&YR – this left the main line to Preston just to the north of the station.  The line from Liverpool was subsequently electrified in 1913, with the suburban EMUs using a bay platform at the southern end of the station to keep them clear of the busy main line to Preston, which was used as the L&Y's principal route to East Lancashire, the Fylde, Cumbria and Scotland.\n\n1977\nThe original Liverpool terminus of the line (Liverpool Exchange) was closed in 1977, when the route became one of the three branches of the new Northern Line and trains began running to a new underground terminus at Liverpool Central.  Since 1996, it has been part of the Merseyrail franchise currently (2016) run by Serco-Abellio.\n\nStation layout\nThe current station consists of a single platform.  An interesting characteristic is how the electric Merseyrail track and the unelectrified Northern track is on the same alignment, with electric and diesel trains using opposite ends of the same platform. The line is cut by a large buffer separating the track sections. Passengers wishing to transfer from an electric train to diesel train walk a dozen yards or so along the same platform to move between trains.  A similar layout exists at Kirkby station.\nPrior to the Beeching Report of 1963 and the subsequent restructuring of the rail network, there were two main through platforms. The electric Liverpool commuter trains would pull into the southern bay platform.  This practice ended following the withdrawal of through trains between Liverpool and Preston via this route. Local services from Preston, East Lancashire and Blackpool towards Liverpool were either withdrawn or terminated at Ormskirk from October 1969 with the last through trains running on 3 May 1970. From 4 May 1970 the line was split, with all trains using the former Liverpool platform (the Preston-bound platform remains, however is disused). The bay platform is now a footpath leading to the bus station.\nOnly a single Merseyrail third-rail electric line runs into the platform, the route towards Liverpool becomes double immediately outside the station. The line from Ormskirk to Preston has been single track since the summer of 1970, except for a passing loop at Rufford.\nThe former link between Ormskirk and Southport, via the Burscough Curves, was closed in 1962. The Skelmersdale Branch has also been lost, having closed to passengers in 1956 and to all traffic seven years later. It was lifted in 1968, though the Burscough curves remained extant until the mid-1980s.\n\nFacilities\nThe station underwent a £1.5 million renovation during 2009.  Among the refurbishments include a new booking hall, waiting room, toilet facilities, ticket counters and new automatic swinging doors, as well as a remodelled and landscaped path and bicycle route up to the bus interchange. The station is classed as eco-friendly and gets its green credentials by using a system that harvests rainwater, as well as other various energy-saving measures. During October & November 2018 the height, width and layout of the platforms were adjusted to prepare for Merseyrail's new fleet of trains which are due to be introduced from 2020.The station is staffed, 15 minutes before the first train and 15 minutes after the last train, and has platform CCTV. There is a payphone, waiting room, booking office and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. The station has a free car park, with 108 spaces, as well as a 2-space cycle rack and secure storage for 28 cycles. The station and platforms have full disabled access but the car park has uneven ramp access.\n\nServices\nServices to Liverpool Central operate frequently, running every 15 minutes during the day (Mon-Sat) and every 30 minutes at other times (evenings and Sundays).  Services to Preston now run hourly Monday–Saturday (since the May 2018 timetable change). There is no Sunday service.\n\nFuture\nThere have been calls from local authorities and the local rail user group to reopen both curves at Burscough to allow the reinstatement of through trains from Ormskirk to Southport, as well as to reinstate through services between Preston and Liverpool via Ormskirk and to rebuild and reopen the Skelmersdale branch. Merseytravel's 2014 Liverpool City Region Long Term Rail Strategy does not back plans for an Ormskirk to Skelmersdale route (instead proposing that the link be provided from the Kirkby to Wigan Wallgate line), but it suggests that a new bi-level interchange at Burscough Bridge could be built, to provide improved interchange facilities between the Ormskirk branch and the Wigan to Southport line, in addition to reopening the curves and extending electrification through to Preston and Southport.Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review to introduce new Merseyrail battery trains will be undertaken in 2020, in view to put Preston interchange station onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston. The aim is to have Preston one of the terminals of the Northern Line, with Burscough Junction, Rufford and Croston stations brought onto the Merseyrail network. The document states, \"The potential use of battery powered Merseyrail units may improve the business case\".\n\nGallery\nSee also\nListed buildings in Ormskirk\nPassage 8:\nPhichai Railway Station\nPhichai railway station is a railway station located in Nai Mueang Subdistrict, Phichai District, Uttaradit.

{"input": "Steve Denton and Albert Costa are both tennis players, which one began playing at the age if five?", "context": "Passage 1:\nTennis New Zealand\nTennis New Zealand (commonly known by the acronym Tennis NZ or TNZ) (formally the New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association) is the governing body of tennis in New Zealand. Founded in 1886, it is one of the world's oldest tennis associations. It is affiliated to both International Tennis Federation and Oceania Tennis Federation. Tennis NZ has six geographically divided regional centres. Tennis NZ operates all of the New Zealand's national representative tennis sides, including the New Zealand Davis Cup team, the New Zealand Billie Jean King Cup team and youth sides as well. Tennis NZ is also responsible for organising and hosting tennis tournaments within New Zealand and scheduling the home international fixtures.\n\nHistory\nThe history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began. The first New Zealand Tennis Championships were played at Farndon Park in Clive, Hawke's Bay, in December 1885. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886. Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England).In 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open. Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called The Australasian Mens Championships (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues. New Zealand hosted the championship twice— Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912). The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France, on 1 March 1913. From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of \"Team Australasia\", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-Tasman partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events. In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993.\n\nStructure\nGoverning staff\nConstitution\nThe constitution of the organisation was adopted on 12 August 2006 in the Special General Meeting in which the main purpose of the organisation is defined as to promote, develop, enhance and protect the sport of tennis mainly as an amateur sport for the recreation and entertainment of the general public in New Zealand.\n\nAffiliates\nRegional centres\nTennis NZ consists of six regional centres which are affiliated to the national body. They control their own activities subject to any requirements which may, from time to time, be legislated for by the national body.\n\nOrganisations\nTennis NZ affiliates several different tennis related private organisations, which are:\nAotearoa Maori Tennis Association (AMTA) - national tennis body of Māori people.\nNZ Tennis Umpires Association (NZTUA) -  national body, which governs tennis officiating in New Zealand.\nTennis Coaches NZ (TCNZ) -  New Zealand's association for professional tennis coaches.\nInternational Lawn Tennis Club of NZ - member of Council of International Lawn Tennis Clubs, established in 1956 and has around 130 members.\nNZ Wheelchair Tennis - Hamilton based organisation affiliated with International Wheelchair Tennis Association (IWTA) governs Wheelchair tennis in New Zealand.\nSeniors Tennis NZ - national association for tennis players aged 35 years and above.\n\nTournaments\nTennis NZ annually organises range of events from local tournaments to national and international events. Tennis Auckland hosts two major events of international tennis tournaments each year at the ASB Tennis Centre, Parnell, just prior to Australian Open:\nASB Classic - is a most prominent women's and men's tournament of New Zealand. This ATP Tour and WTA Tour event is an International series tournament and is played on outdoor hardcourts during the first week of the tennis season.\nPassage 2:\nAlbert Costa\nAlbert Costa Casals (Catalan pronunciation: [əlˈβɛɾ(t) ˈkɔstəj kəˈzals]; born 25 June 1975) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. He is best remembered for winning the men's singles title at the French Open in 2002.\n\nTennis career\nCosta began playing tennis at the age of five. He first came to the tennis world's attention as an outstanding junior player. In 1993, he reached the French Open junior final and won the Orange Bowl. He turned professional later that year and quickly established a reputation as a strong clay court player. Spanish former player and commentator for Spanish television Andrés Gimeno used to call him \"the man with two forehands\", because he could hit with the same accuracy and strength both forehand and backhand. In 1994, he won two challenger series events and was named the ATP's Newcomer of the Year.\nCosta won his first top-level singles title in 1995 at Kitzbühel, beating the \"King of Clay\", Thomas Muster, in a five set final. It was Muster's first of only 2 losses on clay in 1995. Costa ended Muster's streak of 40 consecutive clay match wins and his 11 consecutive final wins . Costa won three further titles in 1996. In 1997, he won another two singles titles and was part of the Spanish team that won the World Team Cup. He won another two singles titles in 1998, including the Tennis Masters Series event in Hamburg and played at magnificent level at the French Open, only a brilliant Marcelo Ríos could stop him at fourth round, but he established the bases for his future winning in 2002. Three further titles followed in 1999.\nIn 2000, Costa helped Spain win its first Davis Cup. Despite being knocked out in the first round in men's singles, he also captured a bronze medal in the men's doubles at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, partnering Álex Corretja.\nGoing into the French Open in 2002, Costa had not won a tour title of any kind since 1999 and was not considered to be among the favorites. Seeded 20th, he defeated Richard Gasquet, Nikolay Davydenko and Andrea Gaudenzi to reach the fourth round, where he defeated two time defending-champion and former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten in straight sets. Costa followed up with a five-set victory over Argentina's Guillermo Cañas in the quarterfinals. He then defeated fellow-Spaniard, former world No. 2 and long-time friend Àlex Corretja in a four-set semifinal. In the final, Costa came up against another Spaniard, future world No. 1, Juan Carlos Ferrero. Ferrero had been in fine form in the run-up to the event and most observers considered him to be the heavy favourite going into the final. But Costa won in four sets, 6–1, 6–0, 4–6, 6–3, to claim his first Grand Slam title. Costa destroyed Ferrero, who could only win nine points during Costa's service games in the first 2 sets. The win propelled him to his career-high singles ranking of World No. 6 in July 2002.\nComing into the French Open as defending-champion in 2003, Costa spent a total of 21 hours and 15 minutes on court, winning four five-setters before eventually being knocked-out in a semifinal by Ferrero (who went on to win the title).\nDuring his career, Costa won 12 top-level singles titles. In 2005, he captured his first tour doubles title (in Doha, partnering Rafael Nadal).\nCiting recurring injuries and lack of desire, he officially announced his retirement from competitive professional tennis on 21 April 2006, at the completion of the Open Seat 2006 in his hometown in Barcelona. In his last tournament, Costa defeated American Vincent Spadea and Slovakian Dominik Hrbatý before losing 6–1, 5–7, 7–5 to Ferrero in the third round.\nIn December 2008, Costa was named Spain's Davis Cup captain, replacing Emilio Sánchez Vicario. Costa became the most successful Spanish Davis Cup captain to date as he led Spain to two Davis Cup titles in 2009 and 2011, before handing the captaincy over to Àlex Corretja.\nCosta was coaching ATP pro Feliciano López.\n\nPersonal life\nHe grew up with John McEnroe as his idol. Besides tennis, he enjoys playing cards, table tennis, golf, and soccer. He is also a fan of Barcelona and his hometown team UE Lleida. He also admires Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Ronaldo.\nLess than a week after his triumph at the 2002 French Open, Costa married his long-time girlfriend Cristina Ventura. Àlex Corretja was the best man at the wedding. The couple have twin daughters, Claudia and Alma, who were born on 21 April 2001.\n\nCareer statistics\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\nFinals: 1 (1 title)\nYear-End Championship performance timeline\nSee also\nList of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n\nSources\nExternal links\nAlbert Costa at the Association of Tennis Professionals \nAlbert Costa at the International Tennis Federation \nAlbert Costa at the Davis Cup \nAlbert Costa at ESPN.com \nAlbert Costa at Olympedia \nAlbert Costa at Olympics.com\nPassage 3:\n1995 Austrian Open\nThe 1995 EA Generali Open, also known as Austrian Open, was a men's tennis tournament held at the Kitzbüheler Tennisclub in Kitzbühel, Austria and played on outdoor clay courts.

Nadal won a career-best 11 singles titles, including then-season-record 4 Masters 1000 titles and his maiden Grand Slam title at the French Open on his first attempt, making him the first teenager since Pete Sampras (1990 US Open) to win a major. He finished the year with 79 calendar match wins, the most by any teenager in ATP Tour history, and the world No. 2 ranking. He was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.\n\nAustralian Open\nAt the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nHard court\nNadal reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by Roger Federer.\n\nClay court\nNadal dominated the 2005 clay court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, which broke Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager. Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona and beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Rome Masters. During the Rome quarterfinals against Radek Štěpánek, Nadal hit what is considered by many as the greatest shot of his career, a no-look, running passing shot near the net. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5 and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinals, as one of only four players who defeated the world No. 1 that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later, he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second male player after Mats Wilander to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first male teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open at age 19. Winning the French Open improved Nadal's ranking to world No. 3.\n\nGrass court\nThree days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to the German Alexander Waske. He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to Gilles Müller of Luxembourg.\n\nSummer hard court\nImmediately after Wimbledon, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, bringing his ranking to world No. 2 on 25 July 2005. Nadal started his North American summer hard-court season by defeating Agassi in the final of the 2005 Canada Masters, but lost in the first round of the 2005 Cincinnati Masters. Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, where he was upset in the third round by world No. 49 James Blake in four sets.\nIn September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth ATP Masters Series title of the year, defeating Ivan Ljubičić in the final of the 2005 Madrid Masters. He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.Both Nadal and Federer won eleven singles titles and four ATP Masters Series titles in 2005. Nadal broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage record of nine in 1983. Eight of Nadal's titles were on clay, and the remainder were on hard courts. Nadal won 79 matches, second only to Federer's 81.\n\nSingles Matches\nSee also\n2005 ATP Tour\n2005 Roger Federer tennis season\nPassage 9:\nSteve Denton\nSteve Denton (born September 5, 1956) is a former professional tennis player for the ATP Tour. He is currently the head men's tennis coach at Texas A&M University.\nAfter becoming an all-American at the University of Texas in 1978, Denton spent nine seasons playing for the ATP Tour. He reached the final of both the 1981 and 1982 Australian Open, and won the 1982 US Open doubles championship with Kevin Curren, attaining career-high rankings of World No. 12 in singles and World No. 2 in doubles. He won a total of 18 tour level doubles titles and, despite reaching 6 finals, never won a singles title. In 1984, his 138 miles per hour (222 km/h) serve broke the world record, which would not be broken until 13 years later. After retiring from the pros, he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, coaching several local junior tennis teams. In 2001, he debuted his college coaching career at Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi, where he led his teams to three conference championships and a first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. In 2006, he resigned to become the head coach at Texas A&M University.\nFor his accomplishments, he is a member of the ITA Hall of Fame, the Texas Tennis Hall of Fame, the Blue-Gray Tennis Class Hall of Fame, and the Longhorn Hall of Honor.\n\nPlaying career\nHigh school and college\nDenton attended Bishop High School in Bishop, Texas. As a prep, he won four consecutive UIL state 3A singles titles. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played tennis from 1976–79. He earned all-American honors in 1978. Along with teammate Kevin Curren, he won the U.S. Tennis Association amateur indoor and SWC doubles title in 1979. He completed his college career with an 85–22 singles record, which currently ranks third all-time in school history. He also compiled a 72–18 doubles record, and a 78–27 team record. For his collegiate and professional accomplishments, he was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 2006.\n\nProfessional\nDenton was ranked as high as World No. 12 on the ATP rankings in singles and No. 2 in doubles, both in 1983. Denton was known for his big serve and employed an unusual service motion which involved taking two steps forward prior to striking the ball.  Current ATP rules prohibit such a motion (or any service motion involving a running or walking start).  In 1984, Denton set a service record of 138 mph (222 km/h) that would stand for 13 years until it was broken in 1997 by Mark Philippoussis who recorded a 142 mph (229 km/h) delivery.  The current record of 163 mph (262 km/h) is held by Sam Groth.\nHe reached six singles finals, most notably the Australian Open (in 1981 and 1982) and the Cincinnati Masters (in 1982). He also won 18 doubles titles (including the US Open and the Canada Masters) in 1982, and reaching 23 additional doubles finals.\n\nGrand Slam finals\nSingles (2 losses)\nDoubles (1 win, 1 loss)\nMixed Doubles (3 losses)\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\nSingles\nCareer finals\nDoubles (18 wins, 21 losses)\nSingles: 6 (6 losses)\nCoaching career\nDenton made his first head coaching debut at Texas A&M–Corpus Christi in 2001. In his five seasons there, he led the Islanders to three Southland Conference regular-season championships, two tournament championships, and the team's first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance. He was named Southland Conference Coach of the Year twice, in 2004 and 2005. He finished with a 64–48 overall record.On August 8, 2006, Denton became the head men's tennis coach at Texas A&M University. After struggling for two years in Big 12 Conference play, Denton led the Aggies to a 5-1 conference record and 2nd-place finish in his third year, earning Big 12 Coach of the Year honors.\n\nCoaching record\nPassage 10:\n1996 Bournemouth International\nThe 1996 Bournemouth International (also known as the 1996 Samsung Open for sponsorship reasons) was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts at the West Hants Tennis Club in Bournemouth in England and was part of the World Series of the 1996 ATP Tour.

{"input": "Are Sutera and Rhodotypos both types of shrub?", "context": "Passage 1:\nOlearia canescens\nOlearia canescens is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a shrub with scattered elliptic or egg-shaped leaves, and white and yellow, daisy-like inflorescences.\n\nDescription\nOlearia canescens is a shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in). It has scattered elliptic or egg-shaped leaves, 10–60 mm (0.39–2.36 in) long, 3–21 mm (0.12–0.83 in) wide and more or less sessile. Both surfaces of the leaves are covered with a layer of greyish, felt-like hairs. The heads or daisy-like \"flowers\" are arranged on the ends of branchlets and are 12–19 mm (0.47–0.75 in) in diameter on a peduncle up to 31 mm (1.2 in) long. Each head has eight to fifteen white ray florets surrounding seven to sixteen yellow disc florets. Flowering occurs from February to August and the fruit is a silky-hairy achene, the pappus with 35–43 long bristles in two rows with an outer row of shorter bristles.\n\nTaxonomy\nThis daisy bush was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham who gave it the name Olearia stellulata var. canescens in Flora Australiensis. In 1917 John Hutchinson raised the variety to species status as O. canescens.In 2014, Andre Messina described two subspecies in Australian Systematic Botany, and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census:\n\nOlearia canescens (Benth.) Hutch. subsp. canescens;\nOlearia canescens subsp. discolor Messina.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nOlearia canescens grows in woodland, forest and rainforest in south-eastern Queensland and as far south as the Apsley River and west to the Nandewar Range in New South Wales.\nPassage 2:\nMark's and Jack's Island Natural Area Preserve\nMark's and Jack's Island Natural Area Preserve is a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) Natural Area Preserve located in Accomack County, Virginia.  The preserve supports Chesapeake Bay beach habitat, as well as various types of marsh, shrub, and forest vegetation. Many species of birds can be found in the preserve's wetlands, and numerous plant species live in the marsh, including marsh-elder.  Loblolly pine and black cherry may be seen along the tops of some old dunes. The beaches provide a home for the northeastern beach tiger beetle.The preserve has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society as a part of the \"Delmarva Bayside Marshes IBA\", which also includes the nearby Parkers Marsh Natural Area Preserve and Saxis Wildlife Management Area.The preserve is owned and maintained by The Nature Conservancy. Access to the preserve is possible only by boat, and is restricted to educational or research purposes. Visitors must make arrangements with The Nature Conservancy prior to visiting.\n\nSee also\nList of Virginia Natural Area Preserves\nPassage 3:\nLonicera conjugialis\nLonicera conjugialis is a species of honeysuckle known by the common name purpleflower honeysuckle. It is native to the western United States from Pacific Northwest to the Sierra Nevada, where it grows in many types of mountain habitat, especially moist areas. This is a slender shrub often exceeding 1.5 meters in erect height. The lightly hairy leaves are oval to round and 2 to 8 centimeters long. The inflorescence is generally a pair of flowers nestled in a leaf axil toward the end of a branch. Each flower is maroon red to deep purple in color. It has an upper lip made up of four fused lobes, and a single-lobed lower lip. The protruding stamens are tipped with light-colored anthers. The fruit is a pair of bright red berries which are often fused together in a double-lobed unit.\n\nExternal links\nJepson Manual Profile\nPhoto gallery\nPassage 4:\nSutera\nSutera is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Caltanissetta in the Italian region Sicily, located about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Palermo and about 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of Caltanissetta. The area is dominated by a large monolithic rock termed \"The Mountain of San Paolino\". Upon this mountain sits the bones of the patron saints of the town, St. Paolino and St. Onofrio. On the Feast of San Onofrio, almost all those in the town walk to the top of the mountain, as a pilgrimage to the saints. As a surname, Sutera has variations that include Souter, Suter, Sudder, and Sutar due to Anglo-Saxon influence during the conquest of Italy. The name refers to both the Rock of Sicily, and a High-German/Middle-Latin word for a cobble or shoe maker \nSutera holds the award of \"bandiere arancioni\"[1] from the touring club Italiano. Sutera is currently the only place in Sicily to hold this accolade, which is awarded to touristic areas of excellence. As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 1,649 and an area of 35.5 square kilometres (13.7 sq mi).Sutera borders the following municipalities: Acquaviva Platani, Bompensiere, Campofranco, Casteltermini, Milena, Mussomeli.\nSutera is twinned with the Borough of Broxbourne in England.\nRecently, the population has had a decrease because of the lack of work in the area. Youngsters had moved away leaving Sutera with mainly elder citizens. However, in the last few years the town has been transformed by the influx of asylum seekers which has saved the local school and boosted the local economy.\n\nPeople linked to Sutera\nGiuseppe Sorge (1857–1937), historian, prefect and director of the public security.\nGiuseppe Mormino (1880–1955) Senator, Prefect and Politician.\nPassage 5:\nClaoxylon australe\nClaoxylon australe, known as brittlewood is a common rainforest shrub or understorey tree. The habitat is all types of eastern Australian rainforests. The natural range of distribution is from Eden (37° S) in south eastern New South Wales to Bowen (20° S) in tropical Queensland.\n\nDescription\nA shrub or small tree growing to 9 metres in height and a trunk diameter of 30 cm. The trunk is cylindrical or somewhat flanged at the butt in larger plants. Bark is fawnish brown or grey, fairly smooth with some lines of vertical bumps and other irregularities. Branchlets often hairy, green turning to fawn with lenticels.\nLeaves alternate, simple and toothed in an irregular manner. Oblong or elliptical in shape, 5 to 12 cm long with a blunt leaf tip. Leaf stalks 1 to 4 cm long. Usually with two small glands at the apex. The midrib is paler than the leaf itself, venation is more evident under the leaf.\nGreenish flowers form on racemes in the months of October to November. Male and female flowers on separate plants, being dioecious. The fruit matures in January to March, being a purple/black capsule. Globular in shape, 6 mm in diameter. Within each of the three lobes of the capsule is one red warty seed. Its fruit is eaten by the brown cuckoo-dove and Australian king parrot.\nPassage 6:\nRhodotypos\nRhodotypos scandens, the sole species of the genus Rhodotypos, is a deciduous shrub in the family Rosaceae, closely related to Kerria and included in that genus by some botanists. It is native to China, Korea, possibly also Japan.\n\nDescription\nIt grows to 2–5 m tall, with (unusually for a species in the Rosaceae) opposite (not alternate) leaves, simple ovate-acute, 3–6 cm long and 2–4 cm broad with a serrated margin. The flowers are white, 3–4 cm diameter, and (also unusually) have four (not five) petals; flowering is from late spring to mid-summer. The fruit is a cluster of 1-4 shiny black drupes 5–8 mm diameter.\nIt does not have a widely used English name, most commonly being known by its genus name rhodotypos, also occasionally as jetbead or jet-bead. It is an invasive species in some parts of eastern North America.\n\nReferences and external links\n\nFlora of China\nPassage 7:\nAlyxia oliviformis\nAlyxia stellata, known as maile in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family, Apocynaceae, that is native to Hawaii. It grows as either a twining liana, scandent shrub, or small erect shrub, and is one of the few vines that are endemic to the islands. The binomial nomenclature means \"chain resembling olive\" in Latin. The leaves are usually ternate, sometimes opposite, and can show both types on the same stem. Flowers are quite inconspicuous and have a sweet and light fragrance of honey. The bark is most fragrant and exudes a slightly sticky, milky sap when punctured, characteristic of the family Apocynaceae.  The entire plant contains coumarin, a sweet-smelling compound that is also present in vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), woodruff (Galium odoratum) and mullein (Verbascum spp.).  Fruit are oval and dark purple when ripe.  Maile is a morphologically variable plant and the Hawaiian names reflect this (see Ethnobotany section).\n\nDistribution and habitat\nMaile can occur in most types of vegetation at elevations from 50 to 2,000 metres (200 to 6,600 ft) on all of the main Hawaiian Islands, however it is believed that both Kahoʻolawe and Niʻihau likely had populations of the species before large-scale disturbances occurred. Lowland wet forests occur from 100–1,200 m (300–3,900 ft) elevation in the Hawaiian Islands and are prime habitat for maile, receiving 150–500 cm (60–200 in) of rainfall annually. Maile is also found in montane mesic and wet communities.\n\nEthnobotanical uses\nLei\nMaile is traditionally and still most popularly used in lei.  The vines are prepared and twined together to make an open lei or if people prefer they can close it.  In more rural areas it is typical for someone to pick their own maile if accessible, however because lei maile is so desirable, many floral shops carry these kinds of lei.  It is one of the only endemic Hawaiian plants grown commercially for lei.  Commercial maile plantations have become more common as some people feel that imported (non-Hawaiian) maile  is not as fragrant as Hawaiian maile.\n\nLāʻau Lapaʻau\nThis plant was used medicinally to treat puho, puka puhi, kaupo, and  na ʻeha moku kukonukonu e aʻe (other cuts).  Maile kaluhea was mashed with ʻaukoʻi (Senna occidentalis) stalks, ʻahakea (Bobea spp.) and koa (Acacia koa) bark.  After water is added to this mixture and heated, it is put on infected areas to clean.\n\nLocal tradition\nLei maile are often worn by the groom, and also by the groom's men in weddings which is a lovely sight.  For high school proms in Hawaiʻi, the boy is often given a lei maile.  Birthdays, graduations, anniversaries and any celebration for that matter are all an occasion for lei maile, however many responsible stewards to the land understand there is not enough maile to go around for everyone.  This ties back in to local maile plantations that have started up.\n\nKapa\nKapa, pounded wauke (Broussonetia papyrifera) is traditionally scented using fragrant plants such as maile, mokihana (Melicope anisata), lauaʻe (Phymatosorus scolopendria), ʻiliahi (Santalum spp.) and kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum).\n\nConservation\nBecause maile is desirable for harvesting it is often incorporated into restoration plantings which can help bring the community into the conservation process.  One study looked at the potential of planting native Hawaiian plants as an understory layer to reduce weedy seedlings from sprouting up and gaining hold again in a restored area.  Maile, māmaki (Pipturus albidus) and palapalai (Microlepia strigosa) were the plants used.\n\nFolklore\nMention of the maile plant occurs in various stories (moʻolelo),  proverbs (ʻōlelo noʻeau), and in the song (mele) \"Lei ʻAwapuhi\".\n\nLāʻieikawai\nThe maile sisters are a favorite stock characters in Hawaiian romance tales. The story of Lāʻieikawai  tells of five Maile sisters. Maile haʻi wale (brittle maile), Maile lau liʻi (small-leaved maile), Maile lau nui (large-leaved maile), Maile kaluhea (sweet-scented maile), and Maile pakaha (blunt-leaved maile).\nKauai's maile lau liʻi is often celebrated in song and chant.  The ʻōlelo noʻeau, Ka maile lau liʻi o Koʻiahi speaks of the \"fine-leaved\" maile of Kokeʻe, Kauaʻi which had one of the best and most fragrant maile lau liʻi in Hawaiʻi and was praised in old chants. Because maile was often placed on heiau in traditional times, the older generations of Hawaiians say that the fragrance of maile still lingers in those areas where heiau once stood or are still standing.\n\nPuna and Panaʻewa\nSeveral ʻōlelo noʻeau from the Hilo and Puna districts on Hawaiʻi Island paint a wonderfully fragrant picture of Puna and Panaʻewa.  Ka makani hali ʻala o Puna, the fragrance-bearing wind of Puna; Lei Hanakahi i ke ʻala me ke onaona o Panaʻewa, Hanakahi is adorned with the fragrance and perfume of Panaʻewa. These were both places that had a moist climate suitable for maile and other fragrant ferns, as well as the famous hala (Pandanus tectorius) from Puna.  The phrase Puna paia ʻala, fragrant walls of Puna, gives reference to the hīnano blossom which was famously hung inside hale of that district to scent the house.  People traveled to both Puna and Panaʻewa in order to pick maile, hence those areas being remembered as fragrant.\n\nMōlī\nMary Kawena Pukui tells a story from Kaʻū on Hawaiʻi Island of a beautiful young woman, Mōlī, whose father will let none other than a fisherman marry her (a good fisherman is well liked and prosperous because of the food he catches; it is also a sign of a much desired hard-working man).  A certain worthless fisherman who tricked Mōlī's father by rubbing fish guts (which were thrown out by others) on himself took her hand in marriage and did no work afterwards.  Driven to desperation, Mōlī decorated herself with a beautiful lei of ginger (Zingiber zerumbet), fern and maile and threw herself over the cliffs at Waiʻahukini.  It is said each year around the time of her death, Mōlī returns and when the wind blows, moaning and wailing can be heard.  The maile fragrance of her lei can also be smelled and if anyone goes there wearing a maile lei, they will be knocked to the ground.\n\nKeaoua Kekuaokalani\nKeaoua Kekuaokalani, a cousin to Liholiho (Kamehameha II), objected to the overturn of the kapu system and with supporters, they gathered together with weapons at the battle of Kuamoʻo in attempt to restore the kapu taken away.  Hawaiians from the area where the battle took place hold that the fragrance of maile worn by the Kekuaokalani's warriors into battle can still be smelled.\nPassage 8:\nLycium cooperi\nLycium cooperi is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family known by the common name peach thorn. It is native to the southwestern United States,  where it grows in a variety of desert and mountain habitat types. This is a bushy, erect shrub approaching a maximum height of 4 metres (13 ft) with many rigid, thorny branches. The branches are lined thickly with fleshy oval or widely lance-shaped leaves each 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) long and coated with glandular hairs. The inflorescence is a small cluster of tubular flowers roughly 1–2 centimetres (0.39–0.79 in) long including the calyx of fleshy sepals at the base. The flower is white or greenish with lavender or green veining. The corolla is a tube opening into a face with four or five lobes. The fruit is a yellow or orange berry under a centimeter wide containing many seeds.\nPassage 9:\nCeanothus velutinus\nCeanothus velutinus, with the common names snowbrush ceanothus, red root, and tobacco brush, is a species of shrub in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Colorado, where it grows in several habitat types including coniferous forest, chaparral, and various types of woodland.\n\nDescription\nCeanothus velutinus grows up to 4 meters tall but generally remains under three, and forms colonies of individuals which tangle together to form nearly impenetrable thickets. The aromatic evergreen leaves are alternately arranged, each up to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are oval in shape with minute glandular teeth along the edges, and shiny green and hairless on the top surface.\nThe plentiful inflorescences are long clusters of white flowers. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule a few millimeters long which snaps open explosively to expel the three seeds onto the soil, where they may remain in a buried seed bank for well over 200 years before sprouting. The seed is coated in a very hard outer layer that must be scarified, generally by wildfire, before it can germinate. Like most other ceanothus, this species fixes nitrogen via actinomycetes in its root nodules.\n\nUses\nDeer and elk browse the plant during winter.Some Plateau Indian tribes drank a boil of this plant to induce sweating as a treatment for colds, fevers, and influenza. Leaves were also used when rinsing to help prevent dandruff.Ceanothus velutinus was known as \"red root\" by many Native American tribes due to the color of the inner root bark, and was used as a medicine for treating lymphatic disorders, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, and tonsillitis.  Clinical studies of the alkaloid compounds in C. velutinus has verified its effectiveness in treating high blood pressure and lymphatic blockages.\nPassage 10:\nCeanothus sanguineus\nCeanothus sanguineus is a species of shrub in the family Rhamnaceae known by the common name redstem ceanothus. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Montana to far northern California; it is also known from Michigan. It grows in temperate coniferous forest habitat in forest openings amidst the conifers. This is an erect shrub approaching 3 meters in maximum height. Its stem is red to purple in color, its woody parts green and hairless when new. The deciduous leaves are alternately arranged and up to about 10 centimeters long. They are thin, light green, oval, and generally edged with glandular teeth. The undersides are sometimes hairy. The inflorescence is a cluster of white flowers up to about 12 centimeters long. The fruit is a three-lobed smooth capsule about 4 millimeters long. This shrub is an important food plant for wild ungulates such as the Rocky Mountain Elk, it is browsed eagerly by many types of livestock, and the seed is consumed by many types of animals.Their roots have nitrogen fixing nodules.", "answers": ["no"], "length": 2969, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ea0c46ce6d9b17006228bd28e9b29f09285b9f0d4fd646f2"}

The last two were inaugurated on 4 October 1807, and a substantial number of compositions involving all six organs were produced that year.\nShortly after their completion, the French invasion and the following exile of the Portuguese Court to Brazil led to the organs decaying for lack of maintenance. A decade later – possibly in connection with the prospect of the return of the Portuguese royal family – the six organs were subject to a major intervention. The intent of these works, undertaken by Machado e Cerveira, was not only to repair the instruments but also to enlarge them. Unfortunately, the works were interrupted a few years later (Machado e Cerveira died in 1828), and several items, such as the reassembling of the organ of São Pedro d’Alcântara, were left unfinished.Until 1998, the organs only received minor repairs. That year, the global restoration of the ensemble, entrusted to the Portuguese organ builder Dinarte Machado, began and was concluded in 2010. This project included the reconstruction of the organ of São Pedro d’Alcântara, incorporating all the materials recovered since it was disassembled around 1820.The six organs (two in the main chapel, two in the northern transept, and two in the southern transept), although different, have several common features. Some, like the horizontal reeds and the divided keyboard, are common among Iberian instruments of the time. Other features, like the short-resonator reeds, the Italian voce umana, and especially the double-wind chest, (allowing the quick cancellation of the plenum stops) are typical of the school of Cerveira and Fontanes.Currently, the pipe organs are played in concerts organized by the Palace of Mafra and the Municipality of Mafra. They are also played in the religious ceremonies held in the basilica, namely the processions of the season of Lent in Mafra.\nPassage 3:\nRandall Dunn\nRandall Dunn is an American record producer, audio engineer, composer, and musician.\nAs a music producer, he has worked with artists and filmmakers including Danny Elfman, Jim Jarmusch, Panos Cosmatos, Nathan Fielder, Benny Safdie, Guillermo Del Toro, Björk, Oneohtrix Point Never, Thurston Moore, Zola Jesus, Algiers, Sunn O))), SQÜRL, Six Organs of Admittance, Marissa Nadler, Boris, Anna Von Hausswolff, Pallbearer, Oren Ambarchi, Eyvind Kang, The Cave Singers, Akron/Family, Earth, Wolves in the Throne Room, and Jesse Sykes, among others. Pitchfork has described him as \"a go-to producer for metal but also for indie acts looking to add more edge and atmosphere.\"\n\nEarly life\nOriginally from Michigan, Dunn moved to Seattle in 1993 to explore his interest in film music. He attended the Art Institute of Seattle to study sound design for film, and formed connections with local musicians, including Skerik and Matt Chamberlain. In an interview, Dunn stated, \"I'm sort of a frustrated filmmaker that turned into a record producer. The people I met when I moved here spun me in a way that sent me down this path of treating sound the way I would have treated film.\"During his studies he received practical experience at Hanzsek Studios under the instruction of Jack Endino. He gradually became involved in the recording and producing of sessions.\n\nCareer\nRecord producer\nAs a fan of the band Naked City, Dunn contacted keyboardist Wayne Horvitz in Seattle who introduced him to Eyvind Kang. Dunn received his first credit for a session with Eyvind Kang, resulting in the piece \"5th NADE/Invisible Man\" on the 7 NADEs album released in 1996. His involvement resulted in a long-term friendship with Kang, through whom he met a number of musicians, mostly in the jazz-rock genre. Dunn was later introduced to the engineer Mell Dettmer and together they founded Aleph Studios.In 1998 he engineered the live portion of the album Bumpa by Critters Buggin, while he received a writing credit for his involvement with Mr. Birdy's Fryday by the Rockin' Teenage Combo. In 2001 he worked together with trumpet player Lesli Dalaba and guitarist Bill Horist, releasing the ambient album Zahir. He engineered Kang's 2002 album Live Low to the Earth, in the Iron Age.In 2005, he was credited as an engineer on the Impaled album Death After Life released through Century Media. In the same year, Dunn met Dylan Carlson of the band Earth in Seattle and recorded their fourth album, Hex; or Printing in the Infernal Method at Aleph Studios.After hearing his work with Asva, Stephen O'Malley contacted Dunn to produce the collaborative album between Sunn O))) and Boris, Altar. This began a long relationship with the band doing live sound and producing several of their albums including Monoliths & Dimensions and Kannon.In 2010, Dunn and Omar Souleyman entered the legendary ADA studio in Istanbul to record and produce a remix of Björk's \"Crystalline” which was released on her third remix album, Bastards, in 2012. In the same session, Dunn recorded a full-length Omar Souleyman album, which was not released.\nDunn began an ongoing collaboration with Native American glass artist Preston Singletary, whose work has been exhibited at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Singletary and Bernie Worrell (of Talking Heads and Funkadelic) began recording as Khu.éex’ under Dunn's musical direction in 2013.In 2017, Dunn entered the studio with Myrkur, producing her second album Mareridt.In 2018, Dunn produced Anna Von Hausswolff's fourth studio album, Dead Magic. The album was critically well received with  reviews highlighting Dunn's attention to capturing her vocal performance. Later that year, Dunn produced Cloud Nothings' fifth studio album, Last Building Burning.\nThe Association of Danish Music Critics nominated Randall Dunn for Producer of the Year in 2018 for his work with Sort Sol, Myrkur, and Childrenn.Following the release of Panos Cosmatos' Mandy, Dunn and Cosmatos conceived a fictional record made by the character Jeremiah Sand. Along with Milky Burgess, Dunn produced and co-wrote Jeremiah Sand's Lift It Down, which was issued by Sacred Bones in 2018. Pitchfork described the record as “[...] a forged artifact, an album recorded largely because those who created it had so much fun inhabiting its outlandish world.” The record featured Angel Deradoorian, Tad Doyle, Faith Coloccia (Mamiffer), Monika Knot (Zen Mother), and Marissa Nadler.On November 9, 2018, Dunn released his first solo studio album titled Beloved. It featured guest vocals from Frank Fisher of Algiers and Zola Jesus.Dunn produced American doom metal band Pallbearer's fourth album in 2020, Forgotten Days, which was released by Nuclear Blast and described by Consequence of Sound as \"Perhaps the best doom metal album of 2020\".In 2020, Dunn opened the studio Circular Ruin, along with Ben Greenberg and Arjan Miranda. Circular Ruin took its name after the eponymous Jorge Luis Borges story in which a surreal plot is revealed to have been dreamed. Dunn likens the act of music making to mystical themes within the Borges text; the group founded the studio as an invocation of a collective, metaphysical, and medicinal approach to music. Signifying this influence, the studio's logo is derived from the Jungian maze.Dunn and Ben Greenberg co-produced Algiers’ third studio album There Is No Year, issued by Matador Records in 2020. AllMusic described the record as “[...] extend[ing] the reach of their previous outings while offering a more strategically articulated, disciplined musicality without sacrificing their core sound or blunting their emotional impact.”Dunn produced Zola Jesus’ sixth studio album Arkhon, issued by Sacred Bones in 2022. The record featured drums by Matt Chamberlain, and was hailed by Pitchfork as “[...]a pleasantly shapeless record [... that] widens the scope of her music while retaining its primal, gothic spirit.”Dunn produced Silver Haze, the first full-length record from SQÜRL (Jim Jarmusch and Carter Logan), featuring performances from Charlotte Gainsbourg, Anika, and Mark Ribot. It will be released on May 5, 2023 by Sacred Bones.Danny Elfman's 2020 single \"Happy,\" his first solo pop single in nearly forty years, featured mixing by Dunn, as well as additional synth design.\n\nMaster Musicians of Bukkake\nIn addition to his work as a producer and engineer, Dunn is a keyboardist and founding member of the experimental group, Master Musicians of Bukkake. Dunn described the project as \"a way to escape how I make music in the studio when I'm doing records for people\".In 2004, alongside his bandmates, Dunn wrote, arranged and produced the first Master Musicians of Bukkake record, The Visible Sign of the Invisible Order. The album was released on Sun City Girls' label, Abduction Records and featured the musicians Eryn Young (vocals), James Davis, Don McGreevy, Alan Bishop, Charlie Gocher, and John Schuller.\n\nFilm and television\nIn the 2010s, Dunn's work as a record producer evolved into projects in film, including production and engineering, as well as composing and performance.\nDunn recorded several songs with Sun City Girls for the soundtrack to the 2007 Harmony Korine film Mister Lonely.In 2014, Dunn worked with Oren Ambarchi and Stephen O’Malley on scoring the short film Kairos by the Belgian filmmaker Alexis Destoop. It was released as Shade Themes from Kairos on Drag City in 2014.Dunn co-produced and composed additional music for the score to the Panos Cosmatos film Mandy, along with the late Jóhann Jóhannsson in 2018. The score won multiple awards for \"Best Original Score\" at the 2019 Austin Film Critics Association Awards, the 2019 Fangoria Chain Saw Awards, and the 2018 Seattle Film Critics Society Awards; it also received multiple nominations for \"Best Original Score\" at the 2018 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and the 2018 Hollywood Music in Media Awards.In 2021, Dunn produced Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe’s score to the Nia DaCosta film Candyman, with a screenplay by Jordan Peele. The score made the shortlist for the 2022 Academy Awards in the category of Best Original Score.In 2022, along with Úlfur Hansson, Dunn was the principal composer of the score for the television show Salvage Marines. In the same year, Dunn and Hansson composed the score for The Way of the Psychonaut, a documentary about the life and work of Stanislav Grof, founder of transpersonal psychology.Dunn was the musical director and producer of Daniel Lopatin’s score to The Viewing, the 2022 Panos Cosmatos episode of Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities. Under Lopatin's executive production at Circular Ruin Studio, Dunn contributed additional synthesizer arrangements.In 2022, Dunn produced Robert Ouyang Rusli's score for Julio Torres’ debut film Problemista, produced by Emma Stone, starring Tilda Swinton, and released by A24 in 2023.With Daniel Lopatin as the executive producer, Dunn produced the score for the Showtime series The Curse, co-created by Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie. The score was composed by jazz keyboardist John Medeski.Dunn produced the Khu.éex’ score for the documentary on the life and work of Preston Singletary.\n\nStyle\nWhen being offered to produce someone, Dunn prefers \"people to send the roughest demos possible rather than more elaborate ones. And I try to see if it's music that I – or my aesthetics – can work with. Like, with their vision, and the end goal\". He also pointed out that \"people themselves are a really big thing for me. I just try to find people that you can spend ten days with in a small room, still enjoy each other's music and company, and be collaborative\". As a musician, Dunn described himself \"as an arranger in the studio. (...) You have to think several steps ahead as a musician – tuning, performance, rhythm – you have to think about all these layers of how sounds work\".On several occasions, Dunn has expressed a preference for the use of analog recording equipment: \"I'm not a huge fan of the predictability of digitally processed music. But when you combine it with analog, you can get a cool medium. I rarely mix in the box [i.e., entirely digitally], or use Pro Tools [a common computerized editing software] to do mixes. Everything is hands-on with faders. I'll start with tape—if it's a rock band, recording to 16-track two-inch tape. It's a beautiful sound you don't hear much of any more. I like the hybrid approach with the soul of tape and the precision of digital.\"Dunn credits his open approach in the studio as being influenced by his studies of Buddhism and psychology.\n\nDiscography\nSolo studio albums\n\nBeloved (Figureight, 2018)Collaborative albums\n\nLesli Dalaba/Bill Horist/Randall Dunn, Zahir (Endless Records, 2001)\nOren Ambarchi/Stephen O'Malley/Randall Dunn, Shade Themes From Kairos (Drag City, 2014)As Master Musicians of Bukkake\n\nThe Visible Sign of the Invisible Order (Abduction, 2004)\nTotem One (Conspiracy Records, 2009)\nTotem Two (Important Records, 2010)\nTotem Three (Important Records, 2011)\nFar West (Important Records, 2013)\nFar West Quad Cult (Important Records, 2015)\n\nProduction credits\nPassage 4:\nThe Manifestation\nThe Manifestation is the seventh album release from experimental indie rock band, Six Organs of Admittance, released in 2004.

The band's name itself derives from the Hindu concept of Om, which refers to the natural vibration of the universe. Every album from  Pilgrimage onward features Eastern Orthodox iconography in the cover art.\nOm's first three albums feature Al Cisneros on vocals and bass and Chris Hakius on drums.\nOn December 5, 2007, Om performed in Jerusalem.

The title is taken from the song \"Pennies from Heaven\" written by Johnny Burke and Arthur Johnston. It was one of several Potter serials (another being The Singing Detective) to mix the reality of the drama with a dark fantasy content, and the earliest of his works where the characters burst into extended performances of popular songs.\n\nOverview\nHoskins became an established actor in the United Kingdom following his role in this serial. The serial was directed by Piers Haggard and produced by Potter collaborator Kenith Trodd. The series also featured Nigel Havers as Conrad Baker (the suave salesman), Jenny Logan as Irene (Joan's friend), Freddie Jones as Mr. Warner (Eileen's headmaster), Michael Bilton as Eileen's dad, Will Stamp as the Barman, Tudor Davies as the cafe customer (Davies was also choreographer for the series), and Peter Bowles as the Prosecuting Counsel.\nPennies was the last of Potter's television dramas to be filmed in the 'hybrid' format of studio videotape and location 16 mm film. The production involved six weeks of filming on location, most of it in Oxfordshire, with selected shooting in the Forest of Dean (in Potter's home county of Gloucestershire, between the River Severn and the River Wye). The school where Eileen teaches is the Forest school Potter attended in Berry Hill and the children who populate the school scenes were local children cast as extras. In temporary remission from his chronic condition of psoriatic arthropathy, a rare skin and joints disease that first afflicted him at the age of 24, Potter and his wife Margaret were able to visit the location shoot in Dean.\nPennies... was transmitted in six episodes of approximately 75 minutes each from 7 March to 11 April 1978, on BBC1 and first repeated later that year. In spring of the following year, Pennies won the British Academy Television Award for Most Original Programme (Hoskins & Campbell were also nominated for BAFTA acting awards). In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, Pennies from Heaven was placed at number 21.\n\nLegacy\nThe original television version was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004. The first and sixth episodes have an audio commentary from Haggard and Trodd.\nPotter's memorial service in November 1994 at St James's Church in Piccadilly began with those in attendance singing \"Roll Along Prairie Moon\" to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. Cheryl Campbell and Freddie Jones read their scene in the schoolroom from Pennies: \"As Jones stifled his tears, Campbell said: 'Nobody ever ever stops yearning' . . . In a comic interlude Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1, and Kenith Trodd, Potter's producer, read a scene from Pennies. [And Trodd] told of their last meeting before the playwright's death from cancer: 'Dennis slugging Courvoisier, fortified by liquid heroin and morphine . . . after an hour he seemed to crumple and he said, 'I do have one very real fear of death. It is that you might get asked to speak at my memorial service'.\"\n\nEpisodes\nFilm adaptation\nIn 1981, the series was adapted as a film, starring Steve Martin. Potter adapted his own screenplay, and Herbert Ross directed. Potter was nominated for the 1981 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay – according to The Times, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had him rewrite the script thirteen times. The movie was not successful at the box office, despite featuring Bernadette Peters (as Eileen), Christopher Walken (as Tom) and Vernel Bagneris (as 'the accordion man').\nMGM required Potter to buy back his copyright from the BBC (according to the same 1990 Times article, Potter paid the BBC \"something over $100,000\" for the script), and prohibited broadcast of the BBC production of Pennies for approximately ten years. In 1989, Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM. The BBC promptly rebroadcast Pennies in February 1990.\n\nSee also\nAl Bowlly, song composer used extensively throughout the series.\nPassage 8:\nDeep Dhillon\nDeep Dhillon is an Indian actor who works in Hindi and Punjabi cinema.

He played at Saint Joseph's University from 1982 to 1986 and was an Associated Press honorable mention All-American in his senior year.  The 1986 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, he was a three-time selection to both the All-Conference team and the All-Big 5 squad. He is one of five Saint Joseph's Hawks to be chosen in the first round of the NBA Draft (drafted by the Denver Nuggets, taken 16th overall) 1986 NBA draft. Martin played two seasons in the NBA, averaging 3.0 points per game in 69 games for the Nuggets. Martin was then selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, but never played for the team, and ended up retiring completely from the NBA at the age of just 24 due to chronic knee pain. He is still the only player from Sullivan County, NY to ever play in the NBA.\nFollowing his NBA career, he became a certified electrician and worked for the Pepsi Center for nearly 20 years as a supervisor that would transform the arena's playing surfacesIn 2016, he was diagnosed with Amyloidosis and as of 2020, is currently seeking a kidney transplant following complications of Amyloidosis.\nPassage 10:\nFrank Martin (cricketer)\nFrank Reginald \"Freddie\" Martin (12 October 1893 – 23 November 1967) was a West Indian cricketer who played in West Indies' first Test in their inaugural Test tour of England. \nA left-handed batsman and slow left-arm bowler born in Kingston, Jamaica, Martin played domestic cricket for Jamaica.

{"input": "Dichroa and Lathyrus, both native to Europe?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLathyrus aphaca\nLathyrus aphaca, known as the yellow pea or yellow vetchling, is an annual species in the family Fabaceae with yellow flowers and solitary, pea-like fruits. It originated in the Middle East and has spread throughout Europe and beyond as a weed of cultivated fields and roadsides. The fruits are eaten as a supplement to diets in some parts of South Asia but are narcotic and potentially toxic in large quantities.\n\nDescription\nLathyrus aphaca, known as the yellow pea or yellow vetchling, is an annual species in the family Fabaceae (formerly Leguminosae). Plants grow to about 100 cm tall, are pale green to glaucous, glabrous, and have angled but unwinged stems. The leaves are reduced to simple (unbranched) tendrils and what look like leaves are actually stipules, which are ovate-hastate in shape and up to 50 mm long. The flowers are usually solitary and yellow (often streaked with violet), 10–13 mm in length, and held on long (up to 50 mm) stalks branching from the leaf axils. The flowers, which are bisexual, have 10 stamens and 1 style. Lathyrus aphaca is diploid, with 14 chromosomes.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nIt is believed to have evolved in the Middle East, around Syria and Jordan, along with other leguminous species which have a centre of diversity in that region. Edible species of pea were first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent, while weeds such as L. aphaca are believed to have adapted naturally to an arable or similar human-disturbed habitat between about 23,000 and 11,000 years ago. Lathyrus aphaca itself has some advantages as a farmland weed, being able to fix nitrogen and thus help to fertilise the soil, as well as being edible in small quantities if present in the grain harvest, although it is narcotic when consumed in larger amounts.\nThe native habitat of L. aphaca is most likely to be the dry, limestone scrubland in the Middle East sometimes known as phrygana or garrigue. In these countries it is found in both wild and cultivated habitats. It can be an aggressive agricultural weed, infesting mainly wheat, but also other crops, such as sugarcane in Pakistan. The expansion of farming over the last 10,000 years allowed L. aphaca to increase its range to southern Asia, as far as Bangladesh, and southern Europe as far as Portugal and even the Azores. In these regions it is often considered native, but it is more likely that it is an ancient introduction, or archaeophyte, which has found a natural or semi-natural analogue of its phrygana habitat, where it can persist in the wild. In Portugal it is considered native only in the Calcareous Western Centre biome, despite being present throughout the country as an agricultural weed. It is more likely that it is a well-established archaeophyte there.\nIn northern Europe, L. aphaca has not generally found any semi-natural analogue of its native arid scrub habitat. In Poland it is described as occurring ‘in a different type of habitats, e.g. in the vegetation of forest edges representing the Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class, on dry lawns, transport route edges (especially along railway lines), in orchards, arable fields and fallows.'\nSince the early 20th century, it has gone into decline throughout Europe due to improved seed cleaning techniques, and it has largely been eradicated from cereal crops. In the Netherlands, it has declined by 75-100% since 1950, and in Germany and Poland there is a similar story. Meanwhile, however, it has become established as an agricultural weed further afield, in the United States, South Africa and Australia (GBIF, 2021).\n\nIn the United Kingdom\nIn Britain, L. aphaca has been recorded since 1632, when it was found by Thomas Johnson ‘near Gravesend.’ This is sufficiently early to earn it a place as either a native or a long-naturalised arable weed (archaeophyte), as opposed to a recent introduction neophyte. In the absence of any further information, therefore, British authors are free to describe it as a native or an introduced plant as they choose. A semi-natural habitat suggests that it is native, whereas an arable field says ‘archaeophyte’. Roadsides are difficult to interpret, and there are many weeds of roadsides which are considered native in various regions across Britain despite the obvious route of introduction. This uncertainty is nicely summed up by Rumsey, who writes ‘[it] may be a long-established introduction rather than a native species… and may have been introduced as a seed contaminant of leguminous crops.’ It is, however, usually treated as native and it is classified as VU (Vulnerable) in the Red List.In 2021 Natural England designated Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent a Site of Special Scientific Interest, partly for its population of yellow vetchling.\nPassage 2:\nLathyrus laevigatus\nLathyrus laevigatus is a flowering plant of the genus Lathyrus in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to middle, eastern, and southeastern Europe.\nPassage 3:\nLathyrus nissolia\nLathyrus nissolia, the grass vetchling or grass pea, is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is native to most of Europe, Maghreb, Levant and the Caucasus. Despite its common names, it is not a grass, but belongs to the legume family Fabaceae.\n\nDescription\nGrass vetchling is an annual plant, with an erect stem branching from the base, and growing to a height of about 2 feet (0.7 m). It is entirely without true leaves, leaflets or tendrils. The leaf stalk, however, is flattened out until it closely resembles a blade of grass ending in a fine point, and the stipules at its base greatly help the deception.The crimson flowers come out in June and July, and are rather small, solitary and borne on a very long footstalk. They have the ability to self-pollinate.The flowers are succeeded by long, slender, straight pods, which are at first very flat, but become cylindrical when the contained peas are fully developed.\n\nHabitat\nGrassland, banks and field margins on neutral to acid soil.\n\nDistribution\nThe species is rare in Scotland and very localised in England and Wales, though there are signs that it is currently spreading in the United Kingdom. Not recorded from Ireland.\nPassage 4:\nLathyrus hirsutus\nLathyrus hirsutus is a species of wild pea known by several common names, including Caley pea, singletary pea, hairy vetchling, and Austrian winter pea.  It is native to Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia, and it is known from other continents, including North America, as an introduced species.  This is an annual herb producing a winged stem and leaves each made up of two leaflike leaflets with a branching, coiled tendril.  The inflorescence holds one or two pink, blue, or bicolored pea flowers each 1 to 1.5 centimeters wide.  The fruit is a dehiscent legume pod covered in hairs with each hair growing from a minute bulbous base.  The rest of the plant is generally hairless.\nPassage 5:\nLathyrus\nLathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants\nin the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus.\n\nUses\nMany species are cultivated as garden plants. The genus includes the garden sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) and the perennial everlasting pea (Lathyrus latifolius). Flowers on these cultivated species may be rose, red, maroon, pink, white, yellow, purple or blue, and some are bicolored. They are also grown for their fragrance. Cultivated species are susceptible to fungal infections including downy and powdery mildew.\nOther species are grown for food, including the Indian pea (L. sativus) and the red pea (L. cicera), and less commonly cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.\n\nDiversity\nSpecies include:\n\nEcology\nLathyrus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the grey chi (Antitype chi) and the latticed heath (Chiasmia clathrata), both recorded on meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), and Chionodes braunella. Lathyrus growth abundance and size both decrease in response to increased temperatures in montane meadows.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Lathyrus at Wikimedia Commons\nCalflora Database: Lathyrus species index\nJepson Flora Project: Key to Lathyrus\nPassage 6:\nLathyrus sylvestris\nLathyrus sylvestris, the flat pea or narrow-leaved everlasting-pea, is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia.The narrow-leaved everlasting-pea forms a mat of herbage. The stems are winged. Each leaf is made up of two elongated leaflets. The flowers are pink. The fruit is a legume pod about 2 inches long.\n\nDescription\nThe narrow-leaved everlasting-pea is a perennial plant which can grow 200 cm (79 in) by climbing with its tendrils. Without any support it can reach about 75 cm (30 in) tall. The stem is floppy and flat with wide wings. The leaves are alternate with short winged stalks and stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with a single pair of narrow lanceolate leaflets with entire margins and three tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten pinkish-red flowers. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \"standard\", the lateral two as the \"wings\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \"keel\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long pod containing five to fifteen seeds.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe narrow-leaved everlasting-pea is native to parts of Africa, Europe and Asia. Its natural habitat is forest edges, sparse broad-leaved hillside forests, dry hillside meadows, hedgerows, embankments and waste ground. It uses its tendrils to scramble over plants, shrubs and the lower branches of trees.\n\nUses\nThis plant is sometimes used to control erosion and for this purpose it is generally planted along with a grass species. It can do well in highly disturbed habitat. There is a cultivar called 'Lathco'.\nPassage 7:\nDichroa\nDichroa is a genus of 12 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia. They are deciduous shrubs growing to 1–3 m tall, with their leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are produced in a broad inflorescence similar to that of the related genus Hydrangea. The fruit is a glossy metallic purple-blue berry.\nDichroa febrifuga (Chinese: 常山; pinyin: chángshān) is an important herb in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs.\nSelected speciesDichroa daimingshanensis Y.C.Wu\nDichroa febrifuga Lour.\nDichroa hirsuta Gagnep.\nDichroa mollissima Merrill\nDichroa versicolour\nDichroa yaoshanensis Y.C.Wu\nDichroa yunnanensis S.M.Hwang\nPassage 8:\nSweet pea\nThe sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus, is a flowering plant in the genus Lathyrus in the family Fabaceae (legumes), native to Sicily, southern Italy and the Aegean Islands.It is an annual climbing plant, growing to a height of 1–2 metres (3 ft 3 in – 6 ft 7 in), where suitable support is available. The leaves are pinnate with two leaflets and a terminal tendril, which twines around supporting plants and structures, helping the sweet pea to climb. In the wild plant the flowers are purple, 2–3.5 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) broad; they are larger and highly variable in color in the many cultivars. Flowers are usually strongly scented.\nThe annual species, L. odoratus, may be confused with the everlasting pea, L. latifolius, a perennial.\n\nHorticultural development\nScottish nurseryman Henry Eckford (1823–1905) cross-bred and developed the sweet pea, turning it from a rather insignificant if sweetly scented flower into a floral sensation of the 19th century.\nHis initial success and recognition came while serving as head gardener for the Earl of Radnor, raising new cultivars of pelargoniums and dahlias. In 1870 he went to work for one Dr. Sankey of Sandywell near Gloucester. A member of the Royal Horticultural Society, he was awarded a First Class Certificate (the top award) in 1882 for introducing the sweet pea cultivar 'Bronze Prince', marking the start of association with the flower. In 1888 he set up his development and trial fields for sweet peas in Wem in Shropshire. By 1901, he had introduced a total of 115 of the 264 cultivars grown at the time. Eckford was presented with the RHS Victoria Medal of Honour for his work. He died in 1906, but his work was continued for a time by his son John Eckford.\nMore recently, the association between the sweet pea, the Eckfords and Wem has been highlighted again. In the late 1980s, the Sweet Pea Society of Wem started an annual show. Many of the street signs now carry a sweet-pea motif, and an area of the town is known as Eckford Park. There is also a cultivar 'Dorothy Eckford', named after a family member.\n\nCultivation\nSweet peas have been cultivated since the 17th century and a vast number of cultivars are commercially available. They are grown for their flower colour (usually in pastel shades of blue, pink, purple and white, including bi-colours), and for their intense unique fragrance.  They are grown by gardeners for private enjoyment or for exhibition, and in the floristry trade. The large, pea-shaped seeds are sown in cold frames in Spring or Autumn.  The seeds benefit from pre-soaking or chipping with a sharp blade. The plants are also available later in the season, as young plants or plugs. They are grown up canes, with the new shoots being regularly pinched out to promote a bushy habit and higher flower yields. Plants typically reach heights of 1-2m, with the flowers appearing in midsummer and continuing for many weeks if regularly deadheaded.Over 50 cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nSee List of AGM sweet peas\n\nPests and diseases\nThe sweet pea plant does suffer from some pests, the most common being aphids. These insects suck the sap out of the plants, reducing growth. Mosaic virus is spread by greenfly, causing yellowing of leaves, distortion of new shoots, and inhibited flowering.\nA pest called the pollen beetle which is small, shiny and black, eats the pollen and disfigures the flowers. Other pests include caterpillars, thrips, slugs and snails. Another problem is mildew; this is a white powdery coating that covers the leaves and slows down growth. When sweet peas are planted too close to each other it causes fungal diseases like powdery mildew. Such fungus suck nutrients from sweet peas and stunt their growth.The sweet pea is also susceptible to ethylene in quantities produced by senescing plants. Because of this, growers are encouraged to plant sweet peas away from fruit trees among other plants prone to early dieback or senescence.\n\nToxicity\nUnlike the edible pea, there is evidence that seeds of members of the genus Lathyrus are toxic if ingested in quantity. A related species, Lathyrus sativus, is grown for human consumption but when it forms a major part of the diet it causes symptoms of toxicity called lathyrism.In studies of rats, animals fed a diet of 50% sweet pea seeds developed enlarged adrenals relative to control animals fed on edible peas. The main effect is thought to be on the formation of collagen. Symptoms are similar to those of scurvy and copper deficiency, which share the common feature of inhibiting proper formation of collagen fibrils. Seeds of the sweet pea contain beta-aminopropionitrile that prevents the cross-linking of collagen by inhibiting lysyl oxidase and thus the formation of allysine, leading to loose skin. Recent experiments have attempted to develop this chemical as a treatment to avoid disfiguring skin contractions after skin grafting.\n\nGenetics\nGregor Mendel is today recognized as the \"Father of Modern Genetics\" for his work with the cross breeding of pea plants (Pisum sativum) with different characteristics, and sweet pea has been used in a similar way. The sweet pea is thus a model organism being used in early experimentations in genetics, particularly by the pioneer geneticist Reginald Punnett. It is highly suitable as a genetic subject because of its ability to self-pollinate and its easily observed Mendelian traits such as colour, height and petal form. Many genetic principles were discovered or confirmed in this species. It was used by Punnett in early studies of genetic linkage. Complementary factor inheritance was also elucidated in sweet peas, from the cross of two pure-breeding white strains which gave rise to a blue hybrid, the blue colour requiring two genes derived independently from the two white parents.\n\nHybridization with Lathyrus belinensis\nLike the blue rose, the yellow sweet pea remains elusive. Lathyrus belinensis is a related Lathyrus species which has red and yellow flowers. There are ongoing attempts to bring the yellow color into Lathyrus odoratus by crossing it with Lathyrus belinensis. Several new sweet pea cultivars have been created as a result, though not any with the yellow flower color so far.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of AGM sweet peas - list of sweet peas that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit\nPassage 9:\nLathyrus cicera\nLathyrus cicera is a species of wild pea known by the common names red pea, red vetchling and flatpod peavine. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and it is known from other places as an introduced species. This is a hairless annual herb producing a slightly winged stem. The leaves are each made up of two leaflike linear leaflets 3 to 6 centimeters (1.2 to 2.4 in) long. They also bear branched, curling tendrils. The inflorescence holds a single pea flower 1 to 1.5 centimeters (0.39 to 0.59 in) wide which is a varying shade of red. The fruit is a hairless dehiscent legume pod.\nThis is one pea species known to cause lathyrism; nevertheless, as cicerchia it figured among the comestibles enjoyed by the fortunate Milanese, listed at length by Bonvesin de la Riva in his \"Marvels of Milan\" (1288).\nPassage 10:\nLathyrus vernus\nLathyrus vernus, the spring vetchling, spring pea, or spring vetch, is a species of flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the genus Lathyrus, native to forests of Europe and Siberia. It forms a dense clump of pointed leaves with purple flowers in spring, shading to a greenish-blue with age.This species, and the cultivar 'Alboroseus', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nDescription\nLathyrus vernus is a perennial plant with an upright stem without wings. The stem grows to 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) and is erect and nearly hairless. The leaves are alternate with short stalks and large, wide stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with two to four pairs of ovate tapering  leaflets with blunt tips, entire margins and no tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten purplish-red flowers, each 13 to 20 mm (0.5 to 0.8 in) long, turning bluer as they age. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \"standard\", the lateral two as the \"wings\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \"keel\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long brown pod up to 60 mm (2.4 in) in length containing eight to fourteen seeds which are poisonous. This plant flowers early in the year, in May and June. It can be distinguished from bitter vetch (L. linifolius) and black pea (L. niger) by the breadth of its ovate leaflets. It does not wither after flowering but continues to grow until autumn.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLathyrus vernus is native to Europe and parts of northern Asia. Its typical habitat is broad-leaved woodland, forest margins, plantations and clearings.", "answers": ["no"], "length": 3332, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c4060a84a9f2595ffbb355e4a5cc6dea19235ab2adb3156d"}
{"input": "What occupation have Carly Gullickson and Francesca Schiavone both held?", "context": "Passage 1:\nFrancesca Schiavone\nFrancesca Schiavone (Italian pronunciation: [franˈtʃeska skjaˈvoːne]; born 23 June 1980) is an Italian former tennis player. She turned professional in 1998 and won the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles. She was also runner-up at the 2011 French Open. Her career-high ranking is world No. 4, achieved on 31 January 2011. To date, Schiavone is the last one-handed-backhand player to win a Grand Slam title on the women's tour.She won eight career singles titles in total, seven on the WTA Tour and one at Roland Garros. In doubles, her career-high ranking is world No. 8, peaking with an appearance in the final of the 2008 French Open. Furthermore, she helped Italy to win the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009 and 2010, and has the most wins for the Italian team.\nSchiavone played in the longest ever women's singles match at a Grand Slam tournament, when she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6–4, 1–6, 16–14 in the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open women's singles draw, the match lasted 4 hours and 44 minutes and in the process secured her first and only quarterfinal at the Australian Open.On 5 September 2018, Schiavone announced her retirement from tennis at the US Open. During the announcement, she shared aspirations of winning a Grand Slam as a coach. In April 2021, Schiavone began coaching Petra Martić.\n\nPersonal life\nSchiavone was born in Milan to Franco Schiavone, from Manocalzati in the Province of Avellino, Campania, Southern Italy, and to Luiscita Minelli, from Bornato in the Province of Brescia, Northern Italy.\n\nPlaying style\nSchiavone employs an all-court game and has a very classic approach to her clay game. She uses an extreme eastern grip on her one-handed backhand. Chris Fowler and Brad Gilbert described her forehand as a \"buggy whip.\"\n\nEndorsements\nSchiavone was endorsed by multiple companies throughout her professional career. From 2004, she was endorsed by Diadora for clothing and apparel, before switching to Lotto in 2007. She switched to Adidas in 2013; due to a series of poor results, she was dropped by the company, moving to Asics in 2014, remaining with Asics for the rest of her professional career. For racquets, Schiavone used Yonex racquets until 2006; in that year, she switched to Babolat, using the Pure Aero racquet until her retirement in 2018.\n\nProfessional career\nSchiavone won eight singles titles and also achieved eleven runner-up positions, eight of them since the autumn of 2005. She lost her first eight career finals on the WTA Tour before finally winning her first title in July 2007. She and her Italian teammates Mara Santangelo, Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci beat the Belgian team 3–2 in the 2006 Fed Cup final. Justine Henin had to retire in the fifth and final match due to an injury in her right knee, which let Italy win their first Fed Cup trophy. This match was a doubles match and Kirsten Flipkens partnered Henin, and Roberta Vinci partnered Schiavone. In 2009, she won the Fed Cup with Italy for the second time against the US, and also made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time. In 2010, Italy with Schiavone won the Fed Cup for the third time.\nIn addition, she realized a notable victory during the quarterfinals of the 2008 Dubai Open, when she upset world No. 1 and four-time champion Henin 7–6, 7–6. She also beat Amélie Mauresmo in a Fed Cup tie in 2006 when Mauresmo was ranked No. 1.\nPartnering with Australian Casey Dellacqua, Schiavone was the runner-up in the women's doubles competition at the 2008 French Open where they lost to Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual. Schiavone also reached the semifinals of the doubles event at the other three Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n2010: First major title at Roland Garros\nAt the Australian Open, Francesca defeated Frenchwomen Alizé Cornet 0–6, 7–5, 6–0, and Julie Coin 6–3, 6–4 first before upsetting No. 10 seed Agnieszka Radwańska 6–2, 6–2. Though she matched her best results there (round four), she went on to lose to No. 6 seed Venus Williams after winning the first set, 6–3, 2–6, 1–6.\nShe beat Alberta Brianti, Tathiana Garbin, Carla Suárez Navarro, Yaroslava Shvedova, and Roberta Vinci all in straight sets to win her third WTA title at the Barcelona Ladies Open.\nSeeded 17th entering the French Open, Schiavone was lightly regarded as a contender for the championship. She defeated Regina Kulikova, Sophie Ferguson, 11th seed Li Na, and 30th seed Maria Kirilenko to reach her first French Open quarterfinal since 2001 (where she had lost to Martina Hingis). There, she defeated world No. 3, Caroline Wozniacki, in straight sets to become the first Italian woman to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles event.\nThe semifinals of the French Open consisted of four players (Jelena Janković, Elena Dementieva, Samantha Stosur and Schiavone) who had never won a Grand Slam singles event; nevertheless, most in the tennis community, including ESPN's tennis commentary team of Mary Joe Fernández, Patrick McEnroe, and Brad Gilbert singled out Schiavone as the one player who was not a serious contender to win the title. In the semifinals, Schiavone defeated world No. 5 and 2004 finalist, Dementieva (she retired in the second set with a torn calf muscle having lost the first set in a tiebreaker), and the victory made Schiavone the first Italian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, and assured that she would become a top-ten player for the first time following the tournament.\nIn the final, Schiavone faced Stosur in a rematch of their first-round meeting at the 2009 French Open which Stosur had won easily (6–4, 6–2). Because of this previous result, and Stosur's victories over four-time French Open champion Justine Henin, world No. 1 Serena Williams and world No. 4 Janković en route to the final, Stosur was considered a heavy favorite. However, on 5 June 2010, Schiavone defied expectations to become the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, beating Stosur 6–4, 7–6. The victory made her only the third Italian player to win a Grand Slam event in singles, after Nicola Pietrangeli and Adriano Panatta. She also became the oldest woman to win a first Grand Slam title in the Open Era, beating the previous record by Jana Novotná. The victory also meant she rose to No. 6 in the world rankings on 7 June 2010 and became the highest-ranked Italian woman ever, after Flavia Pennetta reached world No. 10 in 2009.\nSchiavone's next event was Eastbourne, where she lost in the first round to Sorana Cîrstea, 5–7, 3–6. As the fifth seed at Wimbledon, due to the pre-tournament withdrawal of Dementieva, she lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round, 7–6, 5–7, 1–6.\nSchiavone reached the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup, where she fell to top seed Caroline Wozniacki. She was the sixth seed at the US Open, and defeated Ayumi Morita, Maria Elena Camerin, 29th seed Alona Bondarenko, and 20th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2003 (where she had lost to Jennifer Capriati).

A prominent feature of the complex is a pair of circular silos, set close to the road junction in front of one of the barns.The history of these farm properties dates to the early 18th century, and the earliest period of New Milford's settlement.  Daniel Hine, a native Milford, settled in New Milford in 1737, and soon had a farm established here.  Abel Buckingham began farming land adjacent to Hines's in 1775.  The oldest of the three surviving houses was built about 1760 by Daniel Hines.  By the mid-19th century, both families were engaged in  dairy farming, sending their products to market via the Housatonic Railroad.  The Hines farm was sold out of the family in 1908, while that of the Buckinghams remained in that family until 1972, when it was sold to the Hendersons.

{"input": "Simone de Beauvoir partnered with the person whose journal would be called what?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLes Temps modernes\nLes Temps Modernes (lit. 'Modern Times') is a French journal, founded by Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Its first issue was published in October 1945.  It was named after the 1936 film by Charlie Chaplin.Les Temps Modernes filled the void left by the disappearance of the most important pre-war literary magazine, La Nouvelle Revue Française (The New French Review), considered to be André Gide's magazine, which was shut down by the authorities after the liberation of France because of its collaboration with the occupation.Les Temps Modernes was first published by Gallimard and was last published by Gallimard. In between, the magazine changed hands three times: Julliard (January 1949 to September 1965), Presses d'aujourd'hui (October 1964 to March 1985), Gallimard (from April 1985). Les Temps Modernes ceased publication in 2019, after 74 years.\n\nEarly history\nThe first editorial board consisted of Sartre (director), Raymond Aron, Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Leiris, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Albert Ollivier, and Jean Paulhan. All published many articles for the magazine. Sartre's contributions included \"La nationalisation de la littérature\" (\"The Nationalisation of Literature\"), \"Matérialisme et révolution\" (\"Materialism and Revolution\"), and \"Qu'est-ce-que la littérature?\" (\"What is Literature?\"). Simone de Beauvoir first published Le Deuxième Sexe (\"The Second Sex\") in Les Temps Modernes.In the preface to the first edition, Sartre stated the review's purpose: to publish littérature engagée. This philosophy of literature expresses a basic creed of existentialism—that an individual is responsible for making conscious decisions to commit socially useful acts. Thus, literature in the magazine would have a utilitarian component; it would not be just culturally valuable (\"art for art's sake\"). Other intellectuals, such as André Gide, André Breton, and Louis Aragon, disapproved of this orientation.  Sartre's response: \"Le monde peut fort bien se passer de la littérature. Mais il peut se passer de l'homme encore mieux.\" (\"The world can easily get along without literature. But it can get along even more easily without man.\")The works of many writers appeared in Les Temps Modernes. They include Richard Wright, Jean Genet, Nathalie Sarraute, Boris Vian, and Samuel Beckett.Political divisions between board members soon surfaced. Raymond Aron quit in 1945 because of the magazine's Communist sympathies, becoming an editor at Le Figaro. At the time of the Korean War of 1950–1953, Merleau-Ponty resigned. Originally more supportive of Communism than Sartre, he moved progressively to the right as Sartre moved to the left. At the time, Sartre still endorsed Communism in his writings but in private expressed his reservations.Sartre disapproved of Camus for seeing both sides in the Algerians' rebellion against their French colonial masters (The Algerian War—1954–62). In his bitterness against Camus, Sartre selected Francis Jeanson, who did not like the works of Camus, to review the Camus essay L'Homme Révolté (The Rebel). When Camus responded to the review with hurt feelings, Sartre put the final blow to a friendship that had lasted for years. He said, \"Vous êtes devenu la proie d'une morne démesure qui masque vos difficultés intérieures. ... Tôt ou tard, quelqu'un vous l'eût dit, autant que ce soit moi.\" (\"You have become the victim of an excessive sullenness that masks your internal problems. ... Sooner or later, someone would have told you, so it might as well be me.\")\n\n1960–2019\nLes Temps Modernes enjoyed its greatest influence in the 1960s. At this time, it had more than 20,000 subscribers. During the Algerian War (1954–1962) it strongly supported the National Liberation Front, the primary group in the ultimately successful battle against the French. It fiercely denounced the extensive use of torture by French forces, opposed de Gaulle's government, and supported desertion and resistance to conscription. The journal printed testimonies by French soldiers denouncing the war and torture from 1958 to 1962. For this, it was censured and its premises seized.From its inception the review has published many special issues. These include Sartre's 1946 description of the United States, an attempt to discredit the myths that many of the French held about this country. In 1955, Claude Lanzmann described Sartre's Marxist philosophy in an issue called  \"La Gauche\" (\"The Left\"). An issue on \"La révolte hongroise\" (\"The Hungarian Rebellion\") (1956–57) denounced Soviet repression. In 1967, at the time of the Six-Day War, an issue, \"Le conflit israélo-arabe\" (\"The Israeli-Arab conflict\"), contained articles by both Israelis and Arabs. In 1977, North African writers led by Abdelkebir Khatibi published the edition Du Maghreb. In 2001, a special edition was devoted to Serge Doubrovsky.From 2016, the chief editor of Les Temps Modernes was Claude Lanzmann until his death on 5 July 2018, after a short illness. The editorial board consisted of Juliette Simont (Editorial Assistant to Lanzmann), Adrien Barrot, Jean Bourgault, Joseph Cohen, Michel Deguy, Liliane Kandel, Jean Khalfa, Patrice Maniglier, Robert Redeker, Marc Sagnol, Gérard Wormser, and Raphael Zagury-Orly. It was published bimonthly.In 2019, following Lanzmann's death, Les Temps Modernes ceased publishing, after 74 years.\nPassage 2:\nAnne Looby\nAnne Looby is an Australian actress, producer and stage director.

She is a philosophy professor.  The meeting between the two women was recounted in the book Tout compte fait, which Simone de Beauvoir dedicated to Le Bon.\nLe Bon was one of the women that de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre cared and provided for. Sylvie Le Bon and Simone de Beauvoir met in 1960, when Le Bon was 17 and de Beauvoir was 52. De Beauvoir legally adopted Le Bon in 1980, making her the sole executor of her will.After the death of Simone de Beauvoir in 1986, Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir published several volumes of letters:\n\nLettres à Sartre - an anthology of the letters between Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre\nLettres à Nelson Algren\nCorrespondance croisée (Simone de Beauvoir and Jacques-Laurent Bost)\nAnne, ou quand prime le spirituel (republication of Simone's first novel)\nPassage 4:\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nOlga Kosakiewicz (Ukrainian: Ольга Козакевич; 6 November 1915 – 1983) was a French theater actress.\n\nBiography\nShe and her sister Wanda Kosakiewicz were born in Kyiv as daughters of the Frenchwoman Marthe Kosakiewicz and the Belarusian emigrant from Kyiv Victor Kosakiewicz. After the October Revolution, the family migrated to L'Aigle, where the father acquired and operated a saw mill.\nOlga Kosakiewicz visited the Lycée Joan of Arc in Rouen, where she was taught by Colette Audry and in 1932 presented to Simone de Beauvoir, in  1934  when Jean-Paul Sartre returned from a study visit from the German Reich she was also presented to him. At the end of the school year 1934 she passed her Baccalauréat as best. From autumn 1934 to 1936 she studied medicine at the University of Rouen, then lived in Paris. From 1934 to 1935 Beauvoir and from 1935 to 1937 Sartre had an affair with her. Her irrepressible, rebellious character, characterized by emotional high and low, her authenticity and spontaneity charmed Sartre and Beauvoir.\nShe joined the circle of de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. \nIn de Beauvoir's first novel L'Invitée, she and her sister, Wanda, were fused together to make the character of the younger friend Xavière, to form with the actress Françoise and the actor, director Pierre a ménage à trois.Olga, along with Bianca Lamblin and Natalie Sorokin, later stated that their \"trio\" relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.A motivation of Sartre to write the play The Flies was to give Kosakiewicz an opportunity for a debut as a theater actress. The Flies should have premiered at the Comédie-Française, but the intendant Jean-Louis Barrault did not agree to Sartre's condition that Olga Kosakiewicz should assume the role of Electra. So it was premiered on June 3, 1943 at the Théâtre de la Cité internationale (aka Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt).\nIn 1946 in Simone de Beauvoir's unique Drama Les Bouches inutiles she played Clarice the daughter  of Catherine and Louis d'Avesnes the main characters.\nIn Sartre's trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to Freedom), the character of Ivich is considered a representation of Olga. Deirdre Bair's biography of Simone de Beauvoir examines this relationship. Hazel Rowley also discusses it at length in her book about the relationship between Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre.\nIn 1946 Olga married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a long-time lover of de Beauvoir. She died of tuberculosis in 1983.\n\nSee also\nBianca Lamblin\nNatalie Sorokin\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity (French: Pour une morale de l'ambiguïté) is Simone de Beauvoir's second major non-fiction work.  It was prompted by a lecture she gave in 1945, after which she claimed that it was impossible to base an ethical system on her partner Jean-Paul Sartre's major philosophical work Being and Nothingness (French: L'Être et le néant). The following year, over a six-month period, she took on the challenge, publishing the resulting text first as installments in Les Temps modernes and then, in November 1947, as a book.\n\nContents\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity consists of three parts and a short conclusion.\n\nPart I\n\"Ambiguity and Freedom,\" lays out the philosophical underpinnings of Beauvoir's stance on ethics.  She asserts that a person is fundamentally free, a freedom that comes from one's own \"nothingness,\" which is an essential aspect of one's ability to be self-aware, to be conscious of oneself: \"... the nothingness which is at the heart of man is also the consciousness that he has of himself.\" But each person is also a thing, a \"facticity,\" an object for others. The ambiguity is that each of us is both subject and object, freedom and facticity. As free, we have the ability to take note of ourselves and choose what to do. As factic, we are constrained by physical limits, social barriers and the expectations and political power of others.\nBeauvoir rejects any notion of an absolute goodness or moral imperative that exists on its own. \"...there exists no absolute value before the passion of man, outside of it, in relation to which one might distinguish the useless from the useful.\" Values come only from our choices.Human freedom can be only in concrete projects, not in the abstract. Freedom \"requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects.\"The types of particular content that are suitable are discussed in Part III.\n\nPart II\nPart II, \"Personal Freedom and Others,\" examines a number of different ways that people try to deny their freedom, as freedom can be uncomfortable and disquieting.  The freedom to choose entails the freedom to try to avoid one's freedom.  Before we can even do that, however, we start as children, who take the values of the adults around them as ready-made things.  She calls this the attitude of \"seriousness,\" in which the child \"escapes the anguish of freedom\" by thinking of values as existing objectively, outside themselves, rather than as an expression of their freedom. Once past childhood, one can be a sub-man who avoids all questions of freedom and assumes themselves not free.  The next rung up the hierarchy is the serious man who \"gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned,\" in effect reverting to a kind of childhood. Both the sub-man and the serious man refuse to recognize that they are free, in the sense of being able to choose their own values.\nSeveral other types recognize their freedom, but misuse it.  The nihilist, having failed at life, decides not to try anything at all.  \"Conscious of being unable to be anything, man then decides to be nothing. ... Nihilism is disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself.\" The adventurer is one who engages vigorously in various life projects, but without caring for the goal.  The adventurer \"does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake.\" And they trample on others in the process: \"[T]he adventurer shares the nihilist’s contempt for men.\" Finally the passionate man cares enthusiastically about his goal, but shares a similar contempt for others: \"Not intending his freedom for men, the passionate man does not recognize them as freedoms either. He will not hesitate to treat them as things.\"And finally there is genuine freedom, which takes the excitement of the adventurer and the passion of the passionate man and includes with them a concern for other people, other freedoms, as well. \"Passion is converted to genuine freedom only if one destines his existence to other existences.\"  \"To will oneself free is also to will others free.\"\n\nPart III\nPart III, \"The Positive Aspect of Ambiguity,\" examines the intricacies and nuances of genuinely free action in the world.  It includes five sections.\n\nPart III, Section 1, \"The Aesthetic Attitude,\" criticizes the attitude of detached contemplation as being unworkable.Part III, Section 2, \"Freedom and Liberation,\" explores the evils of oppression and offers a number of trenchant observations about the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed.  The oppressor recognizes the interdependence of people, but treats those of the oppressed class as things, not as free human existents in their own right. To prevent them from rebelling, the oppressor tries to mystify them into thinking that the oppressive situation is just natural.  But it is not, and \"the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt ....\"Part III, Section 3, \"The Antinomies of Action,\" examines the need for violence and its consequent moral quandaries. \"In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries.\" Under what circumstances, then, is violence justified?  Under what circumstances may the oppressed treat the oppressors as less than fully human in order to secure their own liberation? Beauvoir considers in some detail the nuances and difficulties of such considerations.Part III, Section 4, \"The Present and the Future,\" treats the relationship of action in the present to achieve an uncertain goal in the future. The determinism suggested by the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx is considered and criticized.Part III, Section 5, \"Ambiguity,\" returns to the originating theme of the work, that each individual is both radically free, able to transcend themself, and factical, constrained by that which just is what it is.  How does one remain true to one's freedom while allowing others their own freedom, even if they make mistakes?  Are we justified in telling the truth when another person finds the truth unbearable?  We have to act in particular situations, \"inventing an original solution\" each time, but remembering that \"man is man only through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact.\"The brief Conclusion sums up Beauvoir's view of human freedom: \"... we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite.\" She ends with a call for us to realize and act on this fundamental truth of our existence.\nPassage 6:\nSimone de Beauvoir Prize\nThe Simone de Beauvoir Prize (French: Prix Simone de Beauvoir pour la liberté des femmes) is an international human rights prize for women's freedom, awarded since 2008 to individuals or groups fighting for gender equality and opposing breaches of human rights. It is named after the French author and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, known for her 1949 women's rights treatise The Second Sex.The prize was founded by Julia Kristeva on 9 January 2008, the 100th anniversary of de Beauvoir's birth. \nSylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir and Pierre Bras are the head of the Simone de Beauvoir prize committee.According to the organizers:\n\nThe prize is awarded every year to a remarkable personality whose courage and thoughts are examples for everybody, in the spirit of Simone de Beauvoir who wrote: \"The ultimate end, for which human beings should aim, is liberty, the only capable [thing], to establish every end on.\"\n\nRecipients\n2008 – Taslima Nasreen, Bangladeshi writer, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Dutch feminist, writer and politician.\n2009 –  One Million Signatures, a campaign by the Women's rights movement in Iran, demanding changes to discriminatory laws in Iran.\n2010 – Ai Xiaoming, Chinese videographer and professor at Sun Yat-sen University, and Jianmei Guo, Chinese lawyer and founder of the Women's Law Studies and Legal Aid Center at the Peking University School of Law.\n2011 – Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Russian novelist and civil rights activist\n2012 – Association tunisienne des femmes démocrates\n2013 – Malala Yousafzai,  Pakistani student, blogger and activist.\n2014 – Michelle Perrot, French historian \n2015 – National Museum of Women in the Arts\n2016 – Mayor of Lampedusa Guisi Nicolini for her involvement with the integration of immigrants on the island.\n2017 – Polish association 'Save Women'. Barbara Nowacka accepted the prize.\n2018 – Aslı Erdoğan, Turkish writer\n2019 – Sara García Gross, Salvadoran activist\nPassage 7:\nWhen Things of the Spirit Come First\nWhen Things of the Spirit Come First is Simone de Beauvoir's first work of fiction. It consists of five short stories woven together in a way that is structurally similar to a more traditional novel.\nBeauvoir submitted this collection of interlinked stories to a publisher in 1937. But it was turned down by both Gallimard and Grasset. Gallimard eventually published it in 1979. The first English translation came out from Pantheon in 1982.The first story, \"Marcelle\", tells the story of the oldest of three siblings. She marries an abusive artist. The second, \"Chantal\", tells the story of a lycee philosophy teacher. She idealizes her life and becomes involved in the lives of her students but ultimately refuses to help them. \"Lisa\" is the third and shortest story, about a girl who struggles to live a spiritual life while existing in a physical body. \"Anne\", the fourth story, is the result of many of de Beauvoir's earlier attempts at writing. It parallels the story of her friend Elizabeth Mabille (Zaza) who died soon after her mother refused to allow her to marry Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The final story, \"Marguerite\" expresses the existential views that de Beauvoir herself believed that life itself should be experienced and one should \"look things straight in the face, without accepting oracles or ready-made values.\"\nPassage 8:\nBianca Lamblin\nBianca Lamblin (born Bienenfeld; 1921 – 5 November 2011) was a French writer who had affairs with philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir for a number of years. In her book Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée (published in English as A Disgraceful Affair), she wrote that, while a student at Lycée Molière, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s. In correspondence between Sartre and Beauvoir, the pseudonym Louise Védrine was used when referring to Bianca in Lettres au Castor and Lettres à Sartre.\n\nBiography\nBianca Lamblin was born in 1921 in Lublin, to Jewish parents. She was a cousin of the French writer Georges Perec. In 1937, her teacher was Simone de Beauvoir. She also met Sartre at this time. In Paris, Bianca was friends with Jean Kanapa, Yvonne Picard, Raoul Lévy and Bernard Lamblin. She married Bernard Lamblin and they had two children. Bianca became a teacher, and after Simone de Beauvoir's death, Bianca wrote Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée.\n\nBibliography\nMémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée (1994, LGF - Livre de Poche; ISBN 978-2253135937/2006, Balland; ISBN 978-2-7158-0994-9)\n\nSee also\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nNatalie Sorokin\nPassage 9:\nHélène de Beauvoir\nHenriette-Hélène de Beauvoir (6 June 1910 – 1 July 2001) was a French painter. She was the younger sister of philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Her art was exhibited in Europe, Japan, and the US. She married Lionel de Roulet.When Hélène de Beauvoir lived in Goxwiller, a village near Strasbourg, she became president of the center for battered women. She continued painting until she was 85. Her paintings were related to feminist philosophy and women's issues.\nPassage 10:\nNatalie Sorokin\nNatalie Sorokin (also Sorokine; 1921–1967) was a French woman who had relations with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job after seducing her 17-year-old lycée pupil in 1939. Sorokin, along with Bianca Lamblin and Olga Kosakiewicz, later stated that their relationships with Sartre and de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.\n\nExistential life with Simone de Beauvoir\nIn June 1943 Sorokin's mother complained to the school authorities that Beauvoir had led her daughter astray. Beauvoir was accused of behavior leading to the corruption of a minor and her teaching license was suspended for the rest of her life. Sorokin later said her relationship with Beauvoir and Sartre came to an end when she found this relationship serving only one party.\n\nLater life\nAfter recovering from her trauma, Sorokin started writing and worked for radio. She later married Ivan Moffat, a friend of Beauvoir and Sartre's and son of the British actress and poet Iris Tree and artist and photographer Curtis Moffat. Their marriage was brief and produced one daughter.\n\nSee also\nOlga Kosakiewicz\nBianca Lamblin", "answers": ["Les Temps modernes"], "length": 3757, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a5c3e979e6783cb02797f4da64154ae9c1ec36dc5f39ea53"}
{"input": "Who created the term that the author of A Piece of Danish Happiness uses to explain why Danish people are the happiest in the world?", "context": "Passage 1:\nJesper Langballe\nJesper Marquard Langballe (31 August 1939 – 15 March 2014) was a Danish Lutheran priest, author and politician who represented the right-wing populist Danish People's Party (Danish: Dansk Folkeparti) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget, from 2001 to 2011. Langballe was elected in the Viborg constituency. His son Christian Langballe was elected to the Folketinget in 2011.\n\nBiography\nLangballe was born in Copenhagen as the son of physician Mogens Marquard Langballe and housewife Agnete Langballe, née Wolfhagen. He is the cousin of Søren Krarup, another MP for Dansk Folkeparti.\nHe was educated as a journalist at Skive Venstreblad 1959-61 and Ringkøbing Amts Dagblad 1962-63 and as a priest at the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs institute 1972-75. He worked as a journalist at Jyllands-Posten 1964-72 as cultural reporter and back page editor doing political satire. Later he worked as a priest in Thorning-Grathe parish 1975–2007. He has since 1982 been a co-editor and writer at the fundamentalist Lutheran religious periodical Tidehverv.\n\nViews on church politics\nLangballe has been spokesman on church affairs for the Danish People's Party in the last few years and has positioned himself as a strong proponent for the privileged status of the Danish National Church (Danish: Folkekirken) and its close connection to the state, described in the Danish constitution.\nIn this context he has, for instance, stated as follows about the wishes of the Catholic church in Denmark to have its member contributions collected alongside state taxes, like the state Lutheran Church of Denmark:\n\nThe tax collection is a part of the state backing, and it shall not be provided for other religious communities. If you start doing this, then what about other private associations? In this context we are talking about an association with a religious purpose. But it might as well be a handball club.\n\nViews on Islam and muslims\nIn January 2010, Jesper Langballe defended controversial statements by Lars Hedegaard, chairman of Trykkefrihedsselskabet (the Free Press Society), in the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende stating that:\n\nOf course Lars Hedegaard should not have said that we see muslim fathers raping their daughters, when the reality rather seems to be that they simply kill them (the so called honor killings) – and besides that turn a blind eye to uncles raping them.\n\nThese controversial statements were later to be moderated by Langballe following pressure from party chairman Pia Kjærsgaard, and he expressed his regrets about the phrasing - while he still supported the general message of the statement. During the general uproar following the statements, city council member in Viborg for the Danish People's Party, Rikke Cramer Christiansen, decided to leave the party in protest.\n\nFear of islamization and self-censorship\nIslam and islamization is seen by Jesper Langballe as an imminent threat to Denmark and Europe:\n\nIslam and Christianity cannot be reconciled. And they haven't been able to during the 1500 years that Islam has been in existence. I see the religion Islam as a threat to any society where it settles.\n\nAs a member of the Danish parliament I have eagerly contributed to integration work and I wish it all the best. But you shouldn't, trying to help integration, subject yourself to self-censorship and stop talking about real problems.\nIf islamization is allowed to go on unhindered in Denmark, there is definitely a risk that in a few years we are subjected to sharia. Of course there is.\n\nIn his original piece in Berlingske Tidende (mentioned above) Langballe explicitly referred to the book 1400-års krigen (The 1400 Year War), as well as referring to the book Mødom på mode (Fashionable Virginity) written by Danish author Kristina Aamand and her husband Asif Uddin.\n1400-års krigen is written by the above-mentioned Lars Hedegaard along with Langballe's party fellow Mogens Camre. The summary of the book says (in English):\n\nLars Hedegaard and Mogens Camre analyze, for the first time in Danish, the Islamic war theory, strategy and tactics in its full extent. Militarily, theologically, historically, psychologically.\nThe book shows how badly prepared the West is for the new jihad, a jihad far more sophisticated than earlier Islamic conquest attempts. If the EU and the West do not soon awake, it will ultimately mean the end of freedom.\nThe authors also show that even though Islam is a skillful and determined opponent, we still have the opportunity for action if we want to avoid the destiny that has fallen upon all other non-Muslim populations having come under the iron heel of Islam.\n\nAs opposed to Lars Hedegaard og Mogens Camre, Kristina Aamand has denounced Jesper Langballe's use of her book.\n\nSelected works (in Danish)\nContribution to the anthology Modstand og frihed (Resistance and Freedom), 1983.\nContribution to the anthology Og give dig fred.

The municipality covers an area of 250 square kilometres (97 sq mi), and has a population of 23,692 (1 January 2023). The municipality covers most of Stevns Peninsula.\nThe third largest town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Hårlev.\nOn 1 January 2007 Stevns municipality, as the result of Kommunalreformen (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007), merged with Vallø municipality to form an enlarged Stevns municipality.\n\nLocations\nThe ten largest locations in the municipality are:\n\nThe town of Store Heddinge\nThe town of Store Heddinge came into existence during the 13th century, and Saint Katharina Church (Sct. Katharina kirke) is also from that time.  The town received privileged status as a merchant town in 1441.  A Latin preparatory school was founded in the town in 1620, but was closed down in 1739.\n\nPolitics\nMunicipal council\nStevns' municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.\nBelow are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.\n\nAttractions\nThe area is known for its white chalk cliffs, which are quite rare in Denmark. Stevns Klint (Stevns' Cliffs), a popular tourist attraction, is one of these.  The old town church by the small village of Højerup collapsed partially over the cliffs in 1928 due to erosion.\nThe cliffs at Højerup are also the place where the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez measured the highest level of iridium in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer, which led them to propose their hypothesis that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact of a large asteroid 66 million years ago.\nBy 2014 Stevns Klint was listed on UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in Northern Europe.\nIn 2008 the Cold War Museum Stevns Fortress opened to the public. It features a large exhibition of military equipment and a 1.5-hour guided tour in the large underground system of the fortress. The underground system of the fortress features 1.6 kilometres (0.99 mi) of tunnels, living quarters, command centers, hospital and even a chapel. And in addition two ammunition depots for its two 15 centimetres (5.9 in) cannons. The tunnels are 18–20 metres (59–66 ft) below surface excavated in the chalk of Stevns. This top secret fortress was built in 1953 and remained operational until 2000.\nStevns is also home to Elverhøj (Elves' Hill), while not much of an attraction, it is famous for the fairy tale The Elf Mound by H.C. Andersen and the Danish national play  Elves' Hill, both of which in Danish share the name Elverhøj.\n\nNotable people\nPeder Syv (1631–1702), philologist, folklorist and parish priest at Hellested from 1664 until 1702\nBerte Skeel (1644 in Vallø Castle – 1720), noble, philanthropist and estate owner of Selsø Manor\nJens Juel-Vind (1694 in Huellinge – 1726), baron of Juellinge, chamberlain, and landowner.\nChristen Lindencrone (1703–1772), landowner and supercargo, owned Gjorslev Manor 1743-1772\nSeverine Casse (1805 in Lyderslev – 1898), women's rights activist and an influential member of the Danish Women's Society\nHans Peter Johan Lyngbye (1834 in Vallø Castle – 1920), businessman, dealing with timber and salvage\nGunnar Asgeir Sadolin (1874 in Valløby – 1955), businessman and manufacturer of dry pigments and Aniline dyes\nMartin A.

Created by the Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose, it has also come to represent the egalitarian nature of Nordic countries.The \"Law\" was first formulated as ten rules in Sandemose's satirical novel A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks (En flyktning krysser sitt spor, 1933), but the attitudes themselves are older. Sandemose portrays the fictional small Danish town of Jante, modelled upon his native town Nykøbing Mors in the 1930s where nobody was anonymous, a feature of life typical of small towns.\n\nDefinition\nThere are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: You are not to think you're anyone special, or that you're better than us. \nThe ten rules state:\n\nYou're not to think you are anything special.\nYou're not to think you are as good as we are.\nYou're not to think you are smarter than we are.\nYou're not to imagine yourself better than we are.\nYou're not to think you know more than we do.\nYou're not to think you are more important than we are.\nYou're not to think you are good at anything.\nYou're not to laugh at us.\nYou're not to think anyone cares about you.\nYou're not to think you can teach us anything.The Janters who transgress this unwritten \"law\" are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.\nAn eleventh rule recognized in the novel as \"the penal code of Jante\" is:\n\nPerhaps you don't think we know a few things about you?\nFrom the chapter \"Maybe you don't think I know something about you\":\n\nThat one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of Jante, as such was rich in content. It was a charge of all sorts of things, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense.\nSandemose's novel described working-class life in the fictional town of Jante. He wrote in 1955, a bit mischievously, that \"Many people have recognized [in Jante] their own hometown – this has happened regularly to people from Arendal [Norway], Tromsø [Norway] and Viborg [Denmark]\". Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules; he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries.\n\nSociological effects\nAlthough intended as criticism of society in general, some critics in the 1990s argued that the Law of Jante had shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position.It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes. It is commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.While the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politician and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior, and wants to credit it with fueling Nordic countries' high happiness scores. It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries.However, in Scandinavia, there have also been journalistic articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates. Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.\n\nAppearance in English-language sources\nWhen interviewed during episode 646 of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, broadcast November 9, 2018, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård explained that although he had recently received an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for a lauded performance, the inhibitions induced by the Law of Jante prevented him from boasting of the accolade.\nIn Wisting, a 2019 Norwegian police procedural television series, partially in English, the character Line says (translated), \"The newspaper sales numbers and the Law of Jante are merging.\"\nIn Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Bourdain and René Redzepi discuss Janteloven's effect on Danish culture.\nIn some interviews, Greta Thunberg credits and appreciates the law for her being ignored by Swedes that see her in public.\n\nSee also\nPassage 10:\nList of Danish Nobel laureates\nThis is a list of Danish Nobel laureates. Since the Nobel Prize was established per the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, 14 of the prize winners have been from Denmark.

{"input": "Which pistol was replaced by a pistol manufactured by Spreewerk?", "context": "Passage 1:\nHarper's Ferry Model 1805\nThe model 1805 U.S. Marshal \"Harper's Ferry\" flintlock pistol, manufactured at the Harpers Ferry Armory in Virginia (now West Virginia), was the first pistol manufactured by an American national armory. It was the standard handgun of the US dragoons during the War of 1812.\n\nSpecifications\nThe Model 1805 horse pistol was copied from the French Pistolet Modele An. IX of 1798.  Harper's Ferry models 1805, 1806, 1807 and 1808 flintlock pistols were all identical and there were no changes in design during this model year sequence. The M1805 pistol was a .54 caliber, single-shot, smoothbore, flintlock pistol intended for field duty. Pistols made for officers resembled the standard horse pistol but featured more elaborate decoration, and sometimes a rifled barrel. Harper's Ferry model 1805–1808 flintlock pistols were known then as “horsemen’s pistols” and were produced in pairs; both pistols having identical serial numbers. With just one shot readily available without reloading, a pair or \"brace\" was the standard issue. Horse accouterments also included a standard pair of saddle holsters. No serial number higher than 2048 has ever been discovered—and that is exactly half of the number recorded as produced at the Harper's Ferry Armory. There are between 200–300 of these pistols known to exist today.\n\nWar of 1812\nDuring the War of 1812, the M1805 pistol was issued to American cavalry. Due to the high demand for weapons, derivative pistols were manufactured in other states, especially Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Some featured improvements such as iron instead of wood ramrods. President Jackson favored the M1805 throughout his military career, and used a pair of these pistols in his famous duel with Charles Dickinson in 1806.\n\nLater developments\nImproved models of the Harpers Ferry pistol were produced in 1812, 1818, and 1835. These were the first standardised pistols issued to the US Marshals after the War of 1812, and to the Texas Rangers before the Texan War of Independence.A caplock conversion of the M1835 pistol was issued to the US Cavalry during the Seminole War and US-Mexican War until the Colt Dragoon revolver was introduced in 1847. The last Harpers Ferry pistol was the Model 1855, a .58 caliber handgun with a detachable shoulder stock designed for use by US dragoons during the Indian Wars.Harpers Ferry pistols were widely used by gunfighters and mountain men in the early days of the Old West, including Kit Carson. Many were also issued to the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch was carrying a pair of M1835 pistols when he was killed by a Union army sniper in 1862.\n\nModern use\nCurrently manufactured reproductions of the original pistols are made with a larger caliber than the original, as well as a rifled bore for more accurate shooting. There is one reproduction available modeled after the percussion converted Harper's Ferry pistols that is built with the correct .54 caliber smooth bore as well. \n\nThe model 1805–1808 U.S. Marshal \"Harper's Ferry\" flintlock pistol is used today on the insignia of the U.S. Army Military Police Corps.\nPassage 2:\nSpreewerk\nMetallwarenfabrik Spreewerk GmbH was a German weapons manufacturing company. Spreewerk produced a number of important weapons and components before and during World War II including 280,880 of the Walther P.38 pistol which was the standard service pistol of the German Heer, and the famous 8.8 cm Flak anti-aircraft gun.\n\nHistory\nThe Berlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke (BERKA) was founded in 1920 as a successor to the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken AG, one of Germany's largest munitions firms of the prewar era. Under the regime of the Versailles treaty the firm was forced to give up the manufacture of armaments, which had been its core business. Most of the facilities that had grown up to meet the needs of war were reduced and BERKA carried on with factories in Berlin and Karlsruhe, manufacturing a variety of light metal goods.\nIn 1928 the firm passed under the control of Günther Quandt who moved the company into the production of business machines, acquiring typewriter manufacturer Olympia Schreibmaschinen in 1929, and opening a new factory in 1933 at Erfurt to manufacture cash registers and other business machines. Under Herr Quandt's leadership further acquisitions followed.\nIn 1938 the firm re-entered the field of munitions production, establishing Metallwarenfabrik Spreewerk to undertake the fabrication of munitions components at the former Berlin-Spandau factory of the defunct Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken. This was followed in 1939 by the establishment of a modern ammunition loading facility on a forty hectare site near the city of Lübeck by the newly established Maschinen für Massenverpackung GmbH. Early in 1940 the firm strengthened its role in the manufacture of industrial machinery through the acquisition of the Berlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau of Dessau.\nThe factories of the firm include:\n\nBerlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke AG, Berlin-Borsigwalde (metal fabrication)\nBerlin-Karlsruher Industrie Werke AG, Karlsruhe-Durlach (metal fabrication)Subsidiaries of the firm include:\n\nBerlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau AG, Dessau (machine building)\nMaschinen für Massenverpackung GmbH, Lübeck-Schlutup (munitions)\nMetallwarenfabrik Spreewerk AG, Berlin-Spandau (munitions)\nOlympia Büromaschinenwerke AG, Erfurt (business and tabulating machines)\nOlympia Schreibmaschinen AG, Berlin-Spandau (typewriters and business machines)\nSächsische Maschinenfabrik AG, Chemnitz (machine building)Spreewerk was formed in September 1935 in Spandau Germany as a subsidiary of Deutschen Industrie-Werke A.G. (DIWAG). Spreewerk was involved in weapons production from its formation until April 1945 at the Spandau complex; and from June 1942 to April 1945 at the Grottau, Czechoslovakia factory named Werk Grottau.\n\nProducts\nWWII era weapons produced by Spreewerk include:\n\nSpandau, Germany\ns 10 cm K 18\n15 cm sFH 18\n8.8 cm Flak\nGrottau, Czechoslovakia\nP.38 Pistol\nVG 2 Rifle\n\nMarkings\n\nThe Waffenamt inspector at Spreewerk Grottau was assigned code WaA88. The Waffenamt stamp applied to Spreewerk produced P.38 pistols was an Eagle over 88 (e/88). Spreewerk produced P.38 pistols were marked with the \"cyq\"  and \"cvq\" manufacturer's code.\nPassage 3:\nCrosman Stinger P9\nThe P9T Pistol is a cock-and-shoot spring pistol manufactured by Crosman Airguns.

The barrel is attached to the frame by a hinge, allowing for very easy disassembly. Certain aspects of the pistol are covered by Czechoslovakian patent 65558 which may also be found as Finnish patent FI18533(A) from 1939.\nThe pistol was never used by the Czechoslovak military, as the vz. 38 orders were not yet delivered when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in 1938. Several vz. 38s, modified to have a manual safety, were exported to Bulgaria before the German occupation. Most of the pistols saw service in Greater German police and security forces, and despite several issues the vz. 38 was still in production until 1945. Some were captured used by Yugoslav partisans.\n\nSee also\nWeapons of Czechoslovakia interwar period\n\nUsers\nBulgaria\n Finland - 1,700 pistols bought from Germany in 1940.\n Nazi Germany\n Yugoslavia\nPassage 5:\nWalther P38\nThe Walther P38 (originally written Walther P.38) is a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol that was developed by Carl Walther GmbH as the service pistol of the Wehrmacht at the beginning of World War II. It was intended to replace the comparatively complex and expensive to produce Luger P08. Moving the production lines to the easier mass producible P38 once World War II started took longer than expected, leading to the P08 remaining in production until September 1942, and pre-existing copies remained in service until the end of the war.\n\nDevelopment\nAs the Luger P08 was expensive to produce, Germany started to look for a replacement as early as 1927, settling on the Walther P38 in 1938, which offered similar performance to the Luger P08, but took almost half the time to produce.The first design was submitted to the German Army and featured a locked breech and a hidden hammer, but the Army requested that it should be redesigned with an external hammer.\nThe P38 concept was accepted by the German military in 1938 but production of prototype (\"Test\") pistols did not begin until late 1939. Walther began manufacture at their plant in Zella-Mehlis and produced three series of \"Test\" pistols, designated by a \"0\" prefix to the serial number. The third series pistols satisfactorily solved the previous problems for the German Army and mass production began in mid-1940, using Walther's military production identification code \"480\".Several experimental versions were later created in .45 ACP, and .38 Super, but these were never mass-produced. In addition to the  9×19mm Parabellum version, some 7.65×21mm Parabellum and some .22 Long Rifle versions were also manufactured and sold.\n\nDesign details\nThe P.38 was a cutting edge semi-automatic pistol design, which introduced technical features still used today in current commercial and military semi-automatic pistols, including the Beretta 92FS and its M9 sub-variant adopted by the United States military in 1985.\nThe P38 was the first locked-breech pistol to use a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger (the earlier double-action PPK was an unlocked blowback design, but the more powerful 9×19mm Parabellum round used in the P38 mandated a locked breech design). The shooter could chamber a round, use the safety-decocking lever to safely lower the hammer without firing the round, and carry the weapon with a round chambered.  The lever can stay on \"safe\", or if returned to \"fire\", the weapon remains safely \"ready\" with a long, double-action trigger pull for the first shot. Pulling the trigger cocks the hammer before firing the first shot with double-action operation. The firing mechanism extracts and ejects the first spent round, cocks the hammer, and chambers a fresh round for single-action operation with each subsequent shot – all features found in many modern day handguns. Besides a DA/SA trigger design similar to that of the earlier Walther PPKs the P38 features a visible and tactile loaded chamber indicator in the form of a metal rod that protrudes from the rear of the slide when a round is chambered.\nThe moving-barrel mechanism is actuated by a wedge-shaped hinged locking piece underneath the breech. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and slide recoil together, until the hinged locking piece drives down, disengaging the slide and arresting further rearward movement of the barrel. The slide continues its rearward movement on the frame, ejecting the spent case and cocking the hammer before reaching the end of travel. Unlike most autopistols which eject empty cases to the right, the Walther P38 ejects empty cases to the left. Two recoil springs on either side of the frame and below the slide, having been compressed by the slide's rearward movement, drive the slide forward, stripping a new round from the magazine, driving it into the breech and re-engaging the barrel; ending its return travel with a fresh round chambered, hammer cocked and ready to repeat the process.\nThe hinged locking piece assisted breechblock design provides good accuracy due to the in-line travel of the barrel and slide.\nInitial production P38 pistols were fitted with walnut grips, but these were later supplanted by Bakelite grips.\nSheet metal grips were used for a time on pistols produced in France after the war, being called \"Gray Ghosts\" by collectors on the account of their distinctive parkerizing and sheet metal grips. Post war P1 grips were made of black colored plastic.\n\nVariants\nThe Walther P.38 was in production from 1939 to 1945. Initial development of the pistol took place 1937-1939, culminating in the first model, designated Model HP or Heerespistole (\"army pistol\"), which had several variants as engineering changes were made. Early production included a Swedish contract.  The designation P.38 indicates Wehrmacht adoption in 1938, although the exact date is unknown.  The transition from HP to the mechanically-identical P.38-marked pistols took place 1939-1940. Sweden bought the P38 in 1939.During WWII, the P.38 was produced by three separate manufacturers: Walther, Mauser, and Spreewerk.  To conceal manufacturer identities, each wartime manufacturer used a letter code: ac (Walther); byf (Mauser), and cyq (Spreewerk), followed by the date (e.g.: ac44: Walther 1944 production).  Spreewerk did not mark production dates. Pistols were produced in blocks of 10,000 consecutively numbered pistols, with each block having a consecutive letter suffix, to conceal production volume.  1,277,680 P.38s were produced during WWII: 617,585 by Walther in Zella-Mehlis; 372,875 by Mauser in Oberndorf; 287,220 by Spreewerk Grottau. Late in the war, the Spreewerk cyq die broke.  Subsequent pistols appear to be marked \"cvq\" due to the broken die.  About 31,400 pistols are so marked. Spreewerk production ended April 1945.After the war from 1945-1946, several thousands of pistols were assembled for the French armed forces(frequently dubbed \"grey ghosts\" because of parkerized finish and grey sheet metal grips). Only after 1957 was the P38 again produced for the German military.  Slowly over time, West Germany desired to rebuild its military so that it could shoulder some of the burden for its own defense.  Walther retooled for new P38 production since no military firearms production had occurred in West Germany since the end of the war, knowing that the military would again seek Walther firearms.  When the Bundeswehr announced it wanted the P38 for its official service pistol, Walther readily resumed P38 production within just two years, using wartime pistols as models and new engineering drawings and machine tools.  The first of the new P38s were delivered to the West German military in June 1957, some 17 years and two months after the pistol had initially seen action in World War II, and from 1957 to 1963 the P38 was again the standard sidearm.\n\nP1\nIn late 1963 the postwar military model P1 was adopted for use by the German military, identifiable by the P1 stamping on the slide. The postwar pistols, whether marked as P38 or P1, have an aluminium frame rather than the steel frame of the original design. Starting in June 1975, the aluminum frame was reinforced with a hex bolt above the trigger guard, and a slightly modified, stronger slide design was introduced.\nDuring the 1990s the German military started replacing the P1 with the P8 pistol and finally phased out the P1 in 2004.\n\nP4\nAn improved version of the P38, the Walther P4, was developed in the late 1970s and was adopted by the police forces of South Africa, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg.\n\nUsers\nAfghanistan: Afghan National Police received 10,000 P1s after the fall of the Taliban\n Algeria\n Austria\n Bulgaria:Supplied by Germany during WW2\n Canada: Used by the prisoner transport services of the Correctional Service Canada until the late 1980s.

It has a polymer frame with internal strengthening ribs. The 9×19mm version holds 9+1 rounds and uses a single stack magazine. The barrel length is 3+3⁄8 inches. The gun features a safety, a magazine hold open, and a decocker (operated by pushing the safety up beyond the \"safe\" function).\nThe design is somewhat similar to the Browning Hi-Power or the CZ 75. The pistol weighs approximately 696 grams (1.5 lbs) empty (no magazine) and 870 grams (1.9 lbs) with a full magazine. It is known as a reliable, durable sidearm. Although surpassed by more modern double stack compact pistols, the Ultra Star was once a popular choice for concealed carry. Magazines are still available, though tending to be a bit pricey. Other brand magazines have successfully been modified to fit in this pistol.\nPassage 7:\nSteyr TMP\nThe Steyr TMP (Taktische Maschinenpistole/Tactical Machine Pistol) is a 9×19mm Parabellum caliber machine pistol manufactured by Steyr Mannlicher of Austria. The magazines come in 15 or 30 round detachable box types. A suppressor can also be fitted. Though originally intended to be used without a shoulder stock, an optional fixed stock was made available later. \nIn 2001, Steyr sold the design to Brügger & Thomet, who developed it into the Brügger & Thomet MP9.\n\nSPP\nThe Steyr SPP (Special Purpose Pistol) is a semi-automatic variant of the TMP. The TMP's barrel and barrel jacket lengths were increased slightly so there is a greater length of protruding jacket and barrel. The forward tactical pistol grip was also removed. It is large for a pistol and is constructed mainly from Polyamide 66.\n\nUsers\nAustria: Used by EKO Cobra.\n Italy: Used by the Gruppo di Intervento Speciale.\n Myanmar : Manufactured locally as MA-13 MK-II.\n\nSee also\nBeretta 93R\nBrügger & Thomet MP9\nHeckler & Koch VP70\nKGP-9\nBXP\nPatria\nPP-2000\nPassage 8:\nHeckler &amp; Koch VP70\nThe VP70 is a 9×19mm, 18-round, double action only, semi-automatic/three-round burst capable polymer frame pistol manufactured by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH. VP stands for Volkspistole (literally \"People's Pistol\"), and the designation 70 was for the first year of production, 1970.\n\nDesign\nThe VP70 combined a number of design features that were innovative, or at least very unusual for its time:\n\nIt was the first polymer-framed handgun, predating the Glock 17 by 12 years. At 820 g (28.9 oz) unloaded, the weapon is lighter than most metal framed pistols of the time.\nIt has a double-stack, double-feed magazine; double-feed magazines are uncommon for pistols even today. These magazines hold 18 rounds, a rather high capacity for its original production time.\nAs on the Mauser C96 and the Lahti L35, the stock was designed to be used as a holster when not mounted. On the military version of the VP70 this combination includes a unique feature: when mounted, a selective-fire switch, located on the stock, allows switching the weapon to a three-round-burst mode, with a 2,200 rounds per minute cyclic rate of fire.\nThe VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional hammer.\nIt is double-action only, so the trigger pull is relatively heavy.\nIn lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post.\nThe barrel has very deeply cut rifling; this was done to purposely vent gas past the bullet, placing less gas pressure on the slide, a critical part of the VP70's direct blowback function. This also results in slightly reduced bullet velocity when compared to other pistols with similar, or even slightly shorter barrel length.\n\nVariants\nThe handgun comes in two varieties. The \"M\" (Militär, military) variant is selective-fire (semi-auto/three-round bursts), the \"Z\" (Zivil, civilian) variant is a semi-automatic-only version. The VP70Z has no provision to attach the stock, and also lacks the internal mechanical parts required for the burst-fire function even if the stock was attached. The VP70Z also has a crossbolt safety right behind the trigger; on the VP70M this is replaced with a non-functional plug, relying only on the heavy double-action trigger for safety.\nFour hundred VP70Zs were made in 9×21mm IMI; these samples were made primarily for the civilian market of Italy, where the use of the 9×19mm Parabellum was at the time permitted only to military and law enforcement agencies. All of the VP70Z pistols sold to Italy had the provision to mount the stock, but still lacked the three-round-burst firing capability.\n\nUsers\nBrazil:Used by 1º Batalhão de Forças Especiais\n Lebanon: Used during the Lebanese Civil War; adopted by some police forces\n Morocco\n Paraguay: VP70Z variant.\n Portugal: VP70M variant.\nPassage 9:\nMitchell Alpha .45\nThe Mitchell Alpha .45 is a pistol manufactured by the American Mitchell Arms company. It is .45 ACP in calibre and its magazine size is 8 rounds. The Alpha uses the Browning-type locking mechanism and weighs 39 ounces. There is no trigger stop on the pistol and its sights are fixed. Its external safety is compatible to the ambidextrous shooter, with an ambidextrous safety catch.\nPassage 10:\nStar Model S\nThe Star Model S was a Spanish semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. and designed to use the .380 ACP cartridge.  Like many semi-automatic handguns, the basic design of the Star Model S is based on the .45 calibre Colt 1911.  But it is much smaller, lighter, and lacks some of the safety features of the Colt pistol. It is this lightness and lack of safety features that make this a fast gun.\nAt one time the Star Model S was the official sidearm of the Spanish Foreign Legion.  The Star Model S was imported into the United States by the Interarms company of Alexandria, Virginia.  Interarms went out of business in early 1990s at about the same time the Star company went out of business.  The Star Model S is no longer manufactured.\n\nSee also\nList of firearms", "answers": ["Luger P08"], "length": 3741, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "7d70e52523b8024edbe02108598febd714806f6c91d5a7a2"}
{"input": "Electoral district of Bragg currently includes which suburb in the city of Burnside, Adelaide?", "context": "Passage 1:\nElectoral district of Bragg\nBragg is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. The seat is named after the eminent physicists Bragg – William Henry and his son, William Lawrence. The electorate is largely suburban and encompasses a significant portion of the City of Burnside, stretching from the east parklands of Adelaide into the Adelaide Hills. After the redistribution following the 2006 election, the boundary moved eastwards to include suburbs that had formerly been in the electorate of Heysen and now borders Kavel. Bragg currently includes the metropolitan suburbs of Beaumont, Burnside, Cleland, Dulwich, Eastwood, Erindale, Frewville, Glenside, Glenunga, Greenhill, Hazelwood Park, Heathpool, Horsnell Gully, Leabrook, Leawood Gardens, Linden Park, Marryatville, Mount Osmond, Rose Park, Rosslyn Park, Skye, St Georges, Stonyfell, Toorak Gardens, Tusmore, Waterfall Gully, Wattle Park and part of Glen Osmond. (Previous suburbs prior to redistribution included Auldana, Beulah Park, Kensington, Kensington Park, and Kensington Gardens.)\nThe electorate was first contested at the 1970 election as a replacement for the abolished, larger electorate of Burnside, one of fifteen new electorates created in Adelaide to give the metropolitan area fairer representation. It has been held by the Liberals and their predecessors, the Liberal and Country League for its entire existence, and for most of that time has been the safest Liberal seat in the metropolitan area. The Liberals have always won outright majorities on the first count, and until 2022 never won less than 60 percent of the two-party vote.\nAs a measure of the strong Liberal support in this seat, the Liberals easily retained it even in the Labor landslides of 1977, 1985 and 2006, each time winning at least 55 percent of the primary vote. For example, in 2006 the Liberals suffered a swing of 6.8 percent in Bragg, but still comfortably retained it with a majority of 12.6 percent–the only safe metropolitan Liberal seat and one of only four safe Liberal seats statewide.\nThe seat has been held by only three members in its present incarnation, all of whom have gone on to serve in cabinet. Bragg's best-known member was its first, David Tonkin, who served as Premier of South Australia from 1979 to 1982. He resigned shortly after the Liberals lost the 1982 state election.  At the ensuing 1983 Bragg by-election fellow Liberal Graham Ingerson retained the seat without serious difficulty. Ingerson went on to become a minister under Dean Brown and John Olsen and served as Deputy Premier under Olsen from 1996 to 1998. Ingerson retired in 2002 and was succeeded by incumbent Vickie Chapman, two time Liberal leadership challenger and two time Liberal deputy leader from 2006 until 2009 and again since 2013. In 2018 Chapman became Deputy Premier.\nIn 2022, however, the Liberal margin dropped to 58 percent, making it only fairly safe for the first time. It is still the largest Liberal margin for a metropolitan seat.\nOn 19 April 2022, Chapman announced her intention to resign from politics and parliament, forcing a by-election, which was held on 2 July 2022.\n\nMembers for Bragg\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nMoratuwa Electoral District\nMoratuwa electoral district was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989.

The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts.

The suburb is adjacent to Adelaide's east parklands, and forms part of the western boundary of the City of Burnside. Dulwich is a mix of residential housing and commercial activity–corporate offices and businesses line Fullarton and Greenhill Roads. The suburb is bordered by Rose Park to the north, Toorak Gardens to the east, Glenside to the south and the Adelaide Parklands to the west.\nThe area, which was settled by Europeans in the 19th century and used as pasture, made a slow transition to a residential suburb which was complete by the mid 20th century. Much of the area's 19th century housing stock has been recognised with heritage protection. Dulwich's close location to the Adelaide city centre, grand old houses and leafy tree-lined streets make it an attractive and sought-after suburb.\n\nHistory\nPrior to European settlement, the general area was inhabited by the Kaurna tribe of Indigenous Australians.Dulwich, named after the settlement in the London Borough of Southwark, has its origins in Section 263 of the Adelaide region as laid out by South Australia's first chief surveyor, Colonel William Light. It was bought by a Captain of the Royal Navy, Daniel Pring. In his initial absence the section was leased to a local cattle dealer, but upon the early death of Pring, his wife inherited the area. After several transactions the land was sold; John Hector, manager of the Savings Bank of South Australia bought much of the land with the exception of that located around Victoria Park. It was Hector who christened the land as the 'Village of Dulwich', or in the colloquial terms of the time, 'Hector's Paddock'. Hector oversaw the subdivision of the land and its transfer to many new owners. The Adelaide press at the time, in the form of the Advertiser and the South Australian Gazetter, was exceptionally generous in their words relating to the new village: 'The Suburban Village of Dulwich ... beautifully situated on a gentle rise sufficient to command a view of the sea, with the noble amphitheatre of the hills for a background', 'For building sites convenient to the metropolis, Dulwich has no rival'.\n\nWhile Dulwich in 1881 was only home to four residences, by 1891, after a period of explosive growth, there were 50. Businesses began to establish themselves in Dulwich during the early part of the 20th century. By the 1930s, Dulwich was home to manufacturers, blacksmiths, engineers and other groups. This business establishment experienced a surge in the latter part of the 20th century, and offices and businesses now completely line the two major road borders (Greenhill and Fullarton Roads), attracted there by the close proximity to the Adelaide city centre and the lush surroundings.\nWith many sons of the suburb fighting in World War II, a Returned Services League was founded with their return. Eventually the league building became that of the Dulwich Retired Citizens Club, and with its purchase by the Burnside Council, it has become the Dulwich Community Centre. Between 1955 and 1958, a young Tony Blair (British Prime Minister 1997–2007) lived with his family in a house on Ormond Grove while his father Leo was a Law lecturer at the University of Adelaide. One of the first Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the country was established in Dulwich in the 1980s, however by 2000 it had moved to nearby Eastwood.\n\nAttractions\nDulwich Community Centre\nSt. Patrick's Special School\nDulwich Centre (aka Dulwich Village)\n\nResidents\nAccording to the 2001 Census, the population of the Dulwich census area (which includes adjoining Rose Park) is 2,663 people, with a very slight decrease in population between the 1996 and 2001 censuses. 52.4% of the population is female, 79.4% are Australian born (see chart for a breakdown of foreign-born) and 92.5% of residents are Australian citizens. Religious adherence in Dulwich is lower than the Burnside and Adelaide average, standing at 64.3%. The eight strongest religions in decreasing order are; Catholic, Anglican, Uniting Church, Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Buddhism and Hinduism. The most common type of dwelling was a Separate House (64.4%) followed by a flat, apartment or other (24.9%) and a semi-detached house (9.6%). Dulwich has a highly educated population with 44.5% holding a diploma or higher degree. This educational attainment is reflected in household income - almost two-thirds earn over A$1000 per week.\nSimilar to other inner-city suburbs, Dulwich has a large proportion of students who attend nearby universities (9.2%). Overseas students are a sizeable component of this population and represent some of the 7.5% of residents who are not Australian citizens. 60% of households represent families with children; the remaining households are divided among couples without children, lone person households and other non-traditional groupings.[1]\n\nTransport\nCars are the dominant means of transport to work in Dulwich; 70% of the population are either a driver or passenger in a vehicle. 10% walked, cycled or caught public transport. Public transport usage is notably higher than the City of Burnside and Adelaide average, owing to the suburb's close inner-city location. A number of bus routes serve the suburb: the 144 travels to Glen Osmond through Dulwich, as does the 147 to Beaumont; the 580 route travels from Mile End to Paradise Interchange along Portrush Road; the 820 Hills bus travels along Greenhill Road to Carey Gully. 10% of the population owns no vehicles, 40% owns one, 35% owns two and the remainder own three or more. One early problem with Adelaide's streets built in a grid layout was the tendency for motorists to use inner suburb local roads instead of main roads. 'Rat trails' of cars sneaked through narrow sidestreets, creating sizeable bottlenecks. This was a particular problem for Dulwich because of its location - various traffic control methods were put in place (closing streets, speed bumps, lowered speed limits, roundabouts) to counter these problems. This forced the re-routing of traffic onto local thoroughfares such as Fullarton, Greenhill, Kensington and Portrush Roads.[2]\n\nGovernment\nDulwich is part of the state Electoral District of Bragg, which has been held since 2002 by Liberal MP Vickie Chapman. In federal politics, the suburb is part of the Division of Adelaide, and has been represented by Labor MP Kate Ellis since 2004. The results shown are from the closest polling station to Dulwich – which is located outside of the suburb – at Rose Park Primary School in nearby Rose Park.\nDulwich is a socially moderate and economically liberal suburb. The center-right Liberal Party polls very well in the area with around 60% of the vote in the 2007 and 2010 federal elections . The area previously had a relatively strong Democrat vote, until very poor results in the Federal Election of 2004 and the State Election of 2006. The Labor Party and the Greens have absorbed much of the former Democrat vote.\nAt the council level, Dulwich is part of the Rose Park & Toorak Gardens Ward of the City of Burnside.\nPassage 4:\nBatticaloa Electoral District (1947–1989)\nBatticaloa Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989.

The film stars Ethel Clayton, Clyde Fillmore, Jean Acker, Irving Cummings, Charles Meredith, and Ruth Ashby. The film was released on July 11, 1920, by Paramount Pictures.\n\nPlot\nEdith Parrish is a magazine illustrator whose publisher friend, Peter Gordon, has married an \"unworthy wife\", Dora Leroy. To keep her friend from being shattered by his wife's infidelity with Ralph Brent, Edith begins a series of lies to coverup the affair. However, this leads to suspicion that she is having a romance with Brent, which causes her true love, John Blaine to doubt her. Brent, who respects Edith, comes clean to Blaine about the situation, and Edith and him are reconciled.\nSources:\n\nCast\nEthel Clayton as Edith Parrish\nClyde Fillmore as Peter Gordon\nJean Acker as Dora Leroy\nIrving Cummings as Ralph Brent\nCharles Meredith as John Blaine\nRuth Ashby as Maid\nPassage 6:\nJean Acker\nJean Acker (born Harriet Ackers; October 23, 1892 – August 16, 1978) was an American actress with a career dating from the silent film era through the 1950s. She was perhaps best known as the estranged wife of silent film star Rudolph Valentino.\n\nEarly life and career\nJean Acker was born Harriet Ackers on October 23, 1892 in Trenton, New Jersey to Joseph and Margaret Ackers. The 1900 census indicates an 1891 birthdate, and other sources have suggested an 1893 birthdate. However, her burial plot says 1892. Her parents divorced, and her father remarried to Eleanor Bruseren in 1906. They had two sons together, both named Joseph. Their first son died at 4 months old in 1907, and their second son was a stillbirth. Eleanor and Joseph divorced in 1912, and he remarried a third time to Virginia Erb. Her father managed the Casino Bowling Alley and The Ritz Restaurant, and later owned the Boston Shoe Store on Valley Street. He also managed several bowling alleys in the Philadelphia area. In 1906, the family moved to Lewistown. Growing up on a farm, Ackers became an expert horsewoman. She attended St. Mary's Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey for a time. \nShe performed in vaudeville until she moved to California in 1919. After arriving in Hollywood, Acker became the protegee and lover of Alla Nazimova, an actress whose clout and contacts enabled Acker to negotiate a $200 per week contract with a movie studio. Acker appeared in numerous films during the 1910s and 1920s, but by the early 1930s, she began appearing in small, mostly uncredited film roles. She made her last on-screen appearance in the 1955 film How to Be Very, Very Popular, opposite Betty Grable.\n\nMarriage to Valentino\nAfter meeting and befriending the then-struggling actor Rudolph Valentino at a party, they entered a two-month courtship and married on November 6, 1919. Acker quickly had regrets and locked him out of their hotel bedroom on their wedding night. The marriage was reportedly never consummated.After filing for divorce, Valentino did not wait the requisite period for it to be finalized before marrying his second wife, Natacha Rambova, in Mexico, and he was charged with bigamy when the couple returned to the United States. Acker then sued Valentino for the legal right to call herself Mrs. Rudolph Valentino. Valentino remained angry with her for several years, but they mended their friendship before his death in 1926. Acker wrote a popular song about him soon after he died called \"We Will Meet at the End of the Trail\".Acker had an affair with the actress Alla Nazimova. Nazimova included Acker in what was dubbed the sewing circles, a group of actresses who were forced to conceal the fact that they were lesbian or bisexual, thus living secret lives. Another of her female lovers was Grace Darmond, with whom she was involved during her relationship with Valentino.\nIn the 1977 film Valentino a character loosely based on Acker is played by Carol Kane. In the credits, the character is simply called Starlet.\n\nLater life and death\nAfter divorcing Valentino in 1923, Acker was engaged to Marquis Luis de Bezan y Sandoval of Spain. Then, she was in the news over her relationship with Rahmin Bey. In 1930, after she lost her fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, she sued William Delahanty, claiming that he agreed to pay her $18,400 per year if she gave up her film career. The married politician denied that he made such a promise but admitted that he spent thousands of dollars on Acker. Acker met Chloe Carter (June 21, 1903 – October 28, 1993), a former Ziegfeld Follies girl, who was the first wife of film composer Harry Ruby. Acker remained with Carter for the rest of her life. The couple owned an apartment building together in Beverly Hills. Acker died of natural causes in 1978 at the age of 85, and is buried next to Carter at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\nLegacy\nAlthough not born in the Central Pennsylvania town of Lewistown, Jean Acker is considered a local celebrity. Her face dominates an outdoor mural titled \"Mifflin County Movie History\" and is located on Monument Square in Downtown Lewistown. The mural was painted in 2012 by Dwight Kirkland of Blackleaf Studio, Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nJackie Long\nJackie Long (born October 23, 1981) is an American television and film actor, writer, musician, director and producer.

He served in the Illinois Senate and was a member of the United States House of Representatives.\n\nBiography\nNoonan was born in Macomb, Illinois on October 23, 1861, and raised in Quincy and Chicago. He was educated in Quincy and Chicago, and studied law with Chicago attorney and judge Van H. Higgins. He attended law school at the University of Michigan while studying with Higgins, attained admission to the bar in 1882, and received his LL.B. degree in 1883.In addition to practicing law, Noonan was active in Chicago politics as a Democrat.  From 1890 to 1894, he was a member of the Illinois Senate, and from 1893 to 1897 he served on the military staff of Governor John Peter Altgeld with the rank of colonel.  Noonan was counsel for the West Chicago Park Commission from 1893 to 1898, and as an unsuccessful candidate for Congress in 1894 and 1896.Noonan was elected to the U.S. House in 1898, and served in the 56th United States Congress (March 4, 1899 – March 3, 1901). Noonan was not a candidate for reelection in 1900 and resumed the practice of law in Chicago.\n\nDeath and burial\nNoonan died in Chicago on December 19, 1923. He was buried at St. Paul's Catholic Cemetery in Macomb.\n\nFamily\nNoonan and his wife Lillian were the parents of two sons, Laurence (b. 1907) and Cato (b. 1916).\nPassage 9:\nWilson Wood (actor)\nWilson Wood (born Charles Woodrow Tolkien, February 11, 1915 – October 23, 2004) was an American character actor during the middle of the twentieth century.\nBorn in Huron, North Dakota on February 11, 1915, he made his film debut with a small role in 1946's Two Sisters from Boston, directed by Henry Koster. During his 17-year career he would appear in over 100 films, usually in smaller roles. In 1952 he would star in a serial for Republic Pictures.  The 12 part series was titled, Zombies of the Stratosphere, which would be edited down and released in 1958 as a feature film, called Satan's Satellites. His final appearance would be in the 1962 film, Jumbo, starring Doris Day, Stephen Boyd and Jimmy Durante, in which Wood had a featured role. Wood died on October 23, 2004, in Culver City, California.\n\nFilmography\n(Per AFI database)", "answers": ["Jean Acker"], "length": 2379, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a375f8b0473dca4fc0398789869b3a93d9705a98d5d09852"}
{"input": "The debut album came out in 1988 but what year did the song \"She's My Baby\" come out in?", "context": "Passage 1:\nGo to the Top (album)\nGo to the Top is the debut album by Japanese singer-songwriter Hitomi, released on September 27, 1995, by Avex Trax. The first press edition of the album came with the CD case housed inside a hardback case, similar to a book. The inside of the back of the case contains a mini-photobook. The RIAJ has certified it 2× platinum, recognizing over 500,000+ shipments throughout Japan.  On the Oricon charts, the album's peak position was #3, and it stayed on the charts for eight weeks.\n\nHistory\nHitomi had previously released two singles without much success. Her debut single, \"Let's Play Winter\" failed to chart on Japan's Oricon chart, and her follow-up single, \"We Are \"Lonely Girl\"\", while charting much better at #61 on the charts, failed to make a big impression with sales.\nIt was not until the quiet release of her third single \"Candy Girl\" that suddenly Hitomi found success. \"Candy Girl\" charted much higher than her previous attempts, becoming her first single to chart in the Oricon top 20. This was most likely because \"Candy Girl\" had been aggressively marketed and appeared in a famous Japanese Kodak commercial. The single established the then 19-year-old Hitomi Furuya into a household name, showcasing her provocative image.\nFollowing the sudden success of her third single, Hitomi and her label (fledgling at the time) Avex Trax quickly released another single, \"Go to the Top\" which also charted in the top 20, ensuring Hitomi's success for the time being. Go to the Top, Hitomi's debut studio album of the same name, was released two months later and rose in the charts, peaking at #3.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nHitomi - lead vocals, lyrics\nSatoshi Miyashita - bass, chorus\nMami Ishizuka - chorus\nAkihiko Shimizu - vocal direction\nShuichi Nakano - drums, percussion, chorus\nKazuhiro Matsuo, Ken Kimura - guitar, chorus\nAkio Kondo - keyboards\nDoug Sax - mastering\nKevin Moloney - mixing\nAkihisa Murakami - programming\nCozy Kubo, Tetsuya Komuro - electronic programming\n\nProduction\nProduced by hitomi, Tetsuya Komuro for Avex Trax\nCo-produced by Cozy Kubo\nExecutive Production by Max Matsuura\nEngineered by Eiji Ohta, Katsuhiro Odashima, Masataka Ito, Shinpachiro Kawabe, Yoshinori Mizuide, Yuki Mitome\nRecorded by Naoki Nemoto, Shigeru Matsumura, Toshiaki Sabase, Toshihiro Wako\n\nCharts\nOricon Sales Chart (Japan)\nPassage 2:\nTraveling Wilburys Vol. 3\nTraveling Wilburys Vol. 3 is the second and final studio album by the Traveling Wilburys, a group consisting of George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. It was released on October 29, 1990, as the follow-up to their 1988 debut, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The band members again adopted pseudonyms for their contributions, using new names from the fictitious Wilbury brothers.\n\nHistory\nThough it was their second release, the album was mischievously titled Vol. 3 by George Harrison.  According to Jeff Lynne, \"That was George's idea.  He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\"As the dynamics within the band had shifted with Roy Orbison's death, the four remaining members all adopted new Wilbury pseudonyms: Spike (George Harrison), Clayton (Jeff Lynne), Muddy (Tom Petty) and Boo (Bob Dylan). With Harrison and Lynne producing again, the sessions were undertaken in the spring of 1990. An additional track, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\", was recorded and released in June 1990 as a charity single in aid of Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal. The song was also the title track of a multi-artist fundraising album compiled by the Harrisons, Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal. Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 was dedicated to the memory of \"Lefty Wilbury\" (Roy Orbison).\nReleased in October 1990, the album was less positively received than Vol. 1, yet still saw a fair measure of success. In the United States, \"She's My Baby\" (with guest guitarist Gary Moore) and \"Inside Out\" became radio hits, charting at number 2 album rock and number 16 album rock, respectively. The album peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nComparing the two Wilburys albums, a reviewer in The New York Times wrote in November 1990: \"The superstar pop group stays close to 50's and 60's rock roots, drawing on blues, doo-wop, rockabilly and Buddy Holly. But their second album is faster, jokier, lighter and meaner than the first.\" Rolling Stone described the blending of the four participants' musical styles as \"seemingly effortless\", and said that the album showed they continued to enjoy their collaboration. In the years following Vol. 3, there was speculation about further Wilbury releases. Since Harrison was viewed as the de facto leader of the group, his death in November 2001 ended the possibility of any future projects.When Harrison's distribution deal with Warner Bros. expired in 1995, ownership of his Dark Horse Records catalog and the two Wilburys albums reverted to him, and the albums went out of print. On June 12, 2007, Vol. 1 and Vol. 3 were reissued by Rhino Records as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, packaged together with bonus tracks and a DVD.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nTraveling WilburysClayton Wilbury (Jeff Lynne) – acoustic and electric guitars, bass, keyboards, lead and backing vocals\nSpike Wilbury (George Harrison) – acoustic, electric and slide guitars, mandolin, sitar, lead and backing vocals\nBoo Wilbury (Bob Dylan) – acoustic guitar, harmonica, lead and backing vocals\nMuddy Wilbury (Tom Petty) – acoustic guitar, lead and backing vocalsAdditional personnel\n\nBuster Sidebury (Jim Keltner) – drums, percussion\nJim Horn – saxophones\nRay Cooper – percussion\nKen Wilbury (Gary Moore) – lead guitar on \"She's My Baby\"\nEric Idle (as Prof. \"Tiny\" Hampton) - liner notesEngineered by\nRichard Dodd\n\nCharts\nPassage 3:\nThe First Flower\nThe First Flower is Play Dead's debut album, recorded at the Jungle Records studio in March 1983.

{"input": "What type of elevation does Aldgate railway station, Adelaide and Aldgate, South Australia have in common?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAldgate railway station, Adelaide\nAldgate railway station was located on the Adelaide-Wolseley line in the Adelaide Hills suburb of Aldgate, 34.9 kilometres from Adelaide station.\n\nHistory\nAldgate station opened on 14 March 1883, and on 23 December 1886, a second platform was added. From 1 May 1910, most services from Adelaide station were extended to terminate at Aldgate. On 1 July 1929, the westbound platform was converted to an island platform. In 1974, the goods siding was replaced by a second crossing loop. It was very similar to Blackwood; the station building and shelter were the same.\nIt was closed to local trains on 23 September 1987, but until 1990 was available for passengers wishing to board the Mount Gambier-bound railcar service. At the time of closure, Aldgate had three platforms. Platform 1 was a 151-metre-long side platform, and platforms 2 and 3 were a 149-metre-long island platform. The island platform was demolished in the 1990s, but the side platform remains in place, although no longer in use. A crossing loop was provided, but was removed when the line was converted to standard gauge in 1995. The station building now functions as The Hut Community Centre.\nPassage 2:\nStirling, South Australia\nStirling is a town in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, approximately 15 km from the Adelaide city centre. It is administered by the Adelaide Hills Council. Neighbouring townships are Crafers and Aldgate. Other nearby towns are Heathfield and Bridgewater. Of those five, Stirling has by far the largest commercial strip, with the greatest number and widest variety of shops, and the only banks.\nStirling East, a similar sized area towards Aldgate, is home to several schools.\n\nHistory\nStirling is named after Edward Stirling. He was the illegitimate son of Archibald Stirling, a planter in the British West Indies, and a Creole woman. He was able to travel to South Australia because of a financial gift from his father who had been freshly compensated for his slaves on the emancipation of the British West Indies.Founded in 1854, Stirling grew rapidly as a result of the expansion of apple growing and market gardening to satisfy the demand of the expanding city of Adelaide, whose centre is only 15 kilometres from Stirling. It also developed as a residential address for English migrants who could afford it, to escape Adelaide's hot summers, often 10 degrees cooler than Adelaide. As a result, many historic, grand mansions can be found in the area. Today, farming has declined as more of the region has been urbanised, with many Stirling residents commuting to Adelaide daily.\n\nVegetation\nMany deciduous trees, particularly the maple, elm, oak and ash trees, have been imported from Europe and North America. These trees flourish in Stirling's wet and mild to cool climate and are a popular tourist attraction in the autumn months (April–May), bringing rich and vibrant autumn leaf colour to the town. Some Australian cities are too warm (even in the autumn and winter months) to accommodate and produce maple trees, but some temperate regions along the eastern coast and towns at higher altitudes flourish in colour during autumn, rivalling those in North America, Europe and Japan.\nOther tourist sites include the nearby Mount Lofty Botanic Garden and Cleland National Park.\n\nClimate\nStirling has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb). Owing to its location near Mount Lofty, Stirling is the wettest place in South Australia, receiving an average of 1,107 millimetres (43.6 inches) of rain per year—more than twice the average of Adelaide. Between May and August, the average monthly rainfall is as high as 155 millimetres (over 6 inches), and in June 1916, over 450 millimetres fell. Mean summer temperatures are about 5 °C (9 °F) lower than in Adelaide, which may explain why Stirling was recommended as a desirable residence for English migrants and Adelaide's high society in the 20th century. Winters are distinctly cool particularly compared to Adelaide, with an average minimum of 4 °C (39 °F) and an average maximum of 11 °C (52 °F).The Australian Bureau of Meteorology stopped the collection of weather data at Stirling from the 1980s onward.  Weather recording instruments were removed from the grounds of Australia Post's Stirling office following a commercial dispute between these two Australian government organisations.\n\nGovernment\nStirling is located in the state electorate of Heysen and in the federal Division of Mayo. The local council is the Adelaide Hills Council (formerly Stirling Council) in the Mt Lofty and Manoah wards.\n\nCulture\nA prominent landmark in Stirling is the historical Stirling Theatre, home to the Hills Musical Company, Stirling Players and Hills Youth Theatre. Stirling also has a strong affinity with books and has been referred to as South Australia's 'Book Village'. This relates to the close proximity of varied book venues Chapter Two Books, Matilda Bookshop, The Hut Book Shed and the Coventry Memorial Library.\n\nArtistic Community\nStirling has traditionally had a strong community of artists. Notable are abstract artist, Colin Russell Gardiner who was a former electrician and held many exhibitions in the 1970s and 1980s.\nMichael Plant Atchison OAM (4 August 1933 – 16 February 2009) was an Australian cartoonist who worked for the South Australian Advertiser for over 40 years.\n\nFire Service\nThe Stirling community is protected from fire, road crash and hazardous materials by the Stirling Country Fire Service Volunteers.\nIn 2006, the Adelaide Hills Council stepped up efforts to relocate the station to Crafers, against the wants of the volunteers. The council proposed the move in order to sell the land currently inhabited by the CFS station on Avenue Road, to fund a new library.  However, in mid-2006 the council elected to sell the land the fire station was on to SAFECOM (South Australian Fire and Emergency Services Commission), which owns all Fire Service assets.  The new library started construction anyway in early 2007, and it was completed the following year.\n\nTransport\nStirling (Main Street) is very well serviced by public transport, with a 30min off-peak service to the city and nearby Mount Barker (routes 864 and 864F). During peak it is also service by routes 863F and T863. Route 863 operates nights and weekends only. For the east of Stirling, route 865 operates to and from the city and route 866 operates to Crafers. Route 822 also links Stirling to Carey Gully. For the West of Stirling (heading out towards Heathfield) routes 865 and 894H operate via Avenue Road and Longwood Road, at peak times only with very limited interpeak services.\nPassage 3:\nElectoral district of Heysen\nHeysen is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. It is named after Sir Hans Heysen, a prominent South Australian landscape artist. It is a 1,074 km² electoral district that takes in some of the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide before fanning south-east to include most of the Adelaide Hills, as well as farming areas some distance from the capital. It includes the localities of Aldgate, Ashbourne, Belvidere, Biggs Flat, Blackfellows Creek, Blewitt Springs, Bradbury, Bridgewater, Bugle Ranges, Bull Creek, Chapel Hill, Clarendon, Crafers, Dingabledinga, Dorset Vale, Echunga, Flaxley, Gemmells, Green Hills Range, Heathfield, Highland Valley, Hope Forest, Ironbank, Jupiter Creek, Kangarilla, Kuitpo, Kuitpo Colony, Kyeema, Longwood, Macclesfield, McHarg Creek, Meadows, Montarra, Mount Magnificent, Mylor, Paris Creek, Prospect Hill, Red Creek, Salem, Sandergrove, Scott Creek, Stirling, Strathalbyn, The Range, Willunga Hill, Willyaroo, Wistow, Woodchester, Yundi; as well as parts of Bletchley, Hartley, Onkaparinga Hills, Upper Sturt. Although geographically it is a hybrid urban-rural seat, it is counted as a metropolitan seat.\nAs Heysen combines both wealthier suburbs in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills and rural areas further east, it has been held by the Liberal Party and its predecessor, the Liberal and Country League, ever since its creation in the electoral redistribution of 1969 as a replacement for Stirling. For most of that time, it has been a fairly safe to safe seat for the conservatives. It was first contested at the 1970 election. It was abolished at the 1977 election, forcing then-member David Wotton to move to the seat of Murray.  However, Wotton returned to Heysen when it was re-established at the 1985 election. He subsequently held the seat until his retirement in 2002, when he was replaced by former opposition leader Isobel Redmond. Redmond retired at the 2018 election and was replaced by Josh Teague.\nThe 1997 election saw the Democrats receive 47.9 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote, the closest they had ever come to a seat any Australian lower house (apart from the South Australian seat of Mitcham). The 2002 election saw the Democrats receive 46 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote. The 2006 election saw their vote collapse with Labor being brought back into the two-candidate race. That election saw the seat turn marginal against Labor for the first time ever; the Liberals were cut down to 53 percent of the two-party vote. Out of 47 lower house seats, the SA Greens have consistently polled strongest in Heysen. Greens candidate Lynton Vonow came within a few percent of winning the overlapping federal seat of Mayo at the 2008 by-election. Vonow contested Heysen for the Greens at the 2014 election and overtook the Labor candidate coming second after preferences with a 39 percent two-candidate preferred vote from a 19.7 percent primary vote. The Greens also polled well in neighbouring seats such as Kavel and Davenport with primary votes over 15 percent. The 2018 election saw Nick Xenophon's SA-BEST receive 48.2 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote in Heysen which was the closest they came to winning a lower house seat.\nAt the 2022 state election, the Liberals fell to only 51 percent of the two-party vote amid their statewide collapse, only the second time the seat had been marginal against Labor.\n\nMembers for Heysen\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nG399/400 Beijing-Changchun Through Train\nThe G399/400 Beijing-Changchun Through Train (Chinese: G399/400次北京南到长春高速动车组列车) is Chinese railway running between the capital Beijing to Changchun, capital of Jilin express passenger trains by the Shenyang Railway Bureau, Changchun passenger segment responsible for passenger transport task, Changchun originating on the Beijing train.

The shelter shed was not located on the platform, instead being located between the platform and the level crossing. \nThe station closed on 23 September 1987, when the State Transport Authority withdrew Bridgewater line services between Belair and Bridgewater. Both the platform and shelter shed were removed around 1994 when the line had gauge-convertible concrete sleepers installed in readiness for conversion from broad to standard gauge the following year.\nPassage 6:\nPiccadilly Valley wine sub-region\nPiccadilly Valley wine sub-region is a wine sub-region in South Australia located between the towns of Ashton and Basket Range in the north and the towns of Stirling, Aldgate and Bridgewater to its south in the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east of the Adelaide city centre.

The platform has since been demolished.\nPassage 9:\nAldgate, South Australia\nAldgate is a South Australian village and a suburb of Adelaide, located 21 km (13 mi) south-east of the Adelaide city centre, in the Adelaide Hills.\n\nHistory\nAn inn called the Aldgate Pump was opened by Richard D. Hawkins, a well-known publican, in 1864. Hawkins, who had emigrated from London, England, to the Province of South Australia in 1842, already owned several hotels, including the nearby Crafers Inn in present-day Crafers. The pump which Hawkins had installed outside the hotel (and which gave the hotel its name) became a popular place to water the horses and bullock teams which passed through the area, and by 1870, a small settlement had been established. Hawkins claimed at that time that some 60,000 people a year passed through the hotel's doors. The hotel became quite famous, at one point being described as \"one of the best decorated of its kind in the colony\" with \"magnificent chandeliers\".The pump and hotel, and subsequently the town, were named after Aldgate in London. The word derives from ealdgate, the Old English word meaning \"old gate\". The Hills Land and Investment Company subdivided land in the Aldgate area and laid out part section 92, Hundred of Noarlunga for settlement in 1882, naming the town after the hotel.\n\n21st century\nAldgate's drainage system has suffered substantial problems and has been the result of drastic flooding through the main street. One of the worst cases of this occurred at around 8:00 AM 8 November 2005, which left most of the businesses in the main street flooded with significant damage. A recent ongoing project around Aldgate has been upgrading the drainage system.In 2009 and 2010 the intersection of Mount Barker Road, Strathalbyn Road and Kingsland Road in Aldgate was upgraded and streetscape works were carried out throughout the township.  To make way for the roadworks, the pump which was the centrepoint of the town was temporarily removed. It was reinstalled in May 2011 by the Adelaide Hills Council and now sits atop a pedestal on the footpath in the main street.A new fire station for the Aldgate Country Fire Service was completed in August 2009.\n\nHeritage listings\nThere are many locally and state heritage-listed sites in Aldgate. those listed in the South Australian Heritage Register:\nAldgate Crafts Shop\nAldgate Pump Hotel (see above)\nRaywood, formerly Arbury Park: dwelling (designed by Frank Kenneth Milne, commissioned by Sir Alexander Downer, listed 1989), garden, chapel, driveway and gates (listed 2000)\nStangate House and Garden, bequeathed in 1975 to the National Trust of South Australia\nWairoa, historic home and gardens occupied by Marbury School from 1972 to 2004, listed June 1989\n\nGovernance\nAldgate is in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area, the federal Division of Mayo and the state electoral district of Heysen.\n\nIn popular culture\nAldgate is mentioned in the Redgum song \"So Goodbye\" featured on the band's 1978 album If You Don't Fight You Lose.\nPassage 10:\nSouth Brighton railway station, Adelaide\nSouth Brighton railway station is a former railway station on the Seaford line in Adelaide, South Australia.

He began his long and prolific film career in the early days of silent film.\n\nBiography\nBorn in the southwestern Ontario city of St. Thomas, Dell Henderson started his acting career on the stage, but appeared in his first movie Monday Morning in a Coney Island Police Court in 1908. Henderson was a frequent associate of film pioneer D.W. Griffith since 1909 and appeared in numerous early Griffith shorts in Hollywood. Henderson also acted on a less prolific basis in the movies of producer Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios. In addition to acting, Henderson directed nearly 200 silent films between 1911 and 1928. Most of those films are forgotten or lost, but he also directed movies with silent stars like Harry Carey and Roscoe Arbuckle. Henderson also worked as a writer on numerous screenplays.After retiring from directing in 1927, Henderson returned to acting full time and played important supporting roles in King Vidor's The Crowd (1928) and as General Marmaduke Pepper in Show People (1928). The advent of sound film damaged Henderson's acting career, and he often had to play smaller roles. In the 1930s, he appeared on several occasions as a comic foil for such comedians as The Three Stooges, W. C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy. He often played somewhat pompous figures like judges, businessmen, detectives or mayors. Modern audiences will remember Henderson as the annoyed hospital president Dr. Graves in The Three Stooges film Men in Black (1934) and the put-upon chaperone in the Our Gang film Choo-Choo! (1932). He also appeared as a night court judge in Laurel and Hardy's Our Relations (1936) and as a friendly car salesman in Leo McCarey's drama Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). Henderson ended his film career after numerous small roles in 1950.  He did make one final appearance on NBC-TV's \"This Is Your Life\" on March 10, 1954, during a tribute to Mack Sennett.\nHenderson died at the age of 79 of a heart attack in Hollywood. He was married to actress Florence Lee until his death. The couple made several silent films together.\n\nSelected filmography\nPassage 3:\nThe Blue Angel\nThe Blue Angel (German: Der blaue Engel) is a 1930 German musical comedy-drama film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings and Kurt Gerron. Written by Carl Zuckmayer, Karl Vollmöller and Robert Liebmann, with uncredited contributions by Sternberg, it is based on Heinrich Mann's 1905 novel Professor Unrat (Professor Filth) and set in an unspecified northern German port city. The Blue Angel presents the tragic transformation of a respectable professor into a cabaret clown and his descent into madness. The film was the first feature-length German sound film and brought Dietrich international fame. It also introduced her signature song, Friedrich Hollaender and Robert Liebmann's \"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\". The film is considered a classic of German cinema.\nThe film was shot simultaneously in German- and English-language versions. Though the English version was once considered a lost film, a print was discovered in a German film archive, restored and screened at San Francisco's Berlin and Beyond film festival on January 19, 2009. The German version is considered to be \"obviously superior\"; it is longer and not marred by actors struggling with English pronunciation.\n\nPlot\nImmanuel Rath is a professor at the local Gymnasium (high school for students expected to proceed to university) in Weimar Germany. The boys disrespect and play pranks on him. Rath punishes several of his students for circulating photographs of the beautiful Lola Lola, the headliner at the local cabaret called The Blue Angel. Hoping to catch the boys at the club, Rath goes there later that evening. He does find some students there, but while chasing them, he also finds Lola backstage and becomes infatuated with her. When he returns to the cabaret the following evening to return a pair of panties that was smuggled into his coat by one of his students, he spends the night with her. The next morning, reeling from his night of passion, Rath arrives late to school to find his classroom in chaos; the principal is furious and demands Rath's resignation.\nRath resigns his position at the school and marries Lola. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Rath becomes humiliatingly dependent on Lola. Over several years, he sinks lower and lower, first selling dirty postcards, and then becoming a clown in Lola's troupe to pay the bills. His growing insecurities about Lola's profession as a \"shared woman\" eventually consume him with lust and jealousy.\nThe troupe returns to The Blue Angel, where everyone attends to watch the former professor play a clown. On stage, Rath is humiliated by the magician Kiepert, who breaks eggs on Rath's head, and by seeing Lola embrace and kiss the strongman Mazeppa. Rath is enraged to the point of insanity. He attempts to strangle Lola, but Mazeppa and others subdue him and lock him in a straitjacket.\nLater that night, Rath is released and he revisits his old classroom. Rejected, humiliated and destitute, he dies clutching the desk at which he once taught.\n\nCast\nMusic\n\"Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuß auf Liebe eingestellt\" (\"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\": Music and lyrics by Friedrich Hollaender, sung by Marlene Dietrich\n\"Ich bin die fesche Lola\" (\"They Call Me Naughty Lola\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Robert Liebmann, sung by Dietrich\n\"Nimm Dich in Acht vor blonden Frau'n\" (\"Beware of Blond Women\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Richard Rillo, sung by Dietrich\n\"Kinder, heut' abend, da such' ich mir was aus\" (\"A Man, Just a Regular Man\"): Music by Hollaender, lyrics by Liebmann, sung by DietrichThe film also features the famous carillon of the Garrison Church at Potsdam playing \"Üb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit\" (\"Always Be True and Faithful\") as well as an orchestral version of the song. The original melody was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for Papageno's aria \"Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen\" from The Magic Flute. In the German Reich and subsequently the Weimar Republic, the lyrics of \"Üb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit\" symbolized Prussian virtues: \"Use always fidelity and honesty / Up to your cold grave / And stray not one inch / From the ways of the Lord\".\n\nBackground\nBy 1929, Sternberg had completed a number of films for Paramount, none of which were box-office successes. However, Paramount's sister studio in Germany, UFA, asked him to direct Emil Jannings in his first sound film. Jannings was the Oscar-winning star of Sternberg's 1928 film The Last Command, and had specially requested Sternberg's participation, despite an \"early clash of temperaments\" on the set.Though The Blue Angel and Morocco, both from 1930, are often cited as his first sound films, Sternberg had already directed \"a startling experiment\" in asynchronous sound techniques with his 1929 Thunderbolt.\n\nCasting Lola Lola\nSinger Lucie Mannheim was favored by UFA producer Erich Pommer for the part of Lola, with support from leading man Emil Jannings, but Sternberg vetoed her as insufficiently glamorous for a major production. Sternberg also rejected author Heinrich Mann's actress-girlfriend Trude Hesterberg. Brigitte Helm, seriously considered by Sternberg, was not available for the part. Sternberg and Pommer settled on stage and film actress Käthe Haack for the amount of 25,000 Reichsmarks.Sternberg first saw 29-year-old Marie Magdalene \"Marlene\" Dietrich at a music revue called the Zwei Krawatten (Two Neckties), which was produced by dramatist Georg Kaiser. Sternberg began immediately to groom Dietrich into \"the woman he saw she could become.\"\nCritic Andrew Sarris remarks on the irony of the relationship: \"Josef von Sternberg is too often subordinated to the mystique of Marlene Dietrich...the Svengali-Trilby publicity that enshrouded The Blue Angel – and the other six Sternberg-Dietrich film collaborations – obscured the more meaningful merits not only of these particular works but of Sternberg's career as a whole.\"\n\nProduction\nAfter arriving at Berlin's UFA studios, Sternberg declined an offer to direct a film about Rasputin, the former Russian spiritual advisor to the family of Czar Nicholas II. However, he was intrigued with a story by socialist reformer Heinrich Mann entitled Professor Unrat (Professor Filth) (1905), which critiques \"the false morality and corrupt values of the German middle class,\" and agreed to adapt it.The narrative of Mann's story was largely abandoned by Sternberg (with Mann's consent), retaining only scenes describing an affair between a college professor of high rectitude who becomes infatuated with a promiscuous cabaret singer. During filming, Sternberg altered dialogue, added scenes and modified cast characterizations that \"gave the script an entirely new dimension.\" The professor's descent from sexual infatuation to jealous rage and insanity was entirely Sternberg's invention.In order to maximize the film's profitability, The Blue Angel was filmed in both German and English, shot in tandem for efficiency. The shooting spanned 11 weeks, from 4 November 1929 to 22 January 1930, at an estimated budget of $500,000—remarkably expensive for a UFA production of that period.During filming, although he was still the nominal star of the film (with top billing), Jannings became jealous over the growing closeness between Sternberg and Dietrich and engaged in histrionics and threatened quit the production. The Blue Angel was to be his last great cinematic moment, and it was also one of UFA's last successful films. Sarris comments on this double irony:\n\n\"The ultimately tragic irony of The Blue Angel is double-edged in a way Sternberg could not have anticipated when he undertook the project. The rise of Lola Lola and fall of Professor Immanuel Rath in reel [sic] life is paralleled in the real life by the rise of Marlene Dietrich and the fall of Emil Jannings...\"\n\nRelease\nThe Blue Angel was scheduled for its Berlin premiere on 1 April 1930, but UFA owner and industrialist Alfred Hugenberg, unhappy with socialist Heinrich Mann's association with the production, blocked release. Production manager Pommer defended the film, and Mann issued a statement distancing his anti-bourgeois critique from Sternberg's more sympathetic portrayal of professor Immanuel Rath in his movie version. Sternberg, who declared himself apolitical, had departed the country in February, shortly after the film was completed, and conflict ensued. Hugenberg ultimately relented on grounds of financial expediency, still convinced that Sternberg had concealed within The Blue Angel \"a parody of the German bourgeoisie.\"The film proved to be \"an instant international success.\" Dietrich, at Sternberg's insistence, was brought to Hollywood under contract to Paramount, where the studio would film and release Morocco in 1930 before The Blue Angel would appear in American theatres in 1931.\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe Blue Angel, ostensibly a story of the downfall of a respectable middle-age academic at the hands of a pretty young cabaret singer, is Sternberg's \"most brutal and least humorous\" film of his œuvre. The harshness of the narrative \"transcends the trivial genre of bourgeois male corrupted by bohemian female\" and the complexity of Sternberg's character development rejects \"the old stereotype of the seductress\" who ruthlessly cuckolds her men.Sarris outlines Sternberg's \"complex interplay\" between Lola and the professor:\n\n\"The Blue Angel achieved its most electrifying effects through careful grading and construction. When Dietrich sings \"Falling in Love Again\" for the first time, the delivery is playful, flirtatious, and self-consciously seductive. The final rendition is harsher, colder, and remorseless. The difference in delivery is not related to the old sterotype of the seductress finally showing her true colors, but rather to a psychological development in Dietrich's Lola from mere sensual passivity to a more forceful fatalism about the nature of her desires. Lola's first instinct is to accept the Professor's paternal protection and her last is to affirm her natural instincts, not as coquettish expedients but as the very terms by which she expresses her existence. Thus, as the Professor has been defeated by Lola's beauty, Lola has been ennobled by the Professor's jealousy...\"\nBiographer John Baxter echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals \"the tragic dignity\" of Rath's downfall:\n\n \"[T]he tragedy of Immanuel Rath was not that he lost his head over a woman, but that he could not reconcile the loss of power with the acquisition of freedom.\" When Rath is forced to relinquish \"his authority [over] his students, he sinks into alienated apathy…Rath's failure to grasp the chance opened to him…is portrayed in terms of his increasing silence, as he sinks more and more sullenly into the guise of the ridiculous, ironically named clown…In the end, the authoritarian master of language is bereft of articulate speech\", finally erupting into a \"paraoxysmic cockscrow\" when he discovers that he has been cuckolded by Lola.\nWhen Rath, in a jealous rage, enters the room where Lola is making love to the cabaret strongman Mazeppa, Sternberg declines to show Rath, now a madman, at the moment when he is violently subdued by the authorities and placed in a straitjacket. Sternberg rewards the degraded Professor Rath for having \"achieved a moment of masculine beauty [by] crowing like a maddened rooster\" at Lola's deception: \"Sternberg will not cheapen that moment by degrading a man who has been defeated.\" Sternberg presents \"the spectacle of a prudent, prudish man blocked off from all means of displaying his manhood except the most animalistic.\" The loss of Lola leaves Rath with but one alternative: death.\n\nRemakes, adaptations and parodies\nThe Blue Angel (1959), director Edward Dmytryk's remake with Curd Jürgens.\nPousse-Cafe, a 1966 Broadway musical version with music by Duke Ellington.

He and his wife, Olga, were murdered in the Holocaust.\n\nLife\nBorn Kurt Gerson into a well-off merchant family in Berlin, he studied medicine before being called up for military service in World War I. After being seriously wounded, he was qualified as a military doctor in the German Army, despite having been only in his second year at university. After the war Gerron turned to a stage career, becoming a theatre actor under director Max Reinhardt in 1920. He appeared in secondary roles in several silent films and began directing film shorts in 1926.\nGerron's popular cinema breakthrough came with The Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel, 1930) opposite Marlene Dietrich. Two years before, Gerron originated the role of \"Tiger\" Brown in the 1928 premiere production of The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) at the Berlin Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, in which he also performed the first public performance of the song, \"Mack the Knife\". With the show's international success, Gerron's name and recorded voice became well known across Europe.\n\nUnder the Nazis\nAfter the 1933 seizure of power by the Nazis (known today as the Machtergreifung), Gerron left Nazi Germany with his wife and parents, traveling first to Paris and later to Amsterdam. He continued work there as an actor at the Stadsschouwburg and directed several movies. Several times he was offered employment in Hollywood through the agency of Peter Lorre and Josef von Sternberg, but Gerron refused to leave Europe.\nAfter the Wehrmacht occupied the Netherlands, Gerron and his parents were first interned in the transit camp at Westerbork. His parents were deported on May 5, 1943, and murdered in Sobibor. Gerron and his wife were later sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. There he was forced by the SS to stage the cabaret review, Karussell, in which he reprised Mack the Knife, as well as compositions by Martin Roman and other imprisoned musicians and artists.\nIn 1944, Gerron was coerced into directing a Nazi propaganda film intended to be viewed in \"neutral\" nations such as Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland, for example, showing how \"humane\" conditions were at Theresienstadt. Once filming was finished, Gerron and members of the Jazz pianist Martin Roman's Ghetto Swingers were deported on the camp's final train transport to Auschwitz, on 28 October.  Gerron and his wife were murdered in the gas chamber immediately upon arrival on 30 October 1944, along with the film's entire performing entourage (except for Roman and guitarist Coco Schumann). The next day, Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler ordered the closure of the gas chambers.\nAll known complete prints of Gerron's final film, which was to have been called Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet (Terezin: A Documentary Film of the Jewish Resettlement), and which is also referred to as Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt (The Führer Gives the Jews a City), were destroyed in 1945. Twenty minutes of footage were discovered in Czechoslovakia in the mid-1960s, and today the film exists only in fragmentary form.\nOn Friday June 17 2022 a Stolperstein for Kurt Gerron and one for his wife, Olga Gerson were installed at Paulsborner Strasse 77, Berlin, their last residence in Germany.\n\nSelected filmography\nDocumentaries about Gerron\nGerron is the subject of three documentary films, Prisoner of Paradise (PBS), Kurt Gerrons Karussell, and Tracks to Terezín, which features Holocaust survivor Herbert Thomas Mandl talking about Kurt Gerron as the director of the film Theresienstadt.

Roberts, was an American film editor who edited over 100 films during his almost 30-year career.\n\nLife and career\nArthur Roberts began editing towards the end of the silent era of the film industry, his first film being 1927's The College Hero, directed by Walter Lang. His last film was Republic's Lay That Rifle Down in 1955, after which he spent a brief period as the editor for the television series, Lassie, before retiring in 1956. During his career he would work with many famous directors, including Frank Capra (on several films, including The Donovan Affair), Lowell Sherman (on The Royal Bed), William Seiter (on several films, including Way Back Home), Edward F. Cline (on Cracked Nuts), George Cukor (on A Bill of Divorcement), Dorothy Arzner (the first female member of the DGA, on Christopher Strong), Anthony Mann (Strangers in the Night), George Archainbaud (Girls of the Big House), Fritz Lang (House by the River),\n\nFilmography\n(Per AFI database)\nPassage 4:\nGeorge Archainbaud\nGeorge Archainbaud (May 7, 1890 – February 20, 1959) was a French-American film and television director.\n\nBiography\nIn the beginning of his career he worked on stage as an actor and manager. He came to the United States in January 1914, and started his film career as an assistant director to Emile Chautard at the World Film Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  In 1917 he made his own directorial debut As Man Made Her. During the next three and a half decades he directed over one hundred films. After the beginning of the 1950s he moved to television.\nWhile working at RKO Radio Pictures in the beginning of the 1930s, he showed some artistic and skillful eye with many of his films. The finest examples include Thirteen Women (1932), a story of ethnic discrimination and revenge, with Myrna Loy as a half-caste Hindu; The Lost Squadron (1932), a memorable thriller about Hollywood stunt flyers, who risk their lives under the direction of monstrous Erich von Stroheim; Penguin Pool Murder (1932) and Murder on the Blackboard (1934), the first two films of the RKO trilogy starring Edna May Oliver as Miss Hildegarde Withers, a teacher and amateur investigator created by American writer Stuart Palmer; and later in his career the RKO drama Hunt the Man Down (1950), a film noir starring Gig Young which seems more concerned in showing the post-war transformation of seven characters since 1938, than the investigation to solve a murder case.\nAlthough Archainbaud directed films of all genres, he is nowadays mainly linked with westerns. In fact, it was not until the last decade of his directorial career until he specialized in them. With the producer Harry Sherman he made several Hopalong Cassidy oaters. Later he was also one of the principal directors of Gene Autry's Flying A Productions, at which he made several episodes for such weekly television series as Buffalo Bill, Jr., Annie Oakley and The Adventures of Champion.\nIn 1921 he married actress Katherine Johnston (1890 – 1969), whose last film was The Flapper (1920). He died in 1959 and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 5:\nCynthia Mort\nCynthia Mort (born June 18, 1956) is an American director, screenwriter, and producer. Mort has worked primarily in television since beginning her career in 1994, writing for the sitcom Roseanne. Her notable works include the HBO series Tell Me You Love Me as a creator and executive producer, the revenge film The Brave One (2007) as a screenwriter, and the biopic Nina (2016) as a director.\n\nBiography\nMort was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nCareer\nTelevision\nMort began her career as a screenwriter in 1994. She wrote multiple episodes for the sitcom Roseanne, and was later a producer on the show. She continued in television as a writer and producer for the program Will and Grace.In 2007, Mort created and produced the drama Tell Me You Love Me, which aired on HBO, and starred an ensemble cast including Jane Alexander and Adam Scott. The plot of the program closely examines various struggles that may arise in a committed marriage. The series gained notoriety for including highly graphic simulated sexual sequences, to the point that audiences asked whether the actors actually engaged in sexual intercourse on camera. The series ended after one season.Mort co-wrote a pilot episode for HBO called Tilda in 2011, but experienced conflicts with her co-writer Bill Condon. The project was not picked up as a series.\n\nWriting in film\nMort, along with Roderick Taylor and Bruce A. Taylor, wrote the screenplay for the 2007 film The Brave One. The film features Jodie Foster as a woman seeking revenge on the men who killed her fiancé.\n\nNina, controversy, and lawsuit\nIn 2016, Mort released her first film as a director, Nina, a biopic chronicling the life of singer Nina Simone. The film elicited a strong negative response from both critics and audiences alike as a result of Mort's choice to cast actress Zoe Saldana in the title role, despite discrepancies between the two women's skin colours. The film and its creators were accused of perpetuating blackface by darkening Saldana's skin to play the role.Furthermore, the film underwent another controversy in which Mort filed a lawsuit against the producers of Nina in 2014, after finding that choices made by the company compromised her long-standing artistic vision of the film.  As a result, the film was not released for another two years, and while Mort has expressed her support for the project, she maintains that the final result does not properly reflect her work.\n\nPersonal life\nMort is a lesbian. She was involved in a long-term relationship with actress Melanie Mayron and helped raise Mayron's children until their separation in 2008. Mort's personal life garnered attention after the release of The Brave One for her rumoured adulterous romance with actress Jodie Foster, who starred in the film. Both Foster and Mort broke up with their partners and began dating each other, but ended their relationship the following year.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nSee also\nList of female film and television directors\nList of lesbian filmmakers\nPassage 6:\nAlias French Gertie\nAlias French Gertie is an American pre-Code crime film directed by George Archainbaud from a screenplay by Wallace Smith, based upon the unproduced play The Chatterbox by Bayard Veiller. The film stars Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, who were making their first on-screen appearance together. A copy of this film survives in the Library of Congress.\n\nPlot\n\"French Gertie\" is a jewel thief; posing as French maid named Marie.

When a good-hearted detective, Kelcey, lets them off the hook with the promise that they will go straight, they agree.\n\nCast\nReception\nThe New York Times critic, Mordaunt Hall, gave the film a lukewarm review, praising the acting of Bebe Daniels, while not being as kind to Ben Lyon. Overall, he said the film, \"... has not been handled with the subtlety and smoothness it deserves. Nevertheless, up to a certain point, it is a production that holds the interest, but what should have been the main idea is sacrificed for a more obvious turn of events.\"\n\nNotes\nThis is the first film in which Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon co-starred. They were married a short time afterwards, in June 1930, and the two remained married until her death in 1971. The play from which this screenplay was adapted, The Chatterbox, does not appear to have ever been produced.The film was a remake of the 1925 FBO silent film, Smooth as Satin, starring Evelyn Brent and Bruce Gordon, and directed by Ralph Ince.\nPassage 7:\nHoppy Serves a Writ\nHoppy Serves a Writ is a 1943 Western film directed by George Archainbaud and starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy, the 43rd of 66 Cassidy features. The supporting cast features his regular sidekicks Andy Clyde and Jay Kirby, as well as Victor Jory and George Reeves. The film remains noteworthy today as one of the earliest performances (his 2nd) of unshaven newcomer Robert Mitchum, who made an impression upon the studio by generating a surprising fan mail response exactly as Clark Gable had after playing an extremely similar unshaven role in The Painted Desert, a Western starring William Boyd produced a dozen years earlier.\n\nPlot\nCattle rustler and stagecoach hold-up man Tom Jordan and his gang have been terrorizing the ranchers and other citizens of Mason City. Sheriff Hoppy is implored to bring them to justice, but their hideout is across the border in Oklahoma, outside his jurisdiction.

He also begins to take the role of evangelistic minister seriously as well.\nThings come to a head when the Reverend's son, Tommy, loses a significant amount of money to a local gambler, Martin.  When Sheldon goes to Tommy's rescue, he is recognized by Martin, who calls in the police.  In the events that follow, however, the truth is revealed that Sheldon did not actually kill Spots when another man confesses to the murder.

{"input": "New Hampshire Route 124 runs between two regions, one of which is found in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States with the population of about 2000 and is named what?", "context": "Passage 1:\nNew Hampshire Route 32\nNew Hampshire Route 32 (NH 32) is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The highway runs 14.139 miles (22.755 km) from the Massachusetts state line in Richmond, where the highway continues as Massachusetts Route 32, north to NH 12 in Keene. NH 32 connects the southern Cheshire County towns of Richmond and Swanzey with Keene and Athol, Massachusetts.\n\nRoute description\nNH 32 begins at the Massachusetts state line in the town of Richmond. The highway continues south as Massachusetts Route 32 (Richmond-Athol Road), which heads through Royalston toward Athol. NH 32 heads north as two-lane Athol Road to the center of Richmond, where the highway intersects NH 119 (Winchester Road/Fitzwilliam Road). The highway continues north as Old Homestead Highway, which enters the valley of the South Branch of the Ashuelot River as the route enters the town of Swanzey. NH 32 passes near the village of East Swanzey, through Swanzey proper, and then North Swanzey after entering the valley of the main stem of the river. In North Swanzey, the highway passes Dillant–Hopkins Airport. NH 32 enters the city of Keene immediately before it reaches its northern terminus at NH 12 (Main Street).\n\nJunction list\nThe entire route is in Cheshire County.\nPassage 2:\nWest Chesterfield, New Hampshire\nWest Chesterfield is an unincorporated community in the town of Chesterfield in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. It is located north of New Hampshire Route 9 in a valley leading to the Connecticut River. Via Route 9, Brattleboro, Vermont, is 3 miles (5 km) to the west, and Keene, New Hampshire, is 14 miles (23 km) to the east.\nWest Chesterfield has a separate ZIP code (03466) from the rest of Chesterfield.\nPassage 3:\nJaffrey Center Historic District\nThe Jaffrey Center Historic District encompasses the traditional civic heart of the small town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire.  The district lies to the west of the Jaffrey's main business district, extending along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 124) from Harkness Road to the Jaffrey Common, and along Thorndike Pond Road northward from Main Street.  It includes the town's oldest civic buildings, and was its main center until the mills of East Jaffrey eclipsed it.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nDescription and history\nThe district retains the feel of an 18th-19th century rural village, and includes elements dating to shortly after the town's incorporation in 1773.  The old burying ground was established in 1774, and the old meeting house (now a cultural center) was raised in 1775.  The district includes 19th century school houses, and houses that were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, in predominantly Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles.  One of the town's early industries is also represented, in the remnants of a tannery established c. 1810 at the east end of the district.The area's importance as an economic as well as civic center arose  after completion of the Third New Hampshire Turnpike (now NH 124).  The turnpike brought travelers, who stopped at inns and taverns in the center, and goods, which were sold to local farmers.  Melville Academy, a secondary school, was founded in 1832, and its 1833 building is now a local museum.  The area remained of some significance even as East Jaffrey's mills became more prominent, as it catered in the late 19th century to vacationers drawn to nearby Mount Monadnock.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 4:\nNew Jersey Route 124\nRoute 124 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States that is 14.74 mi (23.72 km) long. It is the eastern section of what used to be Route 24 before that road was realigned to its current freeway alignment. The western end is at an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and County Route 510 (CR 510) in Morristown, Morris County; the eastern end continues as CR 603 on Springfield Avenue at the border between Maplewood and Irvington in Essex County. The route runs through suburban areas of Morris County, passing through Madison and Chatham. It interchanges with Route 24 on the border of Millburn, Essex County and Summit, Union County and serves as a frontage road for that route. Upon splitting from Route 24, Route 124 continues east through Springfield Township, Union Township, and Maplewood to its eastern terminus.\nThe alignment of today's Route 124 was first designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current alignment of Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.\n\nRoute description\nMorris County\nRoute 124 begins at the intersection of US 202 and CR 510 at the Park Place square in the downtown of Morristown, Morris County. From here, it heads to the southeast as South Street, a two-lane undivided road that passes businesses. At the intersection with CR 663, the road widens to four lanes. A short distance later, CR 601 continues southeast on South Street and Route 124 bears left to head east on Madison Avenue, coming to an interchange with Interstate 287. Past this interchange, the road passes Morristown Memorial Hospital and continues through mainly commercial areas with some homes. At the intersection with Normandy Parkway, the route turns to the southeast and enters Morris Township, where it narrows to two lanes again, with NJ Transit’s Morristown Line running a short distance to the northeast of the route near the Morris County Golf Club. Route 124 continues into more residential areas and crosses into Madison.Here, the route passes near some business parks before intersecting CR 636, where it is briefly a four-lane road. Past this intersection, the road passes between residential neighborhoods to the northeast and Drew University to the southwest. Route 124 crosses over the Morristown Line near James Park and becomes Main Street, heading southeast through the commercial downtown of Madison. Here, the road intersects CR 647 and CR 608. Past the Rosedale Avenue intersection, the route heads into a mix of residential and business areas.  Route 124 enters Chatham at the intersection with Brooklake Road/Division Avenue. In the center of the town, the route intersects CR 638 and CR 607 before continuing east.\n\nEssex and Union counties\nRoute 124 crosses the Passaic River and runs along the border of Millburn, Essex County, to the north and Summit, Union County, coming to a large interchange with the Route 24 freeway and CR 649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR 657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects CR 608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR 512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.\n\nFrom here, the route passes more commercial establishments as a four-lane road, heading farther from Route 24, before crossing CR 527. At this intersection, Route 124 entirely enters Springfield Township and becomes Morris Avenue, passing a mix of residences and businesses. The route passes under I-78 without an interchange and becomes a two-lane road that passes through the downtown of Springfield, eventually widening to four lanes again.  In this area, it intersects CR 635. Route 124 comes to a circular junction with Route 82 and CR 577. Here, Route 82 continues southeast on Morris Avenue, CR 509 Spur heads south, and CR 577 heads north. Route 124, meanwhile, briefly splits into a one-way pair here. The eastbound direction heads south on Meisel Avenue before turning north along Maple Avenue while the westbound direction follows Springfield Avenue. The two directions of Route 124 rejoin and follow four-lane divided Springfield Avenue northeast to a crossing of the Rahway River and a partial interchange with I-78. Here, there are ramps from the local lanes of eastbound I-78 to both directions of Route 124, to the local lanes of westbound I-78 and Route 24 from both directions of Route 124, and to the express lanes of westbound Interstate 78 from westbound Route 124.\n\nPast this interchange, the route enters Union Township and continues east through developed areas, intersecting CR 638 before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and intersecting CR 630. It continues through more urban commercial areas before intersecting CR 630 again. At this point, Route 124 crosses into Maplewood, Essex County and becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that is locally maintained. This road heads east through the downtown of Maplewood, coming to an intersection with CR 601.  A short distance later, the Route 124 designation ends at the border of Maplewood and Irvington. From this point, Springfield Avenue continues east as CR 603, which heads toward Newark and ends at CR 510, which follows Springfield Avenue for a short distance before becoming Market Street.\n\nHistory\nWhat is modern-day Route 124 was created as part of two turnpikes; the Morris Turnpike, running from Elizabeth to Newton, and the Springfield and Newark Turnpike, from Springfield to Newark. The road was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from Jersey City to Pittsburgh, before being designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part of Route 24, a road that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion of Route 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and the John F. Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 was designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown. In 2002, maintenance of the portion of Route 124 in Maplewood was transferred to the municipality from the New Jersey Department of Transportation.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nU.S. Roads portal\n New Jersey portal\nPassage 5:\nDublin Pond\nDublin Pond or Dublin Lake is a 236-acre (0.96 km2) water body located in Cheshire County in southwestern New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Dublin. The pond lies at an elevation of 1,480 feet (451 m) above sea level, near the height of land between the Connecticut River/Long Island Sound watershed to the west and the Merrimack River/Gulf of Maine watershed to the east.\n\nDescription\nWater from Dublin Pond flows west through a series of lakes into Minnewawa Brook, a tributary of the Ashuelot River, which flows to the Connecticut River at Hinsdale, New Hampshire. New Hampshire Route 101, a two-lane highway, runs along the northern shore of the lake, and the town center of Dublin is less than one mile to the east.\nThe state owns the 1.3 acre Dublin Lake Scenic Area on Route 101, which protects much of the north shore.\nThe lake is classified as a coldwater fishery, with observed species including smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, brook trout, and brown bullhead.45 historic buildings and 10 small boathouses around the lake are designated as the Dublin Lake Historic District. The buildings were part of a popular summer home community in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many prominent artists stayed in the community, including Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Abbott Handerson Thayer, and Joseph Lindon Smith. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nSee also\nList of lakes in New Hampshire\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 6:\nWinchester Town Hall (New Hampshire)\nThe town hall of Winchester, New Hampshire, is located on Main Street, just south of the junction of New Hampshire Route 10 and New Hampshire Route 119 in the center of the town.\n\nHistory and building details\nBuilt of brick in 1911-12 to a design by S. Winthrop St. Clair, it is the only Gothic Revival town hall in Cheshire County.  It was built because the previous town meeting house (a combination town hall and church at the site of the Winchester Memorial Church) was destroyed by fire.  The church was also designed by St. Clair, a Boston-based architect who hailed from Winchester.The town hall is a roughly rectangular structure, covered by a roof that is gabled at one end and hipped below a very small gable at the other end.  At the northern corner stands an octagonal four-story tower topped by a crenellated parapet.  The interior of the building has two levels: the upper level houses an auditorium space with a stage at one end, with a balcony area that has been converted for use as offices.  The basement level houses additional offices.  The building has seen alterations primarily to its interior, but has retained much of its original design.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 7:\nMarlborough, New Hampshire\nMarlborough is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.

The district includes early 19th-century residential structures, as well as industrial buildings and housing associated with the Jaffrey Mills which arose in the mid-19th century. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.The town of Jaffrey was laid out in the 1740s, and incorporated in 1773. Its original town center, now the Jaffrey Center Historic District, was located near its geographic center. The village of East Jaffrey had its beginnings with the establishment of saw and grist mills on the Contoocook River in 1770 by John Boorland. The construction of a turnpike (now NH 124) near the mills in 1799 brought further economic activity. In 1814, the mill complex was replaced by a woolen mill, predecessor to the Jaffrey Mills buildings that now line the river north of the Main Street bridge. By the mid-19th century the area had seen significant growth, with a large number of Greek Revival houses, and a growing array of businesses and civic institutions. The arrival of the railroad in 1870 cemented the area's economic and civic importance.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nPassage 9:\nNew Hampshire Route 78\nNew Hampshire Route 78 (abbreviated NH 78) is a 3.456-mile-long (5.562 km) secondary state highway in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States.

The attack, in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Baghdad, occurred ten minutes after the Council of Representatives had adjourned for lunch. It was on the first floor of the Baghdad Convention Center, which houses the parliament. Two further unexploded suicide vests were found near the canteen. The building had earlier been searched by dogs – very rare considering dogs are considered ritually unclean by Iraqis – suggesting the authorities suspected an attack was imminent. Following the attack the government closed down mobile phone networks and Apache helicopters flew overhead.\n\nCasualties\nThe US military reported on 13 April that only MP Mohammed Awad had died, and that 22 others were wounded.Early reports however had said that eight people were killed, including three MPs, and at least 23 people were reported wounded. The MPs named were Mohammed Awad, a member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front, Taha al-Liheibi, a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front and an unnamed Kurdish MP.\n\nResponsibility\nSuspicions initially centered on the bomber having been the bodyguard of an MP. A government spokesman said \"there are some groups that work in politics during the day and do things other than politics at night\". Member of Parliament Mohammed al-Dayni accused the government of lax security at the site.On 13 April, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a message on an Islamist website claiming to have sent \"A knight from the state of Islam ... [into] the heart of the Green Zone\" to carry out the attack. It is not clear whether this claim is genuine, though some who monitor such websites believe it is.In February 2009, two bodyguards of Iraqi National Dialogue Front MP Mohammed al-Dayni were arrested on suspicion of the attacks. Alaa Khairallah Hashim, al-Dayni's security chief and Ryadh Ibrahim al-Dayni, Mohammed al-Dayni's nephew, confessed on television to involvement in several attacks, including the parliament bombing. They said the MP had given authorisation for the bomber to enter the parliament area. The security forces asked the Council of Representatives of Iraq to lift al-Dayni's parliamentary immunity. Mohammed al-Dayni claimed that the accusations were lies and that his bodyguards had been tortured into making a false confession because he had been disclosing human rights abuses in Iraqi prisons. al-Dayni took a flight to Jordan, but the aeroplane was forced to turn back; parliament then agreed to lift his immunity.\n\nReactions\nWhen the bombing occurred, Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of oppositional Iraqi National Dialogue Front, the party of the killed MP Awad, called on the United States to overthrow the government of Nouri al-Maliki: \"We need America to realize that this pro-Iranian government it has installed has allowed interference on the side of one against the other\".The Iraqi Council of Representatives held an emergency assembly the following day in response to the bombing, to \"show resilience in the face of such attacks\".US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks, saying \"there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of democracy\". The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ali Hosseini described the attack as \"inhumane and satanic ... target[ting] both its Shia and Sunni officials\"Four days later three Ministers from the Sadrist Movement quit the government, citing, among other things, the growing insecurity in Baghdad.\n\nSee also\n2007 suicide bombings in Iraq\nList of attacks on legislatures\nPassage 10:\nAnant Nag filmography\nAnant Nag is an Indian actor and occasional film producer who appears as an actor in predominantly in Kannada films and a few Hindi and Telugu films.

After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car trunk. As they try to get her upstairs, Peter gets sidetracked by her chest, not realizing she has woken up. She headbutts him several times, and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew, delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along.\nAfter Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey — who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic — has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter.\nSome distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous-looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial killer known only as the Farmer.\nAfter opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape, too, with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter incapacitates the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant.\nAs the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat hook in the shed.\nMeanwhile, Andrew and David discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven, dying from being disemboweled before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out.\nPeter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope.\nThe Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters, defeated, \"You must be joking\" before they set upon him; the lighter goes out, and Peter screams as they attack him.\nAfter the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men arrive at the farm. As they step up to the front door, the Farmer suddenly rushes out at them with the pickaxe raised above his head. The image freezes as he swings at them with it, and the screen fades to black.\n\nCast\nReception\nThe Cottage received positive reviews from critics, garnering a 71% certified \"fresh\" result on Rotten Tomatoes. Variety, ReelFilm, and MovieFone gave mostly positive reviews, with MovieFone criticizing the film's pacing issues but praising the movie's acting and banter.Empire Magazine also reviewed the film, stating \"Frightfest regulars and hungry gorehounds will get a kick out of this, but those who hailed Williams as a Brit-indie visionary after London To Brighton might be left scratching their heads.\"\nPassage 3:\nLondon to Brighton (disambiguation)\nLondon to Brighton is a 2006 film by Paul Andrew Williams.\nLondon to Brighton may also refer to:\n\nBrighton Main Line, a railway line from London to Brighton\nLondon to Brighton events, events that take place between London and Brighton\nLondon to Brighton Veteran Car Run, an annual motoring event\nLondon to Brighton in Four Minutes, an early 1950s BBC film about a train journey\nLondon to Brighton Way, a Roman road\nPassage 4:\nPaul Andrew Williams\nPaul Andrew Williams (born 1973 in Portsmouth, England) is a British film writer and director.

The choirmaster is a young teacher, Elizabeth who is preparing the choir to enter a local musical choir competition called \"Shadow Song\". Arthur is also estranged from his son, James. Marion's health deteriorates over time until one night when she dies in her sleep. Arthur initially takes this loss severely and cuts himself from his family and the choir. Eventually he agrees to take Marion's place in the choir. The transition proves to be a challenge for Arthur thanks to the unconventional songbook that includes racier songs such as Salt-N-Pepa's \"Let's Talk About Sex\" and Motörhead's \"Ace of Spades\". However he grows to enjoy spending time in the choir.\nOn the eve of the competition, Arthur has an argument with James in a failed attempt to rebuild their relationship and pulls out of the choir.

When the doorbell rings and Christine goes to answer it, the couple is attacked by Rian (Jumayn Hunter), Asad (Ashley Chin), and Teddy (Sonny Muslim), who hold them both hostage and tie them up in their front room. Knowing Sebastian will be returning at 9pm, the group waits for his return so that they can get revenge on him for grassing on Rian's cousin and getting him sent to prison; Teddy leaves with Mike's credit cards to find a cash machine.\nRian suddenly drags Christine into another room to presumably rape her, leaving Asad to guard a frustrated Mike. Asad allows Mike to have a drink and explains that he is not as violent as Rian, and tells Mike details about his life. Rian's school friends, Beth (Jennie Jacques) and Charman (Corinne Douglas), and Beth's younger brother Oscar, then arrive with an axe for Rian to use on Sebastian. Oscar gets sent into the kitchen, while Teddy returns with Mike's money for Rian to send to his cousin.\nSebastian returns home and is dragged upstairs to his room by the teenagers, who begin to torture and beat him. Hearing his son's screams, Mike desperately struggles to free himself, and is able to knock a knife off the dinner table so that he can cut his wrists free. He goes into the next room to find a traumatised Christine tied up and naked underneath a blanket. Arming himself with a candlestick, he attempts to sneak upstairs, but his presence is alerted by Charman who was exiting the bathroom. Asad, Teddy, Charman, and Beth flee from the house, while Mike grapples with Rian, before finally beating him down with the candlestick and then his fists. Christine comes upstairs to comfort a bloodied, finger-less Sebastian who slowly loses consciousness in her arms, while she hysterically screams for Mike to do something. Mike goes downstairs to call 999, then goes into the kitchen to drink from the tap, when he senses someone behind him and turns around to see Oscar standing there. The film ends with Mike, knife in hand, and Oscar both staring at each other, unsure of what to do next.\n\nCast\nProduction\nBased on a specially written script template, the film was made for Steel Mill Pictures.

Cherry Tree Lane is part of the Film4 Frightfest on 29 August 2010. Metrodome Distribution holds the rights for the sales in England.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. The Film Blogger dubbed it a \"moderately tense thriller\", that was \"accentuated by a well-developed class commentary and some solid performances\".Anthony Quinn of the Independent wrote that \"Like Haneke, the director creates a mood of violence while holding off from graphic depiction – this is no torture porn. Its suggestion of a conscienceless underclass will be as a red rag to more conservative souls, but you suspect Williams won't care. He's becoming a real player in the cinema of ordeal\".Damon Wise, in his review for Empireonline.com, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and claimed that \"After the histrionic Harry Brown and gory Eden Lake, you could be forgiven for thinking the hoodie-horror subgenre had run its course. But while this sparse, ingenious thriller might seem to cover familiar ground, Cherry Tree Lane delves deeper into the hoodie psyche with a degree of black comedy lacking from its forebears\". Wise added that \"The tense siege takes up most of the film’s running time, but this is not so much torture porn as a dry, existential drama\".Daniel Stephens described Cherry Tree Lane as \"...more than just a workmanlike thriller. Like other recent British films that have looked at urban decay in the country, and in light of the recent riots in London and elsewhere, it feels uncomfortably current\" and argued that \"...you can’t help but feel this is a dog eat dog world and what comes around will keep on coming around – generation to generation\".While other critics criticised the film for its lack of social context \"A middle-class couple (Rachael Blake and Tom Butcher) are terrorised in their home by a gang of youths and though the violence happens off-screen, it still feels exploitative. Williams is able to create an unsettling atmosphere with simple sound effects, but he fails to provide a convincing context for the extreme antisocial behaviour (including rape).\" \"Williams has nothing to suggest either as a possible solution to the social problem or a resolution to his drama\".\n\nTitle\nThe film’s name is an ironic reminder of the address of the idealised suburban Banks family in the popular 1964 film Mary Poppins, as well as in the series of books on which the film is based.\n\nSee also\nList of films featuring home invasions\nPassage 10:\nI Was All His\nI Was All His (German: Ich war ihm hörig) is a 1958 West German drama film directed by Wolfgang Becker and starring Barbara Rütting, Carlos Thompson and Wolfgang Preiss.

It was written by Jorge Amado in 1967 and published the following year. It was later adapted to a 1977 Cinema Novo (Nouvelle Vague) film by director/screenplay writer Nelson Pereira dos Santos.\nTent of Miracles was written three years after the military overthrew Brazilian democracy, and it is part of a series Amado called \"The Bahia Novels\", works exploring the region's past.  The novel chronicles the chaos that results when a prominent Columbia University professor arrives in Brazil, with nothing but praise on his lips for a long-forgotten local Bahian writer and self-taught social scientist named Pedro Archanjo.  The year is 1968, which Levinson announces is the centennial of Archanjo's birth, setting off a media stampede to figure out who Archanjo was so that they can profit from a celebration of his life.  When a few people finally uncover who Arcanjo was and what he espoused, media barons and advertisers are horrified to discover that he was an Afro-Brazilian social critic, womanizer and heavy drinker who died penniless in the gutter.  So, they invent their own Pedro Archanjo, which they hype in various advertising-driven events, enlisting some Brazilian academics who are as superficial and self-promoting as Levinson.\nThe novel moves back and forth between events in the life of the historical hero, Pedro Archanjo, and the present.  Most of the characters are types that lend themselves to the author's relentless satire.  The historical setting is the colorful old Pelourinho neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, that flows down the hill from the main plaza, where Archanjo works as a lowly runner at the School of Medicine adjacent to the cathedral.  The place of the title is the home of the hero and his best friend, Lidio Corro, which also serves as barber shop, cultural center, print shop and artist's studio.  The historical sections explore Afro-Brazilian culture and racial discrimination.  Author Jorge Amado once declared that \"Brazil is a racial democracy\", and the novel is consistent with that belief, because he situates all racism in the past.\nThe hero's male children are all over the city, but he is father to none.  They call him \"godfather,\" and he takes one of his \"godchildren,\" Tadeu, under his wing to help him pursue an engineering degree.  The womanizing of the hero serves to highlight the belief of both Pedro Archanjo and the novel's author that uninhibited sexual passion between people of different races and colors (and the resulting mixed children) is Brazil's unique solution to racism.  The theory behind this view was disseminated by Brazilian sociologist and historian Gilberto Freyre in his treatise Casa-Grande & Senzala (1933), translated into English as The Masters and the Slaves. A number of the female characters in the novel are highly sexualized in ways that, according to critics, represent racial stereotypes.\nIn the face of criticism of his portrayals of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Jorge Amado declared: \"It is not a question of literary pride.  It is only the certainty that no one until today had dared to look face-to-face with so much love at Bahian humanity and its problems.  No one knows better than I, who wrote them, what the weaknesses and defects of my novels are.  But, by the same token, no one can measure the sacrifice they cost me, the honesty that went into their making, the disinterest and pure love that made the novelist return to his people.\"Beyond Amado's treatment of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Tent of Miracles is a satire of modern Brazilian institutions, especially the mass media and parts of academia.  Spared from the author's knife is the Brazilian military, which in 1967 was detaining, torturing and exiling some of Amado's political friends.  A few scholars have suggested that the novel hides in its story a parable critical of the military dictatorship, particularly through the portrayal of a repressive but ineffectual assistant police commissioner, Pedrito Gordo.\nPassage 4:\nInstitut des hautes études cinématographiques\nL'Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC; the \"Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies\") is a French film school, founded during World War II under the leadership of Marcel L'Herbier who was its president from 1944 to 1969. IDHEC offered training for directors and producers, cameramen, sound technicians, editors, art directors and costume designers. It became highly influential, and many prominent film-makers received their training there including Paulo Rocha, Louis Malle, Alain Resnais, Claire Denis, Peter Lilienthal, Volker Schlöndorff, Andrzej Żuławski, René Vautier, Andre Weinfeld, Mostafa Derkaoui, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Claude Sautet, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Patrice Leconte, Costa Gavras, Theo Angelopoulos, Omar Amiralay, Rithy Panh, Arnaud Desplechin, Claude Miller, Alfonso Gumucio Dagron Christopher Miles and Pascale Ferran.\nIt was reorganized between 1986 and 1988 and renamed La Fémis.\nPassage 5:\nNelson Pereira dos Santos\nNelson Pereira dos Santos (22 October 1928 – 21 April 2018) was a Brazilian film director. He directed films such as Vidas Secas (Barren Lives), based on the book with the same name by Brazilian writer Graciliano Ramos.\n\nBiography\nPereira dos Santos, named in honor of Almirante Horatio Nelson, was born in São Paulo, Brazil. Himself a frequenter of the cinema, Pereira dos Santos's father brought his very young son to the movie theater for the first time. By secondary school Pereira dos Santos was already fond of literature, and at 15 years old he joined the Brazilian Communist Party and became close to one of its other members, Astrogildo Pereira. At the time the party was considered illegal by the government of Getúlio Vargas.\nThe first feature film he directed was Rio 40°, which was released in 1955. The film is a chronicle of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and it influenced several other directors, spurring the Cinema Novo movement. In 1963, Pereira dos Santos was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.His most well-known film outside Brazil is Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês (How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, 1971). It was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. The film takes place in the sixteenth century and details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the (now extinct) indigenous Tupinamba warrior tribe against the French and Portuguese colonizers of the Brazilian littoral.  The film is something of a black comedy about European colonialism—one that makes satirical use of the Brazilian modernist trope of Antropofagia (\"cultural cannibalism\"), then recently revived by the Tropicalismo movement of the 1960s—as well as a bitter commentary on the historical genocide of the indigenous tribes in Latin America and the gradual destruction of their civilization.\nHis 1994 film The Third Bank of the River was entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.Pereira dos Santos' 2006 film Brasília 18% explores some of the darker aspects of contemporary Brazilian politics such as political corruption, the murder of trial witnesses, and money laundering.\nPereira dos Santos was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2006.\n\nDeath\nPereira dos Santos died of multiple organ failure in Rio de Janeiro on 12 April 2018.

The actors and actresses who portrayed the Tupinambas wore historically correct attire resulting in  a considerable amount of historically correct nudity and semi-nudity in many scenes.\nThe location for the entire film was the Bay of Ilha Grande, which has 365 islands and whose shores comprise the Angra dos Reis and Parati municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPlot\nIn 16th century Brazil rival French and Portuguese settlers are utilizing the indigenous people as allies in their struggle to establish control. The Tupinambás, who live in the Guanabara Bay area, are allied with the French, while the Tupiniquins are allied with the Portuguese.\nA Frenchman who has been captured by the Portuguese is then captured by the Tupinambás after they attack and kill a group of Portuguese. He tries to convince his captors by speaking in French (reciting the poem by Étienne Jodelle found in André Thévet's Singularities of France Antarctique) but the Tupinambás don't believe that the Frenchman was a prisoner of the Portuguese they have killed, and the Chief thinks he is Portuguese because \"No Frenchman would shoot at the Tupinambá.\" The tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong Portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a Portuguese musket ball. Now they have one.\nHowever, the Frenchman is allowed free run of the village area, is eventually provided with a \"wife,\" and adopts traditional Tupinambá nudity in place of his Western clothes. \nA French tradesman comes to the village and tells the Tupinambás that their prisoner is indeed Portuguese – he then promises the outraged Frenchman that he will tell the Tupinambás the truth if the Frenchman finds a hidden treasure that another European has hidden in the area. He also instructs him to collect wood, and pepper for him on his return.\nThe Frenchman gathers cannon powder from the abandoned Portuguese cannons, and brings it to the Tupinambás, who use it to defeat the rival Tupiniquins in battle.\nThe relationship between the Frenchman and his Tupinambá \"wife\" remains enigmatic. It is unclear for most of the movie if she intends to save him from the group that wants to eat him, or if she has been assigned to win his trust and prevent him from escaping. The Frenchman appears to become in love with her but eventually decides to try to leave. She keeps him from escaping by swamping his canoe and then shooting him in the leg with an arrow.

Bento dos Santos studied chemical-industrial engineering at the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Technical University of Lisbon. During his early university years he played rugby union and was also the manager of the Portugal national rugby team in 1967/1968. He started his professional career as an employee of Companhia União Fabril (CUF), the largest Portuguese business conglomerate before the Carnation Revolution in 1974. During the turmoil of the revolution, indeed a left-wing military coup, CUF was forcibly nationalized by the revolutionary government and collapsed. Bento dos Santos, together with other partners such as Eduardo Catroga, founded the metals brokerage and trading company Quimibro. In the late 1980s, Pedro Passos Coelho, future Prime Minister of Portugal, was invited by a cousin to work there as a collaborator. Bento dos Santos studied also economics at the Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão of the Technical University of Lisbon, but he did not graduate. Beyond Quimibro, Bento dos Santos founded other ventures like Quinta do Monte d'Oiro, a winery. In the 2000s, Bento dos Santos became popular due to his cuisine progames O Sentido do Gosto (2007) on the Portuguese television RTP and Segredos do Vinho (SIC, 2004).  He also published a book of cuisine with the title O Sentido do Gosto as well as Subtilezas Gastronómicas – receitas à volta de um vinho (Assírio & Alvim, 2005). He is affiliated with the International Gastronomy Academy, the Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs, the Confraria do Vinho do Porto, the Académie des Psycologues du Goût, and is a chevalier of both des Entonneurs Rabelaisiens and du Tastevin.\nPassage 9:\nRio, 100 Degrees F.\nRio, 100 Degrees F.

Zeca, Sujinho, Jorge, Paulinho and Xerife interconnect the focused stories, covering five touristic points: Copacabana, Sugar Loaf Mountain, Corcovado, Quinta da Boa Vista and Maracanã Stadium. In addition to trying to make a living, they decide to accumulate money to buy a soccer ball. Jorge also needs to sell enough to buy medicine for his sick mother. He goes to Copacabana, is bumped into and his can of peanuts falls into the sea. Without the goods to sell, Jorge starts begging and gets money, but other boys try to rob him, and when he gets rid of them, he is run over. Paulinho goes to Quinta da Boa Vista and his lizard, Catarina, escapes to the zoo. He retrieves it, but the guard of the place chases him away and throws his pet into a serpentarium. Resigned, Paulinho leaves for Maracanã, where he meets the rogue Miro [Jece Valadão (1930-2006)] and his partner Zé [Zé Kéti (1921-1999)] who, eager to enter the stadium and watch the game, take the whole boy's money and sell the remaining peanuts. Zeca, in turn, decides to go to Corcovado, but he is noticed by the explorer of minors who works there, an unscrupulous old man who chases him, forcing him to make a risky escape. Sujinho, on the other hand, with no money and no peanuts, is escorted to his house by a policeman. Sheriff does well in sales and manages to enter Maracanã, after circumventing security. He and Zeca end the day happy to have gotten the money.\nMinor characters and other stories are told in parallel.

He started to make films while a student at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. At thirteen years old, he made his first short film, based on the short story Continuity of the Parks by Julio Cortázar. After graduation from high school, he started studying psychology, before dropping out in favor of enrolling in the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts's film school. He graduated in 1983 with a short film called La espera, based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges. The short earned him a prize at the Huesca International Film Festival in Spain.Bielinsky entered the film industry around 1983 as an assistant director, working under such filmmakers as Miguel Pérez, Carlos Soria and Eliseo Subiela. He also worked on a Mégane commercial that Wim Wenders was filming in Argentina. Bielinsky wrote the script for the 1998 film La sonámbula, recuerdos del futuro (released abroad as Sleepwalker), directed by Fernando Spiner.Bielinsky directed his first film, Nine Queens (Spanish: Nueve reinas) in 2000, a crime thriller about a scam involving forged stamps. The film was critically acclaimed both in Argentina and abroad, and earned seven Silver Condor awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Bielinsky was asked by several Hollywood companies to remake the film in English, but declined. An American remake, Criminal, was produced by Steven Soderbergh and released in 2004.\nBielinsky directed his second film, The Aura, in 2005. Ricardo Darín, who played the lead in Nine Queens, also played the lead role in The Aura. While less financially successful that Nine Queens, it received critical praise. Critics noted how The Aura dropped many of the black comedy elements of Nine Queens in favor of a more atmospheric and cerebral noir. The film won Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the Silver Condor awards. The film was the Argentine entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards.\nIn both of his films various characters mention \"El Turco\", a powerful underworld figure who is never shown on screen.\n\nPersonal life and legacy\nBielinsky was married and had one child. A month before Bielinsky was going to present The Aura at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, he died from a heart attack in his sleep in São Paulo, Brazil, while casting for an advertisement.In 2011, he was posthumously awarded a Konex Award as one of the 5 best film directors of the decade in Argentina.", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 3705, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e14effdfd1d2d53f9eb0f892aa7e91d04e846a77d24f397f"}

Her railroad worker father (Lafe McKee) was the first victim of the murderous fiend known as the Rattler, who is especially difficult to catch because he makes himself appear as other people with a collection of masks, or he effects a strange disguise with eyeglasses, a fake nose, and a crepe-hair mustache.

Tom Mix was still an A-list star in 1935, alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Mary Pickford.  He was paid $40,000 for four weeks work on The Miracle Rider, which he used as urgent funding to support his circus.The serial combined the large cast and interlocking plots of a silent serial with the science fiction and cliffhangers of the sound era. Filming of the outdoor action sequences took place primarily at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The movie ranch, which had been in use as a filming location since the early silent movie era, was known for its rugged landscape and giant sandstone boulders. One of those boulders became known as Tom Mix Rock in later years, after it was discovered that bootholes had been carved in the rock to help the actor shoot a scene atop the rock for The Miracle Rider.\n\nStunts\nTom Mix, whose voice was strained and nasal due to a repeatedly broken nose and a bullet through his throat, did a lot of his own stunts, although some were doubled by Cliff Lyons.\n\nChapter titles\nThe Vanishing Indian\nThe Firebird Strikes\nThe Flying Knife\nA Race with Death\nDouble Barreled Doom\nThundering Hoofs [sic]\nThe Dragnet\nGuerilla Warfare\nThe Silver Road\nSignal Fires\nA Traitor Dies\nDanger Rides with Death\nThe Secret of X-94\nBetween Two Fires\nJustice Rides the PlainsSource:This was Mascot's only 15-chapter serial.\n\"Zaroff\" is obviously inspired by Basil Zaharoff, a notorious early twentieth-century arms merchant, often cited as one of the so-called \"merchants of death\", who supposedly helped bring on World War I.\n\nSee also\nList of film serials\nList of film serials by studio\nPassage 6:\nPrairie Thunder\nPrairie Thunder is a 1937 American Western film directed by B.

It was the last of 12 B-westerns Foran made for Warners as a singing cowboy (as he was often billed) from 1935 to 1937.\n\nPlot\nIn the Old West, a telegraph line is coming to Buffalo Creek, where general store owner Nate Temple lives with daughter, Joan. Joan is courting Rod Farrell, a scout for the Union Army. Rod is ordered to investigate a break in the telegraph line, along with sidekick, Wichita, a Union soldier. Rod finds the break in the line in Indian territory and repairs it. Rod suspects a white man assisted the local Indian tribe in sabotaging the line. Rod and Wichita ride up on an Indian camp. The Indian chief, High Wolf, tells Rod the Indians intend to make war because the railroad and the telegraph coming to the region have depleted the buffalo population. High Wolf confirms a white man, who he will not name, is the only friend to his tribe. Rod and Wichita discover a man named Lynch and his gang are supplying the Indians with weapons and ammunition in exchange for the Indians hijacking supply trains. Rod and Wichita breach the gang's hideout, take Lynch and his gang into custody, hold them at Temple's store, and telegraph the cavalry for help. Rod rides off with Joan while Wichita guards the gang. Matson, one of Lynch's men not arrested, tells High Wolf of the gang's arrest, and a slew of Indian braves invade Buffalo Creek terrorizing the town with gunfire. Rod and Joan, hearing the gunfire, head toward town. Matson and High Wolf free the gang and Lynch orders the Indians to burn the town. Lynch intercepts Rod and Joan. Rod is taken to the Indian camp. Joan is taken to Lynch's hideout. Wichita overhears Lynch and sneaks into the Indian camp where Rod is tied to a stake to be burned. Lynch also arrives at the camp telling High Wolf to strike the railroad workers camp. Wichita, dressed as an Indian, frees Rod and the pair head for Lynch's hideout where they rescue Joan, then head to the railroad construction camp with the Indians in pursuit. The citizens of Buffalo Creek, now displaced after the town was burned, fortify their wagons on the outskirts of town and a gunfight ensues as the Indians arrive.

Reeves Eason, was an American film director, actor and screenwriter. His directorial output was limited mainly to low-budget westerns and action pictures, but it was as a second-unit director and action specialist that he was best known. He was famous for staging spectacular battle scenes in war films and action scenes in large-budget westerns, but he acquired the nickname \"Breezy\" for his \"breezy\" attitude towards safety while staging his sequences—during the famous cavalry charge at the end of Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), so many horses were killed or injured so severely that they had to be euthanized that both the public and Hollywood itself were outraged, resulting in the selection of the American Humane Society by the beleaguered studios to provide representatives on the sets of all films using animals to ensure their safety.\n\nCareer\nBorn in Massachusetts, Eason studied engineering at the University of California. Eason directed 150 films and starred in almost 100 films over his career. Eason's career transcended into sound and he directed film serials such as The Miracle Rider starring Tom Mix in 1935. He used 42 cameras to film the chariot race as a second-unit director on Ben-Hur (1925), the climactic charge in Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), and also directed the \"Burning of Atlanta\" in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nFamily and personal life\nHis son, B. Reeves Eason Jr., was a child actor who appeared in 12 films, including Nine-Tenths of the Law, which Eason, Sr. directed.

{"input": "Which has more species, Aichryson or Polypodium?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPolypodium rimbachii\nSerpocaulon sessilifolium is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Costa Rica and northern and western South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Guyana). Under the synonym Polypodium rimbachii, it was regarded as endemic to Ecuador and threatened by habitat loss.\nPassage 2:\nPhlebodium aureum\nPhlebodium aureum (golden polypody, golden serpent fern, cabbage palm fern, gold-foot fern, blue-star fern, hare-foot fern; syn. Polypodium aureum, Polypodium leucotomos) is an epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.\n\nDescription\nIt is a rhizomatous fern, with the creeping rhizome 8–15 mm (rarely 30 mm) in diameter, densely covered in the golden-brown scales that give the species its name. The fronds are large and pinnatifid (deeply lobed), from 30–130 cm long and 10–50 cm broad, with up to 35 pinnae; they vary in color from bright green to glaucous green and have undulate margins. Several round sori run along each side of the pinna midrib, and the minute spores are wind-dispersed. The fronds are evergreen in areas with year-round rainfall, semi-evergreen or briefly deciduous in areas with a marked dry season.\n\nDistribution\nIt is confined to the eastern side of the Americas and the Caribbean, ranging from the extreme southeast of the  US state of Georgia and south into Florida. It is also found in the Bahamas, on Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Lesser Antilles, as well as coastal regions of Caribbean and Atlantic South America, including Venezuela, Brazil, Suriname, French Guinea, Guyana, and Paraguay. It is the only species of Phlebodium found in North America or on Caribbean islands; all other species are endemic to South America.\n\nHabitat\nThis fern is rarely terrestrial in habitat, usually colonizing the canopies of tropical rainforests and the dwarf palms of subtropical forests. It is common in the cloud forests of the Caribbean and northern South America. It grows in varied habitats in Florida, including swamps and hammocks, and can thus apparently tolerate a wide range of microclimates. Its restriction to the tropics and subtropics is readily explained by its intolerance of anything other than very brief, light frosts. High levels of light are also critical for the growth of this species, and its deciduous habit allows it to invade relatively dry areas.\n\nCultivation and uses\nPhlebodium aureum is well-adapted to cultivation and is valued both as an ornamental plant and in herbal medicine.\nIt can be cultivated in greenhouses in non-tropical climates if night temperatures do not fall below about 5 °C. Several cultivars have been selected for garden planting, with varying leaf color from grey-green to silver-green to blue-green, or with cristate or very wavy frond margins.\n\nMedicine\nDecoctions have been used as a panacea in Central American folk medicine. These tonics were prescribed for a multitude of ailments, ranging from asthma to heart disease. Modern medicine has also investigated P. aureum, often using the deprecated synonym Polypodium leucotomos.\nOral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has also been studied for the treatment of dermatologic disorders including melasma, vitiligo, psoriasis, polymorphous light eruption, atopic dermatitis, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, photoaging and skin cancer.Oral consumption of Polypodium leucotomos extract has been shown to protect the skin from ultraviolet light damage. Clinical studies have shown that Polypodium leucotomos extract provides photoprotection against the effects of both UVB and UVA light. A review of 19 human and 6 basic scientific studies showed that Polypodium leucotomos was well tolerated with a favorable side effect profile. Consequently, Polypodium leucotomos supplementation has been posited as an adjunct photoprotection strategy in combination with traditional UV filters, such as sunscreen.\n\nSystematics\nPhlebodium aureum is a member of a very small, and recently discovered genus. It was split from the genus Polypodium, and the split is still apparent in the multitude of synonyms available for Phlebodium aureum. Phlebodium is one of the 178 genera in the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, the family Polypodiaceae is broken into a number of subfamilies, with Phlebodium a member of the non-grammatid tribe within the subfamily Polypodioideae. Members of the non-grammatids in this subfamily include the genera Phlebodium as well as Polypodium, from which Phlebodium is derived and which most likely is its closest relative. Other members include Pecluma, Pleopeltis, Microgramma, and Pleurosoriopsis. A bootstrapping technique proves that, at a 90% confidence level, the polypodiaceous ferns form a sister relationship with tree ferns. However, further phylogenetic studies need to be conducted regarding the current status of the genus, and which of the species are the most related.\nThe genus Phlebodium is exemplified by containing rows of areoles that lack included veins, and each sorus served by two different veins. Correll and Correll, two authors responsible for thirty years of classification since Flora was introduced in 1982, documented Phlebodium aureum as Polypodium aureum as recently as 1982. However, this creation of the new genera is warranted based on some notable differences. For instance, Giudice et al. point out that the sori on Phlebodium are more smooth and rounded when compared to other groups within the family Polypodiaceae. Additionally, studies on spores and size of the mature plant prove that Phlebodium contrasts severely from the rest of its family, providing the creation of the genera. The division of genera within the Polypodiaceae is fairly gray, considering that systematically, gametophytes differ only very slightly amongst different genera.\nMembers of the family Polypodiaceae are most closely related to the Davalliaceae, with further relationships noted to Oleandraceae, Tectariaceae, and the Lomariopsidaceae within the order Polypodiales, which contains 80% of today’s ferns species (see additional page for picture). The order arose and diversified about 100 million years ago, and are regarded as one of the most evolutionarily advanced orders of ferns.\nPassage 3:\nPolypodium scutulatum\nSerpocaulon fraxinifolium is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Mexico, Central and South America. Under the synonym Polypodium scutulatum , it was regarded as endemic to Ecuador and threatened by habitat loss.\nPassage 4:\nPolypodium australe\nPolypodium cambricum, the southern polypody, limestone polypody, or Welsh polypody, is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae, native to southern and western Europe where it grows on shady rocks, near the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin and in the mountains of Atlantic Europe. It is a spreading, terrestrial, deciduous fern growing to 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, with pinnate fronds. The sori are yellow in winter.\n\nDescription\nPerennial. Rhizome elongate, often above ground, densely covered with rusty scales. Fronds distich, 5–30 centimetres (2.0–11.8 in), glabrous, deltoid in outline; petiole yellowish green, shorter than the pinnatipartite limb. Segments 5-28 on each side; margin dentate, marked with a strong midrib. Sori round, 2–4 millimetres (0.079–0.157 in) in diameter, orange-yellow, arranged on each side of the midrib of segments. The fruits bloom from February to July.\n\nName\nThis species has been widely known by the more apt name P. australe Fée. However, since Linnaeus did mention the species, albeit in the aberrant cambricum-form, that name must have priority.\n\nEtymology\nPolypodium is derived from the Greek Polus, many, and podion, small foot, since the rhizome bears numerous roots. \nThe specific epithet cambricum means \"Welsh\", from the Latinized form of Cymru, the Welsh name for Wales. \nAustrale comes from the Latin auter, wind of the south, for in Europe, this species grows largely in the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nCultivation\nTwo cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\n'Cambricum' \n'Grandiceps Fox' (Cristatum Group)\nPassage 5:\nPleopeltis polypodioides\nPleopeltis polypodioides (syn. Polypodium polypodioides), also known as the resurrection fern, is a species of creeping, coarse-textured fern native to the Americas and Africa.\n\nDescription\nThe evergreen fronds of this fern are 25 cm high by 5 cm wide and monomorphic. The leathery, yellow-green pinnae (leaflets) are deeply pinnatifid, oblong to narrowly lanceolate, usually widest near middle, occasionally at or near base. It attaches to the limbs of its host plant with a branching, creeping, slender rhizome, which grows to 2 mm in diameter. The scales are lanceolate, with light brown base and margins, and having a dark central stripe.\n\nThe gametophytes (the haploid gamete producers) of this plant develop from very small spores that float in the air and are deposited on moist tree branches. These spores are produced in sporangia that develop on the leaves of the fern's sporophyte. The fern can also reproduce by the division of its rhizomes.\nOn the underside of the blades, the sori (reproductive clusters) are round, discrete, and sunken. Their outline can be seen as raised dimples on the upper surface. They are typically near the outer edge, and occur on all but the lowest pinnae of fertile fronds. Indusium is absent. Sporangia are yellow to brown at maturity. Spores are produced from summer to fall.\n\nHabitat\nThis fern is an epiphyte, or air plant, which means it attaches itself to other plants and gets its nutrients from the air and from water and nutrients that collect on the outer surface of bark. The resurrection fern lives on the branches of large trees such as cypresses and can often be seen carpeting the shady areas on limbs of large oak trees repeatedly exposed to rainfall. However, it is known to grow on the surfaces of rocks and dead logs as well. It is often found in the company of other epiphytic plants such as Spanish moss.\nThe P. polypodioides resides in the hardwood forests of southeastern United States in areas including Delaware, Maryland, the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. This fern can also be found in areas such as subtropical America, parts of southern Africa and other humid or sub-humid climate areas.\n\nPhysiology and Rehydration\nThe resurrection fern gets its name because it can survive long periods of drought by curling up its fronds and appearing desiccated, grey-brown and dead. However, when just a little water is present, the fern will uncurl and reopen, appearing to \"resurrect\". It has been estimated that these plants could last 100 years without water and still revive after a single exposure.\n\nThe resurrection fern roots have evolved to function as anchors for the epiphytes, holding them to their host tree’s bark and have been found to be inefficient in absorption. When in clustered groups of ferns on the bark of trees, the increased transpiration of the ferns and bark allow the middle ferns of the cluster to remain open longer than ferns on the outside. The relative humidity of the air and the closing rate of the leaves of the ferns is an inverse relationship. The greater the humidity, the slower the leaves of the ferns close because they have prolonged exposure to moisture in the air.The resurrection fern can severely desiccate and lose almost all of its water. Experiments have shown they can lose up to 97%--and remain alive, though more typically they only lose around 76% in dry spells. For comparison, most other plants would die after losing only 8-12%. This fern can lose almost all the water not hydrating the cells in its leaves and survive. Upon rainfall or even minute exposures to water they can fully rehydrate and return to a normal state within 24 to 48 hours. Following substantial exposures to moisture, there is an immediate increase in its water content of up to 50% after the first hour and 65-70% after three hours. When it regains moisture, the fern can once again become photosynthetically active, increasing its metabolism and release of organic compounds that provide nutrients for symbiotic bacteria that allow them both to thrive.  \n\nAt least one study has shown association between P. polypodioides and moss, indicating that this fern may rely on moss for some of its water needs.\nThe resurrection ferns accumulate sugar in their dehydrated cells in order to protect them and stabilize the membranes and proteins in the dry state. By accumulating sugar, the cells can maintain hydrogen bonds between necessary macromolecules needed for their structure. An interesting feature of the resurrection fern is it does not immediately uptake water after having been in a desiccated state. The resurrection ferns have porous cell structure networks that can expand and rearrange to accommodate absorbing three to four times their own weight in water after being exposed. Initially, the water flows via capillary pressure into the spongy layer of the epidermis and the porous network of the fern’s leaves, without altering them significantly. Over time, pressure builds up in the fern cell network, changing the turgor pressure and strain in the plant, initiating the unfolding of the leaves. The fern only stops unfolding its leaves when the cell network of the fern is entirely filled with water. The uncurling of the leaves was believed to be an entirely osmotic phenomenon, but when the fern is again exposed to water, it absorbs the water through solid colloids causing an increase in volume and capillary pressure of the cells of the fern.\n\nWhen the fronds \"dry\", they curl with their bottom sides upwards. In this way, they can rehydrate the quickest when rain comes, as most of the water is absorbed on the underside of the leaf blades. The fern fronds contain canal cells in the center of their surface scales that direct water to the epidermis of the fern leaves, allowing absorption. The ability of the fern fronds to unroll after exposure to desiccation is attributed to the large cells of the upper epidermis along the midrib of the frond that increase in width more than any other epidermal cell, which forces the fronds to uncurl and flatten out.One way the resurrection fern has adapted to survive desiccation is the ability of its cell walls to deform and reform, without bursting or rupturing. It has been observed that dehydrins may allow the cell walls of the fern fronds and leaves to deform and reform in times of extreme drought followed by water exposure, due to large fluctuations in water content. Dehydrins were found to be only expressed when the fern was drying or in the desiccated state, with the dehydrins located on the outsides of the cells near the cell walls, allowing the leaves and fronds of the ferns to deform and reform accordingly.Thermoluminescence of the resurrection fern has been tested to observe at what temperatures it occurs and therefore shows what temperatures and amount of desiccation the ferns can tolerate before their chloroplasts lose the energy they’ve stored for the plant, in the form of light emissions. One study found the resurrection fern to require high temperatures before thermoluminescence occurred at around 50 degrees C whereas other desiccation-tolerant plants showed thermoluminescence at 40 degrees C. The thermoluminescence activity of the resurrection fern increased as it was exposed to six separate but consecutive flashes of green safelight at its leaves. Because thermoluminescence from the fern fronds wasn’t observed until higher temperatures, this hints that the fern’s chloroplasts may have a mechanism to withhold and store energy for the fern as it desiccates that allow it to survive higher temperatures and extreme periods of desiccation.\n\nReproduction\nThe fern has spores on the bottom of the fronds, contained in sori. The fern sporulates in Summer and early Fall. Rhizome sections are also viable offspring and can root themselves in new medium.\n\nSee also\nResurrection plant\nPassage 6:\nPolypodium\nPolypodium is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek poly (πολύ) \"many\" + podion (πόδιον) \"little foot\", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.\nThey are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10–80 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium).\nPolypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like Polypodium 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. Polypodium have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat.\n\nSpecies\nSeveral of the species form hybrids with other species in the genus; these may often be distinguished by being sterile, with very small \"blind\" sori. As of February 2020, Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species and hybrids:\n\nA number of species formerly included in the genus have recently been transferred to other genera, including Campyloneurum, Cyathea, Microgramma, Nephrolepis, Pecluma, Phlebodium, Pleopeltis and Serpocaulon. Species placed elsewhere include:\n\nPolypodium argyrolepis = Serpocaulon lasiopus\nPolypodium mindense = Serpocaulon eleutherophlebium\nPolypodium mixtum = Pleopeltis murora\nPolypodium piligerum = Moranopteris achilleifolia\nPolypodium punctatum Thunb. ex Murray = Hypolepis punctata\nPolypodium quitense = Pecluma dulcis\nPolypodium rimbachii = Serpocaulon sessilifolium\nPolypodium scutulatum = Serpocaulon fraxinifolium\nPassage 7:\nPolypodium cambricum\nPolypodium cambricum, the southern polypody, limestone polypody, or Welsh polypody, is a species of fern in the family Polypodiaceae, native to southern and western Europe where it grows on shady rocks, near the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin and in the mountains of Atlantic Europe.

Sometimes called the Appalachian polypody or Appalachian rockcap fern, it is very similar in appearance to Polypodium virginianum.  For years, P. virginianum—long considered a variety of the British Polypodium vulgare—was recognized as having cryptic races, with diploid, triploid, and tetraploid representatives.  Since the triploid specimens bore abortive spores, it was apparently the hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid groups.  In 1991, it was resolved that the type of P. virginianum was the tetraploid series, and that it is an allotetraploid species of hybrid origin, with the diploid species as one parent.  The diploid species was then named P. appalachianum.  The other parent of P. virginianum was found to be Polypodium sibiricum.  The tetraploid of hybrid derivation tolerates warmer climates than either parent.\n\nPolypodium sibiricum is also now known to be one of the parents of the allotetraploid Polypodium vulgare, along with Polypodium glycyrrhiza.P. appalachianum is an epipetric plant, preferring sandstone or other hard, noncalcareous rocks.  However, it is known to grow as an epiphyte in the Smoky Mountains. Throughout much of its range, it will be found to grow in places more sheltered from the sun and heat than is P. virginianum. Both species, and their hybrid, can form large clonal colonies, forming dense mats that hold organic matter in place on rock shelves and surfaces.\nPassage 9:\nPhlebodium\nPhlebodium is a small genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its species were formerly included in Polypodium.They are epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The fronds are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, and are pinnatifid. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond.\n\nSpecies\nAs of February 2020, Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species:\n\nSee also\nCalaguala\nPassage 10:\nAichryson\nAichryson is a genus of about 15 species of succulent, subtropical plants, mostly native to the Canary Islands, with a few in the Azores, Madeira and Morocco.\nThe species of Aichryson are not frost-resistant. They are related to Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium and Monanthes, readily seen in their similar flowers.\nThe genus name comes from a contraction of the Greek \"aei\" (always) and \"chrysos\" (gold).Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants. The hybrid cultivar Aichryson × aizoides var. domesticum 'Variegatum' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nTaxonomy\nRecent phylogenetic studies of Crassulaceae indicate that Aichryson is closely related to Monanthes and Aeonium (both genera are also largely endemic to the Canary Islands). Two other genera of Crassulaceae that have many-parted (polymerous) flowers (Sempervivum and Jovibarba) are not closely related to the three Canary Island genera.On the Canary Islands, the center of species diversity seems to be the island of La Palma.\nRelationships within Aichryson were investigated by Fairfield et al. (2004) [Plant Systematics and Evolution 248: 71–83].

He is best known for his role as Ray Barone on the CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, for which he received an Emmy Award, and as the voice of Manny in the Ice Age film series. He created and starred in the TNT comedy drama Men of a Certain Age (2009–2011). From 2012 to 2015, Romano had a recurring role as Hank Rizzoli, a love interest of Sarah Braverman in the NBC series Parenthood. More recently, he co-starred in the romantic comedy The Big Sick (2017) and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese's epic crime film The Irishman (2019). Since 2017, Romano has portrayed Rick Moreweather in the Epix comedy-drama series Get Shorty.\n\nEarly life and education\nRomano was born in Queens, New York City, the second son of Luciana \"Lucie\" (née Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (1925–2010), a real estate agent and engineer. He is of Italian descent. He grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. He has an older brother, Richard (born 1956), a sergeant with the NYPD, and a younger brother, Robert (born c. 1966), a second grade teacher in New York City.Romano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975. He was in the same high school class as Fran Drescher. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended Queens College, in Flushing, New York, where he studied accounting.\n\nCareer\nHis early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by Saturday Night Live short film producer Neal Marshad and appeared on The Comedy Channel. His career included many outlets, such as Comedy Central, where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist. He also was a contestant on Star Search in the stand-up comedy category. He originally was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television sitcom NewsRadio, but was fired and replaced by Joe Rogan. He then appeared on Late Show with David Letterman doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with CBS. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, Everybody Loves Raymond on CBS, that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, a category he won in 2002. He also shared two Emmy Awards as an executive producer when his show won as Outstanding Comedy Series in 2003 and 2005.Romano performed the opening monologue at the 1998 White House Correspondents' Association dinner.Romano and his comedian friend Kevin James starred in the salesman comedy Grilled as two average Joes of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.\nRomano was featured on a 2000 episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, on which he won $125,000 for the NYPD's D.A.R.E. unit. The following year, he and one of his brothers appeared on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.In 2004, Romano became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond. The show broke another record by having the highest revenue, at $3.9 billion.On December 13, 2003, Romano was a guest star, sending a birthday card to Bob Barker for Barker's 80th birthday on the 27th \"Million Dollar Spectacular\" special of the CBS game show The Price Is Right.Romano was the subject of the documentary film 95 Miles to Go. The film documents Romano's road trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by ThinkFilm. In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at UCLA by fellow stand-up veteran David Steinberg, for an episode of Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg. The program first aired on the TV Land network in March 2007.\nRomano returned to television with a new dramedy for TNT in 2008, Men of a Certain Age, which he co-created with former Everybody Loves Raymond writer Mike Royce. It co-starred Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.\nRomano made an appearance in the seventh season of NBC series The Office as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by Michael Scott.Romano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of ABC sitcom The Middle as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie's honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from Everybody Loves Raymond to be reunited with Patricia Heaton on The Middle. Doris Roberts guest-starred in three episodes.\nHe joined the cast of Parenthood beginning with its fourth season premiere. He became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with Sarah Braverman and developed a friendship with her nephew who has Asperger syndrome. The role was specifically created for him after he expressed his love for the series and met with creator Jason Katims on the set of Friday Night Lights.In 2002, Romano voiced the woolly mammoth Manfred (Manny) in the film Ice Age, and its sequels Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 2009, Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012, and Ice Age: Collision Course in 2016.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Romano played a leading role in three seasons of the MGM+ television show Get Shorty, created by Davey Holmes and co-starring Chris O'Dowd.In 2019, Romano starred in the Netflix comedy film Paddleton and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman.Romano is set to play Jim Valvano in an upcoming movie about the former NC State Wolfpack basketball coach.\n\nCompetitions\nRomano competed in the World Series of Poker in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nIn early 2010, Romano starred in the second season of The Golf Channel's original series The Haney Project in which Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney attempts to improve the golf games of different celebrities and athletes. Romano's goal was to finish the show being able to break 80.  Romano took time off from the show to be with his father, Albert Romano, who died in March 2010. Romano is also a regular competitor in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he finished fifth in 2012 with his partner, Australian professional Steven Bowditch. It was the first time Romano had qualified for the final round after failing to do so on 11 successive occasions. He also competes annually in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament owned by NBC and held at Lake Tahoe each July.\n\nPersonal life\nRomano married his wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at a bank together. Romano's character's daughter on Everybody Loves Raymond was named after his real-life daughter, Alexandra \"Ally\" Romano. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his television children have the same names as his real children and changed the twins' names to Geoffrey and Michael onscreen. He also said his brother was not pleased with Ray Barone's television brother.Romano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's daughter made several appearances on Everybody Loves Raymond as Molly, the best friend of his on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes, such as \"Debra at the Lodge\", and \"Boys' Therapy\". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes \"Golf For It\", \"Just a Formality\", and \"The Toaster\". Romano's wife, Anna, appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael's school in season 6's episode titled \"The Angry Family\".In February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife, Anna, had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told People magazine that \"the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect.

{"input": "Who directed more films, Leslie Goodwins or Kenneth Webb?", "context": "Passage 1:\nLeslie Goodwins\nLeslie Goodwins (17 September 1899 – 8 January 1969) was an English film director and screenwriter. He directed nearly 100 films between 1926 and 1967, notably 27 features and shorts with Leon Errol, including the Mexican Spitfire series. His 1936 film Dummy Ache was nominated for an Academy Award in 1936 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel).  Dummy Ache was preserved by the Academy Film Archive and the Library of Congress in 2013. His 1937 film Should Wives Work? (starring Errol) was also nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. He was born in London, England and he died in Hollywood, California.\nGoodwins began his screen career in the waning years of silent films, as a gag writer and then director. He directed comedy stars Snub Pollard and Ben Turpin for the low-budget Weiss Brothers studio. In 1936 producer Maurice Conn hired Goodwins to direct features for Ambassador Pictures starring Pinky Tomlin or Frankie Darro. That same year he joined the two-reel comedy unit at RKO Radio Pictures, two of his early efforts earning Academy Award nominations. Goodwins became a fixture at RKO, equally adept at action and mystery stories but specializing in comedy. He remained with the short-subject division while working on feature films, notably the popular Mexican Spitfire comedies. He remained with RKO through 1951.\nIn 1950 Goodwins entered the new field of television, directing Jackie Gleason in The Life of Riley. The director's long experience with budget productions made him an ideal choice for fast-paced television production, and he was involved in several hit shows including Topper, The Cisco Kid, My Favorite Martian, F Troop, and Gilligan's Island.\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 2:\nShould Wives Work?\nShould Wives Work? is a 1937 American short comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins.

Roberts and Charles R. Marion, based upon the successful radio program Lum and Abner created by Chester Lauck and Norris Goff.  It was the fifth of seven films in the Lum and Abner series, and was released by RKO Radio Pictures on September 28, 1944.  The film stars Lauck and Goff, along with Florence Lake and Andrew Tombes.\n\nPlot\nLum Edwards and Abner Peabody own a general store in Pine Ridge. When oil tycoon M. A. Parker is stranded in the town awaiting his car being repaired, he decides to play a practical joke on the two small-town rubes, and feigns interest in purchasing their store, alleging that there is an oil deposit below the premises. He offers Lum and Abner $20,000 for their property, but the two believe he is trying to steal their property by offering them far less than the property is truly worth. Rather than take Parker's money, the pair convince their friends and neighbors to donate money to drill for oil.\nAs the days go by and they do not strike oil, Lum and Abner get their fellow citizens to invest more and more funds. Eventually, however, there comes a day when their oil speculation company runs out of money. Desperate to get their investors' money back, the pair head to Chicago to sell their property to Parker. While waiting to see him, the duo is overheard discussing their oil property by Jimmy Benton, who works for Parker's chief rival. He approaches Lum and Abner and offers them a large sum of money for their property, enough to pay back all their investors. Parker's partner, Clarke, overhears Benton's offer, and not wanting to lose out on such a lucrative prospect, offers the pair even more money. Lum and Abner agree to sell to Clarke, and return to Pine Ridge, able to pay back all their investors with interest, as well as making a tidy profit for themselves. Parker and Clarke, meanwhile, are left with a worthless piece of property.\n\nCast\n(cast list as per AFI database)\nChester Lauck as Lum Edwards\nNorris Goff as Abner Peabody\nBarbara Hale as Sally\nFlorence Lake as Abigail\nGrady Sutton as Cedric\nDick Elliott as Squire\nHerbert Rawlinson as Wentworth\nDick Baldwin as Jimmy Benton\nErnie Adams as Zeke\nJack Rice as Clarke\nSam Flint as Dr. Crane\nAndrew Tombes as  M.

The film was slated to be one of five RKO productions to be screened at New York City tradeshows from September 18–22.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily found little merit with the film, feeling that it would only appeal to fans of the radio program. They called the production quality \"routine\", and the direction of Leslie Goodwins, \"pedestrian\". Harrison's Reports also gave the picture a lukewarm review, echoing the sentiment that it would only find an audience among the existing fans of the Lum and Abner radio show. Motion Picture Daily was more kind. While they agreed that the film's comedy would find the best reception among the radio show's audience, they felt that it would have a broader appeal, saying that the picture made \"...no passes at subtlety or finesse and concentrates on characterization and the broad sweep of rustic humor. The trade name for this is corn, but it's Grade 'A' corn....\"\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1944\nPassage 4:\nThe Devil Diamond\nThe Devil Diamond is a 1937 American film directed by Leslie Goodwins.\nThe film is also known as Peter B.

Based on a story by John Twist, with a screenplay by novelist Nathanael West, the film is about aircraft development and the dangers of flying in the period before World War II.\n\nPlot\nPhil Mercedes (Richard Dix), once a record-setting pilot, is now an aging alcoholic. As an air show performer, while inebriated, he crashes his stunt aircraft into a barn and is grounded for a year. His sister Kay (Wendy Barrie), his only means of support, hopes to land a job in the drafting department for Martin Ames (Kent Taylor), the chief engineer for Dan McLean (Edmund Lowe), an aircraft manufacturer.\nGiven the war in Europe, the McLean company hopes to win a big contract with the government. Although Kay is not very skilled, she shows Ames some drawings Phil made. The creative designs interest Dan, who approves the construction of a high-speed fighter aircraft. Preliminary tests of the aircraft prove disastrous, with test pilot Dick Allerton (Donald Briggs) contending that the aircraft is too dangerous to fly.\nWith a redesign of the wings, Dick flies the experimental aircraft again, but the landing gear will not extend fully, leaving the test pilot circling the airport. If the aircraft cannot complete its tests, the company will be in danger of bankruptcy. Phil again takes over, successfully wrenching the gear down, but losing his life in the process. With the successful completion of the flight tests, the company is saved.\n\nCast\nProduction\nNovelist Nathanael West was involved in a number of B films in this period, including Men Against the Sky, but recognition of his work was short-lived. Along with his wife Eileen, he was killed in a car crash on December 22, 1940, when West (a notoriously bad driver) ran a stop sign in Southern California. Principal photography for Men Against the Sky took place from late May to June 15, 1940.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lucille Ball, considered Hollywood's B movie queen, was to play the female lead before Wendy Barrie came on board. Paul Mantz, noted movie stunt pilot, was the aviation consultant. Models were mostly used, but also notable is the use of footage of the experimental Hughes H-1 Racer during its trials.\n\nReception\nMen Against the Sky was generally considered a popular entry in the aviation film genre, although not of the same caliber as Test Pilot (1938) or Men With Wings (1938), which explored the same subject. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times in a contemporary review, characterized Men Against the Sky as a \"generally entertaining little action picture,\" although he criticized its \"maudlin heroics,\" the storyline which was \"routine and obvious\" and the performances that were no better than \"stock and pedestrian.\"\nPassage 6:\nPop Always Pays\nPop Always Pays is a 1940 American comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins using a screenplay by Charles E. Roberts, based on a story by Arthur J. Beckhard. Although not credited in the film, news reports of the time reported that when Goodwins fell ill during the filming, the screenwriter, Roberts, assumed directing duties. The film stars Leon Errol, Dennis O'Keefe, Adele Pearce, and Walter Catlett, and was released by RKO Radio Pictures on June 21, 1940.\n\nCast\nLeon Errol as \tHenry Brewster\nDennis O'Keefe as \tJeff Thompson\nPamela Blake as \tEdna Brewster\nWalter Catlett as \tTommy Lane\nMarjorie Gateson as \tMrs. Brewster\nTom Kennedy as \tMurphy\nRobert Middlemass as \tMr. Oberton\nEffie Anderson as Mary\nErskine Sanford as \tJohn Hayes\nVivien Oakland as \tMrs. Violet Oberton\nPassage 7:\nKenneth Webb\nKenneth Webb may refer to:\n\nKenneth Webb (director)\nKenneth Webb (artist)\nKenneth Webb (cricketer)\nKen Webb, English cyclist\nPassage 8:\nDummy Ache\nDummy Ache is a 1936 American short comedy film directed by Leslie Goodwins.

Hively had to come in and finish the picture after Goodwins was hospitalized for pneumonia. Maureen O'Hara plays an Argentinian who falls in love with a Texan (James Ellison), who is attempting to buy a racehorse from her father. It was one of a number of Hollywood films from the 1940s produced to reflect America's \"Good Neighbor policy\" towards Latin American countries. They Met in Argentina was not well received by audiences, critics, or the Argentine government.\n\nPlot\nTim Kelly (James Ellison) is a Texan in the oil business who travels to Argentina to bid for some land. When his bid is unsuccessful, he teams up with colleague Duke Ferrell (Buddy Ebsen) to buy their employer a successful racehorse, Lucero, in the hope that this will compensate for the failed bid. Tim falls in love with Lolita O'Shea (Maureen O'Hara), the daughter of the racehorse's owner, Don Enrique (Robert Barrat). Don Enrique is against selling Lucero, but when he realises his daughter is in love with Tim, he offers him the racehorse on the condition that he immediately returns to the USA. When Lolita realises Tim has left, she pursues him on horseback.\n\nCast\nMaureen O'Hara as Lolita O'Shea\nJames Ellison as Tim Kelly\nAlberto Vila as Alberto Delmonte\nBuddy Ebsen as Duke Ferrel\nRobert Barrat as Don Enrique de los Santos O'Shea\nJoseph Buloff as Santiago, O'Shea's Trainer\nDiosa Costello as Panchita\n\nBackground and production\nIn the early 1940s, Hollywood studios produced a number of films which reflected America's \"Good Neighbor policy\" towards Latin America; They Met in Argentina was one of RKO Pictures' contributions. With these films set in Latin American countries, the studios hoped to both attract an audience in Latin America and to increase popular interest in the region among a North American audience. Other films of this nature included the Twentieth-Century Fox productions Down Argentine Way (1940) and Blood and Sand (1941).They Met in Argentina was based on a story by Lou Brock, who was also the film's producer. Brock approached Rodgers and Hart to score the production. The pair wrote 12 songs in total, although only 7 of them were included in the final cut. The songs featured in the soundtrack are \"You've Got the Best of Me\", \"North America Meets South America\", \"Amarillo\", \"Lolita\", \"Cutting the Cane\", \"Never Go To Argentina\" and \"Simpatica\". The dance sequences were choreographed by Frank Veloz.When Goodwins was hospitalized for pneumonia during production, RKO brought in veteran director Jack Hively to replace him and finish the film.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film fared poorly in cinemas, and made a loss of $270,000.\n\nCritical\nThe film received negative reviews from critics, with Robert Dana in the New York Herald Tribune describing it as \"an American musical at its worst\". Film critic Leonard Maltin later described it as a \"dismal musical\". The Argentine government spoke out against the distribution of the film in Latin America.\nPassage 10:\nDeep South (film)\nDeep South is a 1937 American short film directed by Leslie Goodwins.

Filmed in 16 mm.\"\nHarvard University Library created The Helen Hill Collection, 1990-2006: Film Guide  (2011), which describes the non-narrative content of the film in this way: \"Animated cats hatch eggs; watermelons fall from the sky; chickens become angels and fly out of tombstones; coiled springs symbolize inner meanings and then the film ends.\"\nScratch and Crow has no dialogue, spoken narration, or human voices. Its soundtrack is a mix of subtle sound effects and animals sounds. A non-narrative film, it includes three poetic intertitles written in the first person (e.g., \"If I knew,/ I would assure you we are all / Finally good chickens / And will rise together, / A noisy flock of round, / Dusty angels.\")In 2009, the Librarian of Congress named Scratch and Crow to the National Film Registry, a designation reserved for American films deemed worthy of preservation for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. The Library's news release stated: \"Consistent with the short films she made from age 11 until her death at 36, this animated short work is filled with vivid color and a light sense of humor. It is also a poetic and spiritual homage to animals and the human soul.\"Colorlab preserved the film in 2007, contributing pro bono lab work for a consortium that included the Hill estate, Paul Gailiunas, Harvard Film Archive, the University of South Carolina, New York University, BB Optics, and the Orphan Film Project.

Riley Wallace of Exclaim! wrote, \"With exciting production that features his usual cast of ATL tastemakers who are (in some cases) paired with surprising co-producers like Jake One and !llmind, Future has crafted an opus full of bangers. So, while he doesn't break much new creative ground, there's a lot to love about Future.\" Jordan Sargent of Spin dubbed it \"a clear return to form\". Colin Groundwater for Pretty Much Amazing stated that \"Future is too persistent. In striving for consistency, he sacrifices discretion and intention. One wishes he would take a break—God knows he's earned it. Some time might allow for a stronger sense of intention.\"Writing for The Observer, Alex Macpherson concluded, \"...[and] as a body of work, this album is neither an elevation over nor an advancement of his stream of recent material. At this point, merely shoring up his personal brand with scattered highlights means that Future is stuck in a holding pattern.\" Chase McMullen, an author for The 405, said, \"In a genre that's hard on longevity, and an era with an even shorter attention span, Future has refused to lose, time and again. He certainly doesn't end here. Yet, after a year of baited breathing, we seem to have arrived at an in-between. There's still plenty of fun to be had in the waiting room, but let's hope he has more in store for the next appointment.\" Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork, noted the album for being \"...an ambitious Future exhibition\" with \"a pretty interesting array of textures, sonically.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nFuture debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 140,000 album-equivalent units, of which 60,000 were pure album sales.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 12 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".Dan Raper of PopMatters praised the album, stating, \"Shiny pieces of melody peek out from the lush pop textures the band’s created all through Who Killed Harry Houdini?. In fact, the album keeps up songwriting quality at a surprisingly consistent level, taking a collective breath before barrelling into a series of fine tunes to close. From “Ophelia”’s awkward keyboard switches to the expansive, syncopated refrain of “Little Ghost”, this section of the disc feels like a nostalgic, triumphant encore. It’s not the last one this band will have demanded of them.\"Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the album, stating, \"Houdini sounds like an attempt to escape from the predicament of the sophomore album, making more nuanced use of orchestration and sticking with a comfortingly sweet and naïve tone while also expanding its perspective. March-like first single \"Paper Planes\" has sunny guitars, whistling woodwinds, neighbors' sex, and \"The Cosby Show\", slyly invoking the way we pass unseen through the lives of strangers; free mp3 giveaway \"Music Killed Me\" adds a kiddie-psych spaceyness, using the choral vocal to full rhetorical advantage. \"Andy\" politely invites a guy—with the same name as one of my local bartenders!-- to join the band. But nothing here has the euphoric simplicity of \"We're From Barcelona\", or quite the infant-\"Calvin & Hobbes\" wisdom of \"Chicken Pox\" and \"Treehouse\".\"\n\nTrack listing\nPassage 9:\nMetamorphosis (Mercenary album)\nMetamorphosis is the sixth studio album by the Danish melodic death metal band Mercenary.

{"input": "Which genus expands to the Pacific Ocean islands, Osteomeles or Medinilla?", "context": "Passage 1:\nOsteomeles\nOsteomeles is a genus of plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are shrubs native to eastern Asia, with compound leaves, opposite leaf arrangement, and small pome fruit. The fruits of all species in this genus are edible.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus has sometimes been considered to include South American species of Hesperomeles which, like Osteomeles, have only one ovule per locule and hard pyrenes. But Hesperomeles notably have simple leaves, and recent molecular phylogenetics suggest that the two genera are only distantly related.\n\nSelected species\nOsteomeles anthyllidifolia (Sm.) Lindl.\nOsteomeles schwerinae C.K.Schneid. (China)\nOsteomeles subrotunda K.Koch (China and Ryukyu islands)\nPassage 2:\nMedinilla\nMedinilla is a genus of about 400 species of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae, native to tropical regions of the Old World from Africa (two species) east through Madagascar (about 70 species) and southern Asia to the western Pacific Ocean islands. The genus was named after J. de Medinilla, governor of the Mariana Islands in 1820.They are evergreen shrubs or lianas. The leaves are opposite or whorled, or alternate in some species. The flowers are white, pink, red, or orange, and are produced singly or in large panicles.\n\nSelected species\nThere are approximately 418 species in this genus, including:\n\nMedinilla acuminata Philippines\nMedinilla arboricola China\nMedinilla assamica India\nMedinilla astronioides Philippines\nMedinilla banahaensis Philippines\nMedinilla beamanii Borneo\nMedinilla brevipendunculata Philippines\nMedinilla clemetis Philippines\nMedinilla congesta Philippines\nMedinilla cordata Philippines\nMedinilla cummingii Philippines\nMedinilla curtisii\nMedinilla dolichophylla Philippines\nMedinilla erythrophylla China, Nepal, India\nMedinilla fengii China\nMedinilla formosana Taiwan\nMedinilla fuligineo-glandulifera China\nMedinilla hainanensis China\nMedinilla halconensis Philippines\nMedinilla hayataina Taiwan\nMedinilla himalayana India\nMedinilla involucrata Philippines\nMedinilla lanceata China\nMedinilla luchuenensis China\nMedinilla magnifica Philippines\nMedinilla malindangensis Philippines\nMedinilla merrillii Philippines\nMedinilla mindorensis Philippines\nMedinilla miniata Philippines\nMedinilla multiflora Philippines\nMedinilla mytiformis Philippines\nMedinilla nana China\nMedinilla petelotii China\nMedinilla pycnantha Quisumb. & Merr.

Partulids are distributed across 5,000 sq mi (13,000 km2) of Pacific Ocean islands, from the Society Islands to New Guinea.Once used as decorative items in Polynesian ceremonial wear and jewelry, these small snails (averaging about one-half to three-quarters of an inch in length) gained the attention of science when Dr. Henry Crampton (along with Yoshio Kondo) spent 50 years studying and cataloging partulids, detailing their remarkable array of morphological elements, ecological niches, and behavioral aspects that illustrate adaptive radiation.\n\nDecline\nThe partulids of the island of Tahiti act as an example of the possible deleterious effects of attempted biological control. After an infestation of the introduced giant African land snails (Achatina spp.), the carnivorous Florida rosy wolfsnail (Euglandina rosea) was introduced into Tahiti in an attempt to combat the African species.\nThe wolfsnail chose instead to hunt and eat members of the nearly 76 species of Partula that were endemic to Tahiti and the nearby islands, devouring all but 12 species in a decade. Several scientists recognized what was going on, and were able to save 12 species prior to their becoming extinct.\nToday, the Zoological Society of London runs the Partula Programme Consortium which maintains a captive-breeding programme in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.\nThe 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species contains 15 critically endangered, 11 extinct in the wild, and 48 extinct Partula species. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species version 2009.2 contains 13 critically endangered, 11 extinct in the wild and 51 extinct Partula species. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species version 2015-4 contains 83 Partula species.Individuals are being reintroduced to Tahiti from captive breeding programmes since 2014. In April 2023, over 5,000 individual snails from zoos in the United States and the United Kingdom were released on Tahiti and Mo'orea.\n\nSpecies\nSpecies within the genus Partula include:\n\nCladogram\nA cladogram showing the phylogenic relationships of the genus Partula:\n\nEcology\nPartula species on Tahiti were usually found on the undersides of the leaves of Caladium and plantain, although in some valleys, they were frequently found on Dracaena and turmeric.\nPassage 4:\nNovaculichthys taeniourus\nNovaculichthys taeniourus, also known as the rockmover wrasse, carpet wrasse,  dragon wrasse, bar-cheeked wrasse, olive-scribbled wrasse or reindeer wrasse, is a species of wrasse mainly found in coral reefs and lagoons in the Indo-Pacific region. These include habitats in the Gulf of California to Panama; tropical Pacific Ocean islands including Hawaii; the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia; and the Indian Ocean to the east coast of Africa. The common name, \"rockmover wrasse\", comes from their behavior of upending small stones and reef fragments in search of prey. This species is the only known member of its genus.\n\nEtymology\nThe genus \"Novaculichthys\", in Latin Novacula means razor, and ikhthús in Greek, means fish., while the specific name \"taeniourus\" from Greek tainía means ribbon, and oura means tail.\n\nDescription\nThe rockmover wrasse is a colorful fish, 27–30 cm (11–12 in) in length. It has an oblong, laterally compressed body and a wedge-shaped head. Its head is scaleless except for two scales on the upper part of the gill coverings and an almost vertical row of small scales behind each eye.\nJuveniles and adults have markedly different appearances. In juveniles, the first two dorsal fin spines are long and extended, drooping over the fish's forehead to form a \"cowlick\". As the fish matures, the elongated rays are lost. The adult fish has a dark greenish-brown body with an elongated white spot on each scale. Its head is gray-blue with brown lines radiated from the eyes. Two black spots occur in front of the dorsal fin and a wide vertical white bar is found on the base of the caudal fin. The posterior part of the caudal fin and the pelvic fins are black. Juveniles found in Hawaii are usually green and those in the western Pacific are burgundy to brownish. Both are spotted in white.The difference in appearance between juvenile and adult N. taeniourus is so striking, the common name \"rockmover wrasse\" is used for adults and \"dragon wrasse\" is used for juveniles.\n\nHabitat\nAdult fish live on shallow, semi-exposed reef flats and in lagoons and seaward reefs to depths of 14–25 m (46–82 ft). They prefer hard-bottomed grassy areas of mixed sand and rubble with exposure to a mild surge. Juveniles favor shallow areas on rubble among large patch reefs or protected open patches on reef crests.\n\nReproduction\nAlthough little is known about reproduction of these fish, like other wrasses, they probably are able to change sex and are pelagic spawners, broadcasting eggs and sperm into the water column.\n\nBehavior\nThese fish are highly territorial and pairs of adults often protect large areas of reef.The fish feed on benthic invertebrates including molluscs, crabs and polychaete worms.  One fish turns or shifts large pieces of debris or rubble, grabbing or pulling it with its mouth or pushing it with its snout. When the working member of the pair has revealed the prey, the other fish quickly grabs and eats it. Juveniles do not usually work in pairs, doing all the work themselves. Facing danger, these wrasses quickly dive into the sand for protection.\nJuveniles resemble algae and mimic the movements of detached, drifting seaweed by swaying back and forth in the currents.\n\nDistribution\nThey are widely distributed in tropical Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean reefs and lagoons.\nPassage 5:\nPacific Ocean theater of World War II\nThe Pacific Ocean theater of World War II was a major theater of the Pacific War, the war between the Allies and the Empire of Japan.  It was defined by the Allied powers' Pacific Ocean Area command, which included most of the Pacific Ocean and its islands, while mainland Asia was excluded, as were the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, Australia, most of the Territory of New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands.\nIt officially came into existence on March 30, 1942, when US Admiral Chester Nimitz was appointed Supreme Allied Commander Pacific Ocean Areas.  In the other major theater in the Pacific region, known as the South West Pacific theater, Allied forces were commanded by US General Douglas MacArthur. Both Nimitz and MacArthur were overseen by the US Joint Chiefs and the Western Allies Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCoS).\nMost Japanese forces in the theater were part of the Combined Fleet (連合艦隊, Rengō Kantai) of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which was responsible for all Japanese warships, naval aircraft, and marine infantry units. The Rengō Kantai was led by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, until he was killed in an attack by U.S. fighter planes in April 1943.  Yamamoto was succeeded by Admiral Mineichi Koga (1943–44) and Admiral Soemu Toyoda (1944–45).  The General Staff  (参謀本部, Sanbō Honbu) of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) was responsible for Imperial Japanese Army ground and air units in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.  The IJN and IJA did not formally use joint/combined staff at the operational level, and their command structures/geographical areas of operations overlapped with each other and those of the Allies.\nIn the Pacific Ocean theater, Japanese forces fought primarily against the United States Navy, the U.S. Army, which had 6 Corps and 21 Divisions, and the U.S. Marine Corps, which had only 6 Divisions.  The United Kingdom (British Pacific Fleet), New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and other Allied nations, also contributed forces.\n\nMajor campaigns and battles\nPacific Theater\nAttack on Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941\nBattle of Wake Island 7–23 December 1941\nPhilippines campaign  8 December 1941 – 8 May 1942\nBattle of Bataan\nBattle of Corregidor\nBattle of Ambon\nBattle of Timor\nBattle of Rabaul\nBattle of the Java Sea\nBombing of Darwin\nBattle of the Coral Sea 4–8 May 1942\nDoolittle Raid 18 April 1942\nBattle of Midway 4–7 June 1942\nGuadalcanal campaign 7 August 1942 to 9 February 1943\nBattle of Savo Island\nBattle of Cape Esperance\nSecond Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\nBattle of Tassafaronga\nNew Guinea campaign\nSolomon Islands Campaign\nBattle of the Bismark Sea\nGilbert and Marshall Islands campaign 1943–44\nMakin Island raid 17–18 August 1942\nBattle of Tarawa 20 November 1943\nBattle of Makin 20–23 November 1943\nBattle of Kwajalein 14 February 1944\nBattle of Eniwetok 17 February 1944\nAttack on Truk Island 17–18 February 1944\nMariana and Palau Islands campaign 1944\nBattle of Saipan 15 June 1944\nBattle of the Philippine Sea 19–21 June 1944\nBattle of Guam 21 July 1944\nBattle of Tinian 24 July 1944\nBattle of Peleliu 15 September 1944\nBattle of Angaur 17 September 1944\nBattle of Leyte 17 October 1944\nBattle of Luzon 9 January 1945\nBattle of Iwo Jima 19 February 1945\nBattle of Okinawa 1 April 1945\nNorth Pacific Theater\nAleutian Islands Campaign 1942–43\nBattle of the Komandorski Islands 26 March 1943\nPassage 6:\nCodiaeum variegatum\nCodiaeum variegatum (fire croton, garden croton, or variegated croton; syn. Croton variegatum L.) is a species of plant in the genus Codiaeum, which is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It is native to Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and the western Pacific Ocean islands, growing in open forests and scrub.The garden crotons should not be confused with Croton, a cosmopolitan genus also in the Euphorbiaceae, containing more than 700 species of herbs, shrubs and trees.\n\nDescription\nIt is a tropical, evergreen, monoecious shrub growing to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall and has large, thick, leathery, shiny evergreen leaves, alternately arranged, 5–30 cm (2.0–11.8 in) long and 0.5–8 cm (0.20–3.15 in) broad. The leaf blades can, for example, be ruler-lanceolate, oblong, elliptic, lanceolate, ovate inverted, ovate spatulate, or violin-shaped and coloured green, yellow, or purple in various patterns, depending on the variety. The petiole has a length of 0.2 to 2.5 cm. The inflorescences are long racemes, 8–30 cm (3.1–11.8 in) long, with male and female flowers on separate inflorescences; the male flowers are white with five small petals and 20–30 stamens, pollens are oval approximately 52x32 microns in size. The female flowers are yellowish, with no petals. The flowering period is usually in early autumn. The fruit is a capsule 9 mm (0.35 in) in diameter, containing three seeds that are  6 mm (0.24 in) in diameter. When cut, stems bleed a milky sap like many of the Euphorbiaceae.\n\nCultivation\nIn tropical climates, crotons make attractive hedges and potted patio specimens, valued for their striking foliage. They only survive outdoors where temperatures do not normally drop below 10 to 13 °C (50 to 55 °F) in winter; colder temperatures can cause leaf loss. In colder climates, the plants are grown in greenhouses or as house plants. The cultivated garden crotons are usually smaller than the wild plant, rarely over 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall, and come in a wide diversity of leaf shapes and colours. They are sometimes grouped under the name Codiaeum variegatum var. pictum (Lodd.) Müll. Arg., though this is not botanically distinct from the species and usually treated as a synonym of it.\n\nCultivars\nThe several hundred cultivars are selected and bred for their foliage. Depending on the cultivar, the leaves may be ovate to linear, entire to deeply lobed or crinkled, and variegated with green, white, purple, orange, yellow, red, or pink. The colour patterns may follow the veins or the margins, or be in blotches on the leaf. Popular cultivars include 'Spirale', which has spirally twisted red and green leaves; 'Andreanum', which has broadly oval yellow leaves with gold veins and margins; 'Majesticum', which has pendulous branches, with linear leaves up to 25 cm (9.8 in) long with midrib veins yellow maturing to red; and 'Aureo-maculatum', which has leaves spotted with yellow.\n\nToxicity\nAs with many of the Euphorbiaceae, the sap can cause contact dermatitis in some people. The bark, roots, latex, and leaves are poisonous. The toxin is the chemical compound 5-desoxyingenol.  The plant contains an oil which is violently purgative and is suspected of being a carcinogen.  Consumption of the seeds can be fatal to children.\n\nGallery\nPassage 7:\nGouania\nGouania is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. The 50 to 70 species it contains are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including Africa, Madagascar, the Indian Ocean islands, southern Asia, the Americas and Hawaii. They are shrubs or lianas.  A revision of the species in Madagascar and the other western Indian Ocean islands is in preparation, where the genus has an important centre of diversity. The work will recognise several new species.\n\nSelected species\nGouania corylifolia Raddi (Brazil)\nGouania hillebrandii Oliv. ex Hillebr. (Hawaii)\nGouania leptostachya DC.

Species are native to Asia, Africa (including Madagascar), and the Pacific Ocean islands (Hawaii). It is very closely related to the genus Polystichum, with 2016 research suggesting it should be included in a clade sister to Polystichum s.s.\n\nSpecies\nAs of February 2020, the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species:\nPassage 9:\nAnatahan\nAnatahan is an island in the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and has one of the most active volcanoes of the archipelago. Although formerly inhabited, the island is currently uninhabited due to the constant danger of volcanic eruptions. Anatahan is located 60 kilometers (32 nmi) northwest of Farallon de Medinilla and 120 km (65 nmi) north of Saipan.\n\nHistory\nThe island was first charted by Europeans in late October 1543 by Spanish explorer Bernardo de la Torre on board of the carrack San Juan de Letrán when trying to return from Sarangani to New Spain. At the time, the island was settled by the Chamorros. In 1695, the natives were forcibly removed to Saipan and, three years later, to Guam. Under Spanish rule, coconut plantations were developed for the production of copra. In 1884, an estimated 125 tons were exported.\nFollowing the sale of the Northern Marianas by Spain to the German Empire in 1899, Anatahan was administered as part of German New Guinea. However, by May 1901 the island was reported as uninhabited. In 1902, the island was leased to a private firm, the Pagan Society, owned by a German and a Japanese partner, to further develop the coconut plantations. Severe typhoons in September 1905 and September 1907 destroyed the plantations and bankrupted the company, although copra production continued on a smaller scale afterwards.During World War I, Anatahan came under the control of the Empire of Japan and was subsequently administered as part of the South Seas Mandate. In June 1944, 30 survivors of at least three Japanese shipwrecks reached Anatahan. After the surrender of Japan in World War II, the Americans evacuated two Japanese and 45 natives from the island, but the Japanese castaways refused to believe that the war had ended, and fled into the interior of the island as Japanese holdouts. By 1950, the holdouts were led by Kazuko Higa, who was the only woman left on the island. Higa lived with a harem of five men, but after eleven of the holdouts died under uncertain circumstances, the remainder surrendered in June 1951.  The story of the holdouts was sensationalized as a lurid tale of sex and violent death by the mass media, and was portrayed in 1953 by Josef von Sternberg in his film The Saga of Anatahan. In 1954, one of the survivors, Michiro Maruyama, published a book, Anatahan Island of the Unfortunates, which attempted to refute the more lurid accusations. The story was revived in 1998 by Japanese author Kaoru Ohno as the novel Cage on the Sea, and in 2008 by Natsuo Kirino as the short story \"Tokyo-jima\", which became a film in 2010.Following World War II, the island came under the control of the United States and was administered as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Since 1978, the island has been part of the Northern Islands Municipality of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nGeography\nAnatahan is roughly elliptical in shape, with a length of 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) and a width of 4 km (2.5 mi) and an area of 33.9 km2 (13.1 sq mi).  The island is the summit of stratovolcano which reaches an altitude of 790 m (2,592 ft) above sea level at its highest peak.The volcano is topped by a caldera, 2.3 km (1.4 mi) wide, which is divided into an eastern and western portion, with the eastern portion around 250 m (820 ft) lower than the western. Sparseness of vegetation in the most recent lava flows on Anatahan indicated that they were of Holocene age. In April 1990, the inhabitants of the western coast of the island were evacuated after earthquake swarms and active fumaroles indicated that an eruption might be imminent, but no eruption occurred at that time. A further earthquake swarm occurred in May 1992. The first historical eruption of Anatahan occurred in May 2003, when a large explosive eruption with a VEI of 4 took place forming a new crater inside the eastern caldera and causing an ash plume 12 km (7.5 mi) high which impaired air traffic to Saipan and Guam.The most recent eruption was in 2007, and lasted until 2008.\n\nDemographics\nAs of 1980 the population of Anatahan was one family. The people resided on Anatahan when school was not in session.\n\nSee also\nList of stratovolcanoes\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nPterocarpus indicus\nPterocarpus indicus (commonly known as Amboyna wood, Malay padauk, Papua New Guinea rosewood, Philippine mahogany, Andaman redwood, Burmese rosewood, narra and asana in the Philippines, angsana, or Pashu padauk) is a species of Pterocarpus native to southeastern Asia, northern Australasia, and the western Pacific Ocean islands, in Cambodia, southernmost China, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.Pterocarpus indicus was one of two species (the other being Eysenhardtia polystachya) used as a source for the 16th- to 18th-century traditional diuretic known as lignum nephriticum.Many populations of Pterocarpus indicus are seriously threatened. It is extinct in Vietnam and possibly in Sri Lanka and Peninsular Malaysia. It was declared the national tree of the Philippines in 1934 by Governor-General Frank Murphy of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands through Proclamation No. 652.\n\nDescription\nIt is a large deciduous tree growing to 30–40 m tall, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter. The leaves are 12–22 cm long, pinnate, with 5–11 leaflets, the girth is 12–34 m wide. The flowers are produced in panicles 6–13 cm long containing a few to numerous flowers; flowering is from February to May in the Philippines, Borneo and the Malay peninsula. They are slightly fragrant and have yellow or orange-yellow petals. The fruit is a semiorbicular pod 2–3 cm diameter, surrounded by a flat 4–6 cm diameter membranaceous wing (wing-like structure) which aids dispersal by the wind. It contains one or two seeds, and does not split open at maturity; it ripens within 4–6 years, and becomes purple when dry. The central part of the pod can be smooth (f. indica), bristly (f. echinatus (Pers.) Rojo) or intermediate.Most Pterocarpus species prefer seasonal weather but P. indicus prefer rainforests.\nNote: Pterocarpus macrocarpus, a similar species native to Burma, is referred to as \"Rosewood\" throughout South East Asia. P. macrocarpus is usually harder than P. indicus. When in burl form both are referred to as Amboyna Burl.\n\nUses\nThe hardwood, which is purplish, is termite-resistant and rose-scented. The wood known in Indonesia as amboyna is the burl of the tree, named after Ambon, where much of this material was originally found. Often amboyna is finely sliced to produce an extremely decorative veneer, used for decoration and in making of furniture and keys on a marimba.\nIt is a premium timber species suitable for high grade furniture, lumber and plywood for light construction purposes. It is also used for cartwheels, wood carving and musical instruments.The flower is used as a honey source while leaf infusions are used as shampoos. Both flowers and leaves were said to be eaten. The leaves are supposedly good for waxing and polishing brass and copper. It is also a source of kino or resin.The leaves of narra are also used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of health problems. Narra leaves contain flavonoids. Flavonoids are antioxidants that provide health benefits to humans, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic benefits. Flavonoids in narra leaves may be capable of preventing damage to your kidneys.In folk medicine, it is used to combat tumors. This property might be due to an acidic polypeptide found in its leaves that inhibited growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells by disruption of cell and nuclear membranes. It was also one of the sources of lignum nephriticum, a diuretic in Europe during the 16th to 18th centuries. Its reputation is due to its wood infusions, which are fluorescent.The tree is recommended as an ornamental tree for avenues and is sometimes planted in Puerto Rico as a shade and ornament. The tall, dome-shaped crown, with long, drooping branches is very attractive and the flowers are spectacular in areas with a dry season. It is very easily propagated from seed or large stem cuttings, but suffers from disease problems. It is widely planted as a roadside, park, and parking lot tree.\nIn agroforestry, it maintains ecosystem fertility and soil stability. Narra is a leguminous plant that is capable of fixing nitrogen by forming endosymbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that lives in its root nodules. Leguminous plants, such as narra, are responsible for transforming nitrogen into a usable form.\nIn the Philippines, a permit is required to cut the narra (cf. Tagalog and Cebuano nára, Maranao nara), but nevertheless the popular sturdy wood is widely used for construction and furniture projects.In Singapore, the ease to propagate the tree made it a favourite for the urban planners in Singapore to plant new trees via monoculture in a campaign to transform the rapidly urbaning city into a green city in between 1969 and 1982. In the 1985, the 1,400 trees was killed and cut down in an \"Angsana Wilt Disease\". It was found that the fusarium oxysporum fungi species was the cause of the disease. The fungus was carried by ambrosia beetles boring into the trees. The infection was eventually controlled by a combination of monitoring, removal of lightning-damaged trees, and replanting with identified disease-resistant varieties.\n\nSymbolism\nIt is the national tree of the Philippines, as well as the provincial tree of Chonburi and Phuket in Thailand.", "answers": ["Medinilla"], "length": 4208, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "612b22ddfee72f7d30dcbdc9882a7ac1c3e87abe0279877d"}

Unlike the Welsh Cup, where 135 teams entered in 2008–09, the competition is only open to the members of the Cymru Premier, the Cymru North, Cymru South and a very select few other clubs. It should not be confused with the Welsh Football League Cup, which was for the clubs in the Welsh Football League, which despite its name only covered the south and centre of Wales up until it was disbanded at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nFormat\nSince the inaugural season in 1992/93 the format of the competition has changed many times. The 2006/07 season saw the introduction of a new format for the competition. Beginning in August, the eighteen premier league teams are split into six regionalised groups of three teams. The six group winners and two runners-up enter a quarter-final knock-out phase, followed by a two legged semi-final match before ending with the final in April.\nThe current format, introduced in 2014/15, saw a radical shake up for the competition. The 12 Cymru Premier teams are joined by six teams each from the two feeder leagues, and also four wildcard entrants. 24 teams enter Round 1, with the previous season's four semi-finalists receiving a bye through to Round 2. The draw for each round is regionalized as per competition rules, with teams being divided between northern and southern sections. The format changed slightly for the 2018/19 season, with each round up to the semi-finals being regionalized, and the semis an open draw. The semi-finals will also take place over a weekend for the first time.\nFrom 2019-20 the format was expanded significantly with all 44 teams from the top two tiers of the Welsh football league system taking part as well as two wildcard entries. Twenty-eight clubs will enter in Round 1, which will be made up of any club without floodlights; the two wildcard entries; and the remaining teams ranked lowest in their respective Tier 2 league from the previous season. Round 1 will be regionalised, as will all rounds up to the Semi-Final stage. The fourteen winners will join the eighteen remaining sides in Round 2. This will be seeded so that Premier League sides are not drawn against one another. The winner of the tournament gained entry to the Scottish Challenge Cup.\n\nHistory\nThe first Welsh League Cup was won by Afan Lido in 1992/93, who beat Caersws FC 4–3 on penalties, after drawing in the final 1–1.The New Saints hold the record for the most League Cup titles; they have won the competition six times. Bangor City hold the distinction of making the most number of appearances in the final and losing on every occasion (6).\nThe cup is currently held by Connah's Quay Nomads, who defeated Cardiff Met 10-9 on penalties after a 0-0 draw.\nThe New Saints dominated the competition between 2015 and 2018, winning all four finals during that period. Saints have won nine of the ten finals they have appeared in. They have however not made the final since beating Cardiff Met in 2018. \nThe 2018–19 final between Cardiff Met and Cambrian & Clydach Vale holds the record attendance in the competition, with 1,503 fans witnessing Met's first major trophy win.\n\nSponsorship\nSince 2003, the League Cup has been named after its sponsor, giving it the following name:\n\nLoosemores League Cup (2003 to 2012), sponsored by Loosemores Solicitors (Cardiff)\nThe Word Cup (2012 to 2016), sponsored by theWord, a Cardiff-based telecommunications provider.\nNathaniel MG Cup (2016 to present), sponsored by Nathaniel MG Cars, a car sales company based in Bridgend and Cardiff.\n\nPrize money\nThe total prize fund for the competition is £15,000.

The final was played at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli on 1 May 2010 and marked the second time the final has been staged at the stadium. The match was contested by Port Talbot Town, who beat Bala Town 1–0 in their semi-final, and Bangor City who beat Prestatyn Town 2–0 in their semi-final.\nWelsh Premier League side Port Talbot Town were contesting a Welsh Cup final for the first time in their history. While it is Bangor City's 14th appearance in the final, who were looking to make history as the first North Wales club to win three consecutive Welsh Cups in 100 years.\n\nBackground\nPort Talbot Town began the match having just finished 3rd in the Welsh Premier League to gain a spot in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League First qualifying round and Bangor City finished 5th, narrowly missed out on the European spot, both had finished the league two points apart. The two teams had met each other twice that season with one game won by Port Talbot Town 2–1 and the other ending one all.Bangor City went into the match as 7-time winners of the competition, they were the defending champions having won in 2009 and where looking to make a hat-trick of victories having also won the cup in 2008. Port Talbot Town appear in their first Welsh Cup final.\n\nRoute to the final\nBangor City\nBangor City started their defence of the Welsh Cup at home to fellow Welsh Premier League side Elements Cefn Druids. Elements Cefn Druids took the lead through a 19th-minute goal provided by John Rush, son of former Welsh International Ian Rush. The visitors took the lead to half time, leaving Bangor City only 45 minutes away from losing their first game in the Welsh Cup since October 2006. The Citizens took to the field seven minutes early ready for second half and attacked from the off, Bangor found their feet early when Chris Sharp found the net, only for it to be disallowed for offside, but it was not until the 61st minute that they equalised when Jamie Reed headed one in from Marc Limbert cross. Bangor took the lead 16 minutes later when James Brewerton accepted a throw-in to slot one home. On the 81st minute the Citizens sealed their Third round spot with a header from Chris Sharp, only for Reed to get another three minutes before time.\nAt the end of October Bangor travelled to Cae-y-Castell, home of Cymru Alliance outfit Flint Town United.\nOn 30 January, Farrar Road would welcome Welsh Football League Division One club Aberaman Athletic. Despite dominating the play for most of the first half it was the visitors who would take the lead, when after 18 minutes John Phillips got the ball past Paul Smith. City rallied and came through 3–1 thanks to goals from Jamie Reed, Craig Garside and a 93rd-minute penalty from Reed.\nIn the last eight, played on 27 February, Bangor hosted Llanelli. An early Jamie Reed penalty settled nerves before David Morley settled things with a 90th minute piledriver.\nCity brushed aside Prestatyn town in the semi-final at Latham Park, Newtown. Mark Smyth and Craig Garside did the business for the Blues, who were denied further goals by the outstanding form of rotund Prestatyn goalkeeper, John-Hill Dunt.\n\nPort Talbot Town\nPre-match\nOfficials\nSwansea-based referee Dean John was named as the referee for the 2010 Welsh Cup Final on 15 April 2010.

The team compete in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. The club's usual home colours are amber shirts and black shorts.Formed in 1912, the club began life in the Southern League before being invited to become founder members of the Football League Third Division in 1920. They failed re-election in 1931, but were elected back into the Football League the next year. They struggled for the next few seasons, but went on to be crowned Third Division South champions in 1938–39. World War II meant they had to wait until the 1946–47 season to take their place in the Second Division, though they were relegated at the end of the campaign. They were relegated out of the Third Division in 1962. In the 1979–80 season, under manager Len Ashurst, they secured promotion out of the Fourth Division and won the Welsh Cup for the first time. They reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup the next year. In the 1980s they suffered financial difficulties with a double relegation costing them their Football League place in 1988 and the club went out of business in February 1989.\nThe club reformed but were initially unable to play at their home ground at Somerton Park, so picked up the nickname of the \"Exiles\". They immediately won the Hellenic League in 1989–90 and were promoted out of the Southern League Midland Division in 1994–95. While playing at Newport Stadium, they were relegated from the Premier Division in 1997, before winning promotion out of the Midland Division again in 1998–99. Placed in the Conference South in 2004, they went on to be crowned champions in 2009–10 and after moving to Rodney Parade in 2012, they returned to the Football League following a 25-year absence after winning the Conference National play-off final in 2013 under manager Justin Edinburgh.\n\nHistory\n1912–1988\nRise through the league\nNewport County, originally nicknamed The Ironsides due to Newport being home to Lysaght's Orb Works steel works, started out in the Southern League in 1912 at Somerton Park. The official name of the club was The Newport & Monmouthshire County Association Football Club, although the shorter Newport County was soon adopted. The club were reformed in 1919 and were first elected to the Football League in 1920. They were not re-elected after the 1930–31 season but rejoined for 1932–33. After almost 20 years in the Third Division South, the club finally clinched promotion to the Second Division as champions in 1939 under manager Billy McCandless.\n\nSecond Division\nHopes were high that the championship-winning side could prosper in the Second Division, but only three games were played of the 1939–40 season due to the outbreak of World War II. Newport County managed a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur and a 3–1 win over Southampton, finishing joint ninth out of 22 in the abandoned season. The War League operated for the remainder of the 1939–40 season and County finished 10th in the South-West Division.\nAfter the war, the club reformed and competed in the temporary Football League South for the 1945–46 season. On the resumption of national league football for the 1946–47 season Newport resumed their place in the Second Division but the reshaped team suffered a host of defeats – including a joint Football League record 13–0 defeat at Newcastle United. Newcastle player Len Shackleton remarked \"they were lucky to get nil\". Despite victories over Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham, the club needed four wins out of the last four games to have any hope of safety. Despite a revenge victory over Newcastle United, defeats to Birmingham City, Luton Town and Manchester City sealed their fate. County finished bottom of the Second Division and were relegated.\n\nThird Division\nNewport reached the fifth round of the 1948–49 FA Cup under manager Tom Bromilow, the furthest they have gone in the competition, later equalled in 2019. They only narrowly lost the game 3–2 away to Portsmouth, the eventual FA Cup semi-finalists and First Division champions that season.After 11 further seasons in the Third Division South, the club narrowly avoided another effective relegation with the creation of the Fourth Division for the 1958–59 season. The bottom 12 teams from the Third Division North and South were placed in the new division, with the remainder forming the revived Third Division. County avoided this fate by a mere four points. However, in 1962, with only seven wins all season, the club were relegated to the Fourth Division – their home for the next 18 years.\n\nFourth Division\nBilly Lucas had the first of three spells as Newport County manager from 1953 to 1961. County reached the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup losing 2–0 to Arsenal in front of 20,000 spectators at Somerton Park. In the 1958–59 FA Cup County faced Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round. The game was played in heavy snow away at White Hart Lane, and although County lost 4–1 their goal came from an incredible 35-yard effort by defender Ken Hollyman. This made the score-line 1–2, giving County the hope that they could force an upset upon Bill Nicholson's men (who were double winners a year later). However, two late goals for Tottenham ended County's hopes of pulling off a shock result. County faced Tottenham again in the 1959–60 FA Cup third round at Somerton Park in front of a cup record 24,000 crowd, this time losing 4–0.\nIn January 1964 under Billy Lucas in his second spell as manager, County took on another high-profile side – Burnley, the 1960 Division One champions and 1962 double runners-up – in the FA Cup fourth round, but again suffered defeat 2–1.\nIn the 1970–71 season the Newport team managed by Bobby Ferguson set an unwanted Football League record by not winning any of their first 25 matches, losing 21 in the process. In the same season Newport equalled the worst defeat of a Football League club by a non-league club when they lost 6–1 to Barnet in the FA Cup first round. Results improved in the following season under Billy Lucas in his third spell as manager and in the 1972–73 season Newport missed out on promotion only on goal average.\nFor the 1976–77 season the team managed by Jimmy Scoular changed their playing strip to light blue and white striped shirts, light blue shorts and white socks akin to the Argentina national team in an attempt to turn around their fortunes. However, the team continued to struggle until Colin Addison took over in January 1977. The season became known as \"the great escape\" as County avoided relegation with a 1–0 win at home to Workington in the last game of the season.\n\nPromotion, cup 'glory' and European run\nThe 1980s heralded both the brightest and darkest moments in Newport County's history. Len Ashurst was manager from 1978 to 1982, the club's most successful period in its history and under the chairmanship of Richard Ford. In the 1978–79 FA Cup County beat West Ham United 2–1 in round three before losing 1–0 to Colchester United in a fourth round replay. In 1980, promotion was finally achieved from the Football League Fourth Division, the club being only five points from being crowned champions although never being in contention to win the league and never being top. County sealed promotion in the last match of the season with a 4–2 win at high-flying Walsall. Walsall finished second in the league and were also promoted.\nThe team included a young John Aldridge who later became one of the most prolific goal-scorers in English football history, most famous for helping Liverpool win the First Division title in 1988 and FA Cup in 1989, as well as helping Oxford United win two successive promotions and the Football League Cup.\nAlso in the promotion-winning team was Tommy Tynan, one of the leading lower-league strikers of his era, who scored the all-important goal that sealed County's promotion. Dave Gwyther completed the trio of prolific goalscorers whilst captain Keith Oakes provided strength in central defence. Youth team products Steve Lowndes and Nigel Vaughan went on to attain international caps for Wales. This was also the year that County won the Welsh Cup, entitling them to play in the 1980–81 season European Cup Winners' Cup.\nThe 1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup turned out to be quite eventful – the first round against Crusaders of Northern Ireland was won 4–0 on aggregate (4–0 at home and 0–0 away). The second round against SK Haugar of Norway was even more convincing: after a 0–0 draw away, the home leg was won 6–0, taking the club into the quarter-finals against Carl Zeiss Jena F.C. of East Germany. Aldridge was injured for both matches against Carl Zeiss Jena, though he was a non-playing substitute in the 2nd leg. The quarter-final away leg was drawn 2–2 with Tommy Tynan scoring both goals, including his equaliser in the 90th minute. However, despite dominating the home leg, Newport lost 1–0 in front of 18,000 fans at Somerton Park, denying them a high-profile semi-final with S.L. Benfica. Carl Zeiss Jena went on to be the eventual cup runners-up, losing the final to Dinamo Tbilisi of the Soviet Union.The Newport County squad for the first leg was: 1 Gary Plumley, 2 Richard Walden, 3 John Relish, 4 Grant Davies, 5 Keith Oakes (Captain), 6 Tommy Tynan, 7 Nigel Vaughan, 8 Steve Lowndes, 9 Dave Gwyther, 10 Karl Elsey, 11 Kevin Moore, 12 Neil Bailey, 13 Steve Warriner, 14 Dave Bruton, 15 Bobby Ward, 16 Mark Kendall.\nIn the 1982–83 season Colin Addison, in his second spell as manager, led Newport County to their highest post-war league finish – 4th in the Third Division, just four points behind third-placed Huddersfield Town. Huddersfield were promoted to the Second Division, along with champions Portsmouth and local rivals Cardiff City. County had actually gone top of the table in early April after a 1–0 win over Cardiff in front of 16,052 fans at Somerton Park, but a return of only four points from the last seven games meant County missed out on promotion. County faced First-Division team Everton in the third round of the 1982–83 FA Cup. After a 1–1 draw at Newport, Everton won the replay 2–1.\nIn 1986 County reached the FA Cup third round under manager Bobby Smith, losing 2–0 to Sunderland. Newport appeared in the Welsh Cup final again in 1987 under manager John Lewis, this time losing 1–0 to Merthyr Tydfil after a replay.\n\nFreefall and bankruptcy\nDespite reaching the Welsh Cup final, County were relegated from the Third Division in 1987 and in 1988 finished bottom of the Fourth Division with a mere 25 points, meaning that their 60-season stay in the Football League was over. They failed to finish their first season in the Conference and finally went out of business on 27 February 1989 with debts of £330,000. They were then expelled from the Conference for failing to fulfil their fixtures. Their record (four wins, seven draws and 19 points from 29 games) was expunged.\nThe BBC Wales current affairs programme Week in Week Out broadcast a documentary in 1989 about the winding up of Newport County and its controversial owner at the time, American Jerry Sherman.\n\n1989 onwards\nReformation and exile\nIn June 1989 the club was reformed by 400 supporters, including David Hando as chairman and, later, club president. Former manager John Relish was re-appointed team manager and they were elected to the Hellenic League (then four divisions below the Football League). The club's main aim was to regain the Football League status lost in 1988. The club took on the name \"Newport A.F.C.\" and adopted the nickname The Exiles, as a result of having to play home matches for the 1989–90 season at the London Road ground in the north Gloucestershire town of Moreton-in-Marsh, 80 miles (130 km) north-east of Newport. Newport Council considered the new company to be a continuation of the old, and refused it permission to use Somerton Park on the grounds of unpaid rent.\nNewport won the Hellenic double, gaining promotion to the Southern League. After the 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons back home in Newport at Somerton Park, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) consigned them to a further two seasons of exile in England, ground-sharing at Gloucester City's Meadow Park stadium for 1992–93 and 1993–94. The club was forced to resort to legal action to protect themselves from being forced out of the English football league system by FAW secretary Alun Evans, who was promoting the first national League of Wales formed for the 1992–93 season. That litigation proved successful, with a landmark High Court verdict enabling them to have a permanent home in Newport at the then newly built Newport Stadium.\nThe club's first season back in Newport, in 1994–95 under manager Graham Rogers, saw them promoted to the Southern League Premier Division, after winning the Midland Division Championship by a 14-point margin. On the way to that championship, the club set a then record for the Southern League by winning 14 successive league matches.\n\nFurther progress\nIn 1999, the club reintroduced the name Newport County A.F.C.In the 2001–02 season the team managed by Tim Harris reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time since the club was reformed, drawing Second Division side Blackpool.  Holding them to a 2–2 draw away, County lost the home replay 4–1 after extra time. The following season, then managed by Peter Nicholas, Newport reached the final of the FAW Premier Cup beating Swansea City and Cardiff City along the way before losing 6–1 in the final against Wrexham.\n\nConference South\nSubsequent reorganisation of the upper divisions of non-league football saw County take their place in the 2004–05 inaugural season of Conference South, one of the two feeder divisions into the Football Conference.

When Wanda Holloway was a teen, her father forbade her from trying out for her school's cheerleading team. Many years later, when Wanda had a daughter of her own, she was determined that her daughter would fulfill the dream she was denied and become a cheerleader—which would allow Wanda to make up that part of her childhood by reliving it through her daughter. \nWanda enrolls her daughter, Shanna, in various dance and gymnastics classes in order to enhance her prospects of becoming a cheerleader. She forces Shanna to practice for hours on end, despite sickness or injury. Wanda's best friend, Verna Heath, and her daughter, Amber, live next door to the Holloway family. Amber is the same age as Shanna and the two teenagers become friends. Verna had been a successful varsity twirler when she was young and holds the same ambition as Wanda for her own daughter.\nLeading up to the cheerleading tryouts, jealousy sparks between Wanda and Verna, despite the fact that their daughters' friendship remains solid. In the months prior to the tryouts, Wanda forces Shanna to concentrate completely on cheer-leading. At the tryouts, Amber impresses the judges but Shanna is unable to, despite all of her training. Amber makes the squad and Shanna does not, disappointing both Shanna and Wanda. The fact that Shanna did not make it onto the team causes Wanda to end the friendship between Shanna and Amber. Wanda does not give up on seeing her daughter become a cheerleader, and decides to try again next year.\nEvery day until next year's tryouts, Shanna practices frequently at her mother's command. When the time arrives, Amber makes the team and is even promoted to co-captain, but Shanna is disqualified because of her mother's attempts to bribe the judges and other students. The shock of her daughter's failure for the second time puts Wanda into a mad fit of rage, anger and jealousy. Wanda decides that if it wasn't for Amber, Shanna would have definitely been a cheerleader. She becomes obsessed with the notion that living next door to talented Amber had sapped Shanna's confidence and ruined her chances of success.\nWanda meets her brother-in-law Terry to take a hit out on Amber and Verna. Terry is horrified by Wanda's hate for a thirteen-year-old girl, and disagrees with the murder of a young vibrant girl—especially over something as petty as cheerleading. After the rendezvous, Terry decides to turn Wanda in to the police. He meets Wanda again, this time with a tape recorder in order to obtain proof of Wanda's desire to commit homicide. Terry sends the recorded message, along with background information, to the police. Wanda is arrested and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, but is set free when it is discovered that a member of the jury at her trial was on probation. Wanda serves only six months for the attempted murder of Amber.\nIn the end, Shanna decides it would be best to quit trying out for the cheerleading team. Presently, Shanna and Wanda reside in California, where Shanna is taking classes in modelling, singing and acting. Wanda hopes that one day, her daughter will be a famous Hollywood actress, no matter what it takes.\n\nCast\nReception\nReception for the film was positive. Entertainment Weekly praising the film stating \"the movie gets its real kick when it comes time for everyone to sell their rights to Hollywood... with one writer remarking she has 'Holly Hunter' in mind for the lead.\" However, People magazine's review stated that the movie \"has two good performances\" but that it \"just doesn't seem to have much point.\" Roger Ebert recommended the film as Video of the Week on At the Movies.Television critic Matt Zoller Seitz in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled TV (The Book) named the film as the 2nd greatest American TV-movie of all time, behind Steven Spielberg's Duel. He stated that \"this is a serio-comic (emphasis on serio-) account of a real and bizarre crime, but also a satire on media ethics and the entertainment industry's insatiable tendency to turn real people's pain into entertainment.... The film is self aware from start to finish ... yet it never loses track of the pathetic and tragic aspects of the story, and it never condescends to its small-town characters\".\n\nAccolades\nHolly Hunter won the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a TV Movie for playing Wanda Holloway and Beau Bridges won both the Emmy and the Golden Globe Awards for Supporting Actor in a TV Movie for his portrayal of Terry Harper, Holloway's brother-in-law whom she contacted to arrange the hit.\nPassage 5:\nFurther Adventures Of\nFurther Adventures of is the eighth studio album by Canadian singer/songwriter Bruce Cockburn. The album was released in 1978 by True North Records. The title of the album is not \"Further Adventures of Bruce Cockburn\" and the original album cover the title is simply \"Further Adventures of\".  The album cover displays a picture of a small globe of the Earth after the title, implying that the adventures referred to are those of the planet Earth, not of Cockburn.\nIn 1996, alternative rock group Primitive Radio Gods had a hit with the song \"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\", but that song is different from the song with nearly the same name on this album.\n\nReception\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Brett Hartenbach wrote, \"though it may contain Bruce Cockburn's usual mix of beautifully intricate acoustic work and pastoral mysticism, along with the occasional touches of anger and irony, continues the growth that was so evident on his last studio outing In the Falling Dark... it serves as another steppingstone to what would be the most impressive period of his career...\"\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Bruce Cockburn.\n\n\"Rainfall\" – 3:48\n\"A Montréal Song\" – 4:06\n\"Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money In My Hand\" – 4:53\n\"Prenons La Mer\" – 2:38\n\"Red Ships Take Off In the Distance\" – 5:15\n\"Laughter\" – 3:38\n\"Bright Sky\" – 4:01\n\"Feast of Fools\" – 6:42\n\"Can I Go With You\" – 2:30\n\"Nanzen Ji\" – 4:43The 2002 release also contains the instrumental Mountain Call.\n\nAlbum credits\nPersonnel\n\nBruce Cockburn – composer, vocals, guitar\nRobert Boucher – bass guitar\nBob DiSalle – drums\nEugene Martynec – guitar\nKathryn Moses – flute\nBeverly Glenn-Copeland – backing vocals on 1, 3, 6–7, and 9\nMarty Nagler – backing vocals on 6 and 7\nTommy Graham – backing vocals on 6 and 7\nBrent Titcomb – backing vocals on 6 and 7\nShingoore – backing vocals on 2 and 6–8\nRonney Abramson – backing vocals on 4Production\n\nMarcel Mousette – translation\nEugene Martynec – producer\nKen Friesen – engineer\nPeter Holcomb – engineer's assistant\nBart Schoales – art direction\nFred Bird – model photograph\nBernie Finkelstein – direction\nPassage 6:\nJeff Martin (game designer)\nJeff Martin (born 1965) is an American game designer and entrepreneur best known as the founder of True Adventures and President of Dwarven Forge from 2004 to 2014.\nMartin has numerous industry credits, not limited to having front-page articles in Polyhedron, as well as being a finalist for the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. Martin has authored or co-authored dozens of modules for various platforms including AD&D, True Dungeon, and Marvel Superheroes.\nMartin was the president of Dwarven Forge LLC since 2004 until 2014, a company that specializes in hand painted miniature terrain. He has been the lead developer, or co-developer on several Dwarven Forge miniature terrain sets. He has guided two successful Kickstarter projects for Dwarven Forge.\n\nPersonal life\nMartin was born in Mt. Carmel, Illinois, United States, and currently lives in southern Illinois with his wife and two children. His main hobby is presenting the True Dungeon event at Gen Con Indy every year, but he enjoys the company of his family and friends whenever possible. Martin grew up in a thriving gaming community, having a fond affinity for hobby games from a young age.\nMartin has been attending the Gen Con gaming convention for over 30 years, and has been a part of the gaming community for just as long. Martin won the first ever RPGA D&D Masters Tournament at Gen Con 20, in 1985. He was also part of a small team of designers involved in the play testing of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition.\n\nWhen asked what his childhood heroes were: \n\"My heroes growing up were Col. Hogan and Capt. Kirk. I loved the fact that they could always think themselves out of a situation. It kind of set me up to love D&D since the game greatly promotes creative problem solving.\"\nMartin started playing Dungeons and Dragons in 1978 when he happened upon a rulebook at a neighbor's house. He has been playing D&D pretty regularly since, as well as enjoying some classic war games like Third Reich and Dawn Patrol. Martin has dabbled in every trend that has hit the market except collectible card games, as he said \"I was too long an old fart to play them (laugh).\"\n\nWhen asked what his favorite games are: \n\"Of course, there is D&D in all its incarnations as well as Third Reich, Dawn Patrol, Hyborian War(PBM), Car Wars, Battletech and Thief (series). I have designed several home-brew games, with a slider dice game known as Regent being my favorite.\"\n\nPublishing in Polyhedron\nMartin has been published in the gaming magazine Polyhedron numerous times.\n\nDwarven Forge\nMartin has been closely involved with the design of the Dwarven Forge Miniature Terrain. Dwarven Forge is a company that specializes in hand painted, ultra high quality miniature terrain for tabletop gaming. While Dwarven Forge used to specialize in fantasy settings, it has branched out recently, releasing three unique science fiction terrain sets.\nMartin started working in the Dwarven Forge booth at Gen Con as a volunteer in 2000, when he noticed Dwarven Forge creator Stefan Pokorny scrambling with others to get the booth open in time. He ended up giving up the rest of his time during Gen Con to help, due to the big response created by the release of D&D 3.0. Over the next few years, Martin managed the Dwarven Forge booths at Origins and Gen Con Indy. Eventually, in 2004, Pokorny asked Martin to manage the company while Pokorny stepped back from the day-to-day operations. Since then, Martin has changed the Dwarven Forge business model from a classic \"sold in store\" approach, to a \"direct to gamers\"  distribution via their website and game conventions. Martin has developed many sets inside his tenure at Dwarven Forge, and he is especially proud of the Den of Evil and Realm of the Ancient limited-edition product lines.\n\nWhen asked about the creation of Dwarven Forge, Martin said:  \n\"Dwarven Forge was the brainchild of a talented artist and DM Stefan Pokorny who wanted to make something really cool for his players. He dreamed up a modular 3D tile system and he chose polystone as the best medium for his sculptures. He took a huge risk placing an order for his creations, and the responses was incredible. It has been 13 years now, and the demand for his art continues to grow.\" \" The pieces are first sculpted by Stefan and then cast in rock-hard polystone. He then paints the masters and sends them off to a casting house that mass produces the pieces based on the original masters. \"\n\nWhen asked about Dwarven Forge customers:  \n\"They are incredibly loyal and patient! Stefan only produces sets when he sees fit and we don't follow a production schedule. Sometimes we can go almost a whole year without a new set. Yet our collectors patiently wait for us. I think they appreciate his level of commitment to quality. They also are very giving with feedback and product ideas, and I know Stefan reads our Forums all the time.\"\n\nTrue Dungeon\nMartin is the creator of True Dungeon, a life size 3d dungeon puzzle that occurs annually at Gen Con Indianapolis. Not only does he author every adventure to date, but he also builds most of the props and sets used for the event. True Dungeon started at Gen Con Indy in 2003, and has grown wildly since then. True Dungeon has held the record as the biggest event at Gen Con since 2005, selling over 4000 tickets a year for the annual event. In addition to the fantasy styled True Dungeon, Martin worked with Upper Deck Entertainment in 2004 and 2005 to produce True Heroes, an event similar in scale to True Dungeon, but with a superhero theme.\n\nGen Con owner Peter Adkison has said about True Dungeon,  \n\"Simply put, True Dungeon is the coolest event in the gaming universe. It's the largest event at Gen Con, in fact it’s so big that Gen Con has to open registration for it separate from the rest of the event listing or the system crashes. It’s so cool it has its own line of merchandise that is traded on the secondary market like collectibles. It must be seen to be believed! I am very proud to have True Dungeon as the Gen Con centerpiece.\"\n\nMartin is also the creator and designer of the unique True Dungeon game component known as True Dungeon Treasure Tokens. These have been printed in yearly editions since 2003, and have created their own secondary market on eBay; One token went for over $1,000 at auction. Martin is the lead content designer and co-graphic designer for these full color in-game pieces. Every edition since 2004 has sold out.\nMartin is also co-videographer and co-editor for the True Dungeon teaser trailers.\n\nAwards and nominations\nMartin was one of five nominees for the 2004 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming, an annual award created to publicly acknowledge excellence in gaming. Martin has also received praise in numerous publications for his work with True Dungeon, including Dragon Magazine, and Knights of the Dinner Table.\nPassage 7:\nTrue Adventures\nTrue Adventures, Ltd., is a role-playing game company started by Jeff Martin. It operates two entertainment venues at Gen Con Indy: True Dungeon and True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern. True Adventures is notable because their signature event, True Dungeon, is \"the single most popular event\" at Gen Con, drawing people to the convention just for it.  The event is also notable for its scale; about 3,000 players play in groups of up to eight people (more recently ten) over four days each year. The company also hosted the event True Heroes in 2004 and 2005. True Adventures ran these events at Gen Con SoCal when the convention was still in existence. The company grew out of Martin's work in creating elaborate props and puzzles for his Dungeons & Dragons game.\n\nTrue Dungeon\nAlthough True Dungeon shares some characteristics with live action roleplaying (LARP) games, the game's developers don't consider it a LARP. While players are free to role-play particular characters, True Dungeon does not emphasize role-playing aspects; characters lack backgrounds and names.  Instead characters primarily are collections of spells and statistics useful for solving puzzles and battling opponents.  The rules mechanics are loosely based on those of Dungeons & Dragons. Combat is played out by sliding weapon counters along a waist-high shuffleboard table. True Dungeon focuses on riddle and puzzle solving along with the shuffle board combat system.\nJeff Martin originally ran yearly immersive games of this sort for groups of friends.  Gen Con owner Peter Adkison was invited to one of these events, then running under the name \"Jeff Con\" for about 30 people.\nAfter his experience, Adkison invited Martin to run the game at Gen Con after participating in one of Martin's events.  True Dungeon was first run at Gen Con Indy in 2003.  The first event was arranged at the last minute; there was no promotion and tickets were not in Gen Con's system.The events takes about 100 volunteers to run.  The 2006 event supplies filled two semi-trailers.Equipment for player characters exists in the form of \"treasure tokens\".  These are marked plastic tokens indicating various pieces of traditional Dungeons & Dragons equipment.  Examples include rope, small steel mirrors, weapons, and armor.  In 2005 players were given a random weapon and random armor; they were expected to trade within their group to optimize their equipment usage.  In 2006 players were given a random bag of 10 tokens.  Since the game began players could also purchase additional bags of random tokens.  There is a substantial after-market for these tradable tokens.True Dungeon provides an interactive environment, complete with multiple solutions to many problems.  There are a small number of NPCs as the plot requires.  Players move through various rooms in the game world.  Each room contains a challenge in either the form of a puzzle, a fight, or both.  The puzzles can be very difficult and the game has a high rate of character death, although the game's lethality has dropped over the years. Jeff Martin said of the 2004 Gen Con Indy game that only 20% of characters survived, while in 2005 42% did.Closer to live action role-playing, players are expected to physically explore their surroundings, not simply describing interactions with the gamemaster  Many interactions do require gamemaster interaction, with some details of the environment described to players by the gamemaster assigned to each room.The first few years, each group of players were accompanied by a gamemaster throughout the dungeon.  In 2005, this was switched to having a gamemaster assigned to each room to ensure more consistent rulings for a given room.To maximize throughput of players, each room of the dungeon has a group of players in it.  Groups all advance to the next room simultaneously.  As a result, each room has a hard time limit.  If players finish early, they must wait for the time limit to expire before advancing.  If the players are too slow, they are penalized hit points and are moved into the next room.  The plot for each dungeon usually provides a reason for the time limit.  One year the plot specified that the characters were fleeing lizardmen.  Sometimes the rooms themselves explain the time limit; in 2005 one room had a moving wall that would crush characters who failed to open the locked door into the next room quickly enough.\nPlayer success in True Dungeon (and True Heroes) is tracked in the form of Experience Points.  Players with larger numbers of Experience Points (or XP) are given levels.  These levels have no impact on the gameplay, but offer benefits outside of the game.\n\nEvents\nIn 2005 two different adventures were run in parallel: \"Battle Below Castle Greyhawk\" and \"Assault Above Castle Greyhawk\".  In the last room of one of the adventures players could send a brief message to the other adventure, a clue to help the second party complete their last room.  Players were free to play both adventures.\nIn 2006 two very similar copies of the same adventure, \"Escape from the Spider Cult\", were run in parallel, effectively doubling the number of slots available for players. The playable classes were also expanded to include Barbarian, Druid, and Monk, in addition to the previous Wizard, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Ranger and Bard.\nIn 2007, again two very similar copies of the same adventure, \"Race Across Greyhawk\", were run in parallel.  But this year, one dungeon was more combat oriented while the other was more puzzle oriented. This year also marked the addition of live monsters to the game including a shambling mound, a medusa, and a stone golem.\n2008's adventure was entitled \"Hope of the Lost.\"  The plot line had the players infiltrating a temple of Pelor that had been taken over by evil forces.  Again two versions were run in parallel, a \"combat\" version and a \"puzzle\" version.  Like 2005's game, groups on the two paths had to work together at the very end to win.  Unlike the 2005 year, the two teams actually joined up in the same room.  The puzzle group had to solve a puzzle while the combat group had to fight a monster.  Both groups had to succeed to win.\nIn 2009 True Adventures ran four events.  \"Five Aspects\" was a revised version of the original 2004 game.  \"Smoak\" was a new full length event.  \"Getting In\" was a shorter event.  \"True Grind\" was an all combat event.In 2010 True Adventures ran three events.  \"The Evading Hilt\" offered 1,500 tickets, \"DragonWard\" offered 3,000 tickets and the True Grind event offered around 300 tickets.In 2011 True Adventures ran three events.  \"Lair of the Sea-Lich\", \"Dragon's Redoubt\" and the True Grind.In 2012 True Adventures ran three events.  \"Giants' Travail\", \"Draco-Lich Undone\" and the True Grind.In 2013 True Adventures ran three events for total of 7,500 tickets available.  \"Lycans Afoot\" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, \"Golembane\" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, and the True Grind. Lycans Afoot and Golembane offer 4 levels of challenge: Non-Lethal, Normal, Hardcore, and Nightmare.\nIn 2014 True Adventures ran two events (\"Flight of the Zephyr\", \"Into the Viper's Pit\") and the True Grind.In 2015 True Adventures ran a retro event (\"Decent into the Underdark\") at Who's Yer Con and a True Grind. True dungeon also premiered two new events (Into the Underdark & Sable Gauntlet) and a grind at Gen con.In 2016 True Adventures ran a retro event at Gamehole Con (\"Deeperdark redux\") and a True Grind. True dungeon also premiered two new events (Behold Her Majesty & Into the Deeperdark) and a grind at Gen con.In 2017 True Adventures ran a solo anniversary convention (True dungeon celebration) at which they presented a retro event (\"Beneath Castle Altus\"), and a massive \"raid style\" event called True horde. True Adventures also attended Origins Game Fair rerunning their 2016 adventures and premiered two new dungeons and a grind event at Gencon (The Moongate Maze & Dancing Among Stones) based on Patrick Rothfuss Kingkiller Chronicle world.\nIn 2018 True Adventures began their season at Origins game fair offering a final showing of their 2017 \"Kingkiller: adventures and premiering the first of their N series modules (\"Astral Journey to the Bliss\"), they also offered two patron only events. A best of dungeon called \"Into the shadowlands\" and another showing of the true horde raid. All 3 main N series modules (\"Astral Journey to the Bliss\",\"Odin's Haven\", and \"The Vault of the all father\") as well a TrueGrind event (\"To Pandemonium and Back\") and a seal deck throwback of the 2014 adventure \"Into the Viper's Pit\" were offered at gencon.In 2019 True Adventures again began their season at Origins game fair premiering a new module (\"The Abyssal Swamp\"). The Abyssal Swamp along with 2 new modules (\"Path of death\", \"Infernal Redoubt\") were also offered at gencon.In 2020 True Adventures announced plans for 3 new modules in their S series (\"Weird Magic\",\"Darkhold Keep\",\"Tomb of Terror\") along with a best of adventure called \"Odin's Redux\". However these were delayed due to the unspecified virus of unknown origins suspending in person conventions. Instead True adventures offered the first 3 in a series of 5 announced virtual adventures over zoom (\"Nymph & Nimblewit\", \"Thornbarb Pass\",\"The Deadwill Mine\").\nIn 2021 True Adventures completed the last 2 modules in the initial virtual series (\"Mistress of the Marsh\", \"Ashwind Abbey\"). True adventures has announced they will not be attending Origins or Gencon in 2021, they currently plan to attend Gamehole con assuming conditions allow. They have also announced plans for 3 additional adventures (\"V6 – The Bogwood Beast\", \"R1 – Felurian's Feast\" and \"Vx – Shyport Sinister\").\n\nTrue Dungeon Fantasy Tavern\nIn 2005, True Dungeon added a tavern area in front of the True Dungeon adventures proper.  The area is decorated as a stereotypical fantasy tavern.  Drinks are available for purchase.  The area is intended to be a fantasy-themed area for gamers to congregate and socialize.  It also acts as a staging area for players waiting for their session of True Dungeon.  A shuffle board is available to practice combat, and many players meet here to trade tokens.\nIn 2006 players with a ticket for the day's event could enter the tavern.  Any player with enough Experience Points to be fourth level could also enter.  Anyone else wishing to enter needed to pay a fee.\n\nStory Arcs\nTrue Adventure modules thus far have been broken into 3 story arcs. \n\"The Evading Hilt\", which ended with players challenging a dragon and gaining the materials to craft an item called \"The Medallion of Gray hawk\" \n\"The Missing Dwarfs of Icecrag keep\", which ended with the players challenging a Dracolich and crafting a Rod of Seven Parts\n\"The Teeth of Cavadar\", ongoing.\n\nTrue Craft\nTrue Craft was a quest based mini game that took place during the True Dungeon event held at Gen Con 2012. Players could turn in True craft tokens to costumed NPCs in order to participate in carnival styled games which could grant in game bonuses during the main True Dungeon events held that year.\n\nTrue Heroes\nTrue Heroes was a superhero-themed game that is played much like True Dungeon. It was produced in conjunction with Upper Deck Entertainment and Marvel Comics.  Combat involved throwing small balls containing magnets at metal targets.  Combat also used aspects of Upper Deck's \"VS System\".   True Heroes operated at Gen Con Indy and So Cal in 2004 and 2005 before being cancelled.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nThe Sea Hunters II\nThe Sea Hunters II: More True Adventures with Famous Shipwrecks is a nonfiction work by adventure novelist Clive Cussler published in the United States in 2002.  This work details the author's continuing search for famous shipwrecks with his nonprofit organization NUMA. There is also a television series  titled The Sea Hunters which is based on the book. It airs on the National Geographic Channel and History Television in Canada.\n\nSynopsis\nAdventure novelist Clive Cussler follows up on the success of his first nonfiction book The Sea Hunters: True Adventures With Famous Shipwrecks which documented the formation of his nonprofit organization named after the fictional agency in his novels, the National Underwater and Marine Agency which is dedicated to the discovery of famous shipwrecks around the world.\nThis volume documents the search for the final resting places of fourteen additional ships or other historical sunken artifacts  not documented in the first work.  Unlike the first book, this volume documents searches for ships that Cussler's group has found, and searches that were ultimately unsuccessful.  As in the first work, preceding the details of the search is a fictionalized imagining of the events that led to the loss of the ship.\n\nContents\nPart 1: L’Aimable (Lost ship of René-Robert Cavelier)\nPart 2: The Steamboat New Orleans\nPart 3: The Ironclads: Manassas and Louisiana\nPart 4: USS Mississippi\nPart 5: The Siege of Charleston: Keokuk, Weehawken, and Patapsco\nPart 6: The Cannon of San Jacinto\nPart 7: Mary Celeste\nPart 8: The Steamboat General Slocum\nPart 9: SS Waratah\nPart 10: RMS Carpathia\nPart 11: L’Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird, biplane flown by Charles Nungesser and François Coli, who vanished on an attempted transatlantic flight in 1927)\nPart 12: USS Akron\nPart 13: PT-109\nPart 14: The Hunt for Samuel Morey's boat Aunt Sally\n\nRelease Details\n2002, USA, J.P.

Figg\nThe Mostly True Adventures of Homer P. Figg is a  historical novel by Rodman Philbrick, author of Freak the Mighty. Set during the American Civil War, it follows the adventures of a boy who is an inveterate teller of tall tales on his quest to find his older brother, a Union soldier. First published in 2009, it was named as a Newbery Honor Book in 2010. The Lexile Level of this book is 950L and the Accelerated Reader (AR) Level is 5.6. This book contains 192 pages.\n\nPlot summary\nThis story is narrated by the story's main character, Homer P. Figg, an orphan in Maine living with his older brother, Harold P. Figg, under the cruel treatment of their mother's sister's husband, Squinton Leach. After Harold beats up Leach for abusing them once again, Leach and some other men draft Harold into the Union army illegally. Homer is thrown into a root cellar and subsequently escapes by digging a tunnel. He tries to escape on a horse at night, but is intercepted by two men named Stink and Smelt. \nThe duo force him to investigate a suspected underground railroad operator named Jebediah Brewster, a Quaker who owns a gemstone mine. Homer visits Brewster and is treated well by him, as he understands the situation Homer is in. Brewster advises him to tell the truth, but Homer lies instead. As a result, he is nearly killed but is saved by a fellow prisoner named Samuel Reed, whose life Homer had saved earlier. \nHomer and Reed return to the Brewsters, and Reed leads the fugitive slaves back on their way to freedom. Mr. Brewster then assigns Homer to a young Methodist clergyman, Reverend Webster B. Willow, to act as his guardian.  Unfortunately when they board a ship to find Homer's brother, Willow is seduced by a woman and scammed out of his money. Willow asks the steward to throw Homer into the cargo deck with the pigs.  \nOnce the ship docks, Homer is tormented by the crowd as a “pig-boy” until a man named Professor Fleabottom rescues him. He invites Homer to join his medicine show as the amazing “Pig-Boy”. One night, Homer accidentally sees Fleabottom handing a leather satchel to a man on a black horse. They are running away from a colonel who sent a squad after them, who Fleabottom tried to bribe with silver coins. They continue running and come across a rogue balloon with a man inside yelling for help. Homer and another member of the show help, but are nearly killed when a group of Union soldiers and a captain come to arrest them for treason. During the encounter, Homer discovers Fleabottom is actually a Rebel spy by the name of Reginald Robertson Crockett.  \nHomer escapes in a balloon, avoiding arrest, but crash lands into Confederate territory and is thrown into custody. Homer escapes on the back of a stolen pony, riding right through the battle of Gettysburg, and makes it to Union territory. He meets Reverend Webster B. Willow, who saw Homer's brother and informs Homer that Harold isn't in the fighting yet and will presumably arrive tomorrow in the Maine regiment.  \nWhen Homer intercepts the Maine regiment he discovers that Harold was sent to the rear as a mutineer for slamming his officer into the mud, just like what he did to Leach. The general in charge, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, sends all men available, including the prisoners, to reinforce the hill they are guarding. Harold goes to fight despite Homer's please not to. Homer is right in the fighting as a “support unit”, but injures Harold's leg accidentally.\nBoth Homer and Harold live, although Harold lost his leg due to an infection. They spend the two years working on farms and in small factories. Mr. Brewster finds them, is made their legal guardian, and names them his kin and heirs.\n\nStage verson\nA stage version debuted at the Kennedy Center in 2012.\nPassage 10:\nHow Angel Peterson Got His Name\nHow Angel Peterson Got His Name is a nonfiction, young adult memoir written by Gary Paulsen, outlining the experiences of Paulsen and his friends during the mid-1950s.The book includes discussions of hang gliding and bike riding.", "answers": ["Eve Hewson"], "length": 6860, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "515a5cbf646c2891fde47be6b8fa3442571938d8dac8827a"}

This style was invented and popularized in several regional American cuisines, most notably originating in New Mexican cuisine, and expanding beyond Southwestern cuisine and neighboring  Tex-Mex. Southwestern-style breakfast burritos may include any combination of scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, peppers (usually New Mexico chile, Jalapeño, or other chili peppers), salsa, onions, chorizo, bacon, or sour cream.  In other variations of breakfast burritos, more ingredients such as tomatoes, cheese, ham, and other fresh products can be added.\nSome fast food restaurants such as Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's and Taco Bell sell breakfast burritos. The breakfast burrito is also a popular street food, and street-style breakfast burritos are found in the food truck scene in places such as Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nTia Sophia's, a New Mexican diner in Santa Fe, claims the first use of the term \"breakfast burrito\" on a menu, in 1975, although a rolled tortilla containing some combination of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and cheese existed in New Mexican cuisine well before that.  Fast food giant McDonald's introduced their version in the late 1980s, and by the 1990s, more fast food restaurants caught on to the style, with Sonic Drive-In, Hardee's, and Carl's Jr. offering breakfast burritos on their menus. In 2014, Taco Bell launched their breakfast menu, which included breakfast burritos.\n\nPreparation\nThe breakfast burrito can be prepared with myriad filling ingredients, such as eggs, ham, cheese, onion, chile or bell peppers, bacon, Canadian bacon, potatoes, sausage, avocado, tomato, spinach, beans, and olives.  In New Mexico, breakfast burritos are often served \"smothered\" (covered with a chile sauce) or \"handheld\" (with chile sauce or chopped green chile inside). It is usually served heated up or cooked.\n\nSee also\nBreakfast sandwich\nBreakfast taco\nBreakfast roll\nList of American foods\nList of breakfast foods\nOmelette\nWrap (sandwich)\nPassage 3:\nMapita Cortés\nMapita Cortés (August 4, 1939 – January 1, 2006  born Maria del Pilar Mercado Cordero in 1939 in the Santurce barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico – died in Mexico City), was a Puerto Rican actress of telenovelas and the cinema of Mexico. She is the mother of Mexican actor Luis Gatica, the wife of Lucho Gatica, the niece of Puerto Rican actress Mapy Cortés, and the niece in law of Mexican actor Fernando Cortés. Mapita Cortés is also the cousin of famous Paquito Cordero, two years her junior.\n\nBiography\nCortés was Miss Puerto Rico in the 1957 Miss Universe pageant and finished as one of the top five finalists.Mapita Cortés had demonstrated desire to become an actress since she was a child. As she and her cousin grew, her cousin became a known personality in Puerto Rico. Mapita Cortés, however,  tried her luck in Mexico, since her aunt had adopted her and was a celebrity there. Mapita Cortés took her last name from her uncle and aunt.\nCortés became a sensation in the Mexican film industry during the 1950s, when she appeared in 1958's Misterios de Ultratumba (\"Mysteries of the Afterlife\", aka The Black Pit of Dr. M). This movie became a contemporary Mexican classic.Cortés then starred or played important roles in a number of films, following her uncle and aunt's footsteps by becoming a celebrity on her own in Mexico. She decided to establish herself in the North American country permanently after enjoying success there.\nWhile she was doing films, another celebrity, Chilean singer Lucho Gatica, fell in love with her and the two began a romance that would lead to a marriage on May 21, 1960. They had five children: Luis, Mapy (Maria del Pilar), Aída, Juanita, and Alfredo. Their son Luis Gatica (born in 1961), would eventually also become a celebrity as a telenovela actor and rock music singer during the 1980s. Mapita Cortés and Lucho Gatica divorced after 18 years of marriage.After marrying Lucho Gatica, Mapita Cortés semi-retired from the world of show business, becoming a housewife instead and attending to her children. But she returned to activity sporadically, becoming what is known as a character actress in some of Mexico's most famous telenovelas. In 1989, she participated alongside Verónica Castro in Televisa's Mi pequeña Soledad, which became a major hit across Mexico, the United States and even Europe, giving Mapita Cortés a degree of celebrity in countries like Russia and others. Mapita Cortés also had the opportunity to work alongside Mariana Levy, who died in 2005.\n\nFilms\nVacaciones en Acapulco (1961)\nPoker de reinas (1960)\nDormitorio para señoritas (1960)\nVariedades de medianoche (1960)\nEscuela de verano (1959)\nMisterios de ultratumba (1959) as Patricia Aldama\nSeñoritas (1959)\nLa edad de la tentación (1959)\nTres lecciones de amor (1959)\nA Thousand and One Nights (1958)\nLos tres vivales (1958)\n\nTelenovelas\nMi pequeña Soledad (1990) as Blanquita\nMarionetas (1986)\nYo no pedí vivir (1977)\nPensión de mujeres (1960)\n\nSee also\nList of Puerto Ricans\nForeign-born artists in Mexico\nPassage 4:\nSex Worker Open University\nThe Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (SWARM), formerly known as the Sex Worker Open University (SWOU), was founded in 2009 to provide educational and other resources to sex workers in the United Kingdom. It is a sex worker-led organisation. Their activities include educational projects, breakfast drop-ins for sex workers, and Glasgow's sex worker support effort, Confide. In April 2013, SWOU took a lead role in halting the further criminalisation of sex work in Scotland by organising a massive grassroots community response which included street protests, public education, sex worker-only workshops on safety, the law, and fighting stigma, and presentations to packed audiences of evidence as to the effects of criminalisation, from sex workers and academics from around the world.In 2019 the group celebrated a decade of organising by holding a festival where they started the Decriminalised Futures project. The aims of the project are to \"highlight the history of the sex workers’ rights movement and its connections to broader social and labour struggles while celebrating creative expression\". In 2022 the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London sponsored the project and hosted an exhibition of the same name. The exhibition runs from February to May 2022 and brings together 13 artists, 6 writers including Mercedes Eng, sex workers, the East London Strippers Collective, artists and activists.\n\nSee also\nProstitution in Scotland\nProstitution in the United Kingdom\nPassage 5:\nJaime Fernández (actor)\nJaime Fernández Reyes (6 de diciembre de 1927 - 15 de abril de 2005) is a Mexican actor.

When she was just a teenager, poor and naive, she was deceived and seduced by Gonzalo Montero, son of Don Gregorio - the ruthless owner of the ranch where she worked as a peasant, and became pregnant. However, thanks to Gonzalo's infuriated wife, Gladis, who gave Victoria a violent beating, Victoria suffered a miscarriage.  Since then, Victoria, who at the time was known by her real name, Luisa, has been obsessed with making the Monteros pay for her pain.\nNow a stunning, rich and mature woman, Luisa/Victoria returns to Florida from California (the series was not really shot there) with her lovely adopted daughter, in search of revenge. She begins by getting a job at the Montero ranch, where Gonzalo, Gladis and Don Gregorio are all immediately intrigued by her, as she uncannily reminds them of someone they would rather forget.\nHowever, vengeance doesn't come as easily as Victoria thought, since she never expected love to interfere with her plans. When she meets Diego, a landowner neighbor of the Monteros, it's love at first sight for both. While tough and inflexible on the surface, Diego is really just a bitter man, a victim of a great injustice, in desperate need of affection for which Victoria is willing to give him without bounds. To complicate matters even more, Victoria's daughter, Carolina, finds true love in Alejandro, Gonzalo Montero's son, making Carolina the cousin of Alejandro.\nVictoria realizes that if she wants lasting happiness for herself and her daughter, she must finally let go of the hatred she feels for the Monteros, in spite of the fact that they continue hounding her even today. Will she be able to? What will win out in the end: her unflinching desire for revenge, or the power of love?.\n\nCast\nMain cast\nSecondary Cast\nEduardo Linares ....

After John's disastrous interview with celebrity Brett Anderson (Reid Scott), he and Elliot make a pact to become famous before their 30th birthday in 24 hours. In their first attempt at doing this they get beat up by a homeless man named Archie (Mike Judge) after trying to get a check back from him upon finding the camera only filmed their feet: in their second attempt they get rescued from a fire trying to rescue an old woman from it, with the same woman ending up rescuing Elliot from it. After an interview is denied, John concludes that it's not fame they want, its infamy.\nElliot and John attempt to hack a company using the names \"deadly jester\" and \"fist of satan\" but the owner, Marvin Masterson (Paul Scheer), retaliates by using his \"reverse-screw-driver\" to delete all of John's pornography and melt Elliot and John's computer. John later decides to go on a killing spree in order to get more attention. Elliot is reluctant to help John with this, but eventually decides to do it, saying to him that he can't do it alone. They buy chloroform to use to kill their elderly neighbor, but John has second thoughts. Elliot and John then discover that while in disguise, during one of their previous attempts at fame, they became witnesses to a robbery and are now being called the \"mystery witnesses\". The two go on TV to tell everyone they are the \"mystery witnesses\", and quickly become a full media sensation with the help of Sally and Linda (Kate Micucci and Riki Lindhome), two girls who work at a mall and whom the boys flirt with. However, when brought to the police station soon after, they are informed by Detective Donahue (John Ennis) that the man who had committed the robbery and was arrested is actually a relative of the member of a Cleveland crime syndicate. As such, the two are now being forced to go to the witness protection program to make sure that his family members won't find and kill them. Desperate not to throw their life away, the two run away from the station and hide out in Sally and Linda's apartment and come up with an idea to kill the mystery witnesses.\nElliot and John go to the Nerd King (Hannibal Buress), the overweight owner of a collectible store and a trade partner for tools they had used in their failed fame attempts, and using a rare collectible action figure, are able to get help from him to fake the deaths of the \"mystery witnesses\". After it is done, the two return to Sally and Linda's apartment to find it filled with the press, resulting in them getting arrested for running away and are put in the witness protection program, but they are able to say their goodbyes to Sally and Linda. In the end, John and Elliot are seen working at a diner and wearing fake mustaches. They smile knowing they have finally gotten what they wanted: fame.\n\nVoice cast\nProduction\nNerdland is based on a concept that screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker had been pitching for several years in various iterations: first as a live-action movie, then a television series, then a series of animated shorts, and finally an animated film. Walker explains, \"I have been a huge fan of Metalocalypse, Superjail!, and a lot of the cartoons that are on Adult Swim, especially the stuff done by Titmouse, Inc. I would watch Metalocalypse and the little bird logo would come up at the end and chirp and I’d think, 'Who are these lunatics?' We set up a meeting with Titmouse and gave them the script. I was expecting Chris and Shannon Prynoski, who created and run Titmouse, to just say, 'No, this is a stupid idea.' But they said yes, and we went from there. I was super excited that Chris was interested in overseeing the making of it as a feature. Once he said yes he also said yes to directing it, which was great because I’m a huge fan of his.\"\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 14, 2016.

While he is there bandits attack the colony, killing Phil and capturing Kenner and Sheila. Kenner is taken to a bandit base, the Colosseum. He is brought before Bishop, the leader of the bandits, who knows Kenner's mission and plans to kill him during a gladiator battle. Fortunately, Kenner escapes from the base with a group of Muties in a bandits’ car.\nLater, Kenner explains to Grace, one of the Muties, about his mission. He is to take radioactivity readings to see if they can zirconium around Oblivion. The precious mineral is important in fighting aliens from a parallel universe who transforms planets into stars. To thwart them, scientists developed a zirconium bomb which was used to destroy an alien starship. Kenner's mission is to find more zirconium. When Kenner asks about Grace's family, she explains her parents were eaten by subterranean, cannibalistic mutants called “Whities”.\nEventually, Kenner and the Muties make their way back to camp, which is soon attacked by bandits.

Later, Kenner and Grace talk about the world Kenner comes from and the two make love.\nThe band of Muties arrive at the Colosseum, but Elijah runs screaming out of the convoy and is shot. A firefight erupts between the Muties and the bandits. Kenner finds Sheila along with other prisoners, and then searches for the Bishop. Kenner and the Muties are ambushed by the bandits. They finally corner Bishop and discover he is actually a Mutie himself. During this confrontation, the Bishop escapes.\nIn the end, Kenner writes back to his employers stating the conditions in Oblivion are too radioactive to mine, so they would have to buy the zirconium from the resident Muties.

{"input": "What basketball player elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame released music through Rendezvous Music?", "context": "Passage 1:\nWayman Tisdale\nWayman Lawrence Tisdale (June 9, 1964 – May 15, 2009) was an American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and a smooth jazz bass guitarist. A three-time All American at the University of Oklahoma, he was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nEarly life\nTisdale was born in Fort Worth, Texas. His father, Louis Tisdale, was a well-known pastor in Tulsa, Oklahoma, serving for 21 years as senior pastor of Friendship Church; After his father died in 1997, the former Osage Expressway in Tulsa was named L.L. Tisdale Parkway in his honor. Wayman's older brother Weldon served as the church's pastor 1997–2018.Growing up, Tisdale was not interested in basketball. When older brothers Weldon and William played pickup games he usually quit before they finished, retreating to the family's sandbox. However, Tisdale began taking to the sport in the eighth grade when he first learned to dunk.He met his future wife Regina in April 1981 at church. They were juniors at different Tulsa high schools, and she did not know he was one of the most heavily recruited basketball players in the country.Tisdale called music his \"first love.\" Throughout his youth, and continuing through his college basketball career, he played bass guitar at his father's church.\nMusic and church were so important to Tisdale that after recruiting him to the University of Oklahoma, Sooners head coach Billy Tubbs changed the team's practice schedule. He moved the team's Sunday practice from the morning to the evening to allow Tisdale to play at morning services in his father's church in Tulsa.\n\nBasketball career\nTisdale graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he grew up. As a college player at the University of Oklahoma from 1982 to 1985, he was a three-time Big Eight Conference Player of the Year and the first player in collegiate history to be named a first-team All American by the Associated Press in his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons. He still holds the record at Oklahoma for the most points scored by any player through his freshman and sophomore seasons. He won a gold medal as a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic basketball team coached by Indiana University's Bobby Knight. The Indiana Pacers made Tisdale the second overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft.\nAs a power forward, Tisdale averaged over 15 points and six rebounds per game in a 12-season professional career with the Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings, and Phoenix Suns. His best season was in 1989–90 with the Kings, when he averaged 22.3 points and 7.5 rebounds a game. Tisdale retired in 1997 to focus on his musical career.\nTisdale's jersey number (23) was retired by the University of Oklahoma in 1997. When Blake Griffin was granted permission to wear it during his career at OU (2007–2009), he sought and received Tisdale's blessing before accepting it.\nThe outstanding freshman award in the NCAA is named the Wayman Tisdale Award.\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlayoffs\nMusic career\nTisdale launched his music career with his debut album Power Forward in 1995 on the Motown Label. Primarily a bass player, he recorded eight albums, with the 2001 release Face to Face climbing to No. 1 on Billboard's contemporary jazz chart. He was awarded the Legacy Tribute Award by the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 2002. In an ESPN internet chat, Tisdale said his musical influences included the funk bands of the 1970s. His most recent release (and his final album before his death), Rebound, was written and released after he was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nCancer diagnosis\nIn March 2007, Tisdale underwent treatment for cancer in his knee (osteosarcoma), which was discovered after he fell down a flight of stairs at his home in Los Angeles on February 8, and broke his leg. In May, Tisdale announced on his website that he was recovering from a procedure to remove the cyst, and expected to recover 100%. He and Regina agreed not to tell their four children about his diagnosis until the fall of that year, when the entire family was together (their oldest daughter lives in Atlanta and their second-oldest was attending college at the time). However, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful, leading to a second round. As Tisdale recalled later, \"The doctor had never given anyone chemo that was my size. They just calculated how much chemo to give me and said, 'We hope it doesn't mess up your kidneys. If it does, sorry.\" \nHe drew on some of the challenges he faced during his basketball career to battle the disease, specifically recalling, \"I had some coaches that literally didn't want me to make it, and one in particular was Bobby Knight. At the time I frowned on that … I look at it today that had I not persevered through a lot of the stuff he put me through, I probably wouldn't be here today. I thank God for that dude because he pushed me.\"In August 2008, Tisdale had part of his right leg amputated because of the bone cancer. On his web site, Tisdale said removing a portion of the leg would be the best way to ensure that the cancer would not return. In a video message at halftime of a September 28 Sooners' football game, Tisdale affirmed he was doing well and that he was at peace following the operation.Shortly after the operation, he was fitted for a prosthesis. Scott Sabolich, the clinical director, said that in his 21-year career he had never created a prosthesis as large as the one he had to design for Tisdale. Sabolich noted that it typically takes a new amputee from three to six months to acclimate to a prosthesis, while it took Tisdale a month. He proved to be equally quick in learning to walk on his new limb; a physical therapist Tisdale worked with in Tulsa said that he was months ahead of a typical patient in that respect. Tisdale's experience led him to establish the Wayman Tisdale Foundation to raise funds to help amputees with the prosthetic process, which is not always covered by health insurance.In April 2009, Tisdale accepted an award from the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, then set off on a 21-date national concert tour.\n\nDeath\nTisdale died on May 15, 2009, at St. John Medical Center in Tulsa, where his wife had taken him when he had trouble breathing. She later confirmed that he died after his esophagus ruptured following radiation treatments for his cancer. Tisdale's agent described his death as a \"great shock\" and noted that Tisdale had been planning to go into the recording studio the following week for a project with jazz guitarist Norman Brown.On May 21, 2009, 4,000 mourners attended Tisdale's memorial service at the BOK Center in Tulsa. In June 2009, the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa announced that its new specialty health clinic in north Tulsa would be named in Tisdale's honor.According to the liner notes, Toby Keith's 2009 album American Ride is \"dedicated in memory of Wayman and Noel McFarland.\" The album includes the song \"Cryin' for Me (Wayman's Song),\" a tribute to Tisdale featuring Keith, Dave Koz, Marcus Miller, and Arthur Thompson. Keith had intended to play the song at Wayman's funeral but performed Willie Nelson's \"Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground\" instead because he wasn't emotionally ready to play \"Cryin' for Me\" (which opens with Wayman's outgoing voicemail message.)\nAccording to a note in the album sleeve, the song \"Bright\" by guitarist Peter White (Good Day, 2009) was dedicated \"to the memory of Wayman Tisdale, whose spirit never failed to brighten our lives.\" White said: \"The guy was always so happy, so positive, always had a smile, always made you feel great. Even before his death, I'd always called this song 'Bright,' because it sounded uplifting and happy and funny. Then I realized that it would be the perfect song to dedicate to Wayman, because that was the way he came across to the world.\"\n\nDiscography\nPower Forward (Motown, 1995)\nIn The Zone (Motown, 1996)\nDecisions (1998)\nFace to Face (2001)\nPresents 21 Days (2003)\nHang Time (2004)\nWay Up!

Hickey (December 20, 1902 – December 5, 1980) was an American college basketball and college football coach. He coached basketball at his alma mater of Creighton University (1935–1943, 1946–1947), Saint Louis University (1947–1958) and Marquette University (1958–1964), compiling a 429–230 record. Hickey also served as the head football coach at Creighton in 1934, tallying a mark of 2–7. After retiring from coaching, Hickey managed the American Automobile Association headquarters in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979 and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Hickey died of a heart attack on December 5, 1980 in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nHead coaching record\nBasketball\nFootball\nPassage 3:\nNational Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame\nThe National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Kansas City, Missouri, is a hall of fame and museum dedicated to men's college basketball.   The museum is an integral portion of the College Basketball Experience created by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), located at the T-Mobile Center. The hall is meant as a complement to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, with a focus strictly on those who have contributed greatly to college basketball.\nOn November 17, 2006, the NABC honored around 180 players, coaches and other notable contributors to college basketball by inducting them into the founding class of the Hall of Fame.  Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Dean Smith, John Wooden, and the family of James Naismith, were selected to represent the inaugural class.The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts has indicated it will help with the exhibits.  The other interactive portions of the College Basketball Experience are called 'The Entry Experience,' 'The Fan Experience,' and 'The Game.'

He was enshrined into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2010 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. Jernstedt died in Tequesta, Florida.\n\nEarly life and education\nJernstedt was born in McMinnville, Oregon and raised in Carlton, Oregon and was a three-sport athlete at Yamhill Carlton High School.  He received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from the University of Oregon in 1967 and 1973, respectively.  He was a football student-athlete while at Oregon, playing quarterback from 1964 to 1966 before injuries derailed his career.   He was named senior class president in 1966.  After graduation, Jernstedt spent two years in private business and then joined the athletic department at his alma mater, where he served in administrative positions between 1969 and 1972.\n\nCareer\nNCAA\nThe NCAA hired Jernstedt in 1972 as a director of events.  He is credited with guiding the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to what it is today.  Jernstedt oversaw his first Final Four in March 1973.  He was promoted to assistant executive director in 1974. He held a number of senior-level management positions over the next 29 years, culminating in his appointment in 2003 as executive vice president.  Jernstedt's duties included everything from managing events and overseeing branding to negotiating TV and corporate-sponsorship contracts.  Jernstedt was let go after new NCAA President Mark Emmert took over in 2011.In 2013, Jernstedt was selected to be a member of the first-ever College Football Playoff selection committee\n\nUSA basketball\nJernstedt first became associated with USA Basketball in 1975, serving as a member of its Council. Jernstedt was vice president for men from 1976-1980 and served another stint as vice president for men from 1992-1996. He was USA Basketball's vice president from 1997-2000 and was the organization's president from 2001-04.  Under Jernstedt's tenure, the men's basketball team had disappointing results with a sixth-place finish in the 2002 FIBA World Championship and a bronze finish at the 2004 Olympics, leading to changes in how the team was selected.\n\nAwards and honors\n2001 John Bunn Award\n2009 USA Basketball's Edward S.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida from 1957 to 1993 and was the school's athletic director from 1968 to 1990. Known as the Godfather of Florida basketball, Wilkes was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.Wilkes attended Mercer University, where he played college basketball from 1946 to 1950. At Stetson, he had over 550 wins along with 27 winning seasons.Wilkes wrote a book called Basketball. His son, Glenn Wilkes Jr., is the head women's basketball coach at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. His grandson, Wyatt, plays college basketball at Florida State University.\n\nHead coaching record\nCollege\nPassage 6:\nNolan Richardson\nNolan Richardson Jr. (born December 27, 1941) is a former American basketball head coach best known for his tenure at the University of Arkansas, where he won the 1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and led the Razorbacks to three Final Fours. Elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014, Richardson coached teams to winning a Division I Basketball National Championship, an NIT championship, and a Junior College National Championship, making him the only coach to win all three championships. During his 22 seasons of coaching in NCAA Division I, Richardson made a post-season tournament appearance 20 times.\n\nEarly life\nRichardson was born in El Segundo Barrio in El Paso, Texas, United States to Nolan Richardson Sr. and Clareast Richardson. Clareast died from a mysterious disease in 1944, leaving behind three children: Shirley, age 5, Nolan Jr., age 3, and Helen, six months. Eventually they moved in with the children's grandmother, Rose Richardson or Ol' Mama. Ol' Mama had a profound impact on Nolan by helping instill the drive and determination to succeed. Nolan's father would visit, but often did not live with the family, battling alcoholism for much of his adult life.Nolan Richardson played college basketball at Eastern Arizona Junior College during the 1959-1960 season.  He then returned home to play for Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso), playing his junior and senior years under Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins for the Miners.\n\nCoaching career\nEarly years\nRichardson began his coaching career at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. He coached at Bowie for ten years then moved to Western Texas Junior College for three seasons, posting a record there of 101-13. In 1979-80, his third and last season at Western Texas, he led the team to a 37-0 record and the 1980 National Junior College championship.\n\nUniversity of Tulsa\nRichardson was the head coach at Tulsa from 1980 to 1985, leading Tulsa to the NIT championship in 1981.  This was the first time an African American coach won an NIT championship. Richardson is credited with bringing the Tulsa program to national prominence when hired in 1980, and led the school to season conference championships in 1984 and 1985 and conference tournament titles in 1982 and 1984 to go with the previously mentioned 1981 NIT championship. Richardson had a .763 winning percentage at Tulsa, and became the first coach in NCAA history to win 50 games in his first two seasons. While coaching at Tulsa, Richardson became known for wearing an assortment of polka dot ties. This trademark eventually led Tulsa students to don polka dots during home games.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas\nIn 1985, Richardson became the head coach at the University of Arkansas after Eddie Sutton left for Kentucky.  Richardson became the first African-American coach at a major university in the South, and the first African-American head coach of a men's program in the Southwest Conference.  He inherited a team and program that was used to Sutton's halfcourt-oriented, walk-it-up-the-court style. Richardson's frenetic, up-tempo system was new to Arkansas, and many fans questioned his coaching style after finishing 12-16 his first season. However, by year two he had Arkansas back in the post-season with an NIT berth. By year three, he had Arkansas in the NCAA Tournament. The Hogs would make the tournament in 13 of the next 15 seasons. In all, Arkansas under Richardson enjoyed 15 post-season appearances during the 17 seasons of his tenure.\nHe led Arkansas to three Final Fours—losing to Duke in the semifinals in 1990, winning the National Championship in 1994 against Duke, and losing in the Championship game to UCLA in 1995. He was named the National Coach of the Year in 1994. Richardson's Arkansas teams averaged 27 wins per season during the 1990s, and they were the winningest team of the decade until 1997. The Razorbacks' 270 wins from 1990 to 1999 were more than all but four programs in the NCAA. Nolan's Arkansas teams won at least 20 games 12 times, as well as four 30-win seasons during his 17 years.\nHis teams typically played an up-tempo game with intense pressure defense - a style that was known as \"40 Minutes of Hell.\"  In 2012, his coaching philosophy was featured in the documentary \"40 Minutes of Hell\" on ESPN as part of the network's SEC Storied series. Richardson is the winningest basketball coach in Arkansas history, compiling a 389-169 (.697) record in 17 seasons.  He is the only head coach to win a Junior College National Championship, the NIT Championship, and the NCAA Championship. Richardson is also among an elite group including Roy Williams, Denny Crum, Jim Boeheim, John Calipari and Tubby Smith as the only head coaches to win 365 games in 15 seasons or fewer.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas controversy\nWhile at Arkansas, Richardson frequently spoke out about the negative stereotypes that he and other black coaches faced. His most controversial statement occurred in a post-game press conference in February 2002, when he spoke out against the athletic administration at the University of Arkansas. He claimed that he was being mistreated because of his race, and challenged Athletic Director Frank Broyles to ruffle feathers by declaring, \"If they go ahead and pay me my money, they can take my job tomorrow.\"  Shortly thereafter, Arkansas dismissed Richardson as head coach. In December 2002, Richardson filed a lawsuit against the university, the board of trustees, and the Razorback Foundation, citing a racially discriminatory environment; the lawsuit was dismissed in July 2004.\nRichardson's former long-time assistant, Mike Anderson, was hired as Arkansas' head coach in March 2011. Anderson led Arkansas to three NCAA Tournament appearances in eight seasons as head coach. Richardson attended numerous Arkansas home games during Anderson's tenure. On March 26, 2019, Anderson was terminated as head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks after a lackluster 2018-19 season and was replaced by former Nevada head coach Eric Musselman.\n\nNolan Richardson Court\nOn March 28, 2019, two days after the termination of Nolan Richardson's protege Mike Anderson, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees voted unanimously to name the court in Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena in honor of Nolan Richardson and his contributions to the University of Arkansas, state of Arkansas, and the United States of America. The honor became official in the wake of growing public support to honor Richardson in this way, including a resolution proposed during the 2019 regular session of the Arkansas General Assembly.\n\nInternational\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Richardson, (who speaks fluent Spanish) served as the head coach of the Panama national team. In March 2007, Richardson was named head coach of the Mexico national basketball team.\n\nWNBA\nIn the middle of 2009, Richardson was named as head coach and general manager of a prospective WNBA expansion team in Tulsa.  While it seemed unusual to hire a coach before securing an actual berth in the league, the investors behind the expansion effort claimed this proved they were serious about wanting a team.  On October 20, 2009, the Tulsa group bought the Detroit Shock and moved it to Tulsa as the Tulsa Shock.  It was Richardson's first time as a professional head coach, as well as his first time coaching women.\nRichardson's tenure with the Shock was far from successful.  His first season ended before it began when key players who had led the Shock to three WNBA titles opted, for various reasons, not to make the move to Tulsa. This forced Richardson to try to build the team around disgraced Olympic track star Marion Jones, who hadn't played a meaningful basketball game since her college days 13 years earlier. The players also found it difficult to adjust to Richardson's frenetic style. A lack of continuity plagued the team as well; all of the players who had come from Detroit had left the team by the middle of the season, and Richardson seemingly juggled the roster on a game-by-game basis.  The final result was a dreadful 6-28 record, last in the league. Richardson tried to rebuild the team by coaxing Sheryl Swoopes out of retirement, but after a 1-10 start, Richardson resigned on July 8, 2011.\n\nHead coaching record\nJunior College\nCollege\n†Richardson was replaced by interim coach Mike Anderson before the end of the season.\n\nWNBA\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I Men's Final Four appearances by coach\nPassage 7:\nRendezvous Music\nRendezvous Music (formerly known as Rendezvous Entertainment) is a record label founded by multiple-Grammy Award nominee and RIAA Certified Gold recording artist Dave Koz, radio entrepreneur Frank Cody and music business veteran Hyman Katz in 2002.

McLendon Jr. (April 5, 1915 – October 8, 1999) was an American basketball coach who is recognized as the first African American basketball coach at a predominantly white university and the first African American head coach in any professional sport.  He was a major contributor to the development of modern basketball and coached on both the college and professional levels during his career.  He has been enshrined three times in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and also inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBackground\nBorn in Hiawatha, Kansas, to John Blanche McLendon Sr. (June 24, 1882 –October 15, 1973), a college teacher, and Effie Katherine McLendon (née Hunn; 1886 – 1918), one of his students at Washburn University. McLendon Jr. was part African American and part Delaware Indian from his mother's side. His mother died in the 1918 flu pandemic which would lead to the temporary break-up of his family. John and his younger brother Arthur were sent to be with his Delaware Indian grandparents on a ranch near Trinidad, Colorado while his older sister, Anita, was sent to be with an aunt in Omaha, Nebraska, and his younger sister, Elsie, was sent to be with other relatives, but would end up with a foster family on a ranch in Idaho. John would not see his younger sister again for 45 years, but the rest of the family were reunited after his father remarried in 1921 to Minnie E. Jackson, a school teacher in Kansas City, Missouri.\nThe family settled in Kansas City, Kansas, where John would first go to Dunbar Elementary School and later Sumner High School. John became enamored with the sport of basketball while on a field trip from Dunbar Elementary to the new Northeast Junior High School in Kansas City, Kansas, where he saw his first official basketball court. He soon became an all-around athlete at Sumner High School and chose basketball as his favorite sport, although he failed to make the basketball team at Sumner. Instead, he lettered in gymnastics and was the basketball team manager.After high school, he first attended Kansas City Kansas Junior College where he finally made the basketball team. The team went undefeated, although John only played sparingly. After one year at Kansas City Kansas Junior College he then transferred to the University of Kansas, where he learned the intricacies of basketball from the sport's inventor, Dr. James Naismith, who was the athletic director at the school. However, McLendon was not permitted to actually play college basketball, as the KU varsity team was segregated and would not suit up its first black player until 1951.\n\nCareer\nHe went on to become a successful high school and college coach, at schools such as North Carolina College for Negroes (now North Carolina Central University), Hampton Institute (now University), Tennessee A&I (now Tennessee State University), Kentucky State College (now University) and Cleveland State University. In his early years, his teams were restricted to playing only against other all-black teams.  However, while coaching at North Carolina College for Negroes, McLendon participated in \"The Secret Game\", a match against a team from Duke University, which was the first collegiate basketball contest where blacks and whites competed on the same floor.  He led the Eagles to eight CIAA Championships (1941, 1943–44, 1946–47, 1949–50, 1952). McLendon's teams were credited with increasing the pace of the game of basketball from the slow tempo of its early years to the faster tempo that prevails today.  At Cleveland State, he was the first African American head coach of a predominantly white university.He was a three-time winner of the NAIA Coach of the Year award and won three consecutive NAIA championships at Tennessee State, making him the first college basketball coach ever to have won three consecutive national titles.McLendon also coached professionally on two occasions. Cleveland Pipers General Manager Mike Cleary hired him in 1962 to be the head coach of the American Basketball League team which was owned by George Steinbrenner. McLendon's hiring made history, as he became the first African American head coach in professional sports. In his, and the Pipers', only season in the ABL, partway through the season he quit or was fired (sources differ). McLendon was replaced as coach by Bill Sharman of the recently defunct Los Angeles Jets of the ABL; under Sharman, the team completed the season and won the league championship. McLendon went on to coach the American Basketball Association's Denver Rockets (which later became the Denver Nuggets of the NBA) in 1969, although he was fired after the team started the season 9-19.  Despite the fact that he was only 54 when dismissed, this was the last college or professional head coaching job in his career.\nMcLendon's contributions to the game of basketball include the invention of the fast break, full-court press and four corners offense.\n\nRecognition\nLike Naismith, McLendon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979 as a \"contributor\". He was, however, selected in 2007 for the second entering class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame for his coaching achievements. He was also inducted into the Cleveland State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007, where his wife Joanna accepted the award on his behalf.\nOn April 4, 2016, McLendon was announced as an inductee of the Naismith Hall again, this time as a coach. He was formally inducted in this role on September 9 of that year.A biography of John B. McLendon, Breaking Through: John B. McLendon, Basketball Legend and Civil Rights Pioneer, by Milton S. Katz, was published in 2007.  McLendon's coaching legacy is also chronicled in the documentary Black Magic, which originally aired as a two-part series on ESPN in March 2008.The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics sponsors the John McLendon Minority Scholarship Foundation, which offers postgraduate scholarships to minority students studying athletics administration.  The foundation was formed under the directorship of Mike Cleary, who hired McLendon as head coach of the Cleveland Pipers in 1962 as the first African American head coach in professional sports.\nBeginning in 2016, a first-round game in the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament involving a HBCU team would be known as the Coach John Mclendon Classic. The tradition continued through the tournament's end in 2019. Eracism then took ownership of the event and relaunched it in 2021. It has been held annually ever since.\nHe was the 2021 recipient of the NCAA Theodore Roosevelt Award.\n\nHead coaching record\nNotes and references\nExternal links\nJohn McLendon at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nPassage 9:\nGuy Lewis\nGuy Vernon Lewis II (March 19, 1922 – November 26, 2015) was an American basketball player and coach.  He served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Houston from 1956 to 1986.  Lewis led his Houston Cougars to five appearances in the Final Four of the NCAA tournament, in 1967, 1968, 1982, 1983, and 1984. His 1980s teams, nicknamed Phi Slama Jama for their slam dunks, were runners-up  for the national championship in back-to-back seasons in 1983 and 1984. He was inducted into National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nCoaching career\nBorn in Arp, Texas, Lewis was on the basketball and football teams of Arp High School. After serving in World War II, Lewis enrolled at the University of Houston on the GI Bill. He played center and forward on Houston's first varsity basketball team, graduating in 1947. In 1953, he returned to UH as an assistant coach, succeeding Alden Pasche as head coach in 1956. As a coach, he was known for championing the once-outlawed dunk, which he characterized as a \"high percentage shot,\" and for clutching a brightly colored red-and-white polka dot towel on the bench during games.  Lewis was a major force in the racial integration of college athletics in the South during the 1960s, being one of the first major college coaches in the region to actively recruit African American athletes.  In 1964, his recruitment of the program's first African-American players, Elvin Hayes and Don Chaney, ushered in an era of tremendous success in Cougar basketball.  The dominant play of Hayes led the Cougars to two Final Fours during the 1960s and sent shock waves through Southern colleges that realized that they would have to begin recruiting black players if they wanted to compete with integrated teams.\nLewis led the Houston Cougars program to 27 straight winning seasons, 14 seasons with 20 or more wins, and 14 trips to the NCAA tournament. His Houston teams advanced to the Final Four on five occasions (1967, 1968, 1982, 1983, 1984) and twice advanced to the national championship game (1983, 1984). Standout players Lewis coached during his tenure at Houston included Hayes, Chaney, Akeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Otis Birdsong, Dwight Jones, Louis Dunbar, and Ken Spain.\nLewis's Houston teams played a key role in two watershed events that helped to popularize college basketball as a spectator sport. In January 1968, his underdog Cougars, led by Hayes, upset John Wooden's undefeated and top-ranked UCLA Bruins 71–69 in front of 52,693 fans at the Houston Astrodome.  This was the first nationally televised regular season college basketball game and subsequently became known as the \"Game of the Century.\"  It marked a turning point in the emerging popularity of college basketball.  In the early 1980s, Lewis's Phi Slama Jama teams at UH gained notoriety for their fast-breaking, \"above the rim\" style of play as well as their overall success.  At the height of Phi Slama Jama's notoriety, they advanced all the way to the national championship game in 1983 and 1984, along the way notching consecutive 30-win seasons. In the first of those appearances, in 1983, the Cougars suffered a dramatic, last-second loss to underdog North Carolina State in the 1983 NCAA Final that became an iconic moment in the history of the sport, one that solidified the NCAA basketball tournament in the cultural firmament as March Madness.  Lewis's insistence that his teams play an acrobatic, up-tempo brand of basketball that emphasized dunking brought this style of play to the fore and helped popularize it amongst younger players.\nThe Cougars also lost in the 1984 NCAA Final to the Georgetown Hoyas led by Patrick Ewing.  Lewis retired from coaching in 1986 at number 20 in all-time NCAA Division I victories, his 592–279 record giving him a .680 career winning percentage.  In 1995, the University of Houston named the playing surface at Hofheinz Pavillion (now the Fertitta Center) \"Guy V. Lewis Court\" in Lewis' honor.\n\nLater life and honors\nLewis was hospitalized for a stroke on February 27, 2002. He later recovered, but experienced some lasting effects from the episode. From 1959 until his death, Lewis resided in the University Oaks subdivision adjacent to the University of Houston. Lewis was the honoree at the 2012 Houston Aphasia Recovery Center luncheon benefit.Lewis died on the morning of November 26, 2015 at a retirement facility in Kyle, Texas, at the age of 93.\n\nHead coaching record\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Final Four appearances by coach\nPassage 10:\nHarry Gallatin\nHarry Junior \"The Horse\" Gallatin (April 26, 1927 – October 7, 2015) was an American professional basketball player and coach. Gallatin played nine seasons for the New York Knicks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1948 to 1957, as well as one season with the Detroit Pistons in the 1957–58 season. Gallatin led the NBA in rebounding and was named to the All-NBA First Team in 1954. The following year, he was named to the All-NBA Second Team. For his career, Gallatin played in seven NBA All-Star Games. A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, he is also a member of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, the SIU Edwardsville Athletics Hall of Fame, the Truman State University Athletics Hall of Fame, the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, two Illinois Basketball Halls of Fame, the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) Hall of Fame, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Hall of Fame, and the SIU Salukis Hall of Fame.\n\nHigh school career\nGrowing up in Roxana, Illinois, Gallatin had taken interest in all sports and has been quoted as saying, \"Competition has always been my cup of tea.\" His drive for competition was amplified during his first year in high school as he attended Wood River High School from 1940–41. Since Roxana and some other outlying communities like Bethalto had no high school of their own at the time, all the athletes in the area attended Wood River, thus increasing the level of competition among them for varsity positions. The following year, however, Roxana got its own high school. He graduated from Roxana High School in 1944, and was granted a basketball scholarship by Northeast Missouri State Teachers' College (now known as Truman State University). But after graduating from Roxana High School, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served until the end of World War II.\n\nCollege career\nAt Northeast Missouri, he averaged 12.9 points per game and lead his team to a 59–4 record and two appearances in the NAIA tournament. He earned his bachelor's degree from Northeast Missouri in only two years and would later receive his master's degree in physical education from the University of Iowa in 1954.\n\nProfessional career\nThe New York Knicks selected Gallatin in the 1948 BAA draft. \"It was a dream come true. I really didn't know what to expect; it was my first plane ride, from St. Louis to New York. Here I am a boy from Wood River, a country boy, and going to the Big Apple\", Gallatin explained. \"All I knew was that I loved to play basketball, and the Knicks had taken me with their number one choice. So I knew that they thought I had the kind of abilities they were looking for.\"In his third year in the NBA, Gallatin was selected for the first NBA All-Star Game in 1951, and from 1951 to 1957 was chosen for seven consecutive NBA All-Star games. It was in the NBA where he earned the nickname \"The Horse\". He played his entire career as an undersized center at 6'6\" and 215 lbs., but made up for it with tremendous physical strength. He played nine seasons for the New York Knicks, from 1948 to 1957. His best statistical year was in 1954, when he led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 15.3 rebounds per game. That same year, he was also named to the All-NBA First Team. His most dominating single-game performance was on the last regular season game of the 1952–53 season. That night, against the Fort Wayne Pistons, Gallatin pulled down 33 rebounds, a Knicks record which still stands today. In the six seasons he played when rebounds were recorded, he was among the leaders in the league in rebounds per game. For his career, he averaged 11.9 rebounds per game. Gallatin still holds the Knick team record of consecutive games played, with 610.After nine strong years with the Knicks, Gallatin was traded to the Detroit Pistons with Richard Atha and Nathaniel Clifton for Mel Hutchins and Charlie Tyra on April 3, 1957. He played only one season for the Pistons before retiring as one of the most dominating post players of his era.\n\nBaseball career\nIn addition to basketball, Gallatin also played baseball. He played two seasons of varsity baseball at Northeast Missouri. During the off-seasons between his first three seasons in the NBA, he played for the Class B Decatur, Illinois Cubs/Commodores of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, which was an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in 1949 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1950. He appeared in 46 games in those two seasons, winning 7, losing 9 and batting .227 in 75 at-bats. After the 1950 baseball season, however, he made basketball his only professional sport.\n\nPost-playing life\nAfter his retirement from playing in 1958, Gallatin became the head coach of the Southern Illinois University Salukis. In four seasons there, he led his teams to a 69–35 record and post-season tournament appearances every year. The 1961–62 team made it to the NCAA Small College (now Division II) Tournament semifinals before barely losing to eventual champion Mount St. Mary's College 58–57, then took third place by beating Nebraska Wesleyan University 98–81.He returned to the NBA in 1962 as coach of the St. Louis Hawks. In his first season, he led the Hawks to the division finals and was named NBA Coach of the Year. The 1963–64 season saw the Hawks again advance to the division finals. The eighth coach since the franchise's arrival in St. Louis in 1955, he was fired on December 28, 1964 despite the Hawks being in second place in the NBA Western Division. He was replaced by Richie Guerin. He returned to New York to coach the Knicks which were developing into a championship team, but the pieces were not yet all in place and Gallatin left the Knicks and the NBA midway through the 1965–66 season.He became Assistant Dean of Students at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1966, then the first athletic director and basketball coach in 1967. He remained at SIUE until his retirement in 1992, where he also taught in the physical education department and was the SIUE Cougars's men's golf coach for 24 years, leading that team to NCAA Division II championships 19 times and finishing in the top 10 six times.After his retirement from coaching, Gallatin remained active and enthusiastic, while continuing to live in  Edwardsville, Illinois. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991, and was also named to nine other Halls of Fame. In 2011, the New York Knicks honored him in their second \"Legends Night Awards\" along with other former Knicks stars Dick Barnett, Earl Monroe, Mark Jackson, John Starks and Allan Houston, and in May 2015, the Knicks added him to Madison Square Garden's Walk of Fame.\n\nDeath\nHarry Gallatin died on October 7, 2015 following surgery.  He was survived by Beverly Hull Gallatin, his wife since 1949; their sons, Steve, Jim, and Bill; his sister, Eileen Palmer; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.\n\nLegacy\nOn June 24, 2013, Gallatin took part as the SIUE athletics department broke ground for a new golf training facility. Following approval by the SIU Board of Trustees, it was officially named the Harry Gallatin Golf Training Facility. The facility, initially proposed as an on-campus venue, was moved when Sunset Hills Country Club (SHCC) in Edwardsville.offered to partner in the endeavor. The approximately $500,000, 1,840-square-foot facility was opened to SIUE students and SHCC members on December 10, 2019.\n\nBAA/NBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlayoffs\nHead coaching record\nNBA\nCollege\nSee also\nList of National Basketball Association annual rebounding leaders", "answers": ["Wayman Tisdale"], "length": 7104, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e3569c47223f23fe2d38adc0478c64f81cdce476664d690c"}
{"input": "What is the weight limit of the weight class that Takeyasu Hirono fights in?", "context": "Passage 1:\nWeight class (boxing)\nIn boxing, a weight class is a measurement  weight range for boxers.  The lower limit of a weight class is equal to the upper weight limit of the class below it. The top class, with no upper limit, is called heavyweight in professional boxing and super heavyweight in amateur boxing. A boxing match is usually scheduled for a fixed weight class, and each boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. Although professional boxers may fight above their weight class, an amateur boxer's weight must not fall below the lower limit. A nonstandard weight limit is called a catchweight.\n\nWeigh-in\nA boxer who is over the weight limit may strip naked to make the weight if the excess is minimal; otherwise, in a professional bout, one can try again later, typically after losing weight in the interim through dehydration by vigorous exercise in a steam room.  If the excess weight is too great, the effort expended trying to \"make weight\" will make the boxer unfit for the fight itself.  In such cases the fight may be cancelled with the over-weight boxer sanctioned or the fight may proceed as a catchweight non-title fight.\nThe International Boxing Federation (IBF) has a unique weigh-in policy in title fights. In addition to making the weight at the official weigh-in the day before the fight, the boxers are required to submit to a weight check on the morning of the fight. During this later weigh-in, the fighter must weigh no more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) above the weight limit for the fight. If a boxer skips the morning weigh-in, or fails to make weight at that time, the fight can still proceed, but the IBF title will not be at stake. In heavyweight title fights, the second weigh-in is still mandatory, but since there is no upper weight limit in that class, a boxer can only be sanctioned for failing to submit to the weigh-in.An amateur boxer must make the weight at the initial weigh-in; there is no opportunity to try again later. Boxers who fail to make their projected weights are eliminated from their bouts. If the boxer fails a drug test, they are eliminated from the bout as well. There is a \"general weigh-in\" before the start of the tournament and a \"daily weigh-in\" on the morning of each of a fighter's bouts. At the general weigh-in, the fighter must be between the weight class's upper and lower limits; at the daily weigh-in only the upper limit is enforced. A fighter outside the limit at the initial weigh-in may be allowed to fight in a different class if there is space in the tournament. At major events such as boxing at the Olympics, there is a limit of one boxer per country per weight class.\n\nCulture\nA boxer may fight different bouts at different weight classes. The trend for professionals is to move up to a higher class as they age, with muscle mass and bone density increasing over time. Winning titles at multiple weight classes to become a \"multiple champion\" is considered a major achievement.  In amateur boxing, bouts are much shorter and much more frequent, and boxers fight at their \"natural\" weight.\nOne boxer is said to be better \"pound for pound\" than another if he is considered superior with due regard for their difference in weight. Theoretical comparisons of the merits of boxers in different weight classes are a popular topic for boxing fans, with a similar speculative appeal to comparing sports figures from different eras; in both cases, the competitors could never face each other in reality.\n\nHistory\nIn the early nineteenth century, there were no standard weight classes. In 1823, the Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue said the limit for a \"light weight\" was 12 stone (168 lb, 76.2 kg) while Sportsman's Slang the same year gave 11 stone (154 lb, 69.9 kg) as the limit.Size mismatches were dangerous for the smaller boxer and unsatisfying for the spectators. National and world titles could only become recognised if standard weight classes were agreed upon. Important sets of weight classes were those specified in 1909 by the National Sporting Club of London, and those contained in the 1920 Walker Law which established the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC).After the split in the 1960s between the WBC and the WBA, the divisions were narrowed, creating more champions simultaneously, and making it easier for fighters to move between different weight divisions. Among the professional bodies, the names of the new divisions are not standardized between different sanctioning bodies, although the cutoff weights are.  These weights are specified in pounds, reflecting the historic dominance of Britain (and, later, the United States) in the sport.\n\nGlamour divisions\nBoxing has its own \"Original Eight\" weight divisions, also known as the \"traditional\", \"classic\", or \"glamour\" divisions. These divisions are the most prominent and widely recognized weight divisions in boxing. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in the greatest number of the glamour divisions, winning championships in the flyweight, featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight divisions.\n\nTweener divisions\nThe newcomer weight divisions or \"tweener divisions\", mostly recognized with either a \"super\", \"light\" or \"junior\" in front of their names, took many years to be fully recognized as legitimate weight divisions in boxing. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in four of these divisions; super bantamweight, super featherweight, light welterweight and light middleweight.\n\nCatchweights\nA nonstandard weight limit is called a catchweight.  A catchweight may be agreed to for an individual bout—sometimes even for a championship bout—but championships are awarded only at the standard weight classes. For example, when Manny Pacquiao fought Antonio Margarito at a catch-weight of 150 pounds, the World Boxing Council sanctioned this as a title fight for jr. middleweight, whose limit is 154 pounds.\n\nProfessional boxing\nThis table gives names and limits recognised by the four widely regarded sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO), the label used in Boxrec.com's data, and by the magazines The Ring and Boxing News.\nBridgerweight has been recognised by the WBC since November 2020, but is not currently recognised by any other bodies.The date is that since which a continuous world title has been recognised by a major sanctioning body; some classes had earlier champions recognised intermittently or by minor bodies. One current weight class with only minor recognition is \"super cruiserweight\"; widely used as an informal descriptor, it is a formal weight class of the lightly regarded International Boxing Association at a limit of 210 lb; the IBA's cruiserweight limit is 190 lb.\n\nAmateur boxing\nWhen the (amateur) International Boxing Association (AIBA) was founded in 1946 to govern amateur boxing, it metricated the weight class limits by rounding them to the nearest kilogram. Subsequent alterations as outlined in the boxing at the Summer Olympics article; these have introduced further discrepancies between amateur and professional class limits and names.  The lower weight classes are to be adjusted in September 2010, to establish an absolute minimum weight for adult boxers.Amateur weight classes also specify the minimum weight (which the same as the maximum weight of the next highest class). For safety reasons, fighters cannot fight at a higher weight. This also meant that even the heaviest weight class has a limit, albeit a lower bound.  The lower limit for \"heavyweight\" was established in 1948 at 81 kg. When a new limit of 91+ kg was established in 1984, the name \"heavyweight\" was kept by the 81+ kg class, and the 91+ kg class was named \"super heavyweight\", a name not currently used in professional boxing.\nClasses are as follows:\nAt the Olympics, each weight class is a separate single-elimination tournament awarding one gold, one silver and two bronze medals in each weight class. The event format is geared so that the finals of all represented weight classes are held over the last two days of the competition, entrants that fail to win on the penultimate day being the Bronze medal recipients with the finals deciding Gold and Silver on the final day, all of the bouts are scheduled in ascending order of weight with the super heavyweight final last of all.\nEach weight class conducts preliminary and qualification bouts, for all represented classes where the number of entrants requires multiple match-ups before the finals, with the match-ups of the lightest weight class requiring such fighting first and continuing with each subsequent higher weight class as required, further, second, third and fourth round match-ups may be required to complete the schedule using the same weight class progression to ultimately reach the final\n\nSee also\nBrazilian jiu-jitsu weight classes\nKickboxing weight classes\nMixed martial arts weight classes\nTaekwondo weight classes\nProfessional wrestling weight classes\nWrestling weight classes\nPassage 2:\nJalan Pogoh\nJalan Pogoh (Johor state route J41) is a main state road in Johor, connecting Segamat and Bukit Kepong. It is the main road of the Mukim Pogoh in Segamat. The length of this road is 20 kilometres (12 mi). Jalan Pogoh had been only paved halfway from Segamat to Kampung Pogoh (10 kilometres (6.2 mi)). At the end of the 1990s, the entire road was fully paved. During the pavement works for the remaining stretch, works included raising the road level because of the flood-prone areas along the stretch and also replacing all wooden bridges along the road with concrete bridges, thus abolishing the former weight limit of the road, previously 8 tonnes.\n\nList of junctions\nPassage 3:\nFlyweight (MMA)\nFlyweight is a weight class in combat sports.\n\nBoxing\nFlyweight is a class in boxing which includes fighters weighing above 49 kg (108 lb) and up to 51 kg (112 lb).\n\nProfessional boxing\nThe flyweight division was the last of boxing's eight traditional weight classes to be established. Before 1909, anyone below featherweight was considered a bantamweight, regardless of how small the boxer. In 1911, the organization that eventually became the British Boxing Board of Control held a match that crowned Sid Smith as the first flyweight champion of the world. Jimmy Wilde, who reigned from 1916 to 1923, was the first fighter recognized both in Britain and the United States as a flyweight champion.Other notable flyweights include Victor Perez, Pancho Villa, Walter McGowan, Pascual Pérez, Pone Kingpetch, Fighting Harada, Masao Ohba, Chartchai Chionoi, Efren Torres, Erbito Salavarria, Miguel Canto, Dave McAuley, Charlie Magri, Gabriel Bernal, Santos Laciar, Sot Chitalada, Yong-Kang Kim, Yuri Arbachakov, Danny Romero, Mark \"Too Sharp\" Johnson, Manny Pacquiao, Jorge Arce, Vic Darchinyan, Nonito Donaire, Pongsaklek Wonjongkam, Amnat Ruenroeng, Román González, McWilliams Arroyo, Donnie Nietes, Nicola Adams.\n\nCurrent world champions\nCurrent The Ring world rankings\nAs of June 20, 2023.Keys:\n\n C  Current The Ring world champion\n\nLongest reigning world flyweight champions\nBelow is a list of longest reigning flyweight champions in boxing measured by the individual's longest reign.

The championship was originally created in 1946 by the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). As with all professional wrestling championships, matches for the NWA World Welterweight Championship were not won or lost competitively but by a pre-planned ending to a match, with the outcome determined by the CMLL bookers and match makers. CMLL controlled the championship from 1946 until 1996 and again from 2007 until 2010. From 1996 until 2007 the championship was promoted mainly in Japan, initially as one of eight championships that made up the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) J-Crown Championship. After the J-Crown was discontinued the title remained in Japan promoted by the Toryumon federation until 2007 when it returned to Mexico and CMLL. CMLL was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) until the late 1980s but chose to keep the championship and the NWA prefix after leaving the NWA. \nThe championship predates the creation of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948 and was initially called the World Welterweight Championship, promoted by Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). When EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance in 1952, the NWA prefix was added. In the late 1980s, EMLL withdrew from the NWA and changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). CMLL retained ownership of three NWA-branded championships which originated in the promotion, the other two being the NWA World Middleweight Championship and the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. All continued to be billed as \"Campeonatos de NWA\" (NWA Championships). On occasion, a promotion declared the championship vacant, which meant there was no champion at that point in time. This was either due to a storyline or real-life issues such as a champion suffering an injury and being unable to defend the championship, or leaving the company. All title matches held in Mexico took place under two out of three falls rules.}} The official definition of the welterweight weight limit in Mexico is 70 kg (150 lb) to 78 kg (172 lb), but promotions have ignored the weight limit at times and crowned champions both heavier and lighter than the rules defined.El Santo became the first NWA World Welterweight Champion by winning an eight-man tournament when he defeated Pete Pancoff in the finals. In 1992, the then-champion Misterioso left CMLL to join the newly formed Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), vacating the championship as a result. CMLL had created the CMLL World Welterweight Championship in February 1992 as their top welterweight championship, and thus did not crown a new NWA championship for three years. Negro Casas defeated El Hijo del Santo in a tournament final as CMLL brought the championship back in the winter of 1995. The following August Casas was one of eight champions to compete in an NJPW-promoted tournament to unify the championships into the J-Crown championship. Casas lost in the first round to Shinjiro Ohtani, marking the first time the championship had changed hands outside Mexico. The championship would switch hands in each round of the tournament as Último Dragón won it the next night and then Great Sasuke won it as he won the tournament. In 1996 and 1997 the championship was defended as part of the J-Crown until it was broken up into the original individual championships. After this it was once again inactive until early 1999 when Dragon Kid became the first Toryumon-promoted champion. From 1999 until 2007 the championship was promoted exclusively by Toryumon, mainly in Japan and occasionally by Torymon's Mexican branch. On November 27, 2007, CMLL wrestler La Sombra won the title from Hajime Ohara on a Toryumon Mexico show, bringing the championship back under the control of CMLL.In March 2010, Blue Demon Jr., the president of NWA Mexico, demanded that CMLL (a non-member of the NWA) cease promoting the NWA-branded championships, declaring that all three championships had been vacated as far as the NWA was concerned. NWA Mexico had already tried to reclaim CMLL's three NWA-branded titles on a previous occasion. CMLL ignored both requests completely, with Mephisto, the NWA Welterweight Champion, responding that \"the championships belong to CMLL\", thus the NWA could not vacate them. On August 12, 2010, CMLL unveiled the new NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship to replace the original championship, which it conceded to NWA Mexico. The CMLL made the last CMLL-promoted NWA World Welterweight champion, Averno, the first NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion. On June 22, 2011, Cassandro became the first NWA Mexico-promoted Welterweight Champion when he defeated Dr. Cerebro on a show in London, England.Akantus was the most recent NWA World Welterweight champion, having defeated Impostor Jr. to win the title on April 24, 2016, marking the only known championship match in his reign. Akantus was the 63rd overall champion and the 47th person to hold the Championship. Karloff Lagarde and Américo Rocca are tied for the most title reigns, a total of three, while Lagarde holds the record for the longest individual title reign, 2,742 days from 1958 until 1965. Two men have held the title for just one day: Shinjiro Otani and Último Dragón.\n\nTitle history\nReigns by combined length\nSee also\nList of National Wrestling Alliance championships\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 5:\nLineal championship\nIn combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called \"the man who beat the man\".A break in the direct continuity of a lineal championship can occur when a reigning champion retires or moves to another weight class. Opinions conflict as to what to do when such a breach of continuity occurs. Some require that top \"contenders for the title\" must fight to become the next lineal champion, while others require a new undisputed champion before the lineage can continue. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed-upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage. There is agreement to discount the sanctioning bodies (such as the WBA, WBC, IBF, or WBO) stripping a title.\n\nHistory\nBoxing\nThe concept of a lineal champion was developed by boxing fans dissatisfied by the tendency of each of the various sanctioning bodies (WBC, WBA, IBF, WBO, etc.) to recognize different champions, and in particular to strip a champion of his title for refusing to fight its top-ranked contender. Prior to the 1970s, this rarely happened; the National Boxing Association (NBA) and the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) sometimes recognized different champions, but there was usually only a short interval before one champion defeated the other. In that era, a title vacancy was generally filled by having a single-elimination tournament box-off between two or more top-ranked contenders. The lineal championship is intended as a return to that era.\nEarly boxing champions at various weight divisions were established by acclamation between 1880 and 1920. Once a consensus champion had been awarded the title, the championship could usually be taken only by beating the reigning holder, establishing a lineal championship.\nSeveral top boxers have specified holding the lineal championship as a personal accomplishment (e.g. Lennox Lewis) or goal (e.g., Nate Campbell). Many boxing experts view the lineal championship as a prestigious status which trumps the world titles being issued by the sanctioning bodies (e.g. Steve Farhood).\n\nMixed martial arts\nIn mixed martial arts (MMA), the lineal championship is of particular relevance because until the mid-2000s, the top-ranked fighters were spread out among a number of mixed martial arts promotions across the globe. This included Japanese promotions such as Pride Fighting Championships, Pancrase, and Dream, as well as US-based promotions such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), World Extreme Cage Fighting (WEC), and Strikeforce. The UFC eventually purchased most of the major promotions and, as a result, all of the lineal champions are currently signed with the promotion. Former UFC champion Jon Jones was suspended and stripped of the title for reasons resulting from an alleged hit-and-run felony charge. Daniel Cormier, whom Jones had just defeated, subsequently won the vacant UFC title.\n\nIssues\nAn issue in the implementation of a lineal championship is what to do if the lineal champion retires, dies, or moves to a different weight class. Different ways of resolving this vacancy mean the lineal championship may be subject to dispute. Since the modern lineal championship is a notional title tracked by fans, there is no money or organization to arrange a box-off to fill a vacant title, and there may not be consensus on who the top contenders are – this is true both for boxing and MMA. One example given by Cliff Rold, writing for Cyber Boxing Zone, is the light heavyweight title, considered vacant from the time Michael Spinks moved up to heavyweight in 1985 until 1996. While Rold considers WBA titlist Virgil Hill's defeat of IBF titlist Henry Maske in 1996 as the beginning of the next line of succession, others trace the title through Roy Jones Jr. after he had unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles in 1999. The Ring presented Jones with its inaugural light heavyweight belt in 2002 even though then WBO titlist Dariusz Michalczewski had defeated Hill for the WBA and IBF titles in 1997 and was stripped of them.Another criticism of the lineal championship is that a fighter may defend it against inferior opponents. For example, George Foreman was considered lineal champion from 1994 until 1997, when Shannon Briggs beat him. After the WBA and IBF stripped him of their titles in 1995, Foreman fought only two, low-ranked opponents before Briggs. The lineal champion is not necessarily the boxer viewed as the best. Cyber Boxing Zone and BoxingScene considered Zsolt Erdei the lineal light-heavyweight champion from his 2004 defeat of Julio César González until 2009 when he vacated his title and moved up to cruiserweight. As he had not fought the highest-ranked opponents in the interim, Cliff Rold conceded, \"while the concept of a champion needing to lose a title in the ring is solid, the practice is sometimes highly flawed\".In mixed martial arts, most controversy centers on the proper method for determining the first lineal MMA champion within each weight class. Early fights did not follow the currently agreed upon weight classes determined by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, a rule set that was not finalized until the year 2000. For example: Some consider Mark Coleman's victory in 1997, when he became the first UFC Heavyweight champion, to be the beginning of the Heavyweight lineage. Others argue that Royce Gracie's victory at UFC 1 in 1993 is the true heavyweight starting point due to the Open-weight nature of the tournament. In this case, however, the lineal titles converge and unify with the current UFC Heavyweight title, so the champion remains the same regardless of which lineage one chooses to follow.\n\nInterpretations\nThe Ring\nThe boxing magazine The Ring has its own lineal championship. The original sequence was from its first publication in the 1920s until its hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When it started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion. CBZ commented in 2004, \"The Ring has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\". In 2007, The Ring was acquired by the owners of fight promoter Golden Boy Promotions, which has publicized The Ring's world championship when this is at stake in fights it promotes (such as Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones, Jr. in 2008). Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, The Ring allows fights between a #1 or #2 contender and a #3, #4, or #5 contender to fill a vacant title. This has prompted further doubts about its credibility.\n\nCyber Boxing Zone\nThe Cyber Boxing Zone (CBZ) website maintains lists of lineal champions, with input from boxing historian Tracy Callis of the International Boxing Research Organization. These were first published in 1994, and are retrospective to the introduction of Marquess of Queensberry Rules in 1885. The historical lists have sometimes been updated when new information about old fights comes to light. If its lineal champion at one weight class moves to another class, CBZ does not automatically vacate his title.\n\nBoxingScene\nBoxingScene.com disagrees with the lineages given by The Ring and by CBZ, especially in lower weight divisions with a higher rate of champions changing division. BoxingScene has traced its own most recent lineages, generally back to the 1990s.\n\nTransnational Boxing Rankings Board\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) was formed in October 2012 as a volunteer initiative to provide boxing with authoritative top-ten rankings, identify the singular world champion of every division by strict reasoning and common sense, and to insist on the sport's reform. Board membership includes fifty respected boxing journalists and record keepers from around the world who are uncompromised by sanctioning bodies and promoters. The board was formed to continue where The Ring \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of the editorial board headed by Nigel Collins.After the new editors of The Ring announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. These three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England. The board only awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet, and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" each weight classes.\n\nSports Illustrated\nSI.com published galleries of lineal heavyweight and middleweight champions.\n\nLineal Boxing Champion\nSince April 6, 2019, LinealBoxingChampion.com (LBC) has been producing monthly, non-computerized divisional rankings for women's professional boxing. Prior to this, no such impartial, independent rankings existed. The rankings are compiled by an international team of ten boxing experts, which includes site editor and member of the International Boxing Research Organization, Adam McMeeking (from the UK), International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame 2019 inductee, David Avila (from the US), Max Boxing journalist and former Boxing Monthly contributor, Anthony Cocks (from Australia) and Ring Magazine contributor, Yuriko Miyata (from Japan). In keeping with the tradition, the lineal champion status is awarded to the winner of a fight between the number one and number two ranked contenders. Currently LBC recognizes nine lineal champions in women's boxing: Franchon Crews Dezurn (super middleweight), Claressa Shields (middleweight and junior middleweight), Jessica McCaskill (welterweight), Chantelle Cameron (junior welterweight), Katie Taylor (lightweight), Marlen Esparza (flyweight) and Jessica Nery Plata (junior flyweight). Due to its limited number of competitors LBC does not recognize the light heavyweight division. LBC also keeps a record of the lineal champions in men's boxing, across all 17 weight classes, from the 1880s - present.\n\nRecords\nMuhammad Ali is the only three-time lineal heavyweight boxing champion. He beat Sonny Liston in 1964, George Foreman in 1974, and Leon Spinks in 1978.\nManny Pacquiao is the only fighter in boxing history who is credited with lineal championships in five different weight classes (flyweight, featherweight, super featherweight, light welterweight and welterweight) by Cyber Boxing Zone, TBRB and BoxingScene.com. This has been reported by ESPN, CNN Sports Illustrated, The Ring, Yahoo! Sports and many boxing websites. He is also the third fighter in boxing history to win lineal world titles in three of the original eight weight divisions of boxing also known as the \"glamour divisions\" (flyweight, featherweight, and welterweight), joining the exclusive group of Bob Fitzsimmons and Henry Armstrong. Additionally, Pacquiao has held three Ring titles in three different weight classes (featherweight, super featherweight, and light welterweight).\nPeter Aerts is the only five-time lineal heavyweight kickboxing champion. He beat Patrick Smith in 1994, Andy Hug in 1997, Ernesto Hoost in 1998, Andy Hug in 1998, and Semmy Schilt in 2010.\nFedor Emelianenko, heavyweight mixed martial artist, held the lineal title for longer than any fighter in history. Fedor won the title from Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira in 2003 and defended it 18 times before eventually losing it to Fabricio Werdum in 2010.\nClaressa Shields and Jessica McCaskill are the only women to be recognized as two-weight lineal champions.\n\nSee also\nList of current world boxing champions\nPassage 6:\nProfessional wrestling weight classes\nIn professional wrestling, a weight class is a standardized weight range for the wrestlers. The top class in almost every promotion is heavyweight, but super heavyweights exist. Weight class matches in modern-day American professional wrestling are rare, but weight class championships still exist. However, Japanese professional wrestling, Mexican wrestling and traditional British wrestling use the weight classes more seriously.\n\nAustralia\nAustralian professional wrestling championships determined by weight class\nUnited States\nWWE, the largest professional wrestling promotion both nationally and internationally, has a reserved championship exclusively for wrestlers under the \"Cruiserweight\" category. Historically, WWE has had a number of championships that were only competed by lighter wrestlers such as the WWE Light Heavyweight Championship which became defunct in 2001. Conversely, WWE's so-called \"Heavyweight\" championships are not exclusive to heavyweight performers (240 lbs and above), as they have been won by comparatively smaller wrestlers such as Rey Mysterio and AJ Styles.\nWhile some of the smaller, independent wrestling promotions use weight classes, most of the larger promotions do not. Even if weight classes are used, they are usually not enforced due to the scripted nature of professional wrestling. In March 2013, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) imposed a 230 lb (104 kg) weight limit for wrestlers competing in the X Division for the TNA X Division Championship. In October 2013, however, TNA wrestler Samoa Joe, billed at 280 lb (127 kg), competed in an X Division Championship bout at TNA's Bound for Glory pay-per-view. Rather, it's more common for wrestling promotions to create a secondary championship to be competed for by smaller wrestlers. This championship, depending upon the promotion, is usually named Cruiserweight, Light Heavyweight or Junior Heavyweight. In some sports, most notably boxing since it has a large number of weight classes, these three names represent different separate weight classes. In professional wrestling the upper weight limit of these championships varied and are often not strictly enforced, depending upon the desires of company management, but usually ranged from a maximum of 215 pounds to 230 pounds depending upon the promotion. Throughout the years, practically all of such championships have been retired due to the wrestling promotion closing down or losing interest. The oldest of these championships still active in the United States is the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Created in 1945, the title is also recognized and frequently defended in other promotions outside of the United States.\n\nUS pro wrestling championships determined by weight class\nFormer NWA Weight Classes\nThe only active National Wrestling Alliance championship formerly in a specified weight division is the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (July 14, 1948 – present). Previously for >225 lbs., the championship is open to any weight class.\n\nMexico\nNo other professional wrestling promotions have made such an extensive use of weight classes as some located in Mexico. The lucha libre style is highly prominent in Mexico and makes extensive use of high spots and a fast, sometimes frantic, pace that suits physically smaller wrestlers. As a result, most of the top professional wrestling stars in Mexico are lighter than those in many American promotions. Whereas the few American promotions and governing bodies, such as the National Wrestling Alliance, have what would be termed a Cruiserweight, Light Heavyweight or Junior Heavyweight division, several Mexican wrestling promotions have multiple weight classes.\n\nMexican pro wrestling championships determined by weight class\nJapan\nAs with Mexico, non-heavyweight wrestling championships have risen to prominence in a number of Japanese wrestling promotions. Unlike Mexico, however, and more in line with most promotions in the United States, most Japanese wrestling companies generally have a secondary singles and, in some cases, a tag team championship geared to the Cruiserweight/Junior Heavyweight/Light Heavyweight weight division rather than multiple weight divisions.\n\nJapanese pro wrestling championships determined by weight class\nBJW Junior Heavyweight Championship: February 3, 1998 – 2002\nBJW Junior Heavyweight Championship: May 7, 2017 – present\nGHC Junior Heavyweight Championship: June 24, 2001 – present\nGHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship: July 16, 2003 – present\nIndependent World Junior Heavyweight Championship: October 28, 1993 – present\nTenryu Project International Junior Heavyweight Championship: March 26, 1995 – present\nInternational Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship: February 23, 1996 – present\nIWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship: February 6, 1986 – present\nIWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship: August 8, 1998 – present\nNWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship: December 23, 2003  – present\nZero1 NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship: September 20, 2011 – present\nOsaka Light Heavyweight Championship: July 31, 2022 – present\nTohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship: August 25, 2002 – present\nUWA World Light Heavyweight Championship: November 25, 1975 – present\nUWA World Middleweight Championship: November 26, 1975 – present\nAJPW World Junior Heavyweight Championship: July 31, 1986 – present\nZero1 International Junior Heavyweight Championship: June 29, 2002 – present\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe 1947 Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules set out seven weight divisions with maximum weight limits and called for champions to be crowned of each limit: Lightweight: 11st (154 lb or ~70 kg), Welterweight 11st 11 lb (165 lb or ~75 kg), Middleweight 12st 8 lb (176 lb or ~80 kg), Heavy Middleweight 13st 5 lb (187 lb or ~85 kg), Light Heavyweight 14st 2 lb (198 lb or ~90 kg), Mid-Heavyweight 14st 13 lb (209 lb or ~95 kg) and Heavyweight for all weights upwards of 15st (210 lb or ~95 kg).An earlier system of weight classes with different levels and more divisions existed under the 1930 All-In rules.

MMA titles, or championship belts, are given to those fighters deemed by a promotional organization to have met a certain standard of athletic accomplishment in a specific weight class (most often by means of a championship fight). Championship belts are fought for at each weight class under a promotion, with only one belt awarded per class. Each belt is usually contested every time the belt holder fights, and passed to the victor of that fight (see the List of UFC champions for a chronology of UFC title belts). A belt may be vacated when a fighter leaves a promotion, or is suspended. At such times an interim champion may be crowned, or the belt may be awarded to the winner of a fight between top contenders.\nThis list displays all title holders for the major, certified MMA promoting and sanctioning bodies. There is no clear industry definition within the MMA community to determine which organizations are considered major promoting bodies. Due to a lack of clear guidelines, this list is limited to those organizations that are either highly regarded (such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and Strikeforce), long standing (such as King of the Cage (KOTC) and Pancrase), or the dominant organizations of a country or region of the world (such as England's Ultimate Challenge MMA (UCMMA) and Canada's Maximum Fighting Championship (MFC)).\nBecause there is no international unified MMA weight class system in use, the Nevada State Athletic Commission's (NSAC) weight classes have been adopted for this article as they are most common across major promotions. Some organizations have created titles in weight classes outside the NSAC guidelines. Those titles have been and will be recognized as subdivisions under their common weight class.Though unofficial, Fight Matrix considered the first MMA lineal champions as follows:\nHeavyweight – Ken Shamrock beginning October 14, 1993 at Pancrase: Yes, We Are Hybrid Wrestlers 2\nLight heavyweight – Frank Shamrock beginning December 21, 1997 at UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan.\nMiddleweight – Kenji Kawaguchi beginning May 18, 1989 at Shooto: Shooto.\nWelterweight – Yasuto Sekishima beginning January 13, 1990 at Shooto: Shooto.\nLightweight – Yuichi Watanabe beginning January 13, 1990 at Shooto: Shooto.\nFeatherweight – Noboru Asahi beginning March 27, 1992 at Shooto: Shooto.\nBantamweight – Kazuhiro Sakamoto beginning October 19, 1989 at Shooto: Shooto.\nFlyweight – Kenji Ogusu beginning March 27, 1992 at Shooto: Shooto.Although the inaugural lineal champions are sometimes contested, especially at heavyweight; the consensus view, is that all the lineal titles have been unified with their respective weight class UFC titles.\nOrganizations are listed by a combination of their size (number of fighters, events per year, etc.) and their history (years in existence, title lineage, etc.).

The population was 10,683 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\nIn 1891, Minnie M. Cox was appointed postmaster of Indianola, becoming the first black female postmaster in the United States. Her rank was raised from fourth class to third class in 1900, and she was appointed to a full four-year term. Cox's position was one of the most respected and lucrative public posts in Indianola, as it served approximately 3,000 patrons and paid $1,100 annually, then a large sum. White resentment to Cox's prestigious position began to grow, and in 1902 some white residents in Indianola drew up a petition requesting Cox's resignation. James K. Vardaman, editor of The Greenwood Commonwealth and a white supremacist, began delivering speeches reproaching the people of Indianola for \"tolerating a negro wench as a postmaster.\"Racial tensions grew, and threats of physical harm led Cox to submit her resignation to take effect on January 1, 1903. The incident attracted national attention, and President Theodore Roosevelt refused to accept her resignation, feeling Cox had been wronged, and the authority of the federal government was being compromised. \"Roosevelt stood resolute. Unless Cox's detractors could prove a reason for her dismissal other than the color of her skin, she would remain the Indianola postmistress.\"Roosevelt closed Indianola's post office on January 2, 1903, and rerouted mail to Greenville; Cox continued to receive her salary. The same month, the United States Senate debated the Indianola postal event for four hours, and Cox left Indianola for her own safety and did not return. In February 1904, the post office was reopened but was demoted in rank from third class to fourth class.In July 1954, two months after the Supreme Court of the United States announced its unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional, the local plantation manager Robert B. Patterson met with a group of like-minded people in a private home in Indianola to form the White Citizens' Council.In May 2023, the police's shooting of Aderrien Murry, an 11-year-old, occurred in the city.\n\nGeography\nIndianola is 30 miles (48 km) west of Greenwood.\n\nDemographics\n2020 census\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, there were 9,646 people, 3,483 households, and 2,209 families residing in the city.\n\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 12,066 people, 3,899 households, and 2,982 families living in the city. The population density was 1,400.3 inhabitants per square mile (540.7/km2). There were 4,118 housing units at an average density of 477.9 per square mile (184.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 25.73% White, 73.38% African American, 0.01% Native American, 0.46% Asian American, 0.16% from other races, and 0.27% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.71% of the population.\n\n1990 census\nAs of the census of 1990, there were 11,809 people.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city government convinced a major retailer to build a distribution center near the intersection of the two highways. This development infused cash into the local economy and allowed semiskilled jobs to be established.In August 2011, Delta Pride, a catfish processing company, closed its plant in Indianola.\n\nCulture\nJ. Todd Moye, author of Let the People Decide: Black Freedom and White Resistance Movements in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 1945–1986, said that \"Life in Indianola still moves at a pace established by its distinguishing characteristic, the picturesque and languid Indian Bayou that winds through downtown.\"\n\nBlues\nIndianola is the birthplace of the blues musician Albert King. The blues harp player, Little Arthur Duncan, was born in Indianola in 1934.B.B. King grew up in Indianola as a child. He came to the blues festival named after him every year. King referenced the city with the title of his 1970 album Indianola Mississippi Seeds. The B.B.

The district operates two other 10-12 schools in the city, Indianola Career and Technical Center and Indianola Academic Achievement Academy.Indianola Academy, a private school and former segregation academy, is in Indianola. As of 2012 most white teenagers in Indianola attend Indianola Academy instead of the public high schools. Sarah Carr of The Atlantic explained that there are two explanations of why the private academies in Indianola and other towns still exist. One says that the public schools suffered from poor leadership and wrongdoing and that the private academies thrive because of the failings of the public schools, and the other says that the white leadership starved the public schools of resources after the academies were enacted, leading to the failings of the public schools.The Sunflower County Library operates the Henry M. Seymour Library in Indianola, which houses its administrative headquarters.\n\nHistory of education\nPrior to the school district merger, the Sunflower County School District had its headquarters in the Sunflower County Courthouse in Indianola. The district's educational services building is along U.S. Route 49 West in Indianola.As of 1996, 90 per cent of students in the Indianola School District were black. Most of the white students who attend Indianola public schools transfer to private schools by junior high school.\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Mississippi Department of Corrections operates a probation and parole office in the Courthouse Annex in Indianola.The United States Postal Service operates the Indianola Post Office. A mural, entitled White Gold in the Delta by WPA Section of Painting and Sculpture artist Beulah Bettersworth,  was installed in the post office in 1939. It depicted cotton harvesting scenes. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the U.S. Treasury Department. The original artist Walter Anderson was unable to complete the mural, and Bettersworth was selected. The mural was eventually destroyed. In 2008, the building  was named the Minnie Cox Post Office Building by an act of Congress.\n\nNotable people\nMr. Bo, an American electric blues guitarist, singer and songwriter.\nLittle Arthur Duncan, an American Chicago blues and electric blues harmonica player, singer, and songwriter.\nVera Chandler Foster, an American social worker.\nAlbert King, an American guitarist and singer who is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential blues guitarists of all time.\nB.B.

He built the first mill on the Whitewater River in 1797.  Bollinger was promised a large concession of land if he agreed to return to North Carolina and encouraged others to move to Missouri.  He then returned to North Carolina and brought back with him to Missouri 20 other Swiss and German immigrant families. The village was incorporated in 1900.\n\nGeography\nBurfordville is located on the Whitewater River, approximately eight miles southwest of Jackson, and is situated in the central part of Kinder Township.\n\nDemographics\nEducation\nIt is in the Jackson R-2 School District, which operates Jackson High School.\nPassage 4:\nPearce v. Ham\nPearce v. Ham, 113 U.S. 585 (1885), was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois regarding a bill filed by Charles I. Ham, the appellee, against Isaac N. Pearce and Andrew J. Kuykendall, the appellants.  Originally, one Joseph K. Frick contracted with the County Court of Johnson County in the State of Illinois, where he agreed to build, according to certain plans and specifications, a courthouse for said county at Vienna, the county seat, furnishing the material and completing it by the first Monday of September 1870, in consideration whereof the county court agreed to pay him $38,357 in the bonds of Johnson county, bearing ten percent interest, and due in six years. Frick never did any work on the building, and, owing to some misunderstanding with the county court, abandoned the contract and told Kuykendall that he might go on and build the courthouse if he chose to do so. On September 9, 1869, Kuykendall, as the agent and attorney in fact of Frick, assigned the contract of the latter to Ham and Pearce, Ham being the appellee, and Pearce one of the appellants, who had formed a partnership for the purpose of building the courthouse under said contract.Frick contracted with a county to construct a public building, and gave bond with Kuykendall as surety for the performance of the contract. Frick abandoned the contract. After procuring some modifications in it at request of Ham, Kuykendall assigned the contract to Pearce and Ham as partners with equal interests. Pearce and Ham agreed with Wickwire to construct the building. Ham then left the vicinity and engaged in other work elsewhere. Wickwire constructed the building. Kuykendall received the compensation under the original contract, paid Wickwire in full for the work done by him, and divided the profits with Pearce, claiming to be partner. Held that Ham could recover one-half of the profits from Pearce and from Kuykendall.\nThe object of the suit was to obtain an account of what was due to Ham by virtue of his said partnership and partnership enterprise, and that Pearce and Kuykendall might be decreed to pay him what might be found due on such accounting either in cash or Johnson county bonds.\nUpon final hearing upon the pleadings and evidence, the circuit court rendered a decree in favor of Ham against Kuykendall and Pearce for $5,001. The appeal of Kuykendall and Pearce brings that decree under review.\nThe high court found that The entire profits were appropriated by Pearce and Kuykendall, and they must account to Ham for his share and the Decree was affirmed.\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113\nPassage 5:\nKeats, Kansas\nKeats is an unincorporated community in Wildcat Township, Riley County, Kansas, United States.

Delmar is located six miles north of Natural Bridge, five miles south of Haleyville and 15 miles west of Double Springs, the county seat of what was once the \"Free State of Winston.\" Delmar has an elevation of 881 feet above sea level.\n\nOrigins of the name \"Delmar\"\nDelmar was originally called \"Frog Level.\" Presumably, the community was called Frog Level because of the swampy land that existed around the area at the time. In the 19th century, the citizens of Frog Level asked the U. S. Postal Service to open a post office in their community, since the nearest post office was in Ark (where Needmore, Alabama is currently located). Their request was denied because there was another Frog Level, Alabama (now Fayette, Alabama) and it already had a post office. In order to get a post office, the citizens of the Frog Level in Winston County had to change their town's name. Around 1887, the town began to be known as \"Delmar.\"\nThe exact origins of the name \"Delmar\" are unknown. A popular belief holds that a construction engineer with the railroad had a retired race horse by the name of \"Delmar\" or \"Del Mar\" (Spanish for \"from the sea\"). The horse was well known and loved by the community. When work on the railroad was completed around 1887, the community was renamed after the race horse.\nAfter notifying the U. S. Postal Service of its name change, Delmar's first post office was opened on September 1, 1887. Newton L. Powell was the first Postmaster of Delmar. The current post office building was erected in 1971, during the service of Postmaster Mrs. Martha Roberts Stewart.\nToday, the name of the town of Delmar is pronounced \"Delmer.\"\n\n19th century history\nAccording to legend, Delmar was not always the sleepy little community it is today. During the Coal Mining boom of the 19th century, there were several saloons in Delmar. Reportedly, Delmar was as lively as a town out of the Wild West, complete with drunken bar room brawls.\nByler Road was completed through Winston County in 1820. The historic highway, which ran through parts of what are today Delmar, Natural Bridge, Lynn, and Haleyville, connected the towns of northern Alabama with Tuscaloosa, which at the time was the capital of Alabama.\nWhen Alabama seceded from the Union in 1861, the people of Winston County did not want to fight their Northern or Southern brothers and wanted to remain neutral in the Civil War.  They decided that if a state could secede from the nation, then a county could secede from a state, and formed \"Free State of Winston.\" The people of neighboring counties called the people of Winston County Tories (Northern sympathizers).\nDuring the closing phases of the Civil War, Union troops made their way through Winston County on parts of what today are Winston County Road 17. Union troops set up their camps on the side of the road. Today, the road is better known as \"Yankee Trace Road.\"\nAfter the Civil War, a rail line was built from Sheffield, Alabama to Delmar by the Northern Alabama Railroad. After several years, a rail line was built from Parrish, Alabama to Delmar. This allowed rail service from Birmingham to the Shoals area. Today, Norfolk Southern Railway still runs cargo trains through Delmar.\n\n20th century and recent history\nIn the late 1960s, Marshall Durbin built its regional headquarters in Delmar.\nOn the night of April 3, 1974, Delmar was struck by a deadly tornado, as were communities in 12 other states and Canada during the 1974 Super Outbreak. Five people died in Delmar as a result of the tornado. Several homes and other structures were destroyed. Many homes that suffered little or no direct damage were without electricity, telephone, and water service for several days.\nIn January 1993, the people of Delmar decided to establish a volunteer fire department for their community. Currently, the department has 30 firefighters, two pumpers and two tankers and a brush truck. The current Fire Chief is Ray Cantrell.\nIn 1998, MSR Forest Products built a large plant in Delmar. Today, it employs over 100 people.\nOn January 27, 2000, Delmar received its first visit from a U.S. Senator when Richard Shelby visited the small Winston County town.\nLike so many small towns and communities in Alabama, Delmar has experienced times of economic boom and bust over the past 100 years. Today, Delmar is experiencing somewhat of an economic upturn with several businesses opening in and around Delmar. Tony BrakeField serves as the current Mayor of Delmar.\n\nNotable people\nPerhaps the most famous person from Delmar is Federal Judge Frank Johnson, Jr. Although Johnson was born in Delmar in 1918, he was reared and attended school in nearby Haleyville. He served in World War II, after which he began a law career. In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to a federal judgeship in Alabama. Almost immediately, Johnson was hearing important cases of the civil rights era. In a ruling involving the Montgomery bus boycott, he ruled that racial segregation of public transportation was illegal. Johnson often locked horns with Alabama Governor George Wallace over racial issues. In 1965, Johnson ordered Wallace to allow civil rights protesters to march from Selma to Montgomery. He was often targeted because of his rulings. In 1967, his mother's house was bombed. In July, 1999, at the age of 80, Johnson died at his Montgomery residence. He was buried in the Winston Memorial Cemetery near Haleyville.\n\nChurches\nThere are five churches in the Delmar area: Delmar Baptist Church, Union Grove Baptist Church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, Bethel #2 Baptist Church, and Botush Freewill Baptist Church.\n\nExternal links\nDelmar is covered by the Northwest Alabamian Newspaper.\nTown of Delmar's Facebook Page\nDelmar Volunteer Fire Department's Facebook Page\nHistory of Delmar Alabama by Tony BrakeField\nPassage 7:\nHolly Ridge, Mississippi\nHolly Ridge is an unincorporated community in Sunflower County, Mississippi.

The population was 5,056 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Mississippi County. It is a home to a local correctional facility.\n\nHistory\nCharleston is the largest town on the Missouri side near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Bird's Point (11 miles east on U.S. Route 60). Its history has been tied to traffic on the rivers.\nSettlement initially occurred on the north side, in what in 1805 was called Matthews Prairie.\nAfter purchasing 22.5 acres (91,000 m2) for $337, Joseph Moore laid out Charleston in 1837. Some say the community derives its name from nearby Charles Prairie, while others believe the name is a transfer from Charleston, South Carolina. In 1845, it was selected as the county seat.  A post office named Charleston has been in operation since 1847.The Battle of Charleston was fought on August 19, 1861. Killed in the battle were one Union soldier and thirteen Missouri State Guard soldiers.On September 1, 1861, Confederate General M. Jeff Thompson robbed the Union Bank of Charleston. Thompson, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags.The city was the epicenter of the October 31, 1895 5.9 Mfa earthquake on the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The quake damaged virtually every building in Charleston, creating sand volcanoes and cracking a pier on the Cairo Rail Bridge. In addition, chimneys toppled in St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Gadsden, Alabama; and Evansville, Indiana. The fate of specific buildings may also be traced by Sanborn maps that were produced of the town during this period. This was the largest quake since the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, which measured at 8.3 and was the biggest recorded quake in the Contiguous United States. One of the most visible signs of the quake is located south of Charleston at Henson Lake, which was greatly expanded by the quake.\nIn 1901, the county courthouse was built. It was designed by J.B. Legg, who designed numerous buildings throughout Missouri, including the Gasconade and St. Charles County courthouses. On February 10, 1997, the courthouse was damaged by fire and was subsequently torn down.\nThe Hearnes Site, Missouri Pacific Depot, Moore House, McCutchen Theatre, and Jacob Swank House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGeography\nCharleston is situated in northwestern Mississippi County, a few miles west of the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Bird's Point.

{"input": "Who had more career changes, Charles A. Agemian or Arshile Gorky?", "context": "Passage 1:\nRobert Coates (critic)\nRobert Myron Coates (April 6, 1897 – February 8, 1973) was an American novelist, short story writer and art critic. He published five novels; one classic historical work, The Outlaw Years (1930) which deals with the history of the land pirates of the Natchez Trace; a book of memoirs, The View from Here (1960), and two travel books, Beyond the Alps (1962) and South of Rome (1965). During his unusually varied career, Coates explored many different genres and styles of writing and produced three highly remarkable experimental novels, The Eater of Darkness (1926), Yesterday’s Burdens (1933) and The Bitter Season (1946). Highly original and experimental, these novels draw upon expressionism, Dadaism and surrealism. His last two novels—Wisteria Cottage (1948) and The Farther Shore (1955)—are examples of crime fiction. Simultaneously to working as a novelist, Coates maintained a life-long career at the New Yorker, whose staff he joined in 1927. The magazine printed more than a hundred of his short stories many of which were collected in three anthologies; All the Year Round (1943), The Hour after Westerly (1957) and The Man Just ahead of You (1964). Also, from 1937 to 1967, Coates was the New Yorker’s art critic and coined the term “abstract expressionism” in 1946 in reference to the works of Hans Hofmann, Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and others. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1958. Coates was married to sculptor Elsa Kirpal from 1927 to 1946. Their first and only child, Anthony Robertson Coates, was born on March 4, 1934. In 1946, they divorced and Coates married short story writer Astrid Meighan-Peters. He died of cancer of the throat in New York City on February 8, 1973.Anthony Boucher praised Coates as \"one of the most persuasive recorders of the unaccountable and disturbing moment,\" singling out his fantasy stories for their \"haunting tone of uncertainty and dislocation.\" Floyd C. Gale said that The Eater of Darkness \"has been called the first surrealist novel in English\".Maxim Lieber was Coates' literary agent from 1935 to 1938 and in 1941 and 1945.\n\nLife\nEarly life\nCoates was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1897. He was the second but only living child of Harriet Coates, a Victorian with feminist sympathies and Frederick Coates, a toolmaker-cum-inventor who became a professional designer of special machinery. In 1905, the Coates family embarked on a 10-year tour of the United States. They moved so often that Malcolm Cowley wrote that the young Coates “grew up in more places than laid claim to Homer.” Before he had turned eighteen, Coates had lived in various gold-mining camps in Colorado; in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Cincinnati, Ohio; Springfield, Massachusetts; Buffalo, New York; New York City; and Rochester, New York. As a result, as Coates recalls in his book of memoirs, “everywhere we went, I was, for a period at least, the new boy, the outsider.” Even during the three years that the family stayed in Cripple Creek (1905-1908), they were far from stationary. They moved from the fairly large town of Victor to Independence, then moved on to Goldfield, and finally settled down in the tiny settlement of Christmas Crossing, a “mere clump of log huts and tar-papered shanties”  at an altitude of close to eleven thousand feet.\n\nYale University and Woodstock\nIn 1915, Coates enrolled at Yale University (class of 1919). He published several short stories in the Yale Literary Magazine, and joined its editorial board in the spring of 1918. His early stories took their inspiration from realist writers like O. Henry on the one hand and naturalist writers like Du Maupassant and Theodore Dreiser on the other. Coates also was a member of the literary fraternity “Chi Delta Theta” where he found himself in the company of poet Stephen Vincent Benét, playwrights Thornton Wilder and Philip Barry, and future founder and editor of Time, Henry Luce. When the US became involved in World War I, Coates became a private in the Yale R.O.T.C. in November 1917 and joined the air service (naval aviation) in June 1918. The war was over, however, before he had obtained his wings.\nAfter graduation, Coates moved to New York and worked as an advertising man for the United States Rubber Company. In the spring of 1921 he exchanged New York City for the rural surroundings of Woodstock, in upstate New York, and devoted himself to writing poetry. The following unpublished poem, inspired by metaphysical poetry, is called “The Noose:”      I hold my whole life like a noose,\n      Following you everywhere.\n      I hold it light and very loose\n      To make the better snare.\n      Still like the frightened butterfly\n      You would elude the net;\n      And like a gentle hunter, I\n      Shall fling it round you yet.\n      And though you flee across the field\n      And flutter in the heather.\n      Know that when captive you shall yield\n      We'll both be bound together.\n\nExpatriation\nIn the winter of 1921, Coates sailed to Europe and settled down on 9 Rue de la Grande-Chaumière in Montparnasse, on Paris’s Left Bank. There he found himself in the heart of the bohemian Latin Quarter, much frequented by other American expatriates. Between 1921 and 1923, he established contacts with literary figures such as Arthur Moss, Florence Gilliam, Matthew Josephson, Malcolm Cowley, Kathleen Cannell, Harold Loeb, Ford Madox Ford, Ernest Hemingway and Laurence Vail. He published highly experimental prose sketches, with strong influences from expressionism and Dadaism, in the expatriate little magazines Gargoyle, Broom and Secession. In 1926, Coates’s first novel, The Eater of Darkness, was published in Paris by Robert McAlmon’s publishing company Contact Editions. Although he was part of the “lost generation,” Coates never liked to be grouped in that particular category. As he wrote in a New Yorker article:\n“As a young man I went to France—on what I always thought was my own initiative, until the social historians got to delving into the period and I learned that I’d actually been following, sheeplike, in the tracks of a mass manifestation called ‘the literary exodus’ of a group called ‘the lost generation.’ It is always unsettling to be told that one’s motives are not what one thinks they are.”In Paris, Coates developed a special relationship with Gertrude Stein, the matriarch of modernism who owned the famous salon on 27 Rue de Fleurus. According to Stein’s biographer, Coates had been “a Rue-de-Fleurus favorite”. Stein and Coates each made several attempts to further the other’s literary career: Stein recommended Coates twice for a John Simon Guggenheim Award, in 1928 and in 1935, and reviewed his second novel, Yesterday’s Burdens, for Scribner’s Magazine. Convinced of Coates’s creative originality, she praised him in her notorious Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas as one of the very few writers who “have an individual sense of words.” It followed that “Gertrude Stein took a very deep interest in Coates’s work as soon as he showed it to her. She said he was the one young man who had an individual rhythm, his words made a sound to the eyes, most people’s words don’t.” In turn, Coates tried to persuade the Macaulay Publishing Company in New York to publish an abridged version of The Making of Americans in 1930 and reviewed her work favourably in the New Yorker.Coates’s acquaintance with the European literary avant-garde had a lasting impact on his literary career. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, next to writing for the New Yorker, he continued to be passionate about literary form and style and remained much interested in literary experimentation. He published a short story in the first issue of the avant-garde magazine transition, founded by Eugene Jolas and Maria MacDonald in April 1927 and published two more stories in transition in 1928. After finishing the highly experimental novel The Eater of Darkness, he worked on a second avant-garde novel, Yesterday’s Burdens, which would appear with the Macaulay Company in 1933. A third experimental novel, The Bitter Season, appeared in 1946, which was followed by Wisteria Cottage, a superbly written crime novel which contained several stylistic features not generally associated with the genre such as parentheses, repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing. Also, like much of his earlier work, Wisteria Cottage resonates with genres of popular culture such as the crime novel and the film noir, creating a bridge between high and low culture much practiced by the European avant-garde, from cubism to surrealism.\n\nCoates and The New Yorker\nCoates returned to New York in 1926 and found employment as a staff writer at the newly founded New Yorker in 1927. After interviews with James Thurber, who would become a close friend, and founding editor Harold Ross, he was hired on the spot. Coates’s appointment at the New Yorker was the start of a life-long association. Next to James Thurber, who became a particularly close friend, Coates developed friendships with several of the New Yorker’s editors and associates, among them E.B. and Katharine White, Wolcott Gibbs, Dorothy Parker, Janet Flanner, Wolcott Gibbs, St. Clair McKelway, Gus Lobrano, Russell Maloney, Ann Honeycut, Sid Perelman, and later, William Maxwell and Brendan Gill. Coates resigned from his position as staff writer in 1932, soon after his move to Gaylordsville, Connecticut, in 1931, but continued to write for the New Yorker until 1967.\nDuring his many years of involvement with the magazine he contributed to many different departments—among them “The Talk of the Town,” “Notes and Comment,” “Profiles” and “The Reporter-at-Large.” Coates was the magazine’s book critic from 1930 to 1933 and became their art critic in 1937, a position that he held until 1967. From 1932 onwards he also developed a career as a New Yorker short story writer, submitting over a hundred short stories between 1921 and 1967. In all, as New Yorker scholar Ben Yagoda has pointed out, Coates wrote “more words for the magazine than anyone else, with the possible exception of [E.B.] White and [Wolcott] Gibbs.”One of the literary relationships that came out of Coates’s stint as the New Yorker’s book reviewer was his close friendship with Nathanael West, whom he met after his enthusiastic review of Miss Lonelyhearts. Another noticeable outcome was a public altercation, in the pages of the New Yorker, with fellow novelist Ernest Hemingway, after Coates’s review of Death in the Afternoon as a “strange book, childish, here and there, in its small-boy wickedness of language; bitter, and even morbid om its preoccupation with fatality.” From the early 1930s onwards, Coates became increasingly interested in developing a new, urban, type of short story. The New Yorker became one of Coates’s favourite organs of publication and his reputation as a short story writer grew considerably. By 1943, when his first collection of short stories All the Year Round came out, several of his stories had appeared in prize anthologies: “The Fury” in the O. Henry Memorial Prize Stories of 1937, “Passing Through” in the Best Short Stories of 1939, “Let’s Not Talk About it Now” in O. Henry Memorial Prize Stories of 1940 and “The Net” in Best Short Stories of 1941. In addition, three Coates stories had been reprinted in the first anthology of New Yorker fiction, Short Stories from the New Yorker, 1925-1940. The anthology (which contained 68 stories, including Coates’s “The Fury,” “The Net” and “A Different World”) got rave reviews from the New York Herald Tribune, The New York Times and The Saturday Review and led to the recognition of The New Yorker as a major vehicle of high quality fiction, and an important influence besides. Coates's often starkly realistic and psychologically dark short stories of the 1930s and 1940s made a significant contribution to the magazine’s developing stature as an organ for quality fiction.\n\nCoates as Novelist\nCoates’s first novel, The Eater of Darkness, was published in Paris in 1926 and was republished in New York in 1929 by Macaulay, where it was promoted and hailed as a Dada novel by the critics. Macaulay also published Coates’s second novel, Yesterday’s Burdens, in 1933, which provided a portrait of life in New York City versus life in the Connecticut countryside. A third full-fledged experimental novel, The Bitter Season, appeared in 1946 with Harcourt, Brace and was written against the background of World War II and Coates’s own divorce from Elsa Kirpal.\nAll three novels share a passionate interest in conveying the mood and atmosphere of New York City as experienced by individual onlookers-participants at a certain moment in history through experiments in literary form. They reveal the writer as an idiosyncratic experimentalist who embraced literary innovation and placed great value on “art” but did not withdraw into solipsism. Like the work of William Carlos Williams, Coates’s fiction thrives on contact, both with the locality that inspired it, and with the reader. His first three novels are alike in that they seek to summon aesthetically a particular cultural or historical moment as witnessed and experienced by an individual who is both unique and representative, both a keen reporter and a harried participant.\nAfter the writing of The Bitter Season, Coates changed literary course and turned away from literary experimentalism to embrace crime writing. Coates’s interest in violence—a preoccupation that he shared with such contemporaries writers as Thurber, Dos Passos, Wolfe, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, Hammett and West—had been evident throughout his career. Before Wisteria Cottage, Coates had paid ample attention to beatings, rape, murder, car accidents, embezzlement, and suicide. Of these and other manifestations of violence, murder fascinated him the most. Murder crops up in all his earlier works—starting with the insane homicides of the infernal x-ray machine in The Eater of Darkness, on to the wild and gruesome murders of the American outlaws of the early nineteenth century, to speculation about the potential murder of Henderson in Yesterday’s Burdens, and to the impersonal violence of war and the personal threat posed by the Mexican in The Bitter Season. Coates had also featured murder in several of his short stories.\nIn Wisteria Cottage and The Farther Shore, however, the topic of murder was approached from a fresh angle. In all of Coates’s previous accounts of murder (except for the short story “The Net,” which is clearly a study for Wisteria Cottage), men had been the victims, not women. Also, again with the exception of “The Net,” Coates had not yet shown a murderer’s mind from within.\nDuring the last years of his career Coates wrote a book of memoirs, The View from Here, and two travel books about his art trips to Italy, the highly acclaimed Beyond the Alps (1961) and South of Rome (1964). In 1967, his final short story, entitled “The Setting-In of Winter,” was published in The New Yorker on December 9, 1967.\n\nBibliography\nFiction\nNovels\nThe Eater of Darkness (Contact Editions, Paris 1926; Macaulay, New York 1929; republished by Putnam, 1959)\nYesterday’s Burdens (1933; rpt. 1975, 2020)\nThe Bitter Season (1946)\nWisteria Cottage (1948; 1985, introduction by Brendan Gill).

Newark Metropolitan, opened in 1928, was the first major airport in the United States. The trio of Art Deco buildings, the Administration Building, Brewster Hangar and the Medical Building, were built in 1934 and dedicated by Amelia Earhart in 1935. They were added to state and federal registers of historic places in 1980. In 2001, the Administration Building was relocated when a runway was lengthened, and they have subsequently been renovated. The terminal was once adorned with murals by Arshile Gorky, only two of which survive and are part of the Newark Museum collection.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, New Jersey\nPassage 3:\nCharles A. Agemian\nCharles A. Agemian (July 22, 1909 – March 30, 1996) was an Armenian-American banker who took early retirement from Chase Manhattan Bank, where he was executive vice president of operations, to become chairman and chief executive officer of the Hackensack Trust Co., which later was renamed Garden State National Bank.\n\nEarly life and education\nAgemian was born in Aleppo, Syria and immigrated to the United States at the age of fourteen. After receiving his B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Agemian graduated from Columbia Business School with an MBA.\n\nCareer\nAgemian began his banking career in 1927 as a messenger for the Bank of Manhattan Co. After rising through the ranks in operations, Agemian was named vice president and deputy controller when the Bank of Manhattan Co. and Chase National Bank merged in 1955 to become Chase Manhattan Bank. A year later, he became vice president and controller, and, in 1959, controller general. Agemian is known to have had a good relationship with John J. McCloy, the Chairman of Chase Manhattan. In July 1963, he was named executive vice president of operations of Chase Manhattan Bank, a position he held until his retirement in December 1969. On Jan. 1, 1970, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Hackensack Trust Co. at the urging of Steve Ross (Time-Warner CEO), then chairman of Kinney Services Inc., which was the bank's majority shareholder. Kinney National Company later merged with Warner Bros. to become Warner Communications.\nShortly after taking over, Agemian changed the bank's name to Garden State National Bank, and, a year later, merged it with North Jersey National Bank of Hudson County. Because of the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, Warner was forced to divest its stake in the Garden State National Bank. After an initial divestiture attempt was derailed by a dissident board member, William A. Conway, who claimed that it allowed Warner Communications to exit at a profit at the expense of certain minority shareholders, Garden State ultimately merged in 1980 with Fidelity Union Bancorporation of Newark (which later became part of Wachovia). This transaction required Agemian's resignation from the Warner Communications board so he could continue as chairman and chief executive officer of Garden State. Agemian retired from Garden State in 1981 but remained active as a faculty  member at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking and Pace University.\n\nPersonal life\nA resident of Spring Lake, New Jersey, Agemian died on March 30, 1996, at the age of 86. He was married to Mary Agemian. They had two children: Sandra Borg and Mary Louise Heath.\nPassage 4:\nRoy Newell\nRoy Newell (1914-2006) was an American abstract painter.\nHe was born in Manhattan's Lower East Side on May 10, 1914, and died of cancer on November 22, 2006, in Manhattan. His paintings are typified by richly-hued geometric forms in subtle juxtapositions and textures, heightened by an intimate scale and striking color harmonies. He participated in the Group of American Abstract Expressionists and was a founding member of the 8th Street Artist Club, which also included Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline and Philip Pavia.A self-taught artist, Newell was not a prolific painter.  His works number less than 100 and were often executed over decades, as he constantly refined his compositions with new colours until satisfied with the result.  Due to their continued reworkings, many of his paintings were up to an inch thick when completed, with a combined depth of wood support and layers of meticulously applied paint. Newell exhibited infrequently and sold very few of his paintings during his lifetime.  However, his works are in notable public and private collections such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum,  the New York University Art Collection, the Willem de Kooning Estate,  the Elaine de Kooning Trust, the Pollock-Krasner House, Seymour Hacker, and Michael Ovitz, among others.  His early influences include Cézanne and Kasimir Malevich.Edvard Lieber (author of Willem de Kooning: Reflections in the Studio) introduced Roy Newell to John Woodward of the Woodward Gallery, NYC, in 1995.  Director John Woodward photographed and inventoried all Newell's paintings.  From January 18 - March 9, 1996, Woodward Gallery hosted Newell's largest gallery exhibition to date.  “Roy Newell: Lifelines: 1955- 1995” was a 40-year retrospective and his first one-man show in a decade.  It featured 23 paintings and the critical review of that exhibition was written by Nick Paumgarten “Grumpy Old Artist Gets His Due”, NY Observer, February 24, 1996. Press photos of the opening reception documented the large response of the public and the art world.\nPassage 5:\nMatthew Spender\nMatthew Spender (born 1945) is an English sculptor. He is the author of From a High Place: A Life of Arshile Gorky (1999), a biography of his father-in-law, the artist Arshile Gorky, and A House in St John's Wood (2015), about his father, the poet Stephen Spender.  He also wrote Within Tuscany: Reflections on a Time and Place (1992, Viking, and 1993, Penguin.)\nSpender was born in London, England, the son of the poet Stephen Spender and the pianist Natasha Spender.\nPassage 6:\nShahen Khachatrian\nShahen Gevorki Khachatryan (born September 28, 1934, Aleppo) is an Armenian art expert. He is the founding director of the Arshile Gorky Museum in Etchmiadzin.\n\nBiography\nIn 1946, his family moved to Soviet Armenia. Khachatrian finished the Repin Institute of Arts. In 1967 Martiros Sarian appointed Khachatrian as the head of his museum. He directed the Martiros Sarian Museum for over 40 years. In 1991, Shahen Khachatrian also was appointed the head of National Gallery of Armenia. He enriched the gallery's collection with about 500 pieces purchased and collected from different countries and Armenian Diaspora.[1] He led the gallery for 13 years.\nKhachatrian published books dedicated to Sarian, Hakobian, Minas and Ayvazovski. He organized 60 exhibitions.\n\nAwards\n\"Honored Artist of Armenia\" (1984)\n\"Movses Khorenatsi\" medal (1998)\n\nExternal links\nCelebration Honoring 75th Birthday of Shahen Khachatryan\nSHAHEN KHACHATRIAN TO LECTURE IN LOS ANGELES\n[2]\nPassage 7:\nAlice Mason\nAlice Trumbull Mason (1904–1971) was an American artist, writer, and a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group (AAA) in New York City. Mason was recognized as a pioneer of American Abstraction.\n\nEarly life\nMason was born Alice Bradford Trumbull in Litchfield, Connecticut in 1904, descended from 18th-Century Revolutionary War painter John Trumbull through her father. She travelled throughout Europe when she was young. Beginning in 1921, she studied art in Rome, attending the British Academy in 1923.\nShe settled in New York by 1927 and was influenced by early abstract artist Arshile Gorky. She also studied with Charles Webster Hawthorne at the National Academy of Design in New York where she befriended artists Esphyr Slobodkina and Ilya Bolotowsky. While her earlier works were biomorphic or pure abstraction, her knowledge of Byzantine architecture later infused her compositions with an architectural dimension. She continued her studies at the Grand Central Art Galleries until 1931. She later wrote that she became devoted to abstraction in 1929, \"[A]fter happily painting these realistic things, I said to myself, 'What do I really know?' I knew the shape of my canvas and the use of my colors and I was completely joyful not to be governed by representing things anymore.\"\n\nCareer and later life\nMason married Warwood Mason, a sea captain, in 1930.  They had two children; a son, Jonathan \"Jo\" Mason (1933-1958), and a daughter Emily Mason (1932–2019), who also became an abstract painter.Alice Trumbull Mason took up poetry and corresponded with Gertrude Stein before resuming her painting in 1934. She helped found the American Abstract Artists in 1936, serving as treasurer, secretary, and then president. She took part in a MoMA demonstration. In the 1940s she began working at the Atelier 17 where she created etchings and woodcuts.Mason's first solo exhibition of her work in New York was in 1942 at The Museum of Living Art. Mason exhibited widely over the next few decades in group exhibitions. Many subsequent solo-exhibitions would follow, including Rose Fried Gallery (Pinacotheca) in 1949 and 1951, and Firehouse Gallery, Nassau Community College in 1957.After the death of her son in 1958, Mason struggled with depression and alcoholism. During one stay at a rehabilitation clinic, she met and befriended Richard (\"Dick\") Bellamy, who would later exhibit her at Hansa Gallery in 1959. Mason painted her last work in 1969.\n\nDeath and legacy\nFrom insufficient recognition in her lifetime, often reserved for her male contemporaries, Mason would say, \"I'll be famous when I'm dead.\" Mason remained quite active until her last years of life, exhibiting frequently in gallery shows and having institutions, like the Whitney and Brooklyn Museum, acquire her work.\nIn 1958, the body of Mason's son Jo was found in Puget Sound in Washington, after he had been missing for five months. After the death of her son, Mason struggled with depression and alcoholism. After multiple attempts at rehabilitation, she died in New York City in 1971. She was interred at Milford Cemetery in Milford, Connecticut.Two years after her death, the Whitney Museum of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibition of her works. Her work is included in many museum and public collections, including the Hirshhorn Museum, the Newark Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum.The Emily Mason and Alice Trumbull Mason Foundation was established in 2019, stewarding the legacies of Mason and her daughter, Emily. In May 2020, Rizzoli published the first comprehensive introduction to Mason's remarkable life and career, \"Alice Trumbull Mason: A Pioneer of Abstraction.\" This monograph details Mason's artistic process, painting style, activism, printmaking, poetry, and letters.\n\nArtistic style\nMason's intimate and experimental abstractions began in a biomorphic style and became increasingly geometric over time. She called what became her signature style \"architectural abstraction,\" which she said was about \"painting a positive, architectural construction […] It is building and not destroying.\" As New York Times critic Holland Cotter observed, Mason's paintings show how \"rigorous, stimulating, and accessible\" abstraction can be.In 2020, Roberta Smith of the New York Times wrote of Mason's trajectory, \"The forms on her small canvases mutated with unusual variety and momentum between the biomorphic and geometric (the latter ultimately won out). In other words, the initial influence of Kandinsky (and also Joan Miró) gave way to that of Piet Mondrian, on whose legacy she built with an originality that few other American painters have equaled.\"\nPassage 8:\nDe Kooning: An American Master\nde Kooning: An American Master is a biography of Dutch American painter Willem de Kooning, a prominent figure in the American movement of abstract expressionism, specially in the 1940s and 1950s. Often compared to Jackson Pollock and Arshile Gorky, de Kooning was considered one of the more inspirational and influential artists of the 20th century. The book, which is the first comprehensive biography presenting both de Kooning's personal life and career, was written by authors by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan. In 2005, the book was honored with the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.\n\nHonors and awards\n2004 Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Biography)\n2004 National Book Critics Circle Awards\n2005 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography\n2005 Ambassador Book Award\nPassage 9:\nLeonard Rosenfeld\nLeonard Rosenfeld (December 14, 1926 – December 2, 2009) was an American expressionist artist who was born in Brooklyn, New York. In the Post-World War II era, Rosenfeld associated with a group of artist known as the New York School. His contemporaries and prominent New York School artists included Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, and Robert Motherwell.\n\nBiography\nBorn and raised in New York City, Rosenfeld served in the United States Army during World War II.  After the war he attended the Art Students League of New York. There he studied drawing, painting, and sculpture. Rosenfeld had a very long and productive sixty-year career as an artist.  He along with other New York School artists, such as Willem de Kooning and Allen Ginsberg became immersed in the abstract expressionist and expressionist scene during the 1950s. Much of their time was marked by social gatherings at the legendary Greenwich Village bar \"The Cedar\" where beatniks and fellow members of the New York art scene discussed art, sports, and politics. In the late 1950s, Rosenfeld produced a series of \"Rail-Road\" drawings that would later be displayed by Martha Jackson in 1965 as part of a group exhibition. Rosenfeld, like many great artists, produced many artistic series and his work was shown throughout New York at many prominent galleries, such as his \"rag paintings\" at Ivan Karp's OK Harris gallery on West Broadway during the 1980s.\nRosenfeld derived his inspiration from the common sights he witnessed every day in New York City and worldwide events. In the 1980s, he experimented with different media, for example Rosenfeld was inspired by loose bits of wire he found on the street.  He took these loose bits and tacked them to canvas stretchers with carpet tacks. He would then render these wires and tacks into works that would later be known as \"wire-pieces\" and he explored many shapes, colors, and themes. These works are considered by many to be his greatest works from the 1980s-1990s.\nThe September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center had a profound impact on Rosenfeld. His studio faced the World Trade Center and he witnessed, in horror, the towers collapse. His September 11, 2001, art series is poignant in that it depicts the first-hand observations of an expressionist. During the first decade of the new millennium the war on terror provided Rosenfeld with the inspiration to create a series of war, soldier, and terrorist themed paintings. Rosenfeld's career as an artist spanned six decades. He died on December 2, 2009, in New York City.\n\nInspiration and artistic influences\nLate 1950s \"Rail Road\"\nRosenfeld captured the essence of New York City in the 1950s.  His \"Rail Road\" paintings are black crayon on paper.  They illustrate various subway scenes throughout the borough of Brooklyn, New York.\n\n1970s \"Hookers\"\nLiving in the East Village throughout the 1960s-1970s Rosenfeld chose to depict the daily interactions of hookers and pimps.  Often his inspiration came from scenes witnessed out in front of his apartment.  Rosenfeld depicts many of his \"hookers\" in a manner reminiscent of Picasso.\n\n1980s \"Wire-Painting\"\nConsidered by many to be Rosenfeld's most unusual creations, his \"wire-paintings\" required hours of tedious work.  He would collect bits of wire he found out on the street and bend and fold them into shape.  He would then tack these wires onto a canvass stretcher to form his painting.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\nRosenfeld witnessed first hand the horrors of 9/11.  From his studio he witnessed men and women jumping from the trade center buildings.  His paintings offer the viewer a very emotional and riveting depiction of 9/11 through the eyes of an expressionist.\n\nSoldiers and terrorists\nRosenfeld was one of the first known artists to depict the war on terror.

He spent the last years of his life as a national of the United States. Along with Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, Gorky has been hailed as one of the most powerful American painters of the 20th century. The suffering and loss he experienced in the Armenian genocide had crucial influence at Gorky’s development as an artist.\n\nEarly life\nGorky was born in the village of Khorgom (today's Dilkaya), situated on the shores of Lake Van in the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey). His birthdate is often cited as April 15, 1904, but the year might have been 1902 or 1903. Toward the end of his life, he was particularly vague about his date of birth, changing it from year to year. In 1908, his father emigrated to America to avoid the draft, leaving his family behind in the town of Van. He settled in Providence, Rhode Island.In 1915, Gorky fled Lake Van during the Armenian genocide and escaped with his mother and three sisters into Russian-controlled territory. In the aftermath of the genocide, Gorky's mother died of starvation in Yerevan in 1919. Arriving in America in 1920, the 16-year-old Gorky was reunited with his father, but they never grew close.In the process of reinventing his identity, he changed his name to \"Arshile Gorky\", claiming to be a Georgian noble (taking the Georgian name Arshile/Archil), and even telling people he was a relative of the Russian writer Maxim Gorky.\n\nCareer\nIn 1923, Gorky enrolled in the recently founded New England School of Art in Boston, eventually becoming a part-time instructor.  During the early 1920s he was influenced by Impressionism, although later in the decade he produced works that were more postimpressionist.  During this time he was living in New York and was influenced by Paul Cézanne.  In 1925 he was asked by Edmund Greacen of the Grand Central Art Galleries to teach at the Grand Central School of Art; Gorky accepted and remained with them until 1931. His notable students included Revington Arthur.In 1927, Gorky met Ethel Kremer Schwabacher and developed a lifelong friendship. Schwabacher was his first biographer. Gorky said:\n\nThe stuff of thought is the seed of the artist. Dreams form the bristles of the artist's brush. As the eye functions as the brain's sentry, I communicate my innermost perceptions through the art, my worldview.\nIn 1931, Gorky sent  a group of works ranging in price from $100 to $450 to the Downtown Gallery in New York. (The artist's name was spelled \"Archele Gorki\" in the gallery's records. Most of Gorky's works from this period were unsigned.) The exact nature of their relationship is unknown.  Mrs. John D. Rockefeller (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller) purchased from the gallery a Cézannesque still life by Gorky titled Fruit.  Gorky may have been introduced to the gallery owner by Stuart Davis who regularly exhibited there.In 1933, Arshile Gorky became one of the first artists employed by the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. This later came to include such artists as Alice Neel, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera and Mark Rothko.\nIn 1935, Gorky signed a three-year contract with the Guild Art Gallery (37 West Fifty-seventh Street, New York). Co-owned by Anna Walinska and Margaret Lefranc, but funded and directed by Lefranc, the gallery organized the artist's first solo exhibition in New York, Abstract Drawings by Arshile Gorky.\nNotable paintings from this time include Landscape in the Manner of Cézanne (1927) and Landscape, Staten Island (1927–1928).  At the close of the 1920s and into the 1930s he experimented with cubism, eventually moving to surrealism. The painting illustrated above, The Artist and His Mother, (ca. 1926–1936) is a memorable, moving and innovative portrait.  His The Artist and His Mother paintings are based on a childhood photograph taken in Van in which he is depicted standing beside his mother. Gorky made two versions; the other is in the National Gallery of Art Washington, DC. The painting has been likened to Ingres for simplicity of line and smoothness, to Egyptian Funerary art for pose, to Cézanne for flat planar composition, to Picasso for form and color.Nighttime, Enigma, Nostalgia (1930–1934) are the series of complex works that characterize this phase of his painting. The canvas Portrait of Master Bill  appears to depict Gorky's friend, Willem de Kooning. De Kooning said: \"I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky ... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends. It was nice to be foreigners meeting in some new place.\" However recent publications contradict the claim that the painting is of de Kooning but is actually a portrait of a Swedish carpenter Gorky called Master Bill who did some work for him in exchange for Gorky giving him art lessons.\nWhen Gorky showed his new work to André Breton in the 1940s, after seeing the new paintings and in particular The Liver Is the Cock's Comb, Breton declared the painting to be \"one of the most important paintings made in America\" and he stated that Gorky was a Surrealist, which was Breton's highest compliment. The painting was shown in the Surrealists' final show at the Galérie Maeght in Paris in 1947.Michael Auping, a curator at the Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, saw in the work a \"taut sexual drama\" combined with nostalgic allusions to Gorky's Armenian past.  The work in 1944 shows his emergence in the 1940s from the influence of Cézanne and Picasso into his own style, and is perhaps his greatest work. It is over six feet high and eight feet wide, depicting \"an abstract landscape filled with watery plumes of semi-transparent color that coalesce around spiky, thorn like shapes, painted in thin, sharp black lines, as if to suggest beaks and claws.\"\n\nPersonal life\nArtist Corinne Michelle West was Gorky's muse and probably his lover, although she refused to marry him when he proposed several times.In 1941, Gorky met and married Agnes Ethel Magruder (maiden; 1921–2013) daughter of Admiral John Holmes Magruder, Jr. (1889–1963). Gorky soon nicknamed her \"Mougouch\", an Armenian term of endearment. They had two daughters, Maro and Yalda (renamed Natasha some months later). Maro Gorky became a painter, and married the British sculptor and writer Matthew Spender, son of the poet Sir Stephen Spender.From 1946, Gorky suffered a series of crises: his studio barn burned down (destroying his library and thirty of his paintings); he underwent a colostomy for cancer; Mougouch had an affair with Roberto Matta. In 1948, Gorky's neck was broken and his painting arm temporarily paralyzed in a car accident, and his wife left him, taking their children with her. She was later married to British writer Xan Fielding.On July 21, 1948, after telling a neighbor and one of his students that he was going to kill himself, Gorky was found hanged in his barn studio. On a nearby wooden crate he had written \"Goodbye My Loveds\". Gorky is buried in North Cemetery in Sherman, Connecticut.\n\nLegacy\nGorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as lyrical abstraction was a \"new language. He \"lit the way for two generations of American artists\". The painterly spontaneity of mature works like The Liver is the Cock's Comb (1944),  One Year the Milkweed (1944), and The Betrothal II (1947) immediately prefigured Abstract expressionism, and leaders in the New York School have acknowledged Gorky's considerable influence. Arshile Gorky had a distinct, signature style and was known for his draftsmanship. He used twisted but elegant lines to bring in 'biomorphic' forms in his abstract paintings along with an overlay of colours to create a complex landscape of lines and colours on the canvas.His oeuvre synthesizes Surrealism and the sensuous color and painterliness of the School of Paris with his own highly personal formal vocabulary. His paintings and drawings hang in every major American museum including  the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan, Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (which maintains the Gorky Archive), and in many worldwide, including the Tate in London.A selection of Gorky's letters were translated and published by Karlen Mooradian in Arshile Gorky Adoian and The Many Worlds of Arshile Gorky in 1980. Matthew Spender (1999) and Nouritza Matossian (2000) concluded from their research that the translations of Gorky’s letters to his younger sister, Vartoosh, published by her son, Mooradian, had been embellished and some of these letters were fabricated by Mooradian. The most accurate translations of Gorky’s letters to family and friends were published at Goats on the Roof: A Life in Letters and Documents (2009), edited by Spender with translations by Father Krikor Maksoudian.Fifteen of Gorky's paintings and drawings were destroyed in the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 in 1962.In June 2005, the family of the artist established the Arshile Gorky Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation formed to further the public's appreciation and understanding of the life and artistic achievements of Arshile Gorky.  The foundation is working on a catalogue raisonné of the artist's entire body of work.  In October 2009, the foundation relaunched its website to provide accurate information on the artist, including a biography, bibliography, exhibition history, and list of archival sources.In October 2009 the Philadelphia Museum of Art held a major Arshile Gorky exhibition: Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. On June 6, 2010, an exhibit of the same name opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles. In 2021, during routine maintenance of \"The Limit,\" a hidden painting was discovered underneath; both paintings were exhibited and included in the latest catalogue of his work.In 2015 a fountain monument commemorating Gorky was erected in Edremit, a town near his birthplace. After the town's People's Democracy Party administration was replaced by government appointees the water supply to the fountain was cut off, the taps were broken off, and signs with Gorky's biography in four languages - Armenian, Kurdish, English and Turkish - were removed from the monument.\n\nArt market\nGorky's estate has been represented by Hauser & Wirth since 2016.

It comprises a series of bus-only roadways and reserved lanes on city streets and highways. The dedicated busways ensure that buses and emergency vehicles on the Transitway rarely intersect directly with the regular traffic, and make it possible for them to continue at full speed even during rush hour. OC Transpo operates a network of rapid routes which use the Transitway to connect communities with the O-Train light rail system. Additional bus routes also use segments of the Transitway.\nThe Transitway opened in 1983 with five stations. The network expanded greatly to include over fifty stations at its peak. Beginning in 2015, segments of the Transitway were closed to be converted to light rail. Ottawa's Stage 2 and 3 O-Train expansions will see additional segments of the Transitway converted.\n\nHistory\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton approved the construction of a new transit corridor called the Transitway. The purpose of this busway was to increase the speed of city-bound services from east and west. The first two sections opened in 1983: the southwestern Transitway between Lincoln Fields and Baseline and the east between Lees and Hurdman.The central Transitway was then added in the Westboro and Mechanicsville areas. In the downtown core, buses traveled along dedicated lanes on Albert and Slater streets. The eastern Transitway was extended in both directions, towards Laurier in the northwest and Blair in the east. These segments of the Transitway were serviced by route 95, travelling the full length of the Transitway from Baseline to Blair. Priority measures were later added to Woodroffe Avenue and Regional Road 174, extending service into the suburbs of Barrhaven and Orleans.In the 1990s, a rail corridor was gradually converted into the southeast Transitway, spanning from Hurdman to South Keys. This new section necessitated the creation of route 97. Route 97 followed the new southwest Transitway before joining route 95 along the existing Transitway segments. The 97 was extended to service the suburb of Kanata. The Kanata section was later split off into route 96.In 2001, the O-Train's Trillium Line (then simply the \"O-Train\") opened. Its northern terminus was at the new Bayview station on the central Transitway and its southern terminus at Greenboro on the southeast Transitway.The southwest Transitway was gradually extended southward, first to Fallowfield in 2005 and then to Barrhaven Centre in 2011. A median busway section was added along Chapman Mills Drive to Nepean Woods in 2014. The first segment of the western Transitway opened in 2009 connecting Pinecrest and Bayshore. This was extended to Moodie in 2017.Beginning in 2015, sections of the Transitway closed for conversion to light rail for the Confederation Line. Buses were rerouted to bus-only lanes along Highway 417, Regional Road 174, and city streets. The Confederation Line opened in 2019, along with a major re-organization of the Transitway network. Rapid routes no longer travelled through downtown Ottawa. Instead, all rapid routes use the Transitway to connect communities to the Confederation Line at one of three stations: Tunney's Pasture, Hurdman, or Blair. Routes were also renumbered to correspond with their geographic service area, resulting in the retirement of route 95, the Transitway's busiest and oldest route.\nMultiple sections of the Transitway were permanently closed for O-Train Stage 2 construction in 2021 and 2022. In September of 2021, the Transitway was closed between Moodie and Bayshore, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April of 2022. Buses were detoured along Highway 417, with Moodie station being relocated to temporary bus stops at the interchange ramps, and some bus routes bypassing Pinecrest and Bayshore stations eastbound as a result. In June, the entirety of the central Transitway between Tunney's Pasture and Dominion stations was closed, as well as the southwest Transitway between Iris and Baseline. Buses were detoured along Scott Street parallel to the former central Transitway, with a temporary extension and bridge connecting to Dominion Station. Buses were routed along Iris Street and Woodroffe Avenue between Iris and Baseline stations.\n\nRoutes\nThe following are OC Transpo's rapid routes, which travel along the Transitway with frequent service connecting communities to the O-Train. Additional OC Transpo routes also use segments of the Transitway.\n\nStations and segments\nEast\nThe east Transitway currently consists of a series of intermittent bus-only lanes along Regional Road 174 between Blair and Place d'Orléans.\n\nSoutheast\nThe southeast Transitway is a dedicated busway adjacent to some rail corridors between Hurdman and South Keys.\n\nCentral\nThe central Transitway was a dedicated busway between Tunney's Pasture and Dominion. It was closed in preparation for O-Train Stage 2 construction in June 2022, with buses now running along Scott Street. A temporary Transitway was built from Dominion station to the intersection of Churchill Road and Scott Street. The new Transitway travels over the old one via the bailey bridge and then alongside until the intersection of Scott /Churchill.\n\nDowntown\nThe former downtown section of the Transitway consisted of two single bus-only lanes on Albert and Slater Streets (one-way public streets in opposite westbound and eastbound directions, respectively), with stops in each direction at Bay, Kent, Bank and Metcalfe Streets as well as on the Mackenzie King Bridge. Traffic congestion here, where the buses mingle with private vehicles, often caused service delays and was seen by some as the main weakness in the Transitway system.\nInitial plans for the Transitway included a bus-only tunnel in this section but the cost of a ventilated tunnel for conventional buses was deemed too expensive and was not warranted at the time. In 2006, it was proposed to extend the O-Train downtown as a tramway over the same streets while keeping existing bus and car traffic. The idea was met with objections from businesses along those streets, as normal access to the businesses would be impeded.\nIn 2019, the Confederation Line opened, replacing the downtown portion of the Transitway with an underground, high-capacity rapid transit rail line. This service change greatly reduced the number of buses travelling on Albert and Slater streets.\n\nSouthwest\nThe southwest Transitway includes a dedicated busway from Lincoln Fields to Baseline. Buses then travel on reserved lanes before joining a busway before Fallowfield. This busway extends from Fallowfield to Barrhaven Centre. A separate median busway east of Marketplace connects Beatrice and Nepean Woods before traveling along reserved lanes to Riverview.\n\nWest\nThe west Transitway consisted of a dedicated busway between Pinecrest and Moodie, however the section between Moodie and Bayshore closed permanently in September 2021, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April 2022. Buses also use reserved lanes on Highway 417 between Moodie and Eagleson.\n\nSee also\nO-Train, OC Transpo's light rail transit systemOther bus rapid transit systems in OntarioViva Rapid Transit\nMississauga Transitway\nYork University Busway\nPassage 4:\nNepean Sportsplex\nNepean Sportsplex is a sports facility in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 1701 Woodroffe Avenue north of the Ottawa Greenbelt, near the former Confederation High School along OC Transpo routes 74 and 75 in the former city of Nepean. This is the home arena to the Nepean Raiders hockey team of the Central Canada Hockey League.\n\nHistory\nNepean Sportsplex was built in 1973 as a central facility for the former city of Nepean. The site contains an athletics centre (including fitness room) & gym, baseball, soccer and football fields, 4 squash courts, convention space, swimming pools, lawn bowling, 10 curling sheets, and three ice rinks including a 3000-seat arena.  In addition to nearby neighbourhoods, the Sportsplex served the community of Barrhaven until the Walter Baker Sports Centre was constructed in 1980.  In 1997, the 3000-seat arena was named Steve Yzerman Arena in recognition of Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings, who played with the Nepean Raiders hockey team in his youth. The Ottawa Junior Riders of the Quebec Junior Football League also play here.\nThe Sportsplex was the site of Ottawa's first mass vaccination clinic during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nFacilities\nNepean Squash Club:\nBegan with 4 squash courts and an upstairs viewing gallery in 1974 and called itself the Nepean Squash Racquets Club.\nThen 4 more courts were added in 1976. \nBy 2004, only 6 courts remained to make way for a weight room, and by 2008, only 4 courts remained.\nActive membership of over 100 club players with House League, City League, Tournaments, Round Robins, Socials and Lessons.\n\nFoyer Gallery\nThe facility includes the Foyer Gallery, an artist-run exhibition space that operates under the auspices of the Foyer Gallery Artists’ Association and the City of Ottawa.

In 2006, it was proposed to extend the O-Train downtown as a tramway over the same streets while keeping existing bus and car traffic. The idea was met with objections from businesses along those streets, as normal access to the businesses would be impeded.\nIn 2019, the Confederation Line opened, replacing the downtown portion of the Transitway with an underground, high-capacity rapid transit rail line. This service change greatly reduced the number of buses travelling on Albert and Slater streets.\n\nSouthwest\nThe southwest Transitway includes a dedicated busway from Lincoln Fields to Baseline. Buses then travel on reserved lanes before joining a busway before Fallowfield. This busway extends from Fallowfield to Barrhaven Centre. A separate median busway east of Marketplace connects Beatrice and Nepean Woods before traveling along reserved lanes to Riverview.\n\nWest\nThe west Transitway consisted of a dedicated busway between Pinecrest and Moodie, however the section between Moodie and Bayshore closed permanently in September 2021, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April 2022. Buses also use reserved lanes on Highway 417 between Moodie and Eagleson.\n\nSee also\nO-Train, OC Transpo's light rail transit systemOther bus rapid transit systems in OntarioViva Rapid Transit\nMississauga Transitway\nYork University Busway\nPassage 6:\nMackenzie King station\nRideau is a station on the O-Train Confederation Line on Rideau Street on the border of the Sandy Hill and ByWard Market neighbourhoods in Central Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nLocation\nThe underground station is beneath Rideau Street in Central Ottawa.Originally, Rideau station was to be built under the Rideau Canal, with a station at Confederation Square, closer to Parliament Hill. It was decided to relocate the station to the east in partnership with Cadillac Fairview, the owners of the Rideau Centre, where it would serve more people and provide access to the ByWard Market.There are two entrances from the Rideau Centre on the south side and another built into a Scotiabank on the north side of Rideau Street, at the threshold of the ByWard Market.Through the Rideau Centre, riders can walk to Hudson's Bay, the Westin Hotel, the Shaw Centre, the Transportation Building and the National Defence Headquarters without stepping outside.\nThe station serves destinations such as the ByWard Market, National Gallery, US Embassy, Shaw Centre, Government Conference Centre, Rideau Canal, National War Memorial, Château Laurier and National Arts Centre, as well as retail shops, restaurants and hotels.\n\nLayout\nRideau is an underground side platform station. Two concourses located above the two ends of the platforms contain the ticket barriers and give access to the Rideau Centre (west concourse) and the William Street/ByWard Market exit (east concourse). Both concourses feature elevators to the surface and the platforms. \nThe station is the deepest on Ottawa's network, with the platform 26.5 metres underground. It also has the longest transit escalator in Canada at 35.3 metres.The station features two artworks: FLOW/FLOTS by Geneviève Cadieux, a set of two glass screens on the station concourses overlooking the platforms; and The shape this takes to get to that by Jim Verburg, a set of murals in the access stairwells. Additionally, an exhibition area called \"Corridor 45|75\" is located along the corridor connecting the west concourse with the access to the Rideau Centre.\n\nService\nThe following routes serve Rideau station as of December 20 2020:\nRoute 12 is temporarily truncated west of St. Laurent Boulevard due to the Montreal Road revitalization project.\n\nSinkhole\nA sinkhole unexpectedly appeared on June 8, 2016 on Rideau Street  adjoining the excavation for the underground station.\nPassage 7:\nOC Transpo Route 4\nOC Transpo is a public transit commission that operates 170 bus routes, two light rail lines, and a paratransit system in Ottawa and the National Capital Region.\n\nGeneral information\nThe last two digits of route numbers correspond to service area:\n\n00s and 10s – Central\n20s – Gloucester\n30s – Orléans\n40s – Alta Vista\n50s – Ottawa West\n60s – Kanata/Stittsville\n70s – Barrhaven/Riverside South\n80s – Nepean\n90s – South Keys/GreenboroNOTE: Routes with a white background operate during select time periods or certain days of the week only.

Route 505 is considered an event route and is operated by OC Transpo.\nPassage 8:\nOC Transpo Route 61\nThe Transitway is a bus rapid transit (BRT) network operated by OC Transpo in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It comprises a series of bus-only roadways and reserved lanes on city streets and highways. The dedicated busways ensure that buses and emergency vehicles on the Transitway rarely intersect directly with the regular traffic, and make it possible for them to continue at full speed even during rush hour. OC Transpo operates a network of rapid routes which use the Transitway to connect communities with the O-Train light rail system. Additional bus routes also use segments of the Transitway.\nThe Transitway opened in 1983 with five stations. The network expanded greatly to include over fifty stations at its peak. Beginning in 2015, segments of the Transitway were closed to be converted to light rail. Ottawa's Stage 2 and 3 O-Train expansions will see additional segments of the Transitway converted.\n\nHistory\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton approved the construction of a new transit corridor called the Transitway. The purpose of this busway was to increase the speed of city-bound services from east and west. The first two sections opened in 1983: the southwestern Transitway between Lincoln Fields and Baseline and the east between Lees and Hurdman.The central Transitway was then added in the Westboro and Mechanicsville areas. In the downtown core, buses traveled along dedicated lanes on Albert and Slater streets. The eastern Transitway was extended in both directions, towards Laurier in the northwest and Blair in the east. These segments of the Transitway were serviced by route 95, travelling the full length of the Transitway from Baseline to Blair. Priority measures were later added to Woodroffe Avenue and Regional Road 174, extending service into the suburbs of Barrhaven and Orleans.In the 1990s, a rail corridor was gradually converted into the southeast Transitway, spanning from Hurdman to South Keys. This new section necessitated the creation of route 97. Route 97 followed the new southwest Transitway before joining route 95 along the existing Transitway segments. The 97 was extended to service the suburb of Kanata. The Kanata section was later split off into route 96.In 2001, the O-Train's Trillium Line (then simply the \"O-Train\") opened. Its northern terminus was at the new Bayview station on the central Transitway and its southern terminus at Greenboro on the southeast Transitway.The southwest Transitway was gradually extended southward, first to Fallowfield in 2005 and then to Barrhaven Centre in 2011. A median busway section was added along Chapman Mills Drive to Nepean Woods in 2014. The first segment of the western Transitway opened in 2009 connecting Pinecrest and Bayshore. This was extended to Moodie in 2017.Beginning in 2015, sections of the Transitway closed for conversion to light rail for the Confederation Line. Buses were rerouted to bus-only lanes along Highway 417, Regional Road 174, and city streets. The Confederation Line opened in 2019, along with a major re-organization of the Transitway network. Rapid routes no longer travelled through downtown Ottawa. Instead, all rapid routes use the Transitway to connect communities to the Confederation Line at one of three stations: Tunney's Pasture, Hurdman, or Blair. Routes were also renumbered to correspond with their geographic service area, resulting in the retirement of route 95, the Transitway's busiest and oldest route.\nMultiple sections of the Transitway were permanently closed for O-Train Stage 2 construction in 2021 and 2022. In September of 2021, the Transitway was closed between Moodie and Bayshore, followed by the section between Bayshore and Pinecrest in April of 2022. Buses were detoured along Highway 417, with Moodie station being relocated to temporary bus stops at the interchange ramps, and some bus routes bypassing Pinecrest and Bayshore stations eastbound as a result. In June, the entirety of the central Transitway between Tunney's Pasture and Dominion stations was closed, as well as the southwest Transitway between Iris and Baseline. Buses were detoured along Scott Street parallel to the former central Transitway, with a temporary extension and bridge connecting to Dominion Station. Buses were routed along Iris Street and Woodroffe Avenue between Iris and Baseline stations.\n\nRoutes\nThe following are OC Transpo's rapid routes, which travel along the Transitway with frequent service connecting communities to the O-Train. Additional OC Transpo routes also use segments of the Transitway.\n\nStations and segments\nEast\nThe east Transitway currently consists of a series of intermittent bus-only lanes along Regional Road 174 between Blair and Place d'Orléans.\n\nSoutheast\nThe southeast Transitway is a dedicated busway adjacent to some rail corridors between Hurdman and South Keys.\n\nCentral\nThe central Transitway was a dedicated busway between Tunney's Pasture and Dominion. It was closed in preparation for O-Train Stage 2 construction in June 2022, with buses now running along Scott Street. A temporary Transitway was built from Dominion station to the intersection of Churchill Road and Scott Street. The new Transitway travels over the old one via the bailey bridge and then alongside until the intersection of Scott /Churchill.\n\nDowntown\nThe former downtown section of the Transitway consisted of two single bus-only lanes on Albert and Slater Streets (one-way public streets in opposite westbound and eastbound directions, respectively), with stops in each direction at Bay, Kent, Bank and Metcalfe Streets as well as on the Mackenzie King Bridge.

The mall is one of the busiest in the National Capital Region as it attracts almost 8 million visitors per year from across the city and the surrounding region. It is the second largest shopping mall in the National Capital Region. It is anchored by Hudson's Bay, a combined Winners/HomeSense store and Walmart Supercentre.\n\nConstruction and renovations\nFirst phase (1973–1987)\nWhen the mall originally opened in 1973, it consisted of two floors. Its anchors consisted of Steinberg, Miracle Mart, The Bay and Eaton's. Miracle Mart was located on the floor above Steinberg's.\nIn 1982, The Bay expanded from 123,000 to 181,000 square feet with the addition of a third floor.\nIn the mid 1980s, the mall underwent an extensive renovation, including the addition of a third storey, upgraded passenger lift, and an escalator going directly from the ground floor to the top level. The colour scheme was also changed to a green and tan marble design. The original wrought-iron and wood railings were replaced by glass panels. The new design featured large peaked glass panels as the ceiling. Another level was added to the exterior parkade as well. The third floor opened on September 14, 1987. Overall, 65 stores were added, bringing the total number of stores to 165 in the mall. The four anchors were still the same from 1973 although Miracle Mart had been renamed to M at that point.\n\nSecond phase (1987–2012)\nThe supermarket at Bayshore was rebranded to Loblaw's Your Independent Grocer banner, effective March 14, 1992, due to Steinberg's decision in January 1992 to exit the Eastern Ontario market.\nBy 1994, the major tenants had slightly changed at the 760,000 square foot three-level regional mall that was now anchored by Eaton's, The Bay and Zellers.\nFollowing the closure of Eaton's in 1999, Zellers moved to the space in 2000, using two of the three floors of the defunct retailer. Les Ailes de la Mode opened in August 2001 its first store outside of Quebec in Zellers' former location (previously Steinberg's).\nFollowing the 2003 closure of Les Ailes de la Mode, the resulting vacant space on the south side of the first and second levels was reconstructed into two new areas. In the first level, the former corridor was closed and a new corridor and mall entrance created to its east. Stores in the new area include GNC, EB Games, The Body Shop, Shoppers Blvd (which later closed), Scentiments, Carol Baker Visage, Freyja Collections and MotoPhoto. A small eating area was also added, including a few new snack shops: Booster Juice, La Cremière and Cinnabon. Savory's Fine Foods store opened on June 15, 2006 (replacing the defunct Market Fresh store) and the new Pet World opened across from the grocery store on July 13. Savory's Fine Foods closed on August 19, 2007, marking the second exit by a specialty food retailer in the same location. Home Sense took over the vacant space in Fall 2009.\nOn the second level, a new corridor includes stores such as Mexx, Cleo, Timothy's World Coffee, Place Bonbon, Winners and Swarovski. The two new sections of the mall are connected by an elevator and some escalators. Washrooms were added near the Gap replacing the older and smaller ones that were located near the main entrance of the level (by the Bayshore Dental Clinic).\nA new passenger elevator opposite to the existing one, that leads to the food court area of the third floor. It was also built to transport a greater number of customers from first to third or vice versa.\nThe new Build-A-Bear Workshop opened its doors on June 15, 2006 at the old Cotton Ginny location. Cotton Ginny moved east to beside Northern Reflections, and just across from the new Aritzia store. A new store, Esprit occupied the remaining space starting in October. Also in 2006, Northern Reflections then moved to the location occupied by McIntosh & Watts. La Senza Express also opened during the fall replacing the former Campus Crew store.\nDuring the summer of 2006, the mall underwent an extensive renovation to its parking deck to replace the structure that existed since the mall's opening.\n\nThird phase (2012–present)\nConstruction started in 2012 for a further expansion of the mall, adding 300,000 sq ft of retail space. Widespread renovations of the existing portions of the mall and the relocation of the food court have occurred. The former Zellers space is being converted to multiple retail outlets with an H&M on the first floor (opened in October 2013). Victoria's Secret opened in Bayshore on October 23, 2013 along with its sister store Pink. This marked the premiere of both brands in the Ottawa region. Over 500 attended the store launch, some who lined up the night before. Forever 21 opened its doors on September 27, 2014.A Target store was built as a new anchor for the mall, but on January 15, 2015, Target Canada filed for bankruptcy and announced the closure of all of its stores, including the unopened Bayshore Shopping Centre location. On May 8, 2015, Walmart Canada announced its intent to acquire the locations of 13 Target Canada stores, including the Bayshore Shopping Centre location. Its new Supercentre store opened on the 3rd level of the mall on January 28, 2016 after relocation from its Lincoln Fields location.\n\nMajor criminal incidents\nOctober 14, 1983: David Utman, a Nepean policeman, was shot to death at the mall by a convict. Peter Michael Collins was handed a life sentence in 1984 for first-degree murder, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Collins apparently said \"Your time is up\" before shooting the officer.\nSeptember 1, 1984: Cst. Ralph Erfle and Cst. Robin Easey were shot after interrupting an attempted robbery involving a Brinks truck delivery to the mall's Toronto-Dominion Bank branch. Of the five criminals involved, four were captured and sentenced, the other was shot and killed at the scene. Easey was paralyzed after the incident.\nMarch 28, 1994: Dave Murphy, 18  was stabbed 13 times by three men and nearly died. His life was saved by two paramedics.\nJanuary 1999: Octavio Eva Gonzalez was murdered in a stabbing at the mall after he finished work there. Benny Jauvin was convicted of manslaughter and was given a net sentence of six years, a jail term some observers considered too lenient. A policeman was shot in the back and is now paralyzed.\n\nTransportation\nThe mall is located near the interchanges of provincial highways 417 and 416, via the Richmond Road exits (exit 130 on Highway 417 and exit 75C on northbound Highway 416).\nBayshore Shopping Centre is served by numerous routes at Bayshore Transitway Station, located just west of the mall.", "answers": ["about 7 million"], "length": 5850, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "446bbf21f76c9f7a31bb4557ab81001f81ba6d60a408f8a2"}
{"input": "Did Holland's Magazine and Moondance both begin in 1996?", "context": "Passage 1:\nHolland-class submarine\nThe Holland class were the first submarines built for the Royal Navy. They were built by Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness. The first three were designed by John Philip Holland.  The Hollands were built under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company/Electric Boat Company during the years 1901 to 1903. The Admiralty hoped to keep the Holland class a secret, and very few senior officers even knew of their existence. This led to the myth of the Admiralty not taking any interest in submarines. On the contrary, the Admiralty was well aware of the submarine's destructive potential. It therefore refrained from any submarine development programme so as to avoid provoking similar programmes on the part of foreign navies. Once those navies did begin serious submarine programmes, the Admiralty had no choice but to begin its own.\n\nAdoption of the submarine\nCaptain Henry Jackson, British naval attaché in Paris, had been instructed to report on submarine developments which had been underway in France for several years. In 1898 he witnessed trials of the privately developed Le Goubet, a small 11-ton submersible designed to be carried on board a warship. In January 1899 he informed the Admiralty of exercises with the 270-ton experimental submarine Gustave Zédé which had been used to launch a torpedo attack on the battleship Magenta. The Board of Admiralty considered whether it needed to act, but rejected further reports that the French had ordered up to a dozen submarines in the light of other reports on the trial suggesting that its outcome had been stage-managed for political reasons.In January 1900, the Washington attaché Captain Charles Ottley reported that the US government was considering purchasing a submarine-boat designed by John Holland and provided the Admiralty with US Navy reports on the boat's performance and a set of blueprints. In February the new Paris attaché submitted further favourable reports on the capabilities of Gustave Zédé. Meanwhile, Admiral Fisher commanding the Mediterranean Fleet, which might be required to fight the French, asked the Admiralty for instructions on the best defence against submarines and suggested the use of defensive mines. In May the Admiralty responded by instructing the torpedo school to investigate means of combatting submarines, whereupon they requested a submarine with which to experiment,  while in the same month news arrived confirming the US purchase of a Holland boat, USS Holland. First Sea Lord Walter Kerr and the Controller, Rear Admiral Arthur K. Wilson, were convinced of the need to obtain a submarine for the Royal Navy to investigate its capabilities and means to combat submarine attack.No British shipbuilder had experience of constructing submarines, so the Admiralty began negotiations with the Holland Torpedo Boat Company and Vickers Ltd, which was a major shipbuilder for the Admiralty. It was agreed that The Electric Boat Company (having purchased the rights from Holland) would license Vickers to build submarines in Britain, and an order was placed for five. The Board of Admiralty now considered that the submarines might also be useful in an offensive role, not merely to practice defence, and if trials of the boats were successful further orders would be placed with Vickers.A general election in November 1900 led to a change of First Lord of the Admiralty from George Goschen to the Earl of Selborne. The new Parliamentary Secretary to the board was Hugh Oakley Arnold-Forster, who as a backbench Member of Parliament had criticised Goschen for failing to adopt submarines. Now he discovered that the Admiralty had been doing so in secret. Selborne became concerned that even so the Admiralty was lagging some way behind the French in development, and the first boat, whose contract was finally signed December 1900, would not be delivered until October 1901. Arnold-Forster proposed involving other companies in constructing submarines, but this was opposed by the Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Archibald Douglass, as well as by Wilson, on the grounds that it remained unwise to encourage the general development of the submarine, which might be of more benefit to smaller navies rather than the RN. Wilson considered that the limited range of existing submarines meant they would only be able to operate in French waters, whereas if further developed could become a weapon to threaten British home ports. He recognised the potential of the submarine to prevent maritime trade, which was essential to the survival of an island nation like Britain. Any steps possible to slow down submarine development should be taken while the navy worked on means of defence against the submarine.In the event, the story that Vickers was building submarines was leaked by a Glasgow newspaper in February, and confirmed by the Admiralty in March. Arnold-Forster continued to press for more submarines to be built, considering that the navy either needed a great many or none, but although Selborne was inclined to agree, the two were opposed by the Sea Lords. It was agreed that only three per year would be ordered, which was the minimum number needed for Vickers to continue their specialist construction team. It was known that the French design was technically superior to the Holland boats ordered, but the Admiralty had no better design available at that time.\n\nFurther development\nConstruction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entire from the US company, the actual design used, Fulton, was an untested improved version of the original Holland design using a new 180 hp petrol engine.The Admiralty decided to appoint an Inspecting Captain of Submarines to oversee development work, and Captain Reginald Bacon was appointed in May 1901. Bacon was a technically minded officer experienced with the use of surface torpedo boats. His first recommendations were to note that the Holland submarines were likely to compare poorly to the current French design and would be unable to operate on the surface in anything other than fair weather (the boats had a range of only 20 miles (32 km) underwater). He therefore suggested the designs of boats four and five, which had not yet been started, should be modified to improve their seaworthiness. The Admiralty felt the Holland company would refuse any responsibility for difficulties arising from unauthorised design changes, but agreed to order one submarine of a new design, the A1.Experiments were conducted in 1901 at the torpedo school attempting to blow up a torpedo with underwater charges. In November 1902 Holland 1 finally became available for testing and was used as target with live explosive charges. It was found that the boat came to no harm from a 200 lb (91 kg) guncotton charge exploded at a distance of 80 yards (73 m). Since there was no known way of locating a submarine even to this accuracy, it was concluded that it was effectively impossible to attack submerged submarines. Destroyers were more at risk themselves from their own experimental charges thrown off the stern but in any case were not big enough to carry more than two charges. However, Bacon was much more optimistic over the offensive capabilities of the submarine, concluding that a group of 3–5 would be an insurmountable obstacle for any enemy ships attempting to operate near a port where the submarines were based.\n\nService\nThe submarines initially had serious reliability problems, and a 1903 attempt to sail around the Isle of Wight on the surface resulted in four of the boats breaking down before covering much more than 4 miles (6.4 km).The Holland class were mostly used for testing, but in October 1904, after a Russian fleet mistakenly sank a number of British fishing vessels in the Dogger Bank incident, the Holland boats left harbour to attack the fleet. They were recalled before any engagement could take place.\n\nBoats\nHolland 1, launched on 2 October 1901 in secret.

The magazine began in 1996.Said Editor-in-Chief Loretta Kemsley, \"My background in newspaper design was a good start for our fledgling ezine but so very different from the demands and opportunities of Internet publishing. With little experience to guide us, that first edition was an adventure unto itself. Some of our volunteers doubted we could accomplish this feat, even as we worked hard to meet our self imposed deadline: September, 1996. Moondance was coded for Internet browsers while reading a book on simplified HTML,\"Journalist Loretta Kemsley of Los Angeles, creator and publisher for the magazine, began her media career in the mid-1950s as a young horsewoman and stunt rider for cowboy star Gene Autry through Flying A Productions studios in Hollywood. In June 1954, Kemsley rode as a stunt double, at the age of eight, for Nancy Gilbert who played the young Calamity in the Buffalo Bill, Jr. NBC series directed by George Archainbaud, starring Dick Jones as Buffalo Bill, Jr., the Marshall of Wileyville, Texas. Forty more episodes were later co-produced by Autry for the children's western from 1954–1956.\n\nHistory\n\"Moondance was an experiment without precedent when it began, but today is the role model for a variety of exciting new ezines. When we decided to publish Moondance, we searched the Internet for examples to emulate. None could be found. Starting from scratch, we used trial and error to devise the successful format which uses the best of print media design, combined with the expanded capabilities of online media, while remaining accessible to those with hardware and software limitations. Moondance is coded specifically for disabled access,\" said Kemsley about the magazine's creation.Only three years after its beginning in 1999, Moondance received a UNESCO Web Prize Award, Category I (Free Themes). UNESCO - the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization was founded as a cultural wing of the United Nations in 1945. Created through the UNESCO prize for the promotion of the arts the UNESCO Web Prize Competition was awarded from 1997-2003 \"in recognition of the growing cultural and societal importance of the new information and communication technologies.\"\"In March, 1998, we were honored when Moondance was presented by Ida Miro Kiss, a Hungarian feminist and renowned speaker, as an example of women networking on the Internet at the UNESCO Inter-governmental Conference, Stockholm, Sweden,\" said Kemsley.\nMoondance is currently being used in many various university-level classroom curricula across the United States including University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, George Mason University and Akamai University of Hawaii among others. Mujeres University in Madrid, Spain has also used Moondance magazine in their English studies classroom curriculum since 1999. Today the American Political Science Association, a political science consortium of over 80 universities and higher education centers uses Moondance as a reference to enable a greater study and understanding of women's gender issues.\nPast writers for Moondance include noted women journalists, poets, authors and novelists. These include Fulbright scholar Lucinda Nelson Dhavan, Hurston/Wright Award winner Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu, Sonia Pressman Fuentes the 2000 U.S. Maryland Women's Hall of Fame winner and founder of NOW - the National Organization for Women and 2003 ABA - American Book Award winner Daniela Giseffi.\n\nFocus\nMoondance editorial standards stay close to the themes of focusing on the interests, lives and international culture of women. Sections for the magazine include: Best of Theme, Columns, Fiction, Non-Fiction, Inspirations, Poetry, Art and Reviews. Since its beginning Moondance neither sells nor takes any advertising monies.

He was best known for his comedy schoolboy character 'Bottler', the 1995 film Moondance, and his 1996 appearance in the Irish TV sitcom Father Ted as Father Fintan Stack. His 1975 song \"The Combine Harvester\" was a number one hit in Ireland, and his 1982 release of \"The Dutchman\" is considered to be one of the most enduring versions of the song.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in the heart of Dublin in 1951, Grace was raised on Echlin Street, in the inner city Liberties neighbourhood. His father Seamus worked as a bartender, an ambulance man and other odd jobs to keep the family going. Like many young Dubliners of the time, Grace left school at the age of 13 to begin working. His first job was as a messenger boy, an occupation he often referred to in his live act.\n\nMusic career\nAt the age of 18, Grace formed a band known as the Gingermen. They toured Ireland in what has become known as the showband era of the 1960s, although the Gingermen were a folk group rather than a showband. During a gig one night, the band found themselves two members short; in an attempt to calm an anxious crowd, Grace was thrust upon the stage to humour them. His wit and observations of daily life in Ireland immediately won over the crowd, and he would go on to sell out venues around the globe. He shared stages with many well-known names, such as Frank Sinatra, who referred to Grace as his \"man in Europe\", and John Denver, among many others.\nGrace's hit songs included \"Cushie Butterfield\", \"The Combine Harvester\"—which topped the charts in Ireland in 1975, and in 1976 was a UK number one hit for The Wurzels—and \"The Dutchman\".\n\nActing career\nIn 1995, Grace starred in Moondance, and the following year he appeared in the Father Ted episode \"New Jack City\" as Father Fintan Stack. In 2007, he appeared as Big Sean in Killinaskully, and in 2015, he starred in The Gift.\nHe also reprised his Bottler character in a TV movie also called Bottler in November 2013. It tells of Bottler's exploits in his early years.\n\nPersonal life\nGrace married Eileen Doyle in 1973. They had four children, Melanie, Brendan, Amanda, and Bradley. The last is best known as a member of the American metalcore band Poison the Well.\nIn November 2009, Grace released his autobiography, Amuzing Grace (ISBN 0956354114). In his later life, he divided his time between his home in Jupiter, Florida, and his pub in Killaloe, County Clare, which he named Brendan Grace's Bar.Grace was diagnosed with pneumonia in June 2019, and died from lung cancer at the Galway Clinic in Galway, Ireland, on 11 July 2019, aged 68. His funeral took place on 15 July at the Church of St. Nicholas of Myra in Dublin, followed by cremation. The funeral was attended by thousands of fans who lined the streets outside the church as well as along the procession route, which included stops outside the Guinness brewery and Grace's childhood home on Echlin Street. A year later his family scattered his ashes on Lough Derg near their family home in Killaloe, County Clare. A seat was also dedicated to the entertainer at his favourite spot in Killaloe where he used to feed the ducks and the swans.\nPassage 4:\n.240 Apex\nThe .240 Magnum Rimless Holland & Holland (also known as the .240 Apex and the .240 Super Express) is a centrefire sporting rifle cartridge developed in English gunmakers Holland & Holland no later than 1919, primarily for use in hunting deer and plains game.As it was common for rimless hunting cartridges, a rimmed (beltless) variant, at the time called just \"Holland's 240 Super Express\" and now sometimes named .240 Flanged Magnum or .240 H&H Flanged, was developed simultaneously for break-barrel rifles and combination guns.\n\nOverview\nThe ballistic performance of the .240 H&H in factory loads is very similar to that of the .243 Winchester, with a 100-grain (6.5 g) bullet with a diameter of .245 inches (contrary to the .240 name) giving a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,900 feet per second (880 m/s). When it is loaded at the same pressure as the .243 WSSM using modern powders, the .240 H&H has the potential for slightly better performance.\nMost bolt-action rifles made for the .240 H&H will be amply strong enough to handle hand-loaded cartridges at high pressure.\n\nSee also\nList of rifle cartridges\n6 mm caliber\nPassage 5:\nLewis Merenstein\nLewis Merenstein (October 23, 1934 – September 6, 2016) was an American record producer, most famous as the producer of the Van Morrison album Astral Weeks, and as executive producer for Moondance, Morrison's 1970 album. Astral Weeks was listed as #19 on the Rolling Stone Magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. In November 2006, when CNN published their list of The All-Time 100 Albums, Astral Weeks was  on the list, along with Moondance.\n\nBiography\nMerenstein was born on October 23, 1934 to a German-Jewish immigrant family in Baltimore, Maryland. His aunt was Bess (née Merenstein) Berman, co-founder of the Apollo record label; and his uncle was Charles Merenstein, a co-writer of the song Handy Man. He moved to New York City in the late 1950s and worked on jazz recordings at the Nola Penthouse studios with producer Tom Wilson.  During the 1960s he began working as a producer in his own right on records by Miriam Makeba, Gladys Knight and others.    Regarding Astral Weeks, Merenstein said:\nWarner Bros. Records had contacted Bob Schwaid [Morrison's manager], and he contacted me. And they had sent some producers, and they didn't know what he was talking about; people went up expecting to hear \"Brown Eyed Girl,\" because the year before he had had \"Brown Eyed Girl\" on Bang Records and that's what he was last known for. So Joe Smith and Mo Ostin asked me to go up [to Boston] and listen to him. And I went up and it was at Ace Recording Studio at 1 Boylston Place, and there was Van Morrison, very timidly sitting on a stool and I came in very timidly sitting on a stool and he played! And the first tune he played was \"Astral Weeks.\" Thirty seconds into it, my whole being was vibrating, because having spent all that time with jazz players, when he was playing, I could hear—the lyric I got right away; I knew he was being reborn. I heard 30 seconds, a minute and it went right through me, and I got the poetry of it. It was just stunning, and I knew I wanted to work with him at that moment. He went on and played more things, various tunes. And I guess everything was agreed on...\nAfter further rehearsals, Morrison and Merenstein went into the studio to record.  Merenstein said: that\n\n...it was just beautiful, just beautiful. I forget if we did one take, two takes, how many times I may have interrupted it and asked the band to soften it up a little bit and maybe move the tempo a little bit. Van had nothing to say. He just went and sang the song. That's primarily the way the album proceeded...\nAdditionally, he produced albums for Biff Rose, Charlie Musselwhite, The Spencer Davis Group, Cass Elliot, The Mamas & the Papas, John Cale, Curtis Mayfield, Charlie Daniels, The Association, Turley Richards, Alexander Harvey, Les Variations, George Burns and Phyllis Hyman.   Merenstein also produced the three studio albums recorded by Glass Harp in the early 1970s, featuring guitarist Phil Keaggy.\n\nPersonal life\nMerenstein died on September 6, 2016 of complications due to pneumonia in New York City. Services were held at Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan. He was survived by his daughters Ilene Merenstein and Emma Terese Merenstein.\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nDiederik Simon\nDiederik Rudolf Simon (born 10 April 1970 in Bloemendaal, North Holland) is a rower from the Netherlands, who competed for his native country in five consecutive Summer Olympics.\nHe won the gold medal with the Holland Acht (Holland Eight) at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He earned silver medals in the Men's Quadruple Sculls (Sydney 2000) and in the Men's Eights (Athens 2004). After becoming a coach, he rejoined the national team in 2007, placing fourth at the Beijing Olympics (2008) and fifth at the London Olympics (2012), both in the Dutch Men's Eights. He trained for his sixth Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, but was not selected for the Dutch team.\nSimon auctioned off his Olympic gold medal to raise money for Nereus Rowing Club in Amsterdam. He left his second silver medal in an Athens taxi but it was returned to him after he reported the loss to the police.\nPassage 7:\nSouth Holland School District 151\nSouth Holland School District 151 is an elementary school district in South Holland, a Chicago suburb located in southern Cook County, Illinois. It is composed of four schools; three elementary schools and one junior high school. Students begin their education in the district at Taft School; prekindergarteners, kindergarteners, and first graders are educated here under supervision of principal Christine Wilson. Students then proceed to Eisenhower School, where they will remain until third grade; the school's principal is Mr. Peter Kolinski.  The third and final elementary school in the district educates fourth and fifth graders, and is called Madison School; Madison's principal is Dr. Jerald McNair.  Graduates of Madison move on to Coolidge Middle School, where they will remain until graduating from the eighth grade. The principal of the district's middle school is Patricia Payne.\nPassage 8:\nSouth Holland School District 150\nSouth Holland School District 150 is an elementary school district in South Holland, a village located in Cook County just south of the city of Chicago. It is composed of three schools: two elementary schools and one junior high school; all three schools are located within South Holland, although the junior high school and one of the elementary school are located in the same facility. Students begin their education as prekindergarteners or kindergarteners in Greenwood Elementary School, where under supervision of principal William Kolloway, students will remain until graduating from grade three. Students then progress to McKinley Elementary School under principal jerome Pharrel where students in grades four and five are educated. The last wing of education that the district provides takes place in McKinley Junior High School, which is in the same structure as McKinley Elementary School; it is also headed by Jerome Pharrel, and serves grades six through eight. Dr. Jerry Jordan is the superintendent of the district.\nPassage 9:\nBegin (video game)\nBegin, A Tactical Starship Simulation is a video game released for MS-DOS in 1984 and consists of combat between spaceships.In 1991 it was followed by Begin 2. Begin 3 for Microsoft Windows was released in March 2009.\n\nGameplay\nBegin is a tactical starship simulator where the player commands a fleet of ships against an alien force.\nThe game is set in the Star Trek universe. Players can play as the Federation, Klingon, Romulans or Orion Pirates. Various weapons and functions are included, such as phasers, photon torpedoes and tractor beams.\n\nReception\nIn 1996, Michael Feir stated that Begin 2 is \"the best and most\ndetailed simulator accessible to the blind.\" According to PC-SIG, the \"computer strategy is quite effective.\"\n\nLegacy\nBegin 2, released in 1991,  is a tactical starship simulator game set in the Star Trek universe released in 1991. It is the sequel to Begin. The screen is similar to the one in Begin. The main difference is that the sequel featured VGA graphics whereas the original used pure ASCII screen characters (text mode). Extra ships and weapons were added as well. However, each ship is individually represented in the game, and can be individually operated and commanded by the player. Each ship has a unique set of weapons and resources. As with the first game, one of the most notable features of this game is its highly mathematical nature, and its lack of random factors.\n\nSee also\nTrek73\nStar Trek games\nPassage 10:\nHolland's Magazine\nHolland's Magazine (originally known as Street's Weekly, also known as Holland's: The Magazine of the South) was a magazine published from 1876 to 1953. It was a women's magazine that published recipes, fashion tips, gardening tips, sewing patterns, non-fiction, and short fiction. It was known for being a vehicle for social change and was influential in securing the passage of the Texas Pure Food law.\n\nStreet's Weekly\nFrom its founding in 1876 until its 23rd volume in 1905 the magazine was Street's Weekly and published weekly. Beginning with its 24th volume in 1905 it published monthly under a new name.\n\nHolland's Magazine\nIn 1905 F. P. Holland changed the name of Street's Weekly to Holland's Magazine and moved its headquarters to Dallas, Texas. Holland's became a monthly magazine, with page sizes measuring 15 by 11 inches (38 cm × 28 cm) and a full color cover. Roughly 40% of the magazine's contents were advertising. At ten cents an issue, it was more affordable than comparable magazines of the time.The magazine campaigned for social change and improved living conditions. It campaigned for a pure food law in Texas in 1906, which the state legislature passed in 1907. In 1911 it supported the establishment of community recreation and social centers in small towns and rural communities. It sponsored \"cleanest town\" contests and contests for community development and \"beautification\". In 1924 Holland's campaigned for the protection of Texas wildlife and in 1925 a wildlife protection act was passed by the Texas legislature. In 1927 Charles Campbell wrote a series of articles and gave lectures on the use of natural predators to control mosquitos. By the end of the 1920s Holland's had the largest circulation of any magazine of its type in the south.In 1926 the name of the magazine was changed to Holland's: The Magazine of the South.The Holland family owned the magazine until 1952 when it was sold to Hugh Wolfe. Wolf sold the printing equipment to a Chicago publisher. Without the equipment the magazine was not able to mass-produce as many copies and there were fewer buyers. In December 1953 the last issue was published.\n\nInfluence on pure food laws\nF.P. Holland ran two magazines in Dallas in the early 1900s, Holland's and Texas Farm and Ranch, which was about farming products and practices.\n\nAlthough women in the first decade of the 1900s were not yet entitled to vote, they cared deeply about the quality of food available to feed their families, and were strong supporters of the federal Pure Food and Drug Act. More and more people were living in cities and were no longer growing and preparing their own food. Whereas their mothers had probably harvested eggs from their own chickens, churned their own butter, and made their own jam many women in the early 1900s were buying these products already made, and had no idea if the eggs were fresh or had been sitting in storage for weeks, if the butter was fresh or if rancid butter had been mixed with new, and what was in the jam. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, combined with the work of journalists to expose abuses, and advocacy by women's groups made advocating for pure food laws a priority for many women. When the federal Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906 there was a need for states to take reciprocal action. Texas had a law forbidding adulterated animal feed, but no such law for humans.Women's groups in Texas began pushing for a state pure food law. As a publication geared towards women with a sister publication geared towards agriculture, Holland's was well-positioned to aid in this endeavor. Beginning in August and September 1906 Holland's ran a series of muckraking articles documenting formaldehyde in milk, poisoned meat, and the like, which laid the groundwork for a 1907 bill. The bill also had the support of the medical community, which praised Holland's work highly. The Texas Medical Journal said,\n\nIn September Holland's will take up the subject of milk. The people of Texas, or at least those in the larger cities and towns, are being forced to buy a very large amount of milk which is treated with formaldehyde and other preservatives. Milk adulteration is one of the greatest crimes which can be committed against the public since the life and health of thousands of helpless children in the larger cities and towns are absolutely dependent upon the milk supply.\nDuring this time Holland's in conjunction with their sister publication Farm and Ranch conducted a study where they purchased food items at various markets throughout the south and southwest and hired a chemist to test them. The results they gathered were described as \"alarming\" and prompted the North Texas Medical Association to adopt a resolution endorsing the work of the magazines and campaign for pure food and drug laws at the state level.Holland's regularly published work by female authors like Mary Work and Helen Stoddard, who were active in designing the bill and getting it passed. It published legislative petitions for readers to circulate and send to their representatives.", "answers": ["no"], "length": 5047, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b893608c026ffd4b64b370af3989af857069c6718a309ae6"}
{"input": "What ethnicity is this American professional baseball right fielder born in 1987 play, who graduated from Nova Southeastern University?", "context": "Passage 1:\nNova Southeastern Sharks baseball\nThe Nova Southeastern Sharks baseball program represents Nova Southeastern University in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's NCAA Division II level. The Sharks have a very short history, having only a small number of years of play under their belt; even having only joined the NCAA as recently as 2003. However, the sharks have won the Division II championship in 2016, led by the coaching of Greg Brown. The sharks are also known for producing several MLB stars, such as J. D. Martinez of the Boston Red Sox, Miles Mikolas of the St. Louis Cardinals, and Mike Fiers of the Oakland Athletics. After the 2019 season, coach Greg Brown announced his resignation so that he could pursue an opportunity to join the Tampa Bay Rays as a minor league hitting coordinator. Laz Gutierrez, a former roving instructor for the Boston Red Sox was named as his successor.\nPassage 2:\nCarlos González (baseball)\nCarlos Eduardo González (born October 17, 1985), nicknamed \"CarGo\", is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder. Over the course of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played for the Oakland Athletics, Colorado Rockies, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago Cubs. A three-time All-Star, González was the National League batting champion in 2010. He has also won two Silver Slugger Awards and is a three-time Gold Glove Award winner. While mainly a right fielder throughout his career, González was the Rockies' starting left fielder from 2010-2014; in 2015 he transitioned to right field.\n\nCareer\nArizona Diamondbacks\nBorn in Maracaibo, Venezuela, González signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks as an international free agent on August 3, 2002. González began his professional baseball career in 2003 for the Rookie League Missoula Osprey. González batted .258 with six home runs in 72 games. In 2004, González split time between the Low Single-A Yakima Bears and the Single-A South Bend Silver Hawks. In 85 games, he batted .275 with 10 home runs.\nGonzález played the 2005 season again for the Silver Hawks. He led the team in games played (129) and RBIs (92), and was also second on the team in batting average (.307), home runs (18), at bats (515) and runs scored (91). González was named to the Midwest League midseason and postseason All-Star teams and was also selected as the Midwest League Most Valuable Player and Prospect of the Year. Baseball America and Topps each named González as a Low Class-A All-Star. Topps also chose him as the Midwest League Player of the Year.\nIn 2006, Baseball America rated González at #32 on their top 100 prospects list and was the 6th-highest Diamondbacks player on that list. González mainly played for the High Single-A Lancaster JetHawks in 2006, but also spent some time with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. González played in 122 games and batted .289 with a career high 23 home runs. He also led the JetHawks in home runs (21) and RBIs (93). González was also an All-Star Futures Game selection and a California League postseason All-Star selection. Baseball America rated González as a High Class-A All-Star, and he received the same honor from Topps.\nIn 2007, Baseball America rated González at #18 on their top 10 prospects list and was the 3rd highest Diamondbacks player on that list. González mainly played for the Double-A Mobile BayBears, but also spent some time in Triple-A with the Tucson Sidewinders. González played in 130 games and batted .288 with 17 home runs. González led the BayBears in home runs (16) and RBI (75). González was once again named to the All-Star Futures Game.\nOn December 14, 2007, the Diamondbacks traded González, Dana Eveland, Aaron Cunningham, Chris Carter, Brett Anderson, and Greg Smith to the Oakland Athletics for Dan Haren and Connor Robertson.\n\nOakland Athletics\nOn May 30, 2008, González made his MLB debut at the age of 22 against the Texas Rangers, where he got first career hit, an opposite field double down the left field line off Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Millwood. This was one of two doubles he hit in his major league debut. His next five major league hits were also doubles, making González the first player since Hall of Famer Johnny Mize in 1936 to record the first seven hits of his career as extra base hits. On June 20, 2008, González hit his first career home run against the Florida Marlins. It was a solo home run that was hit off a curveball to right-center field. He had his first 4-hit game, going 4-for-4 against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 8.\n\nColorado Rockies\nOn November 12, 2008, González was traded with Huston Street and Greg Smith to the Colorado Rockies for Matt Holliday. After what many called a disappointing season with Oakland, González spent most of the season with the Rockies Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. After a series of injuries to the Rockies outfield, González was called up and started slowly, but eventually began to produce, proving himself as a nice combination of power and speed atop the lineup. In the 2009 National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, González tied the franchise record for the most hits in an NLDS with 10, and led the NLDS and ALDS in batting average with .588 in four games. In his 2010 season, he finished in the top 5 in home runs, batting average, RBIs, and runs scored in the National League.\nOn July 31, 2010, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, González hit for the cycle, including a walk-off home run on the first pitch in the bottom of the 9th inning. He became the first player since Dwight Evans of the Boston Red Sox in 1984 to hit a walk-off home run for the cycle, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Manager Jim Tracy labeled González as not just a five-tool player, but a \"six-tool player.\" Only four other players in major league baseball history had completed a cycle with a game-ending homer: Ken Boyer (1961), César Tovar (1972), George Brett (1979), Dwight Evans (1984). Nolan Arenado repeated the feat in 2017 to make it six total players in major league history.\nIn 2010, González garnered serious consideration as a candidate for the National League MVP award, along with St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols and Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto, as well as a Triple Crown candidate with the above-mentioned first basemen. However, González fell short on home runs and narrowly missed having the most RBI, but did manage to win the NL batting title in 2010 with a .336 average. He finished with 34 home runs, 117 RBI and a National League-leading 197 hits. He also led the National League in total bases (351) and power-speed number (29.5).González received the National League Players Choice Award for Outstanding Player in 2010. He then won the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year throughout Major League Baseball. González was also voted the winner of the 2010 Luis Aparicio Award, which is given to the most outstanding Venezuelan player in Major League Baseball, as voted by Venezuelan and international Spanish-speaking media. He finished third in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America for National League MVP. For his defensive efforts in 2010, in which he only committed one error in the outfield, González won his first Gold Glove. On the offensive side, González received his first Silver Slugger Award.González signed a seven-year, $80.5 million contract extension with the Rockies on January 11, 2011. The contract included a $3 million signing bonus and yearly salaries through 2017 that ramp up to $20 million. It is the largest contract in MLB history for a two-year player. On May 21, 2012, he became the 22nd player in MLB history to hit a home run in four consecutive at-bats, doing this during a two-game span against the Houston Astros. In early July 2011, Gonzalez injured his right wrist and was placed on the disabled list. On July 21, 2011, he yet again injured the wrist against the Atlanta Braves. On May 14, 2013, he went 5-for-5 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, hitting 2 home runs and setting a new career high with 5 hits in one game. On June 5, 2013, he hit 3 home runs against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in a 12-4 victory.\nIn 2014, with the breakout of Corey Dickerson, González was moved out to right field.\nGonzález won a Silver Slugger Award in right field for the 2015 season after hitting 40 home runs, second most in the National League.After his poor performance in the 2017 season it was highly speculated that Gonzalez would not return to play for the Rockies in the 2018 season. After the 2017 season González did temporarily leave the team, and entered free agency. However González was re-signed to a one-year, $8 million contract on March 12, 2018, to remain playing for the Rockies.\nIn 2018, he played 132 games hitting 16 home runs and batting .276 with 67 RBI's. He entered free agency at the end of the season.\n\nCleveland Indians\nGonzález signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on March 19, 2019; the deal included a non-roster invitation to spring training. He is set to make $2 million, plus $1 million in incentives, because he made the big league roster.The Indians purchased González's contract on April 14, 2019. González was designated for assignment by the Indians on May 22, 2019 after hitting .210 with 2 home runs and 7 runs batted in. After clearing waivers, González elected free agency on May 26, 2019.\n\nChicago Cubs\nOn May 30, 2019, González agreed to a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. The team purchased his contract on June 3, 2019, and he was the starting right fielder in an inter-league game against the Los Angeles Angels. With one out and the bases loaded in the seventh inning, González made a highlight-reel game-saving diving catch. On June 29, he was designated for assignment for the second time in the 2019 season. On July 2, González again elected free agency.\n\nSeattle Mariners\nHe was signed to a minor league contract on February 12, 2020 with the Seattle Mariners. Gonzalez was released by the Mariners organization on June 25, 2020.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Gonzalez married a Venezuelan woman named Indonesia Riera on October 20, 2012. He is the father of a boy and twin girls.\n\nSee also\nList of Major League Baseball batting champions\nList of Major League Baseball players from Venezuela\nList of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\nPassage 3:\nMark B.

Martinez\nJulio Daniel Martinez (born August 21, 1987) is an American professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Boston Red Sox. He made his MLB debut in 2011. A right-handed thrower and batter, Martinez stands 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighs 221 pounds (100 kg).\nA native of Miami, Florida, Martinez attended Nova Southeastern University (NSU) before the Astros selected him in the 20th round with the 611th pick in the 2009 amateur draft.  He is the first player drafted from NSU to play in the major leagues.  He is a six-time MLB All-Star selection and a three-time Silver Slugger Award winner, as well as the only player to earn the latter honor twice in the same season.\nOn September 4, 2017, Martinez became the 18th player in MLB history to hit four home runs in a single game, doing so versus the Los Angeles Dodgers.  During the Red Sox' 2018 World Series run, he won the American League (AL) Hank Aaron Award as the league's top offensive performer, leading the league in RBIs, while placing second in batting average and home runs.  He also won the 2018 Players Choice Award for Player of the Year.\n\nCareer\nAmateur career\nMartinez attended Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Florida, and graduated in 2006.  The Minnesota Twins selected Martinez in the 36th round, with the 1,086th overall selection, of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign with the Twins.\nInstead, Martinez attended Nova Southeastern University (NSU), where he played college baseball for the Sharks from 2007 through 2009.  He set the school's career record for home runs with 32, ranked second in batting average (.394), third in runs batted in (RBI, 142), and fourth in slugging percentage (.691).  In 2009, he batted .428 with 15 home runs and set a program record with 73 runs scored.  He was a two-time All-Sunshine State Conference baseball player.In 2014, Martinez was inducted into the NSU Sharks Hall of Fame.\n\nHouston Astros\nDraft and minor leagues\nThe Houston Astros selected Martinez in the 20th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft with the 611th overall selection. He was signed by Greg Brown, who later became the head coach at NSU. Martinez started his professional career with the Greeneville Astros of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, where he batted .403 before earning a promotion to the Tri-City ValleyCats of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League.\n\nMartinez started the 2010 season with Lexington Legends of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) before earning a mid-season promotion to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League.  He led SAL in each of batting (.362), on-base percentage (.433), and slugging percentage (.598).  At the time of his promotion to the Texas League, he also led the SAL in hits, doubles, extra-base hits, runs scored and total bases. Martinez was honored as SAL Player of the Year, Most Valuable Player (MVP), and the Houston Astros' Minor League Player of the Year.\n\nMartinez started the 2011 season with Corpus Christi; over 88 games, he batted .338/.414/.552/.959, 25 doubles, 13 home runs, 72 RBI, 42 bases on balls, and 55 strikeouts.  He was named a Texas League All-Star.\n\nEarly major league career (2011–14)\nOn July 30, 2011, the Astros called up Martinez to replace Hunter Pence, whom they had traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.  Martinez became the first player drafted from Nova Southeastern University to debut in Major League Baseball.  The following month, he drove in 28 runs, establishing an Astros rookie record for one month.On April 13, 2012, Martinez hit the first ever home run in the new Marlins Park.  With a runner on in the eighth, he hit an Edward Mujica offering into the Clevelander bar beyond the left-field wall for a game-tying home run.  He led the club with 55 RBI in 2012.During a batting practice session in July 2013, hitting coach John Mallee confronted Martinez about his swing: unless he changed his approach to hitting, the best-case scenario for his playing career would be to \"bounce between the big leagues and the minors.\"  As difficult as the message was for Martinez to accept at the time, he pondered Mallee's words.  The next month, while in the trainer's room after spraining his left wrist, Martinez watched ESPN highlights of Milwaukee Brewers' slugger Ryan Braun batting.  He realized that his swing bore no resemblance to Braun's.  From there, he began to dedicate himself to study other top MLB hitters including Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera to investigate what improvements he could make to his swing to become a more successful hitter.  He then observed teammate Jason Castro, who had just made the All-Star team and was on pace to triple his home run output, and realized, \"Castro’s got the same swing they do.\"  Martinez asked Castro how he had learned his technique, to which he replied, “You’ve got to see my guys in California.”  The day after the season ended, Martinez was in Santa Clarita for an appointment with hitting experts Robert Van Scoyoc and Craig Wallenbrock.After two weeks in Santa Clarita, Martinez traveled to play for the Leones del Caracas in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.  In one month, he batted .312 with six home runs and a .957 OPS.  Of greater import was the response of the ball each time he hit it: there was a feel of newfound mastery.  However eager Martinez was to demonstrate this increased prowess to general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager Bo Porter, they remained unconvinced.  He played sparingly the following spring training, receiving 18 total at bats and collecting three hits.  The Astros outrighted Martinez off the major league roster on November 20, 2013, and released him on March 22, 2014.  After three years and 252 games in an Astro uniform, Martinez had hit .251 with 24 home runs.\n\nDetroit Tigers\n2014 season\nOn March 24, 2014, the Detroit Tigers signed Martinez to a minor-league contract.  After hitting 10 home runs and driving in 22 runs over his first 17 games with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers purchased Martinez' contract, and recalled him to the roster to play his first game on April 21.Martinez was awarded the American League (AL) Player of the Week Award for the period ending June 22, 2014. He batted .444 (12-for-27) with three doubles, four home runs (including one grand slam), 11 RBIs, and six runs scored in seven games to win his first career weekly honor. Martinez was named the Detroit Tigers' Player of the Month for June, posting a .345 average with nine doubles, seven home runs and 21 RBI, including a career-high 14 game hit streak.  He tied for third place in the American League in home runs.Martinez authored a breakout regular season in 2014, finishing with 30 doubles, 23 home runs, 76 RBI, .315 batting average, and a .912 OPS, all career-highs to that point in his major league career.  He was second on the club in batting, slugging percentage (.553), and OPS, and third in home runs.  He was named a finalist for the MLBPA's  Players Choice Award for AL Comeback Player of the Year.On October 3, during Game 2 of the American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Baltimore Orioles, Martinez became the first player in Tigers history—and just the 16th major leaguer—to hit a home run in each of his first two career postseason games. Martinez finished the postseason with one double, two home runs, and five RBI in three games as the Tigers were swept by the Orioles.\n\n2015 season\nOn January 16, 2015, Martinez and the Tigers avoided arbitration when the two parties agreed on a one-year, $3 million contract for the 2015 season. On June 21, Martinez hit three home runs and had six RBIs in a game against the New York Yankees, becoming the first Tigers player to do so since Miguel Cabrera did it in May 2013. Martinez was awarded the AL Player of the Week award for the period ending July 5. He batted .458 (11 for 24) with six runs scored, four home runs, one double, and 10 RBIs in six games to win his second career weekly honor. He paced the Majors in slugging percentage (1.000) and total bases (24), and finished tied for first in home runs. Among AL leaders, he finished tied for first in on-base percentage (.500), second in RBI, third in batting average, tied for third in hits and tied for fourth in runs scored. On July 6, 2015, Martinez was named as a reserve for the American League at the 2015 All-Star Game.Martinez finished the season with a .282 batting average, and reached career highs of 33 doubles, 38 home runs and 102 RBI.  His 38 home runs marked the third-highest total by a Tigers outfielder, trailing only Rocky Colavito's 45 in 1961 and Hank Greenberg's 41 in 1940. Martinez's 102 RBIs marked the most by a Tiger outfielder since Magglio Ordóñez drove in 103 in 2008. Martinez's 319 total bases ranked fifth among all AL hitters. His 109 runs created ranked eighth, and his .897 OPS ranked ninth. He had the highest percentage of hard-hit batted balls in the majors (42.8%). Following the 2015 season, Martinez was awarded his first career Silver Slugger Award. He was named the 2015 Tiger of the Year by the Detroit chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.Martinez was also a finalist for his first Gold Glove Award in right field, but the award went to Kole Calhoun of the Angels.  Martinez' 15 outfield assists tied for third in the AL, his .993 fielding percentage led all AL right fielders, and his 7.7 ultimate zone rating ranked second among AL right fielders.\n\n2016 season\nOn February 8, 2016, the Tigers signed Martinez to a two-year, $18.5 million contract extension.Martinez was placed on the 15-day disabled list after a June 16 game against the Kansas City Royals, having suffered a non-displaced fracture in his right elbow caused by running into the outfield wall. At the time of the injury, Martinez was hitting .286 with 12 home runs and 39 RBI.On August 3 against the Chicago White Sox, in his first game after being activated from the disabled list, Martinez hit a pinch-hit game-winning solo home run off Chris Sale on the first pitch of the at-bat. Martinez played 120 games in the injury-shortened 2016 season, and hit .307 with 22 home runs and 68 RBI.\n\n2017 season\nDuring a spring training game on March 18, 2017, Martinez left the game with an apparent foot injury. One week later, on March 25, further tests revealed that there was a lisfranc sprain in his right foot. As a result, Martinez began the season on the 10-day disabled list, with 3–4 weeks to recover. He rejoined the Tigers on May 12 after a four–game rehab stint with Toledo.Martinez was awarded the AL Player of the Week award for the period ending May 21. Martinez batted .389 (7 for 18) with seven runs scored, four home runs, and nine RBIs while reaching base 17 times in six games to win his third career weekly honor.  Next, Martinez was awarded the AL Player of the Week award for the period ending July 16. Martinez batted .454 (5 for 11), with two runs scored, two home runs, and seven RBIs in three games to win his fourth career weekly honor. During the 2017 season with the Tigers, Martinez batted .305 with 16 home runs, 39 RBIs, and a 1.018 OPS. Over four seasons with the Tigers, he hit .300 with 99 home runs, 285 RBIs, and a .912 OPS.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nOn July 18, 2017, the Tigers traded Martinez to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Dawel Lugo, Sergio Alcántara, and Jose King.On September 4, Martinez hit four home runs versus the Los Angeles Dodgers to become the 18th major leaguer and first Diamondbacks player to hit four home runs in the same game.  Each home run came in four consecutive at-bats against four different pitchers.  As the Dodgers collectively obtained three hits, Martinez' achievement of four home runs made him the first with that distinction to realize more home runs than the opposing team had totals hits.  The first came in the fourth inning; he then hit a home run in each of the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings, becoming the first player in the modern era to do so.  He is the most recent player to hit four home runs in a game, doing so less than three months after Scooter Gennett hit four while playing for the Cincinnati Reds.  Martinez won the following National League (NL) Player of the Week Award—ending September 10—after batting .429, seven total home runs, and 11 RBI.\n\nOn September 17, Martinez recorded his 40th home run of the season, doing so against the San Francisco Giants, and reaching the milestone for the first time in his career.  He became just the fifth player to reach 40 home runs while playing for two different teams in one season. He was awarded the NL Player of the Week award for the period ending September 17, during which he batted .435 with three home runs, six RBIs, and eight runs scored over six games. He became the first NL player to win consecutive Player of the Week Awards since Bryce Harper in May 2015. It was Martinez' fourth weekly honor of 2017, making him the first player with four in the same season since the award was created in 1974. He hit his 16th home run of the month of September on September 28, tying Ralph Kiner in 1949 for the National League record for the month. Martinez was named NL Player of the Month for September, playing 24 games and hitting 16 home runs, .404 (40-for-99), eight doubles, 24 runs scored, and 36 RBIs.In 62 games with Arizona, Martinez hit .302 with 29 home runs and 65 RBIs.  His combined achievements with Detroit and Arizona in 2017 included a .303 batting average in 119 games played and new career-highs in each of 45 home runs, 104 RBI, .376 OBP, and eight intentional walks. Other career highs of .690 slugging percentage and 9.6 at bats per home run also led the major leagues, albeit without gaining the requisite number of plate appearances to qualify for rate statistic titles in either of the American or National Leagues.  He was second in the major leagues in OPS (1.066), third in home runs, fourth in OPS+ (166), and sixth in adjusted batting runs (41).  After the season, Martinez became a free agent for the first time of his career.Since joining the Tigers in 2014 until the end of the 2017 season, Martínez hit the 10th-most home runs in baseball while taking the second-fewest plate appearances of the top 20 home runs hitters. His slugging percentage trailed only Mike Trout, and he ranked in the top five in wOBA and wRC+, while batting .300 and .362 OBP.  His .690 slugging percentage in 2017 led all MLB hitters by 59 points before adding hitless plate appearances to qualify.  In terms of quality of contact, Martinez led MLB with a 49% hard contact rate, and only Aaron Judge managed more barrels per plate appearance.  Martinez ranked tenth with a 208-foot (63 m) average batted ball distance counting hitters who produced 250 or more batted ball events.  He ranked 12th with a 90.8 miles per hour (146.1 km/h) average exit velocity, and sixth in fly balls with an average exit velocity of 97.2 miles per hour (156.4 km/h).\n\nBoston Red Sox\n2018 season\nOn February 26, 2018, Martinez signed a five-year, $110 million contract with the Boston Red Sox. On April 7, Martinez hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform at Fenway Park, doing so off Chaz Roe of the Tampa Bay Rays.  Martinez won the AL Player of the Week Award for the week ending on May 20, after hitting five home runs, eight RBI, .346 average, and 1.414 OPS in seven games.  At that point, he had tied with teammate Mookie Betts for the major league home run lead at 15, making them the first duo in Red Sox history to both hit at least 15 home runs within the first 50 games of the season.  Martinez set the franchise record for home runs through the month of June, hitting his 25th on June 28 versus Andrew Heaney of the Los Angeles Angels.  The previous record of 24 had been achieved by Ted Williams (1950), Mo Vaughn (1996), Jose Canseco (1996) and Manny Ramirez (2001).Batting .329 with 27 home runs and 73 RBIs, Martinez was named to the 2018 MLB All-Star Game as the American League's starting designated hitter.  Spanning one full season of play from the 2017 MLB All-Star Game to July 14, 2018, he led the major leagues in home runs (60), RBIs (152), and OPS (1.074).  In a 19–12 win over the Baltimore Orioles on August 10, Martinez became the first player to reach 100 RBIs in the 2018 MLB season. Martinez again won the AL Player of the Week Award, for the week ending August 12, when he hit .464 with 11 RBIs and nine extra-base hits. He was also recognized as the AL Player of the Month for August, with a slash line of .373/.453/.686 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs in 26 games.Martinez finished the 2018 season with 43 home runs and a career high 130 RBIs, which led MLB.  He also led the Red Sox in home runs and hits.  In Game 1 of the ALDS, Martinez hit a three-run home run in the first inning off New York starter J. A. Happ; Boston won the game 5–4.  In Game 5 of the ALCS, Martinez hit a solo home run versus Houston starter Justin Verlander; Boston won the game, 4–1, to clinch a World Series berth and face the Los Angeles Dodgers.  In Game 5 of the World Series, Martinez homered in the seventh inning to increase the Red Sox lead to 4–1.  The Red Sox went on to win the game, capturing their ninth World Series title.  In the 2018 postseason, Martinez batted .300/.403/.520 with three home runs and 14 RBIs, tallying one home run in each of Boston's three playoff series.On October 26, Martinez was announced as the American League recipient of the annual Hank Aaron Award.  He won two Silver Slugger Awards, one as an outfielder and one as a designated hitter, becoming the first player to win more than one in the same season.  He was also named the Players Choice Award winner for 2018 Player of the Year.\n\n2019 season\nWhile visiting the Seattle Mariners on March 31, 2019, Martinez homered for his 1,000th career hit, walked twice and collected four RBIs.  In a road game versus the Baltimore Orioles on May 7,  he hit his 200th career home run. At the end of June, he had a .298 average with 18 home runs and 47 RBIs.  Martinez was selected as a reserve designated hitter to the 2019 All-Star Game. For the season, Martinez batted .304 with 36 home runs and 105 RBIs. He had the highest batting average against left-handers of all major league batters with 100 or more at bats against them (.404).  He had the lowest Soft Contact Percentage of all American League batters, at 10.2%.When asked about exercising his opt-out clause following the club's final regular season game, Martinez responded, \"I don't mind moving around. I kind of like it.\" However, on November 4, his agent Scott Boras announced that Martinez would not be exercising his opt-out and would remain with Boston.  Forbes magazine ranked Martinez as the world's 94th highest-paid athlete in 2019, totaling $25.6 million ($29.3 million today) in projected earnings.\n\n2020 season\nDuring the start-delayed 2020 season, Martinez was again Boston's primary designated hitter. He struggled at the plate, falling below the Mendoza Line (.200) on September 18. Overall with the 2020 Red Sox, he batted .213 with seven home runs and 27 RBIs in 54 games.\n\n2021 season\nMartinez returned in 2021 as Boston's primary designated hitter, starting the season batting 13-for-30 (.433) in Boston's first seven games. On April 10, he was briefly on the COVID-related list, missing one game. On April 11, Martinez recorded his third career game with three home runs, driving in four runs in a 14–9 win over the Baltimore Orioles. He became the fifth player in history to hit three home runs in one game for three different teams after Johnny Mize, Dave Kingman, Alex Rodriguez, and Mark Teixeira. He also became the second player in the modern era to record 12 extra-base hits in the first eight games of the regular season, the first being Dante Bichette in 1994. Martinez was subsequently named AL Player of the Week for the week of April 5–11. On July 4, he was named to the American League roster for the MLB All-Star Game. Martinez was placed on the COVID-related injured list on August 7, and returned to the lineup the next day. Overall with Boston during the regular season, Martinez played in 148 games while batting .286 with 28 home runs and 99 RBIs. After missing the Wild Card Game due to an ankle injury he suffered in the final game of the regular season, Martinez played in nine playoff games, batting 11-for-32 (.344), as the Red Sox advanced to the ALCS. During Game 2 of the ALCS, both Martinez and Rafael Devers hit grand slams, marking the first time an MLB team had two grand slams in a playoff game. On November 7, Martinez declined his opt-out clause for the third straight year, choosing to remain with the Red Sox for the 2022 season.\n\n2022 season\nMartinez returned for the 2022 season as Boston's primary DH.

Rhino Foods has grown from a small ice cream shop, Chessy's Frozen Custard, into a business with over 150 employees. In 2013, the company became a certified B Corporation joining nearly 5,000 companies worldwide in the unified goal to use business as a force for good for people and the planet. The company is best known locally for their ice cream sandwich, the Chesster.  In 1991, the company worked with Ben & Jerry's to develop the first cookie dough for use in ice cream. The company produces cookie dough and baked pieces for most major brands in the ice cream industry. The company also co-packs ice cream cookie sandwiches for national and international companies.\n\nEmployee Exchange program\nRhino Foods' operates the Employee Exchange Program (EEP) as a way to manage seasonal staffing demands to the benefit of employees and the company. The company sent 15 factory workers as temporary staff to the lip balm manufacturer Autumn Harp for a week to deal with the holiday rush.The Employee Exchange Program was developed in 1993 when a group of Rhino employees held brainstorming sessions on how to respond to a drop in staffing needs during the winter months.\n\nIncome Advance Program\nIn 2007, Rhino Foods started a new employee program to support short-term and long-term financial stability.  Any employee that has worked at the company for 12 months can get a same day loan up to a $1000 from Rhino's credit union partner.  The loan is paid off with automatic weekly payroll deductions.  When the loan is repaid the deduction rolls into a savings account in the employee's name unless the employee cancels it.  This helps employees build a relationship with a bank and improve their credit rating.\n\nTed Castle\nTed Castle is the founder, owner, and CEO of Rhino Foods. He is a former All-American hockey player at the University of Vermont from the 1970s. He coached in Vermont as well as Maine and played professionally in Italy and Sweden.

The original shop was called Chocolate House Candy and Ice Cream, and served candies purchased from Chocolate House of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and 19 flavors of homemade super-premium ice cream. The company expanded by opening additional locations in the Madison area, and selling ice cream to local restaurants and businesses. In the 1970s the company focused in on the ice cream business by ceasing their candy sales, building an ice cream manufacturing plant at 2221 Daniels St., Madison, WI and changing the company name to Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company.The Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream is now operated by Chuck Jr. and Dave Deadman. The company owns a manufacturing plant and four company-owned ice cream shops in Madison, manufactures over 100 ice cream flavors, and distributes products to over 600 independently owned ice cream parlors and businesses across the country.\n\nOperations\nChocolate Shoppe Ice Cream produces ice cream with 14% butterfat content and 35% overrun (air). The ice cream is kosher certified and made with rBGH-free cream. This includes flavors such as all natural \"Zanzibar Chocolate\" ice cream made with three kinds of cocoa, and for flavors such as \"Fat Elvis\" made with banana ice cream, a peanut butter ripple and chocolate chunks, and \"Scotch Ale Caramel Crunch\" made with scotch ale ice cream, caramel and heath pieces.\n\nSee also\nList of frozen yogurt companies\nPassage 3:\nBacon ice cream\nBacon ice cream (or bacon-and-egg ice cream) is an ice cream generally created by adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture. The concept of bacon ice cream originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke; it was eventually created for April Fools' Day by a New York ice cream parlour in 1982. In the 2000s, the English chef Heston Blumenthal experimented with ice cream, making a custard similar to scrambled eggs and adding bacon to create one of his signature dishes. It now appears on dessert menus in other restaurants.\n\nOrigins\nIce cream is generally expected to be a sweet food, eaten as a dessert, even though there is evidence of savoury ice creams eaten in Victorian times. Bacon ice cream originated as a joke, a flavour that no one would willingly eat, in the 1973 \"Ice Cream Parlour Sketch\" by The Two Ronnies, where a customer requests cheese and onion flavoured ice cream followed by smokey bacon.\nIn 1992, bacon-and-egg ice cream was created as an April Fools' Day experiment at Aldrich's Beef and Ice Cream Parlor in Fredonia, New York. Ten years earlier, co-owner Scott Aldrich was challenged by a gravy salesman to make beef gravy ice cream, which he did for April Fools' Day of 1982. Although it was reportedly \"their most disgusting\" creation, Aldrich's went on to release other unusual flavours on April Fools' Day, such as  \"chocolate spaghetti ice cream\" (Julia Aldrich's first of many contributions),\"ketchup and mustard swirl\", \"pork and beans\" or \"sauerkraut and vanilla\" in 1991. In 1992, they made 15 US gallons (57 L; 12 imp gal) of bacon-and-egg ice cream which he gave away free to anyone who would try it. The ice creams generally received positive reviews. In 1992, The Victoria Advocate reported,Despite the disgusting names, most of [Aldrich's] prank flavors taste good, he said. Bacon and egg tastes like a slightly nutty vanilla, though the faint flavor of flaky egg yolk sometimes pushes through.In 2003 an ice cream parlour, \"Udder Delight\", opened in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, specialising in \"outlandish\" ice cream flavours. Among other flavours, such as their award-winning peanut butter and jelly ice cream, they have created a bacon ice cream which tastes like butter pecan. The owner, Chip Hearn, had included the flavour along with 17 others in an invitation-only focus group, where the tasters were allowed to suggest changes and give opinions on the flavour.\n\nHeston Blumenthal\nThe English chef Heston Blumenthal creates unusual dishes using molecular gastronomy. His restaurant, the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, has won three Michelin stars among other achievements. As early as 2001, Blumenthal created savoury ice cream flavours such as mustard grain and crab. In an article explaining the concept of \"flavour encapsulation\", Blumenthal explained that flavour is much more intense in encapsulated bursts, rather than when dispersed in a solution; therefore, the more that eggs are cooked, the more that the proteins stick together. This creates pockets of egg flavour in the ice cream, which release as it melts in customers' mouths.\n[Blumenthal's] bacon and egg ice cream came about through his interest in \"flavour encapsulation\": the principle of which means a single coffee bean crushed in your teeth while drinking hot water will taste much more of coffee than the same crushed bean dissolved in the water. One day, using that principle, he over-cooked the egg custard for an ice cream, so that it practically became scrambled. He puréed that and made an ice cream from it, that had an immense eggy flavour... [which] was not particularly pleasant. Which was when he decided to see if he could incorporate the sweet tones of smoked bacon into an egg ice cream. Boy, did it work.\nTraditional ice cream is frozen egg custard with flavours added. Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar interacts with the proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins. The entire substance turns white, at which point flavouring can be added and cooked in. While stirring the mixture, Blumenthal cools it as fast as possible using liquid nitrogen.Blumenthal's bacon-and-egg ice cream, now one of his signature dishes, along with his other unique flavours, has given him a reputation as \"The Wizard of Odd\" and has made his restaurant a magnet for food enthusiasts. Blumenthal has stated that one ambition is to create an ice cream with flavours released in time-separated stages; for example, bacon and egg followed by orange juice or tea. Once he perfects the technique of separating the flavours, he would attempt mussels followed by chocolate.In the 2006 New Years Honours List, Blumenthal was awarded Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE), the United Kingdom's fourth highest order of chivalry, for his services to food.\n\nRecipes\nAs bacon ice cream was created in 1992 and came to prominence in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights the sweetness of the ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes in some parts of the United States.\n\nHeston Blumenthal variation\nBlumenthal's recipe uses ice cream without flavouring, but which tastes of egg. In the recipe featured in The Big Fat Duck Cookbook, the bacon is lightly roasted with the fat on, then infused in milk for 10 hours. The infused mix is precisely heated with egg and sugar to overcook the eggs, increasing the \"eggy\" flavour, then sieved, put through a food processor, churned and frozen. The ice cream is served with caramelised French toast, a tomato compote, a slice of pancetta hardened with maple syrup, and tea jelly.Blumenthal has since updated his recipe to include a ten-hour period of soaking the bacon in a vacuum-packed bag prior to baking. He has also changed the presentation so that the unfrozen ice cream is injected into empty egg shells, then dramatically scrambled at the customer's table in liquid nitrogen, giving the impression of cooking.\n\nReception\nBacon ice cream has received a mixed reception; as a combination of sweet and savoury flavours, it was designed to be controversial. In 2004, rival chef Nico Ladenis thought the Michelin system was doing a \"great disservice to the industry\" by hailing Blumenthal as a genius for egg-and-bacon ice-cream, saying that originality alone should not merit a Michelin star. Blumenthal pointed out that Ladenis had never tried the aforementioned ice cream.Trevor White has suggested that Blumenthal had latched onto a culture where diners cannot get enough of the new and are spoiled by choice, comparing the food to a \"freak show\". Janet Street-Porter has criticised Blumenthal's cooking as pretentious. She attempted to make his bacon-and-egg ice cream from the recipe published in his The Big Fat Duck Cookbook, altering the recipe slightly due to her hectic workload and guessing when she did not have the right tools. The result she described as nauseating and \"too sickly for words\".The ice cream sparked debate in the Los Angeles Times, when food writer Noelle Carter described bacon ice cream as perfection but the health section put up a photograph of a heart bypass and the headline \"Bacon ice cream. No good can come of it\". The Delaware \"Udder Delight\" ice cream maker, Chip Hearn, who made bacon ice cream appears to have done so partly as a gimmick to get people into his shop, since he allows customers to taste any flavour in the store. He felt that his flavours differentiated him from the many other parlours on the shore and many people come in to try bacon ice cream only to buy something else.\n\nNotable uses\nBacon ice cream has been recreated by other chefs in recent years. For example, it appears on the menu at Espai Sucre in Barcelona, a restaurant that specialises in desserts, with descriptions such as \"innovative\" and \"spectacular\". In the United States, bacon was one of the themes for dessert at the Fancy food show. In 2006, two separate contestants created versions of bacon ice cream in the reality series Top Chef. Celebrity chef Bob Blumer won a Texas ice cream making competition with a bacon ice cream. Originally planning to use candied bacon, he changed at the last moment to do a bacon brittle ice cream. Chef Michael Symon made bacon ice cream in the first season of the Food Network's The Next Iron Chef competition. Andrew Knowlton, a judge, dismissed it as not original. But Symon managed to progress in the competition and eventually win. Burger King rolled out a \"bacon sundae\", vanilla ice cream with caramel, chocolate, bacon bits, and one strip of bacon, in the summer of 2012 in the US. It was tested in Nashville in April.\n\nSee also\nList of bacon dishes\nList of ice cream flavors\nBeer ice cream\nChocolate-covered bacon\nBacon mania\n2010s in food\nPassage 4:\nIce Cream Man (album)\nIce Cream Man is a studio album by American rapper Master P.

Their primary operating region is in most states east of the Mississippi River. \nThe company's main products are ice cream and frozen yogurt, made on site with a milk-based mix at each individual store and made fresh in order to avoid ice crystal formation. There are 200 independently owned locations in 22 states, Guyana and South Korea.\n\nHistory\nBruce Reed got his start with the ice cream business in the 1950s, when, as a child, he helped out his parents at their diner, Jerry's Curb Service, in Bridgewater, Pennsylvania, a small town located 27 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. It was through this experience that Reed would learn from his dad the secrets to the restaurant business.In 1989, Reed opened an ice-cream shop right next door to Jerry's. Then Reed began operating under the Bruster's name after 15 months in the business.\nBruster's also began franchising and has outlets in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Guyana, and recently in South Korea as well. Bruster's remains headquartered in Bridgewater.\n\nCo-branding\nSome Bruster's locations also operate as franchisees of Nathan's Famous, with Nathan's hot dogs and other menu items sold in addition to ice cream.\n\nProducts\nThe recipe book that Bruster's uses consists of over 170 recipes. Bruster's also makes handmade ice cream cakes, homemade waffle cones, milkshakes, sundaes, and banana splits. Bruster's has recently introduced a limited range of non-dairy ice cream flavors made with oat milk.\nPassage 6:\nIce Cream Man (film)\nIce Cream Man is a 1995 American direct-to-video black comedy slasher film produced and directed by Norman Apstein and written by Sven Davison and David Dobkin. The film stars Clint Howard as the title character, Olivia Hussey, Jan-Michael Vincent, David Warner and David Naughton. The film's plot follows a deranged man (named \"Gregory Tudor\") who was recently released from a psychiatric institution and opens up an ice cream factory where he begins using human flesh in his recipes. The film has developed a cult following among viewers who see and enjoy it as an unintentional comedy for the film's campy production values. Joe Bob Briggs hosted the film on TNT when it was shown on MonsterVision. Howard himself made an appearance, discussing the film with Briggs. The film had an estimated $2 million budget and was released on DVD in 2004.\n\nPlot\nDuring the 1960’s in a Los Angeles suburb, young Gregory Tudor witnesses his local ice cream man, known as \"The Ice Cream King\", murdered in a drive-by shooting. In the present, Gregory has taken over the \"King's\" business, calling himself \"The Ice Cream Prince\", and using the man's truck and parlor. Unbeknownst to the public, Gregory uses the dilapidated parlor as a sort of laboratory, where he produces his concoctions, filled with insects and dismembered human pieces.\nOne night, Gregory kills a dog belonging to Nurse Wharton, his landlord and an orderly who treated him for his childhood trauma. The same night, Roger, a neighborhood boy, goes missing. Having witnessed Gregory's creepy personality, the other children suspect him of kidnapping Roger, but the police and Wharton do not. Three kids, Johnny, Heather, and Tuna, agree to search for Roger. Soon after, another boy known as Small Paul disappears.\nInitially unable to prove that Gregory is dangerous, the kids have a difficult time getting the police to pursue their claims. Meanwhile, Gregory has recurring flashbacks to his abusive treatment at the Wishing Well Sanatorium. As the kids dig deeper, they discover that Gregory kidnapped Roger and Small Paul, and imprisons them in a cage at the parlor. However, Small Paul shows a macabre interest in the experiments, so Gregory takes him under his wing.\nTwo detectives investigate the Wishing Well, which is unregulated and free-for-all; the unstable patients roam freely and cause chaos, while the doctors and administrators are insane. Escaping, the police now believe the children, and prepare to search for Roger and Small Paul. Gregory kidnaps Tuna, and Heather enlists the help of Tuna's older brother Jacob to investigate, but Gregory kills Jacob and Jacob's girlfriend. Small Paul baits Gregory by holding a photo of the Ice Cream King over his face, and leads him into the main mixer, where Gregory is dismembered.\nRoger and Tuna are reunited with their friends, who reveal that Small Paul has been sent to therapy. The final scene shows Small Paul alone in a darkened room, silently churning an ice cream bucket, his face twisted into an evil leer, just like Gregory's.\n\nCast\nClint Howard as Gregory Tudor\nMatthew McCurley as Young Gregory Tudor\nJustin Isfeld as Johnny Spodak\nAnndi McAfee as Heather Langley\nJoJo Adams as Tuna Cassera\nMikey LeBeau as Small Paul\nZachary Benjamin as Roger Smith\nOlivia Hussey as Nurse Wharton\nDavid Naughton as Martin Cassera\nSandahl Bergman as Marion Cassera\nKarl Makinen as Jacob Spodak\nSteve Garvey as Mr. Spodak\nJanet Wood as Mrs. Spodak\nAndrea Evans as Wanda\nStephanie Champlin as Janet\nJan-Michael Vincent as Detective Gifford\nLee Majors II as Detective Maldwyn\nTom Reilly as Charley\nStephen Fiachi as Gus\nDavid Warner as Reverend Langley\nJeanine Anderson as Mrs. Langley\nJessica Devlin as Mrs. Smith\nMarla Frees as Gregory's Mother\n\nCanceled sequel\nOn October 9, 2014, a Kickstarter campaign, backed by star Clint Howard, was started to fund a sequel (titled Ice Cream Man 2: Sundae Bloody Sundae) to coincide with the film's 20th anniversary. However, the campaign was closed on 30 October 2014 after only 70 backers and just over $4,000 was made. However, it is stated that the project has not been abandoned and stated that they are looking for a new crowdfunding structure and alternative financing for the film.

Ice Cream Man had over 100 volunteers committed to the idea of free ice cream for all.\n\nHistory\nIce Cream Man was founded by Matt Allen (aka Ice Cream Man), a resident of Long Beach, California. In the summer of 2004 Allen purchased a 1969 Chevrolet Step-Van in order to work as an ice cream man in Ashland, Oregon. At the end of the summer he decided to give away the leftover inventory to Ashland residents in the venue of an ice cream social at Garfield Park. The novelty of free ice cream garnered the attention of local news media and inspired Allen to base a startup project on the idea.\nIce Cream Man gained major media exposure when it was granted backstage access at the main stage of Lollapalooza 2006. Soon after, Ice Cream Man began receiving interview requests and attention from future sponsors. Since 2006, Ice Cream Man has been a backstage fixture at almost every US rock music festival including Lollapalooza, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Pitchfork Music Festival, ATP, Austin City Limits, SXSW, and Outside Lands Music Festival.\n\nBusiness model\nIce Cream Man’s business model is based on mutual exposure and advertisement. In exchange for funding of its operations, Ice Cream Man attempts to increase word-of-mouth promotion and build a popular association between its sponsors, free ice cream and the experience of music events. In this way, Allen states, Ice Cream Man is trying to establish a foothold in what he believes is a growing experience economy. The foremost example of Ice Cream Man’s business model is its use of two Yaris hatchbacks from Toyota as ice cream delivery vehicles for the 2009 summer season.\n\nSee also\nIce cream van\nPassage 9:\nFred Claus\nFred Claus is a 2007 American Christmas comedy film directed by David Dobkin, screenplay and a story by Dan Fogelman and Jessie Nelson, and starring Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Miranda Richardson, John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz, Kathy Bates, and Kevin Spacey. The film was first announced in October 2005 with Mike Mitchell attached to direct. The film was released in the United States on November 9, 2007 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is loosely based on the poem \"A legend of Santa and his brother Fred\" written by Donald Henkel. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $97 million worldwide against the production budget of $100 million.\n\nPlot\nIn the mid-19th century, young Frederick Claus grows up in the shadow of his younger brother Nicholas. Nick's selfless and kind attitude constantly wins the approval of his family over Fred, causing a strained relationship that is permanently damaged when Nick cuts down a tree, inadvertently destroying the bird house in which Fred's bird Chirp Chirp lived in. Due to Nick's saint-like personality, he is deemed a \"Saint\", and the family is gifted with immortality.\nIn the present, Nick has become the modern-day Santa Claus, delivering gifts to the children of the world. Fred has become a repossession agent in Chicago. Fred lives alone and is friends with orphan Samuel \"Slam\" Gibbons. After his girlfriend Wanda breaks up with him, Fred is arrested for impersonating a Salvation Army employee in an attempt to raise seed money for an illegal casino plan. Fred asks Nick for bail and seed money. Nick only agrees on the condition that Fred comes to the North Pole to work for the money.\nHead Elf Willie escorts Fred to the North Pole. Nick gives Fred the task of assigning children as \"naughty\" or \"nice\" based on their behavior. Efficiency expert Clyde Northcutt, from the agency which monitors the activities of supernatural entities, arrives to analyze the North Pole's dwindling performance on a three-strike assessment. Fred picks a fight with the workshop's DJ Donnie after he plays \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" on repeat, causing disruption that leads to Northcutt assigning the first strike. Nick sandbags Fred into having dinner that evening with their parents.\nLater that night, Northcutt shreds the children's letters. Fred is blamed for \"losing\" the letters, and the lack of backup copies leads to a second strike. Not believing Fred's denials, Nick has security abduct Fred, and bring him to an intervention, attended by their parents, Nick's wife Annette, Wanda, and a psychologist. Angered by Fred's self-centeredness and his obnoxious attitude, Wanda leaves him; Fred insults Nick and lambasts his parents for having favoritism. Following the intervention, Fred sees Slam on the top spot of the Naughty List; Fred realizes that Slam's bad behavior is a consequence of being bullied at the orphanage (along with some bad advice he gave him), and that Slam is a good kid. Fred then returns to his office and assigns every child as \"nice\".\nThe brothers get into a fight over Fred's decision, with Nick injuring his back. Unable to now produce enough gifts for every good child, the North Pole falls far behind schedule, leading Northcutt to assign the third strike, shutting down the workshop. Fred leaves, taking his money and a gift from Nick. Back in Chicago, Fred attends a meeting with the siblings of other celebrities in an attempt to sort out his issues. Fred opens his gift: a replica of the birdhouse Chirp Chirp lived in and a note from Nick apologizing for cutting down the tree. With a change of heart, Fred uses the seed money to make his way back to the North Pole.\nFred motivates the elves to make as many gifts as possible. Because of his injury, Nick is unable to deliver gifts. Feeling guilty, Fred decides to deliver the presents (as only a Claus can deliver the gifts). He reminds Nick that most of the \"naughty\" kids aren't bad, but good kids going through bad situations, and that every child deserves a gift on Christmas. Fred gets the workshop to quickly make simple gifts so that every child gets a toy. Fred and Willie begin to deliver the gifts, but Northcutt sabotages their efforts and fires the elves. Nick realizes that Northcutt was also bullied as a child, which caused him to become troubled. Nick apologizes to Northcutt for putting him at the top of the Naughty List in 1968 and gives him the Superman cape he had asked for as a child.\nDisguised as Santa, Fred visits Slam and gives him the dog he wanted for Christmas and tells Slam to become a better person. After every gift is delivered, Fred returns to the North Pole while Willie finally starts a relationship with the tall elf, Charlene. Fred and Nick make amends. Santa hires Northcutt to work at the North Pole. Slam is adopted. Fred reconciles with Wanda and takes her to Paris. The next Christmas, the Claus family is happily reunited including Chirp Chirp who now lives in the new birdhouse.\n\nCast\nVince Vaughn as Frederick \"Fred\" Claus\nJordon Hull as 6 year old Fred\nLiam James as 12 year old Fred\nPaul Giamatti as Nicholas \"Nick\"/\"Santa\" Claus\nTheo Stevenson as 6 year old Nick\nMiranda Richardson as Mrs. Annette Claus, Nick's wife.\nKathy Bates and Trevor Peacock as Mother and Father Claus, Fred and Nick's parents.

The website's critics consensus states: \"A slew of talent is wasted in this contrived and overly sentimental Christmas film, which can't quite get the balance between slapstick humor and  schmaltzy uplift.\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.Brian Lowry of Variety magazine said the film has many shortcomings but most of all Vaughn was miscast as his rapid-fire delivery and angry persona did not fit well with the story. Lowry describes it as following in the step of other feel-bad films, \"movies so tone-deaf and disagreeable as to have completely worn out their welcome by the time that gush of last-act warmth arrives.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $18,515,473 in its first weekend, and closed on February 14, 2008 with a final gross of $72,006,777 in North America and another $25,831,572 in other territories for a total worldwide gross of $97,838,349.

Though there are variations from the original flavor, it traditionally comprises chocolate ice cream, nuts, and whole or diced marshmallows.\n\nHistory\nAccording to one source, the flavor was created in March 1929 by William Dreyer in Oakland, California when he cut up walnuts and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream in a manner that reflected how his partner Joseph Edy's chocolate candy creation incorporated walnuts and marshmallow pieces. Later, the walnuts would be replaced by pieces of toasted almond. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dreyer and Edy gave the flavor its current name \"to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression. \" Alternatively, Fentons Creamery in Oakland claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road-style ice cream flavor invented by his friend, Fentons' George Farren, who blended his own Rocky Road-style candy bar into ice cream; however, Dreyer substituted almonds for walnuts.The original Rocky Road ice cream used chocolate ice cream with no chocolate chip pieces. By blending numerous ingredients such as chocolate ice cream, nuts, and marshmallows, the rocky road flavor was one of the first types to mix in the materials together. This style was developed by Dreyer's lead chemical engineer and dairy chef Noah Holladay and proved difficult to produce due to the nature of freezing and preserving various mixed ingredients. Over the years after the inception of the flavor, many companies would try to imitate or mix in other ingredients such as various nuts, fruits, and toppings, but the original combination proved to be the most popular. Some variations, such as the Breyers brand version, contain a “marshmallow swirl” as opposed to regular marshmallows.\n\nSee also\nList of ice cream flavors\nRocky road (dessert)\nRocky Road (candy bar)\n\"I Love Rocky Road\"", "answers": ["David Dobkin"], "length": 5609, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "17572470452faa7617467f79050b8233589347c9ce587dba"}

In 2017, she retired as a Professor of Chemistry and Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nCareer and education\nIn 1946, Stubbe was born in Champaign, Illinois. In 1968, Stubbe received a BS degree in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania, and worked as an undergraduate in the laboratory of Professor Edward R. Thornton. After she received her PhD degree in organic chemistry  under the guidance of Professor George Kenyon from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971, she did a very brief stint (1971-1972) as a postdoc at UCLA, where she worked on synthesizing LSD from tryptophan with Julius Rebek. Then, Stubbe taught at Williams College (1972-1977) discovered she didn't want to teach, but wanted to do research. Her realization sent her to Brandeis University (1975-1977), where she did a second postdoc with Bob Abeles. This is where she learned the art and science of creating mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors. She also taught at Yale School of Medicine (1977-1980) as an assistant professor in the department of pharmacology.In 1980, she moved to the University of Wisconsin, serving as assistant professor in the Biochemistry Department and rising to full professor in 1985. She was an assistant professor for a total of 12 years. In 1987, Stubbe became a professor in the MIT Chemistry Department, where she became the first woman to receive tenure in that department. She received a joint appointment in the MIT Biology Department in 1990.\n\nResearch\nStubbe has published over 300 scientific papers and has been frequently recognized for her research achievements. Before Stubbe's work, there were no chemical mechanisms that could be written for certain enzymes. She revolutionized the biochemistry field with her first two scientific papers on enzymes enolase and pyruvate kinase.Her first two publications in scientific journals showed the mechanisms for reactions that involved the enzymes enolase that metabolizes carbohydrates, and pyruvate kinase. Her first groundbreaking experiments were carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while she was at Yale, then the University of Wisconsin. She was trying to understand how the hydroxyl group at the 2’ position of the ribonucleotide's sugar was replaced by the hydrogen found in deoxyribonucleotides. To perform these experiments, she had to synthesize nucleotides that carried a heavy isotope at specific positions. Stubbe reportedly kept a bed in her office since she worked around the clock on her experiments. Stubbe pioneered the use of spectroscopic investigations of enzyme interactions and has devoted most of her career to elucidating the biochemical mechanisms behind free radicals. In her early work at Yale and then at the University of Wisconsin, Stubbe discovered how enzymes called ribonucleotide reductases use free-radical chemistry to convert nucleotides into deoxynucleotides, an essential process in DNA repair and replication. These enzymes catalyze the rate-determining step in DNA biosynthesis. Her analysis of the nucleotide reduction process shed light on the mechanism of action of the Eli Lilly & Co. anti-cancer drug gemcitabine, which is used to treat various carcinomas, such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.Stubbe, in collaboration with John Kozarich, also elucidated the structure and function of bleomycin, an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat cancer. They discovered how bleomycin induces DNA strand breaks in tumor cells, which in turn induces apoptosis.Before retiring, Stubbe studied the function of ribonucleotide reductases and the mechanisms of clinically useful drugs. She also extended her research into polyhydroxybutyrates, a class of biodegradable polymers that can be synthesized by bacteria under certain conditions and then converted into plastics. Stubbe's other research interests included the design of so-called suicide inhibitors and mechanisms of DNA repair enzymes.Stubbe was active on several committees, including review boards for the NIH grants committee and the editorial boards for various scientific journals.\n\nPersonal life\nStubbe's parents were teachers, and that is why she thought teaching is what she originally wanted to do as a career. Stubbe had a pet dog named Dr. McEnzyme Stubbe. The dog was a part of the research group and had its own email address and picture on the group's website.\n\nScientific societies\n1991 American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n1992 United States National Academy of Sciences (Biochemistry section)\n2004 American Philosophical Society\nAmerican Chemical Society\nAmerican Society for Biological Chemists\nProtein Society\n\nAwards and honors\n1986 Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry\n1989 ICI – Stuart Pharmaceutical Award for Excellence in Chemistry\n1990 MIT teaching award\n1991 American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellow Award\n1992 Myron L.

The stream source is in Howell County, Missouri, just south of US Route 160 west of Hocomo. The stream flows southwest into Ozark County, Missouri, and under Missouri Route 142 on the east side of Bakersfield. It then flows south through the extreme northwest corner of Fulton County, Arkansas, and into the northwest corner of Baxter County, Arkansas. It continues to the southwest and enters the northeast arm of Norfork Lake to the east of Gamaliel, Arkansas.

The borough of Belle Vernon is 2 miles (3 km) to the northwest. Pennsylvania Route 201 passes through Fairhope, leading north to Interstate 70 and south to Fayette City. As of the 2010 census, the population of Fairhope was 1,151.\n\nDemographics\nPassage 3:\nSullivan's Corner Historic District\nSullivan's Corner Historic District is a historic district encompassing a historical rural crossroads in northeastern Norfolk, Massachusetts.  The 18-acre (7.3 ha) district includes Norfolk's oldest cemetery, established c. 1736, and five 18th- to early 20th-century buildings currently used as residences.  The core of the old cemetery is on the northeast corner of Seekonk and Main Streets. The cemetery was enlarged north and east from that point in the 19th century.  Four of the five houses in the district face the cemetery across Seekonk Street; the fifth, 1 Needham Street, lies across Main Street at the corner, and is one of Norfolk's best-preserved Greek Revival buildings.  The building on the corner's northwest corner, Sullivan's Store, was built c. 1913, and is still somewhat recognizable as a corner store of the period, despite its conversion to residential use.  It is Norfolk's only commercial building from that period.The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Norfolk County, Massachusetts\nPassage 4:\nDade County, Georgia\nDade County is a county in the U.S. state of Georgia. It occupies the northwest corner of Georgia, and the county's own northwest corner is the westernmost point in the state. As of the 2020 census, the population is 16,251. The county seat and only incorporated municipality is Trenton. Dade County is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1860, residents of Dade County voted to secede from the state of Georgia and from the United States, but no government outside the county ever recognized this gesture as legal. In 1945, the county symbolically \"rejoined\" Georgia and the United States.\n\nHistory\nDade County was established in 1837 and was named for Major Francis Langhorne Dade, who was killed in the Dade Massacre by Seminole Indians in December 1835. The first settlers of Dade County won the land in the Georgia Land Lotteries, held to encourage settlement after the Cherokee people were forced off the land. Many settlers worked in regional coke and coal mines that contributed to development of the Chattanooga, Tennessee area.\nThe area was long isolated by its geography of mountains and rivers, which some historians say contributed to early residents' separatist attitudes. For the first century of Dade County's existence, no road connected it directly to the rest of Georgia, so visitors from elsewhere in the state had to reach it by way of Alabama or Tennessee. That changed in 1939 with the establishment of Cloudland Canyon State Park, and Georgia began work on Highway 136 to connect U.S. 41 to the recently created park. The Civilian Conservation Corps built many of the facilities and access roads to the park.\nDade County had a short-lived state secessionist movement before the American Civil War. In 1860, county residents wanted to secede from the Union, but lawmakers for the state of Georgia were cautious. Legend has it that in 1860, the people of Dade County were so impatient that they announced their own secession from both Georgia and the United States. On July 4, 1945, a telegram from President Harry S. Truman was read at a celebration marking the county's \"rejoining\" the Union. Historians say Dade's individual secession and readmission were symbolic and had no legal effect. They say that officially, Dade County seceded along with the state of Georgia in 1861 and re-entered the Union with the state in 1870.The noted Southern humorist, author and seminal writer of Southern humor George Washington Harris (1814-1869) is buried in the Brock Cemetery in Trenton. Although he greatly influenced the literary works of Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor, his grave was not verified and given a marker until 2008.\nIn 1964, Covenant College established a campus at Lookout Mountain. Founded in 1955 in California, it was ready to expand after a year. Several professors led Covenant to move to St. Louis, Missouri, where it developed for eight years. After outgrowing its facilities there, the college decided to move to Dade County.\n\nQuarter controversy\nShortly after the Georgia State Quarter was released by the US Mint, Dade County gained attention because of an apparent mistake in the design. As shown on the quarter, the state appears to lack Dade County, in the extreme northwestern part of the state. Some accounts in 2012 suggest the exclusion was intended to refer to the local legend of Dade County's secession from Georgia.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 174 square miles (450 km2), of which 174 square miles (450 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) (0.1%) is water.The county, like most of northwest Georgia, is entrenched in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In addition, a vast majority of the county is located in the Middle Tennessee-Chickamauga sub-basin of the Middle Tennessee-Hiwassee basin. A very small part of the southernmost tip of the county is located in the Upper Coosa River sub-basin in the ACT River Basin (Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin), while a small part of the westernmost portion of Dade County is located in the Guntersville Lake sub-basin in the Middle Tennessee-Elk basin.\n\nMajor highways\nI-24 / SR 409\n I-59 / SR 406\n US 11 / SR 58\n SR 136\n SR 157\n SR 189\n SR 299\n SR 301\n\nAdjacent counties\nMarion County, Tennessee (north/CST Border)\nHamilton County, Tennessee (northeast)\nWalker County (southeast)\nDeKalb County, Alabama (southwest/CST Border)\nJackson County, Alabama (west/CST Border)\n\nProtected areas\nChickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park (part)\nCloudland Canyon State Park\n\nDemographics\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 15,154 people, 5,633 households, and 4,264 families living in the county.

The city of Atlanta, Georgia wanted to gain rights to the water in Nickajack Lake to supplement their sources from Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona. In addition, in 2008 Georgia lawmakers wanted to change the Tennessee-Georgia state line, as they say it is based on a flawed 1818 survey, which mistakenly placed Georgia's northern line just short of the Tennessee River. Changing the boundary would give Georgia rights to the water, but they were unsuccessful.\n\nPolitics\nAlthough it contained many opponents of the Confederacy during the Civil War, Dade County – unlike more easterly Fannin, Towns, Pickens and Gilmer – is a typical “Solid South” county in its political history. It voted Democratic in every presidential election until 1964, when the county turned towards conservative Republican Barry Goldwater. Since then, only twice has a Republican presidential candidate lost Dade County: when segregationist former and future Alabama Governor George Wallace carried the county in 1968 and when favorite son Jimmy Carter won in 1976. In 1972, Dade was Richard Nixon’s strongest county nationwide in his 2,900-plus-county landslide over George McGovern.\n\nCommunities\nCities\nTrenton\n\nCensus-designated places\nNew England\nWest Brow\nWildwood\n\nOther unincorporated communities\nHead River\nHooker\nMorganville\nNew Home\nNew Salem\nRising Fawn\n\nGhost towns\nCole City\nTatum\n\nNotable people from Dade County\nThe Forester Sisters\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Dade County, Georgia\nNorthwest Georgia Joint Development Authority\nTown Line, New York, seceded from the United States (unrecognized) and rejoined in 1946.\nList of counties in Georgia\nPassage 5:\nNelson, New Hampshire\nNelson is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 629 at the 2020 census, down from 729 at the 2010 census. Nelson includes the village of Munsonville.\n\nHistory\nOriginally named \"Monadnock No. 6\", the town was granted in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in 1767 by Breed Batchelder. On February 22, 1774, the town was incorporated by Governor John Wentworth as \"Packersfield\", after a major proprietor, Thomas Packer, the sheriff at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The name was changed in 1814 to Nelson in honor of Viscount Horatio Nelson, British admiral and naval hero.Located on the height of land separating the watersheds of the Connecticut and Merrimack rivers, Nelson became primarily an agricultural community. The uneven surface proved good for grazing. But with streams rising from four ponds to provide water power, it also developed industry. The village of Munsonville, situated on the stage line at the outlet of Granite Lake, manufactured cotton cloth and chairs. The L. J. Colony Chair Co. produced between 25,000 and 30,000 chairs annually, hiring women and children from local farms to weave the rattan seats and backs. At one time, Munsonville had 1,000 homesteads and 10 school districts. The mills have since closed, and Munsonville is today a resort of summer homes.Nelson is the home of a popular Monday night contradance. Similar dances have been held for over 200 years in Nelson's town hall. Many make the claim that this is the longest running public contradance in the world, though there have been no attempts to document this as an \"official\" record. The Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music, a classical chamber music group which attempts to bring members of cultures in conflict (such as Israelis and Palestinians) closer together through music, is also in Nelson.\n\nGeography\nNelson is located in the eastern part of Cheshire County, in southwestern New Hampshire. Its eastern border is the Hillsborough County line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 23.3 square miles (60.3 km2), of which 21.9 square miles (56.7 km2) are land and 1.4 square miles (3.5 km2) are water, comprising 5.88% of the town. The eastern part of the town drains towards the Contoocook River, a tributary of the Merrimack River and part of the Gulf of Maine watershed, while the western part of the town feeds tributaries of the Ashuelot River, part of the Connecticut River watershed draining to Long Island Sound. Spoonwood Pond and part of Nubanusit Lake are in the east. Part of Silver Lake is in the south, and part of Granite Lake is in the north. The village of Munsonville is located at the outlet of Granite Lake. The highest point in Nelson is the summit of Osgood Hill (also known as Nelson Pinnacle), with an elevation of 2,253 feet (687 m) above sea level.\nThe town is crossed by the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a 50-mile-long (80 km) hiking trail that traverses the highlands of southern New Hampshire from Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey to Mount Sunapee in Newbury. The trail passes directly through the center of Nelson.\nThe town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 9.\n\nAdjacent municipalities\nStoddard (north)\nAntrim (northeast)\nHancock (east)\nHarrisville (south)\nRoxbury (southwest)\nSullivan (west)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 729 people, 303 households, and 208 families residing in the town.

The church is a rectangular Tudor Gothic building dedicated in 1847, with an addition in 1865.  The front features two 60 foot flanking octagonal towers are also crenelated and have louvered belfry openings and stained glass Gothic-arched windows. The manse / parsonage at the north end has similar matching walls of brick, heavy Tudor-Gothic window hoods, and battlements atop the roof and was built in 1857.\nThis church was incorporated in 1844 by a group of men from the First Presbyterian Church then located at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street and North Street (now Guilford Avenue) in downtown (later relocated in 1854 to West Madison Street and Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood after selling their previous third church building of 1790-95 to the Federal Government which built a U.S. Courthouse there [to 1889, replaced again 1932] dedicated in 1860 by 16th President James Buchanan). They felt the need for a new church in that fast-growing northern section of the city formerly \"Howard's Woods\" of Col. John Eager Howard's (Revolutionary War commander of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army)  country estate \"Belvidere\" (mansion located at intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets, razed 1875) where the Washington Monument was erected with its four surrounding park squares just two blocks from their new building.\nFranklin Street Church was also located on \"Cathedral Hill\" in the southern part of the community bordering downtown Baltimore to the south and across the street from the old Baltimore Cathedral (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, erected 1806-1821 and designed by Benjamin Latrobe - first Catholic cathedral constructed in America. Later in 1882–1886, philanthropist Enoch Pratt founded his central library for the new Enoch Pratt Free Library then facing West Mulberry Street at Cathedral, a block further south which was replaced in 1931-33 by a new central library building facing Cathedral Street and encompassing the entire block and now directly across Franklin Street from the F.S.P.C.In 1973, the two historic downtown area congregations reunited to form The First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and was centered at the First Church site on West Madison and Park. The Franklin Street building was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist independent Protestant congregation and later re-sold to the present \"New Unity Church Ministries\".\nAcross Cathedral Street to the northeast was the 1820s era Greek Revival style home with large front columns, designed by Robert Mills (who also did the iconic landmark Washington Monument two blocks away) which later was occupied by the original Maryland Club, an exclusive Southern-leaning dining and leisure society of gentlemen, founded 1857 that was once threatened by Massachusetts State Militia commander, Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, U.S.A. when he occupied Baltimore on May 13, 1861, a month after the infamous \"Pratt Street Riots\", when mobs of Southern sympathizing Baltimoreans attacked passing state militia from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania at the beginning of the Civil War on Thursday/Friday, April 18-19th. General Butler's troops fortified Federal Hill with a battery redoubt named Fort Federal Hill and with numerous cannons overlooking the harbor basin (later renamed \"Inner Harbor\" in the 1960s) and surrounding city, \"to put a shot into it\" if he spied a reputed rebel flag flying or any discontent to the Union Army declared martial law. The Club later moved a few city blocks further north to North Charles and East Eager Streets in 1892 and the Cathedral and Franklin mansion was later replaced in 1907-08 by the former Central Building of the Young Men's Christian Association of Central Maryland (YMCA) which was closed in 1984 and the building renovated as the Mount Vernon Hotel and Café, and again subsequently as the Hotel Indigo in 2017.\nThe church is no longer used by a Presbyterian congregation and is currently occupied since the 1970s by the New Unity Church Ministries / New Unity Baptist Church, with Pastor Johnny N. Golden, sr. John Gresham Machen, the founder of Westminster Seminary of the Presbyterians, attended the church as a child.The church and manse / parsonage in the rear (at 502 Cathedral Street, at southwest corner with West Hamilton Street [alley]) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5, 1971.

The three-unit townhouse structure was built for, and originally owned by, George Henry Williams, a former United States Attorney General, United States Senator (for Oregon), and Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice.  Later, Williams also served as mayor of Portland.  The townhouses were built as a business investment, and Williams did not reside in the building.  The structure was moved in 1922.  Although always situated within the block bounded by NW 18th and 19th Avenues, and NW Couch and Davis Streets, it was originally in the block's northwest corner, i.e. at the southeast corner of the intersection of NW 19th and Davis.

Lobster Stream connects the northwest corner of the lake to the West Branch Penobscot River 1.4 miles (2.3 km) north of the lake. Lobster Lake and the river are at a similar elevation; so the West Branch may temporarily reverse flow through Lobster Stream into the lake during peak runoff events from the western Maine highlands along the Canadian border. The lake has self-sustaining populations of native lake trout and land-locked Atlantic salmon; but brook trout populations are suppressed by competition from yellow perch and white perch.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPassage 10:\nBuchanan Township, Atchison County, Missouri\nBuchanan Township is one of eleven townships in Atchison County, Missouri, United States.

P. Dutton. The novel, set in five parts, tells the family history of succeeding generations of characters named George Mills. The story covers more than 1,000 years from the First Crusade in Europe to the Ottoman Empire to present-day America. Elkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. Elkin mentioned George Mills as one of his favorite novels. The novel is considered Elkin's \"longest and most complexly organized work\".: 189\n\nPlot\nThe first George Mills sets out on a journey with his lord on the First Crusade. But he eventually gets lost in the Netherlands and reaches a salt mine in Poland. His lord at the mines is Guillalume, who teaches him some life lessons. Mills becomes aware of what is written in his fate and this helps him understand the walks of life in this world in a better manner. Despite having the knowledge of what would happen in the future, his timidity and powerlessness does not bring out any situation-changing effects. \nThe novel covers the history of succeeding family members named George Mills and all of them are aware of their fates and equally feeble and ineffective in changing their circumstances. The 43rd Mills encounters King George IV and is assigned on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, where he first joins the Janissaries but later ends up in the Ottoman Sultan's harem doing household chores. He escapes from there and reaches America. The present-day Mills in America is a caretaker of an old woman named Judith Glazer in St. Louis, who is in the final stages of terminal cancer. Mills accompanies Glazer to Mexico and upon her death participates in her funeral together with her family.\n\nPublication\nElkin worked for over seven years writing George Mills and by the end of its completion, he felt exhausted and insisted this would be his last fictional work. But after watching a British news report of how terminally ill children had a memorable experience at Disneyland, he wrote his next novel, The Magic Kingdom (1985), and dedicated it to his son who had died young from a medical ailment after lengthy treatments.George Mills was published on 25 October 1982. In 1989, Elkin mentioned that several sections of George Mills had been adapted from the 1936 novel Absalom, Absalom! by William Faulkner. He also mentioned that in writing the novel, he came to realise \"that I was a novelist, that anything I say is a part of this novel is a part of this novel\".: 194\n\nReview and reception\nKirkus Reviews called the novel \"a leaky collection of parts rather than one whole strong book\" but said it was required reading for connoisseurs of comic fiction. The New York Times reviewer Leslie Epstein complimented \"the novel's fine writing, flashes of humor and memorable heroine\", but felt that the plot was \"out of control\". Brad Owens of The Christian Science Monitor praised the novel for its \"energetic entertainment\" and said that it \"sometimes overpowers its more serious intentions\".\n\nAwards\nElkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel.  The novel was nominated along with Levitation: Five Fictions (by Cynthia Ozick), Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant (by Anne Tyler),  The Color Purple (by Alice Walker), and Shiloh and Other Stories (by Bobbie Ann Mason). Elkin also won the award in 1995 for his novel Mrs. Ted Bliss.\nPassage 3:\nLiterary agent\nA literary agent is an agent who represents writers and their written works to publishers, theatrical producers, film producers, and film studios, and assists in sale and deal negotiation. Literary agents most often represent novelists, screenwriters, and non-fiction writers. \nReputable literary agents generally charge a commission and do not charge a fee upfront. The commission rate is generally 15%.\n\nDiversity\nLiterary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent—for example—authors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry.\nLegitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to Writer's Market listings, many agents in the United States are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics.\n\nSee also\nWriter's Market\nList of UK literary agencies\nPassage 4:\nAnne Lamott\nAnne Lamott (born April 10, 1954) is an American novelist and non-fiction writer.\nShe is also a far-left progressive political activist, public speaker, and writing teacher. Lamott is based in Marin County, California. Her nonfiction works are largely autobiographical. Lamott's writings, marked by their self-deprecating humor and openness, cover such subjects as alcoholism, single-motherhood, depression, and Christianity.\n\nLife and career\nLamott was born in San Francisco, and is a graduate of Drew School. She was a student at Goucher College for two years where she wrote for the newspaper. Her father, Kenneth Lamott, was also a writer. Her first published novel Hard Laughter was written for him after his diagnosis of brain cancer. She has one son, Sam, who was born in August 1989 and a grandson, Jax, born in July 2009.Lamott's life was documented in Freida Lee Mock's 1999 documentary Bird by Bird with Annie: A Film Portrait of Writer Anne Lamott. Because of the documentary and her following on Facebook and other online networks, she is often called the \"People's Author\".\nLamott has described why she writes: I try to write the books I would love to come upon, that are honest, concerned with real lives, human hearts, spiritual transformation, families, secrets, wonder, craziness—and that can make me laugh. When I am reading a book like this, I feel rich and profoundly relieved to be in the presence of someone who will share the truth with me, and throw the lights on a little, and I try to write these kinds of books. Books, for me, are medicine. \n\nLamott was featured on the second episode of the first season of the show The Midnight Gospel.\n\nAwards and honors\nLamott was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985. She was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nPersonal life\nOn April 13, 2019, when Lamott was 65, she wed for the first time. She married Neal Allen, 63, a former vice president for marketing at the McKesson Corporation in San Francisco. The couple had met in August 2016. He was a twice-divorced father of four, who had left his job at McKesson to devote himself to writing.\n\nBibliography\nNovels\nHard Laughter. Viking Press. 1980. ISBN 0-670-36140-2.\nRosie.

His extravagant, satirical fiction revolves around American consumerism, popular culture, and male-female relationships.\n\nBiography\nElkin was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Chicago from age three onwards. He did both his undergraduate and graduate work at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, receiving a bachelor's degree in English in 1952 and a Ph.D. in 1961 for his dissertation on William Faulkner. During this period he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957. In 1953 Elkin married Joan Marion Jacobson. He was a member of the English faculty at Washington University in St. Louis from 1960 until his death, and battled multiple sclerosis for most of his adult life. In 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.During his career, Elkin published ten novels, two volumes of novellas, two books of short stories, a collection of essays, and one (unproduced) screenplay. Elkin's work revolves about American pop culture, which it portrays in innumerable darkly comic variations. Characters and especially prose style take full precedence over plot. His language is extravagant and exuberant, baroque and flowery, taking fantastic flight from his characters' endless patter. \"He was like a jazz artist who would go off on riffs,\" said critic William Gass. In a review of George Mills, Ralph B. Sipper wrote, \"Elkin's trademark is to tightrope his way from comedy to tragedy with hardly a slip.\" About the influence of ethnicity on his work Elkin said he admired most \"the writers who are stylists, Jewish or not. Bellow is a stylist, and he is Jewish. William Gass is a stylist, and he is not Jewish. What I go for in my work is language.\"\nAlthough living in the Midwest, Elkin spent his childhood and teenage summers in a bungalow colony called West Oakland, on the Ramapo River in northern New Jersey not far from Mahwah, the home of Joyce Kilmer. This was a refuge for a close-knit group of several score families, mostly Jewish, from the summer heat of New York City and urban New Jersey. Elkin's writings placed in New Jersey were informed by this experience.Elkin won the National Book Critics Circle Award on two occasions: for George Mills in 1982 and for Mrs. Ted Bliss, his last novel, in 1995. The MacGuffin was a finalist for the 1991 National Book Award for Fiction. However, although he enjoyed high critical praise, his books have never enjoyed popular success. The 1976 Jack Lemmon film Alex & the Gypsy was based on Elkin's novella \"The Bailbondsman\".\nElkin died May 31, 1995, of a heart attack, twenty days after his 65th birthday. His manuscripts and correspondence are archived in Olin Library at Washington University in St. Louis. Elkin's literary legacy is represented by the literary agency headed by Georges Borchardt.\nHe has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nWorks\nNovels\nBoswell: A Modern Comedy (1964)\nA Bad Man (1967)\nThe Dick Gibson Show (1971)\nThe Franchiser (1976)\nThe Living End (novella) (1979) ISBN 978-0525070207\nGeorge Mills (1982)\nThe Magic Kingdom (1985)\nThe Rabbi of Lud (1987)\nThe MacGuffin (1991) ISBN 978-0671673246\nMrs. Ted Bliss (1995)\n\nStory collections\nCriers and Kibitzers, Kibitzers and Criers (1966)\nEarly Elkin (1985)\n\nNovella collections\nSearches and Seizures (1973) (U.K. title: Eligible Men (1974))\nVan Gogh's Room at Arles (1993)\n\nOther works\n\"A Prayer for Losers\", from the Why Work Series (edited by Gordon Lish) (1966)\nStanley Elkin's Greatest Hits (anthology; foreword by Robert Coover) (1980)\nThe Six-Year-Old Man (screenplay) (1987)\nPieces of Soap (collected essays) (1992)\n\nLimited editions\nThe First George Mills  (Part One of George Mills; 376 copies, all signed by Elkin and the illustrator, Jane E.

Membership is open to writers and translators who have published at least 100 pages of non-fiction, and the association has approximately 5300 members.\nThe Norwegian Non-fiction Writers Association was founded in 1978. In 1990, it merged with The Norwegian Non-fiction Translators Association to form The Norwegian Non-fiction Writers And Translators Association (NFF).\nNFF secures and protects the professional and economic interests of authors and translators by negotiating contracts and agreements with public and private institutions. NFF also strives to promote high quality non-fiction literature and to strengthen the Norwegian language. The association offers courses and seminars to members and non-members alike.\n\nThe Non-fiction Literary Fund\nNFF has collected remuneration for public lending right (PLR) since 1979 and remuneration for the reproduction of non-fiction works since 1980. The revenue from these remuneration schemes is deposited in the Non-fiction Literary Fund. The purpose of the fund is to support the production of Norwegian non-fiction, primarily through grant schemes for non-fiction authors and translators.\nThe grants from the Non-fiction Literary Fund amount to approximately US$7.5 million per year. $4.5 million is paid in the form of project grants to authors and translators working on a book project. The remainder is paid as travel grants and as honorary grants to authors and translators of at least 67 years of age.\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Website\nPassage 7:\nSteven Zwicker\nSteven Nathan Zwicker (born June 4, 1943) is an American literary scholar and the Stanley Elkin Professor in the Humanities in Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nBiography\nZwicker is an expert on Restoration-era English literature and politics and is the author of Dryden's Political Poetry: The Typology of King and Nation (1972), Politics and Language in Dryden's Poetry: The Arts of Disguise (1984), and Lines of Authority: Politics and English Literary Culture, 1649-1689 (1993).

Shoemaker has edited and published books under several imprints, including North Point, Pantheon Books, Shoemaker & Hoard, and Counterpoint. Shoemaker has published books by Guy Davenport, Romulus Linney, Gary Snyder, Wendell Berry, Evan S. Connell, MFK Fisher, James Salter, Gina Berriault, Reynolds Price, W.S. Merwin, Michael Palmer, Donald Hall, Anne Lamott, Kay Boyle, Gary Nabhan, Jane Vandenburgh, Carole Maso, and Robert Aitken. Shoemaker supports author-driven literary publishing ventures and mindfulness and political awareness in publishing. Shoemaker was one of the first American publishers of Thich Nhat Hanh, and a major publisher of Wendell Berry.\n\nBackground\nJack Shoemaker was born in California and began his literary career as a bookseller in 1965 in Santa Barbara. During the next twenty-five years he owned or managed several influential independent literary bookshops, including The Unicorn Bookshop, Serendipity Books, and Sand Dollar Booksellers & Publishers. He allowed books to stay on the shelves longer than usual. He also corresponded with writers such as Gary Snyder, Robert Duncan, and Guy Davenport and stocked his store with titles they recommended. “I had good instincts, I had enormous presumption, and most of all I had good advisors,” Shoemaker has said of that time. “I was, still am, an autodidact.  I did not go to college, so for me the correspondence and reading formed my path in education.”\n\nPublishing\nJack Shoemaker moved from bookselling to publishing.  An early publishing venture, Unicorn, evolved from a bookstore in Isla Vista, near the campus of University of California-Santa Barbara operated by Shoemaker from 1967 to 1968. In that capacity, Unicorn published in 1968 a book of poems, The Cry of Vietnam, by Thich Nhat Hanh at a time when he was a little known Vietnamese Buddhist priest.  A second volume published by Unicorn, Hark, Hark, the Nark, was a pamphlet that instructed readers on their civil rights in the event of an arrest for drug possession.  Unicorn was followed by Sand Dollar, Booksellers and Publishers, which began operations in 1970 from Berkeley, California, “a bookshop for poets.” \nShoemaker continued his career as a bookseller until 1979, when he co-founded North Point Press with William Turnbull, a civil engineer who loved literature. North Point began with authors Shoemaker had worked with, including Berry, Snyder, Aitken, Fisher, Connell, Salter, and Davenport. Shoemaker served as the company’s editor-in-chief for the entire life of the company. It lasted 12 years and published nearly 400 works, some of which won awards.When North Point closed in 1991, several of its authors followed Shoemaker to Pantheon, where he served as West Coast editor of the Knopf Publishing Group. Frank H. Pearl, an entrepreneur who specialized in leveraged buyouts, recruited Shoemaker to found Counterpoint Press in 1994 in Washington, D.C., and Shoemaker’s core group of authors followed him once again.  In 2004 Shoemaker left Counterpoint, and with his longtime associate Trish Hoard established a new company, Shoemaker & Hoard, Publishers, to continue his work. Soon affiliated with the Avalon Publishing Group, Shoemaker & Hoard published more than 100 titles in its few years of existence. Additional writers published by Shoemaker, either at Counterpoint or at Shoemaker & Hoard, include Michael Downing, Robert Bringhurst, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Nicholas Christopher, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Peter Coyote, Jay Griffiths, Robert Hass, Ann Pancake, Jed Perl, Mary Robison, Valerie Trueblood, Lawrence Wechsler, Janet Frame, and Cynthia Shearer. Later partnering with Charlie Winton, Shoemaker purchased Counterpoint Press from the Perseus Book Group, and another press, Soft Skull Press. At that time Counterpoint Press also formed an operating agreement with Sierra Club Books.The new endeavor, consisting now of three separate imprints, operates from offices in Berkeley, California.\n\nAmerican Buddhism\nAs an editor and publisher Shoemaker has exerted influence on Buddhism in the United States, publishing notable translations of Buddhist sutras and texts, including work by Red Pine, Thomas Cleary, Norman Waddell, and David Hinton. Shoemaker has published in English great Zen masters, including Baisao, Bankei, Bassui, Bodhidharma, Dogen, Hakuin, Muso, Senzaki, and several others. Shoemaker first became interested in Zen Buddhism through the work of Gary Snyder and Kenneth Rexroth. Shoemaker was a student of Robert Aitken and published several books of Aitken's including Taking the Path of Zen, thought by many to be the best practical introductory guide to the study and practice of Zen. Later he co-edited with Aitken's senior Dharma heir, Nelson Foster, The Roaring Stream: A New Zen Reader, an anthology of Zen texts. “As a Buddhist, I’m simply a beginner,” Shoemaker told an interviewer in 2005. “There are many of us trying to discover if there can be an authentic American Buddhism, oriented toward lay practitioners.”\n\nAwards and honors\nShoemaker served from 1974–1978 on the Literature Panel of the National Endowment of the Arts, serving his last eighteen months as that panel’s chairman.  He has also served on the California Arts Council, the Western States Arts Foundation panel, the North Carolina Arts Council literature panel, and several other boards and awards panels devoted to literature, the visual arts, and dance. Shoemaker was a co-founder of Small Press Distribution, a distributor for the work of dozens of small independent American presses.\nTogether with Jack Hicks and Gary Snyder, he founded The Art of the Wild, a summer program in Squaw Valley, California, devoted to the practice and study of writing related to environmental concerns and natural history. Shoemaker also serves on the advisory board of Fishtrap, a literary non-profit in Wallowa County, Oregon, that offers workshops, conferences, and residencies to develop writing talent among Western writers. In 1981 Publishers Weekly named Shoemaker the recipient of the Carey-Thomas Award for Creative Publishing.  PubWest awarded him the 2013 Jack D. Rittenhouse Award for lifetime achievement and contributions to the Western book community.\n\nPersonal\nJack Shoemaker married Vicki Guerin in 1965. They had two children, Sean Shoemaker, and Demian Shoemaker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1991. In 1996 he married California novelist Jane Vandenburgh in Washington, D.C. They raised her child from a previous marriage, Eva Zimmerman. Shoemaker lives with his family in Point Richmond, California.\nPassage 9:\nMrs. Ted Bliss\nMrs. Ted Bliss is a 1995 novel by American author Stanley Elkin, published by Hyperion Books. It concerns the last eventful years in the life of an old widow. Elkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for this work.\n\nPlot\nMrs. Dorothy Bliss is an old woman in her early 80s living alone in a retirement community near Miami Beach, Florida, after her husband's death due to cancer. She was born in Russia and is Jewish. Her mother bribed an immigration officer and added three years to her age on legal documents in order that she could start working in Manhattan's Lower East Side after their immigration. Her husband, Ted Bliss, had a butcher shop in Chicago and together they had three kids. Her oldest son dies of cancer at a young age and after her husband's retirement, the couple moved to Florida. She is obsessed with cleaning and also keeps records of the gifts given to her grandchildren in order to keep track and stay impartial with everyone.The single life of Mrs. Bliss is now filled with expectations of finding a romance or a partner but eventually she is disappointed and heartbroken. She gets involved with Alcibiades Chitral, a drug lord who operates in her neighborhood, and starts using her and her husband's car as a front for his activities. The story keeps introducing various new men in her life, such as Hector Camerando, a jai alai pro who helps Mrs. Bliss with some tips on dogs, and Tommy Auveristas, an imposter. Junior Yellin, a once upon a time lover with whom Mrs. Bliss had had a passionate encounter in her husband's butcher shop, also makes a re-entry into her life. She eventually dies when Hurricane Andrew hits Miami and brings massive destruction.\n\nPublication\nFollowing Elkin's death on 31 May 1995 at age 65, the novel was released posthumously on 7 September 1995. Elkin had published ten novels, five short-story collections, and various novellas and non-fiction articles in various magazines and papers during the course of his writing career, which began in the 1950s.\n\nReview and reception\nKirkus Reviews writes that Elkin makes readers believe that the novel has a plot when drug dealers are introduced in it. However, \"there isn't so much a plot as an accumulation of detail about Mrs. Bliss\". Elkin's \"long poetic sentences about seemingly mundane minutiae\" later bring substance to the character of Mrs. Bliss. Walter Goodman, a television critic for The New York Times, mentions in his review that \"[the book] may not be Stanley Elkin's best, but it is a smart, generous, melancholy, funny, even elegiac work by a prodigious practitioner\". Publishers Weekly writes that \"Elkin is at his best here, blessed with the gift of one-liner insight and a definite, if reluctantly exercised, ability to tug on a reader's heartstrings\".\n\nAwards\nElkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. The book was nominated along with Independence Day (by Richard Ford),  Galatea 2.2 (by Richard Powers), Moo (by Jane Smiley), and The Tent of Orange Mist (by Paul West). Elkin had earlier won in the same category for his 1982 novel George Mills.\nPassage 10:\nGwyn Avenue–Bridge Street Historic District\nGwyn Avenue–Bridge Street Historic District is a national historic district located at Elkin, Surry County, North Carolina. The district encompasses 124 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site in a predominantly residential section of Elkin.  They were primarily built between about 1891 and 1955 and include notable examples of Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Bungalow / American Craftsman architecture. Notable buildings include the Elkin Presbyterian Church (1937, 1944, 1950, 1955, 1961), First Baptist Church (1955, 1968), Alexander Martin Smith House (1893–1897) designed by George Franklin Barber, the Gwyn-Chatham-Gwyn House (c. 1872, 1911, 1936), Richard Gwyn Smith House (c. 1918), and Mason Lillard House (c. 1910).It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.", "answers": ["no"], "length": 4508, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3056ee6e5f33c35fc218f27c9afd5d6f2cd62a940b1d4373"}
{"input": "Gül Mosque and Hippodrome of Constantinople are both located where?", "context": "Passage 1:\nCovered Hippodrome\nThe Covered Hippodrome (Greek: σκεπαστός ἱππόδρομος) was a covered courtyard that served as an antechamber to the Great Palace of Constantinople in Istanbul, Turkey. The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland also equated it with the emperors' private hippodrome. It lay on the southeastern corner of the palace complex, and connected the Palace of Daphne in the north with the later lower palace complex around Bucoleon in the south, through the gate of Skyla. It played a great role in imperial ceremonies, and is not to be confused with the far larger adjacent Hippodrome of Constantinople, which in Byzantine sources was often distinguished as the \"uncovered\" (ἀσκέπαστος) Hippodrome. From the 9th to the 11th centuries, it was also the site of one of the Byzantine capital's highest courts, the tribunals of the \"judges of the Hippodrome\" (κριταὶ τοῦ ἱπποδρόμου) and of the \"judges of the velum\" (κριταὶ τοῦ βήλου).\n\nSources\nGuilland, Rodolphe (1969). \"L'hippodrome couvert\".

The mosque is also spelt as Haji Alekber Mosque. The Haji Alakbar mosque was constructed in 1890 by the renowned architect of the time Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi who also built Yukhari Govhar Agha Mosque and Ashaghi Govhar Agha Mosque in Shusha, Aghdam Mosque in Aghdam, mosques in Horadiz and Qocahmadli villages, Tatar mosque in Odesa, Ukraine, and Qababaghlilar Mosque in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. This monument of Islamic architecture is among 300 religious monuments of Karabakh and is famous for its structure along with Qiyas ad Din Mosque, also located in Fuzuli. Fuzuli, along with the Haji Alakbar Mosque was occupied by Armenian forces in 1993, and its condition was unknown during the occupation. However, after the recapture of the city by Azerbaijan, it was found to be destroyed.\nPassage 3:\nAyakapı\nAyakapı (Turkish: \"The Gate of the Saint\", \"The holy gate\") (the toponym comes from the Turkish word Aya, derived from pronunciation of the Greek word ἁγἰα, mean. \"female Saint\" and the Turkish word kapı, mean. \"gate\") is a quarter of Istanbul, Turkey. It is part of the district of Fatih, inside the walled city, and lies on the shore of the Golden Horn. During the Byzantine era, it was named ta Dexiokratiana or ta Dexiokratous in Greek, after the houses owned here by a certain Dexiokrates. Its modern name comes from a church dedicated to Saint Theodosia which, according to Petrus Gillius, stood near the gate. In Ayakapı lies one of the most important surviving Byzantine buildings of the historical peninsula, the Gül Mosque. Moreover, in 1582 the Ottoman architect Sinan built here a Turkish bath, the Ayakapı Hamamı. This structure is currently used as a storage for timber.\n\nGallery\nPassage 4:\nProculus (prefect of Constantinople)\nProculus (died in Constantinople, November 16, 393) or Proklos (Greek: Πρόκλος) was Eparch of Constantinople during the reign of Theodosius the Great (r. 379–395. An epigram on the pedestal of an obelisk at the hippodrome of Constantinople records his success in setting the obelisk upright. A Latin translation of the epigram by Hugo Grotius is given by Fabricius.\n\nBiography\nProculus was the son of Eutolmius Tatianus. He held the posts of governor of Palestine and of Phoenicia; between 383 and 384 he was Comes Orientis. During this time, his name was carved on the Commemorative stela of Nahr el-Kalb.\nIn 388, shortly before leaving for a campaign in the West against the usurper Magnus Maximus, Emperor Theodosius I appointed him praefectus urbi of Constantinople.\nIn 392 he fell into disgrace: the general and statesman Rufinus, jealous of the power of Proculus and of his father (who was praetorian prefect of the East), used his influence to launch accusations against Proculus, who went into hiding. Rufinus then coaxed Tatianus and Theodosius to pardon Proculus, who received a letter from his father asking him to return to court. Once Proculus turned up, he was captured and imprisoned. He was tried and sentenced, as Rufinus had decided, and sent to death in a suburb of Constantinople called Sykai (the Galata district of modern Istanbul); the Emperor sent a messenger to order the execution halted, but Rufinus ordered the messenger to move slowly, so that he arrived after the execution had been carried out.\nHis name was subject to damnatio memoriae and was erased from monuments, as, for example, the Obelisk of Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. Later, his nephew, who came to power under the Emperor Marcian (r. 450–457), had the good name of Proculus restored, re-carving it on the obelisk.\n\nSee also\n4th century in Lebanon\nPassage 5:\nPalace of Antiochos\nThe Palace of Antiochos (Greek: τὰ παλάτια τῶν Ἀντιόχου) was an early 5th-century palace in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey). It has been identified with a palatial structure excavated in the 1940s and 1950s close to the Hippodrome of Constantinople, some of whose remains are still visible today. In the 7th century, a part of the palace was converted into the church–more properly a martyrion, a martyr's shrine–of St Euphemia in the Hippodrome (Ἀγία Εὐφημία ἐν τῷ Ἱπποδρομίῳ, Hagia Euphēmia en tō Hippodromiō), which survived until the Palaiologan period.\n\nHistory\nAntiochos's palace\nThe palace of Antiochos was constructed as a residence for Antiochos, a eunuch of Persian origin, who enjoyed considerable influence during the reign of Theodosius II (r. 402–450). As a cubicularius (chamberlain), he was tutor to the young emperor and eventually rose to the post of praepositus sacri cubiculi and the rank of patricius. His overbearing attitude and dominance over the young emperor caused his downfall (the date is disputed) by the emperor's sister, Pulcheria, but he was allowed to return to his palace and live there. He remained active in the capital's politics until he finally fell from grace and entered the clergy in ca. 439. Following this, his property, including the palace, was confiscated by the emperor.The palace was first discovered in 1939, when frescoes depicting the life of Saint Euphemia were discovered northwest of the Hippodrome. Further excavations in 1942 by Alfons Maria Schneider uncovered a hexagonal hall opening to a semicircular portico, while excavations in 1951–52 under R. Duyuran uncovered a column base with the inscription \"of the praepositus Antiochos\", which allowed for the identification of the site. Based on the stamps on the bricks recovered from the site, J. Bardill proposes a date of construction not earlier than 430.\n\nChurch of Saint Euphemia\nThe Church of Saint Euphemia in the Hippodrome (also known as lying \"in ta Antiochou\", i.e. \"the quarters/palaces of Antiochos\") was established in the hexagonal hall probably sometime in the early 7th century, when the original church at Chalcedon was destroyed during the Sassanid Persian invasions, and the relics moved for safety to Constantinople. Originally the western chapel had frescoes depicting the martyrdom of Saint Euphemia, and the sanctuary had a canopy dome.\nDuring the Byzantine Iconoclasm, the building was secularized and allegedly converted into a store of arms and manure. According to tradition, the bones of the saint were ordered thrown into the sea by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (ruled 717–741) or by his son, Constantine V (r. 741–775). They were however saved by two pious brothers and brought to the island of Lemnos, from where they were brought back in 796, after the end of the first Iconoclasm period, by Empress Eirene (r. 797–802). The church survived until the end of the Byzantine Empire, being redecorated in the late 13th century with frescoes in the Palaiologan style.\n\nDescription\nOriginal architecture of the palace\nThe original palace consisted of two sections, a southern and a northern. The southern one, inaccessible to the public today, featured the large apsed hexagonal hall which was later converted into the Church of Saint Euphemia, connected to a wide semicircular portico, some 60 m in diameter and enclosing a courtyard paved with marble. The hexagonal hall originally served probably as a dining hall (triclinium). The diameter of the hall is some 20 m, with each side of the hexagon 10.4 m wide. Each side featured an absidal niche, polygonal on the exterior and semicircular in the interior, each 7.65 m wide and 4.65 m deep, thus providing space for a semicircular bench (sigma or stibadium) and a dining table. Each apse also had a door that communicated with small circular rooms, situated between the apses. A marble pool was located in the center of the hall, a feature common in Late Antiquity. The hexagonal triclinium was flanked by other rooms, grouped along the outer curve of the great portico, including an elaborate vestibule with a circular room at its center.The northern section, located between the street that ran along the western wall of the Hippodrome and the Mese thoroughfare, was until recently misidentified as the Palace of Lausus. It comprised a large rotunda of 20 m diameter with niches on the wall, which seems to have functioned as an audience hall for Antiochos. It was attached to a south-eastwards facing, C-shaped portico open to the street along the Hippodrome. A small bath house, also accessible from the street, lay next to the southern side of the portico. In the 5th century, when the palace was imperial property, an elongated hallway was added to the rotunda in the west, accessed through a double-apsed vestibule. Its shape points to its use as a triclinium. It was 52.5 m  long and 12.4 m wide with an apse at its end, while in the 6th century, six apses were added on each of its long sides.\n\nConversion into a church\nWhen the hexagonal hall was converted into a church, several modifications were made. The bēma was placed to the right of the original entrance, in the southeastwards-looking apse, and another entrance was opened up in the opposite apse. The original gate remained in use, but was narrowed at some later point. Two further gates were opened in the two northern circular rooms, to which two mausolea were eventually attached.The excavations uncovered the remains of the synthronon (seats for the clergy, a cathedra), the altar foundation, the chancel barrier, and a solea (an elevated podium). No evidence of an ambo survives, but its presence is possible, in line with other early Byzantine churches of the city. Most of these sculptural remains display typical 6th-century features, such as marble sculptures inlaid with glass, but the epistyle dates from the restoration of the church in 797.\n\nFrescoes\nA series of  frescoes, dating to the late 13th century, survive on the southwestern wall of the church, and can be seen behind a protective glass. Fourteen of them form a cycle narrating the life and martyrdom of Saint Euphemia, while another fresco depicts the martyrdom of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, a theme unique among the churches of the capital.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\nPassage 6:\nGül Mosque\nGül Mosque (Turkish: Gül Camii, meaning Rose Mosque' in English) is a former Byzantine church in Istanbul, Turkey, converted into a mosque by the Ottomans.\nIt is in Vakıf Mektebi Sokak in the district of Fatih, Istanbul, in the neighbourhood of Ayakapı ('Gate of the Saint'). It lies at the end of the valley which divides the fourth and fifth hills of Constantinople and overlooks the Golden Horn from its imposing position .\n\nProblem of identification\nAlthough the Gül Mosque was one of the most important Byzantine buildings in Constantinople, its dedication and the date of its construction have been disputed by scholars. It is sometimes identified with the church belonging to the nunnery of Saint Theodosia (Greek: Μονή τής Άγιας Θεοδοσίας εν τοις Δεξιοκράτους, Monē tis Hagias Theodosias en tois Dexiokratous) or with that of the monastery of Christ the Benefactor (Greek: Μονή του Χριστού του Ευεργέτου, Monē tou Christou tou Euergetou).After Stephan Gerlach visited it in the late 15th century, the building was always identified as the church of Hagia Theodosia en tois Dexiokratous. However, at the beginning of the last century, Jules Pargoire identified it instead as the church of Hagia Euphēmia en tō Petriō, built during the reign of Basil I (867–886), and explained why he thought this was the case. After studies aimed at the dating of the basement in the 1960s, the German archaeologist Hartmut Schäfer estimated the date of the church's construction as between the end of the eleventh and the first half of 12th century, placing it in the Komnenian period, and identifying it hypothetically as the church of the monastery of Christos Euergetēs. He refuted the idea that the Gül Mosque was the building where the body of Hagia Theodosia was brought at the end of the Iconoclasm period. On the other hand, he did not exclude the possibility that the building could have been dedicated to Hagia Theodosia at a later period.\n\nHistory\nByzantine period\nOn January 19, 729, at the very beginning of the iconoclastic persecutions, Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ordered the removal of an image of Christ which stood over the Chalkē, the main gate of the Great Palace of Constantinople. While an officer was executing the order, a group of women gathered to prevent the operation, and one of them, a nun named Theodosia, caused him to fall from the ladder. The man died, and Theodosia was captured and executed.After the end of the Iconoclasm era, Theodosia was recognized as a martyr and saint, and her body was kept and worshiped in the church of Hagia Euphemia en tō Petriō, in the quarter named Dexiokratiana, after the houses owned here by one Dexiokrates. The church and adjoining monastery were erected by Emperor Basil I at the end of the ninth century. The monastery hosted his four daughters, who were all buried in the church. Hagia Euphemia lay near the Monastery of Christos Euergetēs, whose foundation date is unknown although it was restored by protosebastos John Komnenos, son of Andronikos I Komnenos and brother of co-emperor John, who died fighting in the battle of Myriokephalon in 1176. On April 12, 1204, during the Fourth Crusade, the Latin fleet gathered in front of the monastery of Chistos Euergetes before attacking the city. During the period of the Latin Occupation, the navy had its anchorage in front of the monastery. Many sacred relics kept in the church were looted by the Crusaders and some still exist in churches throughout western Europe.Over time, the worship of St Theodosia grew until, after the 11th century, the church was renamed after her. Since the original feast day of Hagia Euphemia was on 30 May, and that of another Hagia Theodosia (Hagia Theodosia of Tyros) was on 29 May, 29 May came to be accepted as the feast day of Hagia Theodosia hē Konstantinoupolitissa ('Saint Theodosia of Constantinople').Hagia Theodosia became one of the most venerated saints in Constantinople, being invoked particularly by the infirm. Her fame increased  when a deaf-mute was miraculously cured in 1306. The church was often mentioned by the Russian pilgrims who visited the city in the fourteenth and early fifteenth century, although it was sometimes confused with the nearby church of Christ Euergetēs. Twice a week there was a procession during which the relics hosted in the church were carried and a crowd of sick people followed, praying to be cured. \n\nThe church was mentioned for the last time on May 28, 1453. On that day, which was the eve both of the saint's feast and also of the end of the Byzantine Empire, the Emperor Constantine XI went with the Patriarch to pray in the church, which was adorned with garlands of roses. Afterward Constantine left for the last fight before the city fell to the Ottomans . Many people remained all the night in the church, praying for the city's salvation. After entering the city, the Ottoman troops arrived to find the building still adorned with flowers, and captured everyone sheltering inside, regarding them as prisoners of war. The relics were thrown away and the body of the saint was cast to the dogs.\n\nOttoman period\nAfter the Ottoman conquest, the basement of the church fell into ruin and was used as naval dockyard. Close to the building, Seyhülislam Molla Hüsrev Mehmet Effendi (died 1480) established a vakıf (foundation) and erected a small mosque (Küçük Mustafa Paşa Mescidi) and a bath (Küçük Mustafa Paşa Hamamı), which still exists.In 1490, the ruined church was repaired and converted into a mosque. During the reign of Selim II, between 1566 and 1574, a minaret was erected by Hassam Pasha, a supplier to the Ottoman navy. Afterwards the mosque was often named after him. Between 1573 and 1578, during his sojourn in Istanbul, the German preacher Stephan Gerlach visited the mosque and identified it with the church of Hagia Theodosia. During that century a local holy man named Gül Baba was allegedly buried in the building. It is possible that the mosque was actually named after him.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the upper part of the church-mosque was badly damaged by earthquakes. Eventually Sultan Murad IV restored it, rebuilding the dome and its pendentives, almost the whole west side, the vaults at the southwest and northwest corners, and the minaret.The building escaped the fire which ravaged the quarter in 1782, and was restored again by Sultan Mahmud II (1808–1839), who added the wooden Sultan's lodge.\n\nArchitecture\nExterior\nThe exterior of the building is quite imposing. It stands on a high vaulted basement, which was used during the Byzantine period for secular purposes. The masonry of the basement has been built using the technique of the \"recessed brick\", typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period.  In this technique, alternate courses of bricks are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a mortar bed which means that the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the brick layers.The building has a Greek cross plan, which is oriented northwest-southeast. It is 26 metres (85 feet) long and 20 metres (66 feet) wide, and is surmounted by five domes, one above the central nave and four smaller ones placed at the four corners. The central dome, which has a low external drum and no windows, is Ottoman, as are the broad pointed arches which carry it.\nThe original dome, like that of the Kalenderhane Mosque, should have been carried by a tall drum pierced by windows. On the southeastern façade, the central apse, with seven sides, and the lateral apses, with three sides, project boldly outwards. The central apse appears to be a later Byzantine reconstruction, since it lacks the four tiers of five niches, which feature ornamental brickwork and adorn the lateral ones. Above the niches runs a cornice.\nThe side apses resemble those of the Pantokrator Church and support a late dating for the building.\n\nInterior\nThe entrance to the mosque is through a wooden porch, which leads to a low narthex surmounted by a barrel vault. From there a triple arcade leads into the lofty nave, which is flanked by galleries forming the side arms of the cross. They rest on a triple arcade supported by square piers. The nave ends with the main apse, which is flanked by two smaller ones. The south-east orientation of the main apse allowed the erection of the mihrab inside it.\nEach gallery ends with a small chapel, which lie above the prothesis and diaconicon respectively. Both chapels are surmounted by hemispherical domes built directly above the pendentives. Light enters the building through five rows of windows, three belonging to the galleries. Some of the windows are Ottoman.\nCarved inside each of the two eastern dome piers there is a small chamber. The south east chamber contains the alleged tomb of the Ottoman holy man Gül Baba. Above the entrance an inscription in Ottoman Turkish reads:  \"Tomb of the Apostle, disciple of Jesus. Peace be with him\", which bears witness to the religious syncretism of sixteenth-century Istanbul. The chamber may originally have housed the tomb of St Theodosia. A tradition that one of the piers hides the burial place of the last Byzantine Emperor only dates back to the nineteenth century, and is groundless.The walls of the building were plastered and decorated in the 18th century.\nTogether with the Eski Imaret and Vefa Kilise Mosques, the Gül Mosque  is one of the most important cross-in-square churches in Istanbul.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\nPassage 7:\nAzam mosque of Qom\nAzam Mosque of Qom (Persian: مسجد اعظم قم), or Masjid-Azam  located in Qom, Iran, was built by Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi, grand Shia Marja' next to the Fatima Masumeh Shrine.\n\nSpecifications\nOn 22 June 1954 the foundation stone of this great mosque was laid in a religious custom. That day fell on the birth day of Ali al-Ridha, eighth Imam of Shia Muslims. The construction of it was ended in 1961. Azam mosque had been built basis on the Islamic architecture. This mosque made of four prayer halls and three towering balconies. The diameter of the large dome of the mosque is 30 metres and its height above the roof of the mosque is 15 metres and 35 metres from the basement of the mosque. The minarets of the mosque has 25 metres length above the roof of the mosque and 45 metres from the basement of the mosque. The upper part of the minarets is 5 metres . It has special section and used to call to prayers (A'zaan).

It was constructed in 1974 as the Paris home of the Jean Richard Circus, and in that period, was known as the Nouvel Hippodrome de Paris.   The Hippodrome featured a faux neo-classical front and a yellow and blue big-top canopy.  It could seat approximately 3,500 people.  In 1980 subsequent to the closing of the nearby Pavillon de Paris, the Hippodrome also hosted numerous musical performances, especially touring rock bands.  In 1982, the Jean Richard Circus ceased operations, and the Hippodrome was demolished in order to be replaced on the same site by a larger, concert-specific space. The new concert venue, Zénith de Paris, opened in 1983.\n\nPerformance chronology\n1977: Chicago (3-5 Feb), Téléphone (2 Apr), Festival Délirock with Jacques Higelin, Téléphone, Urban Sax (23 Apr), Urban Sax (30 Apr), Chris Hillman Band + Roger McGuinn Band + Gene Clark (7 May), Klaus Schulze (9 May), Chuck Berry (11 May), Magma (14 May), Gong & Family (28 May), Iggy Pop (23 Sep), Peter Gabriel (4 Oct), Steve Hillage + Tim Blake (5 Oct), Rory Gallagher (6 Oct), Wishbone Ash (7 Oct), Henry Cow + Albert Marcoeur + Etron Fou Leloublan (8 Oct), Bob Seger (11 Oct), Peter Gabriel (30 Oct), Uriah Heep (10 Nov), Caravan (14 Nov), Van der Graaf (17 Nov), Fête du Parti Socialiste with Jacques Higelin, Eddy Mitchell, Bernard Lavilliers, Captain Beefheart, Urban Sax, Hot Tuna, Randy Weston, Henry Cow, National Health, Planet Gong, Bloom, Surya, Edition Spéciale, Larry Martin Factory, Soho (20-21 Nov)\n1978: Festival Antirouille with Jacques Higelin, Ange, Djamel Allam (3 Feb)\n1979: Status Quo (17 Feb), Scorpions (28 Mar)\n1980: The Allman Brothers Band, KISS (27 Sep) and Rod Stewart (16 Oct)\n1981: Stray Cats (date unknown), James Brown (26 Jan), Johnny Hallyday (24 Mar), The Clash (8 May), Status Quo (18 May), Grateful Dead(17 Oct) Genesis (19-20 Oct), Sean Tyla and Pat Benatar (25 Oct)\n1982: Roxy Music (date unknown), Stray Cats (7 Feb), Frank Zappa (19 May), Téléphone (4 Nov), New York City Rap (special touring ensemble of rap artists) (27 Nov), Rainbow (28 Nov)\n1983: Eric Clapton (24 Apr)\nPassage 9:\nOdalar Mosque\nThe Odalar Mosque (Turkish: Odalar Câmîi, meaning \"the mosque of the barracks\" after the nearby accommodations of the married Janissaries established in this quarter in the 18th century. Also: Kemankeş Mustafa Paşa Câmîi) was an Ottoman mosque in Istanbul. The building was originally a Byzantine-era Eastern Orthodox church of unknown dedication. In 1475, after the Fall of Constantinople (1453), it became a Roman Catholic church, dedicated to Saint Mary of Constantinople, until finally it was converted into a mosque by the Ottomans in 1640. The mosque was destroyed by fire in 1919, and since then has fallen into ruin. As of 2011, only some walls remain, hidden among modern buildings.\n\nLocation\nThe ruins of the building lie in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirne Kapı (the ancient Gate of Charisius), more or less halfway between the Chora Church and the Fethiye Mosque. The few remains lie in a courtyard and can be accessed through modern blocks built on Müftu Sokaĝi 20-22.\n\nHistory\nByzantine Age\nBetween the ninth and the tenth century a church with an underlying basement and a crypt was erected on the top of the sixth hill of Constantinople, on a plateau which is limited by the open air cistern of Aetius (now a football field) and by the unidentified Byzantine edifice denominated in Ottoman times as Boĝdan Saray. The dedication of this building is uncertain, but it was probably part of a complex which also included today's Kasım Ağa Mosque and the İpek Cistern, and was almost certainly the katholikon of a monastery.The edifice has been identified for a long time as the Theotokos en te Petra, but without conclusive evidence.\nDuring the Byzantine period, several monasteries lay in the area; the Monastery of Manuel, that devoted to St. John in Petra, and the Kecharitomene nunnery (\"full of grace\" or \"favoured (by God)\"). The latter was founded at the beginning of the 12th century by Empress Eirene Doukaina, and is known above all because of its detailed and extant typikon. The nearby church of the Theotokos tes Kellararias, used by the nuns of the Kecharitomene as a burial place, and that of Hagios Nikolaos, both mentioned in the typikon of the nunnery, are possible candidates for the identification. Moreover, the Odalar Mosque could also be identified with a nearby church dedicated to Saints Sergius and Bacchus, which lay \"near the cistern of Aetios\": not to be confounded with the homonymous church which lies near Hagia Sophia) because of the discovery in the vicinity of a monogrammed capital (unfortunately found not in situ). Between 1150 and 1175  a new church of the cross-in-square plan was built above the old one (possibly destroyed by fire or menaced by a landslide).\n\nOttoman Age\nThe documented history of the edifice begins in 1475, shortly after the Fall of Constantinople, when Sultan Mehmed II conquered the Genoese colony of Caffa, in Crimea. About 40,000 Latin, Greek, Armenian and Jewish inhabitants who lived in Caffa (\"Caffariotes\" or, in Turkish, Kefeli) were then deported to Istanbul and relocated to this quarter, which was named after them Kefe Mahallesi. The Latins, mainly Genoese, were authorized to use in their quarter as churches the building and, together with the Armenians, another edifice known later as Kefeli Mosque, which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas.The edifice, dedicated then to Saint Mary of Constantinople (Italian: Santa Maria di Costantinopoli), was officiated by the Dominicans, which before the Ottoman conquest had also a monastery in the city on the Black Sea. Here was brought from Caffa a large icon of the Hodegetria type, which now is kept in the Dominican monastery of SS. Peter and Paul in Galata. Due to all that, at the beginning of the sixteenth century the church of Saint Mary had turned into the center of this quarter predominantly inhabited by Italians, but the building fell soon in disrepair. Under Sultan Murad IV (r. 1623–1640) the decision was taken to exclude from the walled city the Christians who were not Ottoman subjects and to resettle them in Galata and Pera. As a consequence, and after riots between Christian and Muslims, the church was closed in 1636, and in 1640 it was transformed into a mosque by Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha (d. 1644). As mentioned above, only the Hodegetria Icon could be moved with great difficulties to Galata.After the relocation of the married Janissaries in the quarter in 1782, the mosque got the appellation of Odalar (In Turkish \"Oda\" means \"room\" but also \"barrack of the Janissaries\"). Previously these were lodged at the Eski Odalar (\"Old Barracks\") near Şehzade Mosque, which were destroyed in the fire of 1782. The building decayed steadily (by the mid-19th century the dome had collapsed), and it was heavily damaged by the fire of Salmatomruk on 2 July 1919. When the quarter was rebuilt with modern criteria the edifice was not restored, and fell into ruin.\n\nArchitecture\nAs mentioned above, several constructive phases can be recognized in the building during the Byzantine period. The first church, erected in the middle Byzantine age, had an almost square plan (about 11.65 m x 10 m ) with three apses, and was oriented toward the East.  In 1935, only the tripartite sanctuary and the Bema were still visible. The church was built on a basement composed of 24 vaulted rooms and a vaulted crypt with an apse, which is supposed to have been a chapel containing relics.  These rooms had at first a profane usage, later they were used as burial place and finally as a cistern.The second church, erected at the end of the twelfth century, used also 16 small rooms of the abandoned first church's basement as substructure. The masonry was made of stone and bricks, and was erected with the technique of the recessed brick,  typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period. In this technique, alternate courses of bricks are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a mortar's bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the bricks layers. In this building, three or four rows of bricks alternate with single rows of stones, and the bricks are arranged to form several patterns.The second church was of the cross-in-square type with an almost square naos about 10.5 m wide: it had four columns sustaining the dome through pendentives, three apses - the central one having a polygonal shape - and a narthex embracing the edifice on the west and north sides. The dome was about 4.4. m wide, lay on a drum and was adorned with frescoes. East of the naos lay a tripartite sanctuary composed of a bema flanked by a prothesis and a diakonikon. The floor of the new church was 3.3 m above that of the first church.  The edifice can be described as a middle-sized Byzantine church, similar to the nearby Church of Christ Pantepoptes.From a relation of Pietro Demarchis, bishop of Santorini, who visited Istanbul in 1622, we know that at that time the columns of the church had been taken away by the Turks and substituted with wooden pillars, and that the dome was covered with frescoes. Moreover, part of the building was already menacing ruin. Just after the conversion to mosque, to the building were added a mihrab, a minbar and a minaret. After the fire of 1919, the building fell into ruin (the roof collapsed and the minaret crashed already in the 1820s), but luckily it was thoroughly studied and surveyed by the German Archaeologist Paul Schatzmann in 1934/1935.\nAccording to the Greek scholar Alexandros G. Paspates, in the East part of the basement of the Mosque sprung a water source (Greek: αγίασμα, hagíasma, Turkish: ayazma) dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, abandoned for a long time.\n\nPaintings\nDuring the excavation of 1934/1935 up to four mortar layers covered with frescoes on blue background were uncovered. A fresco representing a Madonna on Throne with angels was found in the crypt. In the basement rooms were found fragments of paintings having as subject funerary themes. In the inferior church were discovered two deesis, a fresco representing the soldier Saint Mercurius  - of unparalleled technique among the known Byzantine works of this age - and prophets. These paintings were executed either in the tenth or in the middle of the eleventh century, belonging so to the first church. The diakonikon of the second church was adorned with frescoes showing saints and episodes of the Life of the Virgin. The best preserved frescoes (among them Saint Mercurius) were detached, restored and are on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\nPassage 10:\nHippodrome of Constantinople\nSultanahmet Square (Turkish: Sultanahmet Meydanı) or the Hippodrome of Constantinople (Greek: Ἱππόδρομος τῆς Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, romanized: Hippódromos tēs Kōnstantinoupóleōs; Latin: Circus Maximus Constantinopolitanus; Turkish: Hipodrom) is a square in Istanbul, Turkey. Previously, it was a circus that was the sporting and social centre of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. \nThe word hippodrome comes from the Greek hippos (ἵππος), horse, and dromos (δρόμος), path or way. For this reason, it is sometimes also called Atmeydanı (\"Horse Square\") in Turkish. Horse racing and chariot racing were popular pastimes in the ancient world and hippodromes were common features of Greek cities in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine eras.\n\nHistory and use\nConstruction\nAlthough the Hippodrome is usually associated with Constantinople's days of glory as an imperial capital, it actually predates that era. The first Hippodrome was built when the city was called Byzantium, and was a provincial town of moderate importance. In AD 203 the Emperor Septimius Severus rebuilt the city and expanded its walls, endowing it with a hippodrome, an arena for chariot races and other entertainment.\nIn AD 324, the Emperor Constantine the Great decided to refound Byzantium after his victory at the nearby Battle of Chrysopolis; he renamed it Nova Roma (New Rome). This name failed to impress and the city soon became known as Constantinople, the City of Constantine. Constantine greatly enlarged the city, and one of his major undertakings was the renovation of the Hippodrome. It is estimated that the Hippodrome of Constantine was about 450 m (1,476 ft) long and 130 m (427 ft) wide. The carceres (starting gates) stood at the northern end; and the sphendone (curved tribune of the U-shaped structure, the lower part of which still survives) stood at the southern end. The spina  (the middle barrier of the racecourse) was adorned with various monuments, including the monolithic obelisk, the erection of which is depicted in relief carvings on its base.\nThe stands were capable of holding 100,000 spectators. The race-track at the Hippodrome was U-shaped, and the Kathisma (emperor's lodge) was located at the eastern end of the track. The Kathisma could be accessed directly from the Great Palace through a passage which only the emperor or other members of the imperial family could use.\n\nDecoration\nThe hippodrome was filled with statues of gods, emperors, animals, and heroes, among them some famous works, such as a 4th-century BC Heracles by Lysippos, Romulus and Remus with the she-wolf Lupa, and the 5th-century BC Serpent Column. The carceres had four statues of horses in gilded copper on top, now called the Horses of Saint Mark. The horses' exact Greek or Roman ancestry has never been determined. They were looted during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and installed on the façade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. The track was lined with other bronze statues of famous horses and chariot drivers, none of which survive. In his book De Ceremoniis (book II,15, 589), the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus described the decorations in the hippodrome at the occasion of the visit of Saracen or Arab visitors, mentioning the purple hangings and rare tapestries. According to Hesychius of Miletus, there was once a statue of Hecate at the site.\n\nFunctions\nThroughout the Byzantine period, the Hippodrome was the centre of the city's social life. Huge amounts were bet on chariot races, and initially four teams took part in these races, each one financially sponsored and supported by a different political party (Deme) within the Byzantine Senate: The Blues (Venetoi), the Greens (Prasinoi), the Reds (Rousioi) and the Whites (Leukoi). The Reds (Rousioi) and the Whites (Leukoi) gradually weakened and were absorbed by the other two major factions (the Blues and Greens).\nA total of up to eight chariots (two chariots per team), powered by four horses each, competed on the racing track of the Hippodrome. These races were not simple sporting events, but also provided some of the rare occasions in which the Emperor and the common citizens could come together in a single venue. Political discussions were often made at the Hippodrome, which could be directly accessed by the Emperor through a passage that connected the Kathisma with the Great Palace of Constantinople.\nThe rivalry between the Blues and Greens often became mingled with political or religious rivalries, and sometimes riots, which amounted to civil wars that broke out in the city between them. The most severe of these was the Nika riots of 532, in which an estimated 30,000 people were killed and many important buildings were destroyed, such as the nearby second Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine cathedral. The current (third) Hagia Sophia was built by Justinian following the Nika riots.\n\nDecline\nConstantinople never recovered from its sack during the Fourth Crusade and even though the Byzantine Empire survived until 1453, by that time, the Hippodrome had fallen into ruin, pillaged by the Venetians who likely took the four horses now in San Marco from a monument there. The Ottomans, whose sultan Mehmed the Conqueror captured the city in 1453 and made it the capital of the Ottoman Empire, were not interested in chariot racing and the Hippodrome was gradually forgotten, although the site was never actually built over. The hippodrome was used as a source of building stone, however.\n\nHippodrome monuments\nSerpent Column\nTo raise the image of his new capital, Constantine and his successors, especially Theodosius the Great, brought works of art from all over the empire to adorn it. The monuments were set up in the middle of the Hippodrome, the spina. Among these was the sacrificial tripod of Plataea, now known as the Serpent Column, cast to celebrate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians during the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. Constantine ordered the Tripod to be moved from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and set in middle of the Hippodrome. The top was adorned with a golden bowl supported by three serpent heads, although it appears that this was never brought to Constantinople. The serpent heads and top third of the column were destroyed in 1700. Parts of the heads were recovered and are displayed at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. All that remains of the Delphi Tripod today is the base, known as the \"Serpentine Column\".\n\nObelisk of Thutmose III\nAnother emperor to adorn the Hippodrome was Theodosius the Great, who in 390 brought an obelisk from Egypt and erected it inside the racing track. Carved from pink granite, it was originally erected at the Temple of Karnak in Luxor during the reign of Thutmose III in about 1490 BC. Theodosius had the obelisk cut into three pieces and brought to Constantinople. The top section survives, and it stands today where Theodosius placed it, on a marble pedestal. The granite obelisk has survived nearly 3,500 years in good condition.\n\nWalled Obelisk\nIn the 10th century the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus built another obelisk at the other end of the Hippodrome. It was originally covered with gilded bronze plaques, but they were sacked by Latin troops in the Fourth Crusade. The stone core of this monument also survives, known as the Walled Obelisk.\n\nStatues of Porphyrius\nSeven statues were erected on the Spina of the Hippodrome in honour of Porphyrius the Charioteer, a legendary charioteer of the early 6th century who in his time raced for the two parties which were called \"Greens\" and \"Blues\". None of these statues have survived. The bases of two of them have survived and are displayed in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.\n\nContemporary description\nThe area is officially called Sultan Ahmet Square. It is maintained by the Turkish government. The course of the old racetrack has been indicated with paving, although the actual track is some 2 m (6.6 ft) below the present surface. The surviving monuments of the Spina, the two obelisks and the Serpentine Column, now sit excavated in pits in a landscaped garden.\nThe German Fountain (\"The Kaiser Wilhelm Fountain\"), an octagonal domed fountain in neo-Byzantine style, which was constructed by the German government in 1900 to mark the visit of the German Emperor Wilhelm II to Istanbul in 1898, is located at the northern entrance to the Hippodrome area, right in front of the Blue Mosque.\nIn 1855, Sir Charles Newton, the English archaeologist who excavated Halicarnassus and Cnidus, excavated the one surviving jaw of a snake from the Serpent Column. The Hippodrome was excavated by the Director of the Istanbul Archeological Museums, archaeologist Rüstem Duyuran in 1950 and 1951. A portion of the substructures of the sphendone (the curved end) became more visible in the 1980s with the clearing of houses in the area. In 1993 an area in front of the nearby Sultanahmet Mosque (the Blue Mosque) was bulldozed in order to install a public building, uncovering several rows of seats and some columns from the Hippodrome. Investigation did not continue further, but the seats and columns were removed and can now be seen in Istanbul's museums. It is possible that much more of the Hippodrome's remains still lie beneath the parkland of Sultanahmet.\nThe Hippodrome was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 500 lira banknotes of 1953–1976.\n\nImage gallery", "answers": ["Istanbul, Turkey"], "length": 7112, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0df347189016b4d86b8f6d4086388a5ea318a08c468abba3"}
{"input": "Were Daniel Mann and Todd Solondz both directors?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPalindromes (film)\nPalindromes is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Todd Solondz. Referencing Solondz's previous Welcome to the Dollhouse, it was nominated for the Golden Lion award at the 61st Venice International Film Festival.\nThe protagonist, a 13-year-old girl named Aviva, is played by eight different actors of different ages, races, and genders during the course of the film, which features an array of secondary characters. The names of the characters Aviva, Bob, and Otto are all palindromes.\n\nPlot\nThe film opens with a funeral for Dawn Wiener (the protagonist from Solondz's Welcome to the Dollhouse), who went to college, gained a lot of weight and acne, and committed suicide at age 20 after she became pregnant from date rape. Her older brother Mark (Matthew Faber, reprising his role) reads the eulogy while Dawn's tearful parents (Angela Pietropinto and Bill Buell, also reprising their roles) sit in the audience and seem to finally show remorse over the way they mistreated her as a child. Dawn's younger sister whom she was estranged from, Missy, does not attend the funeral. One of the attendees is Aviva, Dawn's cousin.\nA few years later, Aviva desires to have a child. She has sex with Judah (Robert Agri), a family friend, and becomes pregnant. Aviva's parents are horrified and demand that she get an abortion. While the abortion is technically successful, it is implied via a fractured, emotional conversation with the doctor (Stephen Singer) that Aviva can no longer have children. Not fully conscious, Aviva is unaware of this, and her parents, already fragile, lead her to believe all is well when she awakens, afraid to upset Aviva.\nAviva runs away from home. She befriends a trucker (Stephen Adly Guirgis) and has sex with him; however, the trucker abandons her at a motel. She is eventually found by the Sunshine Family, a Christian fundamentalist foster home that cares for disordered orphans and runaways. She tells them her name is Henrietta — the name she picked for the baby she was persuaded to abort. While at the Sunshine Family home, she discovers a dark side to the foster father; he assassinates abortion providers. His next target is the doctor who performed Aviva's abortion. The hitman whom the foster father uses is the same trucker Aviva previously befriended and had sex with.\nConvinced she is in love with the truck driver, Aviva flees the Sunshine Family to join him on his assignment. They have anal sex. The murder does not go as planned as, in addition to the doctor himself, the trucker (whose name is revealed to be Bob) ends up accidentally shooting the doctor's young daughter when she steps in front of the first shot. The police find Bob and Aviva both in a motel room, and a guilt-ridden Bob commits suicide by cop.\nThe film then skips ahead several months later to Aviva back home with her parents, planning her next birthday party. During the party, she talks to her cousin, Mark, who has recently been arrested and accused of molesting his sister Missy's baby (although he denies having done it and it is loosely implied that Missy might have made it up for attention). Mark tells Aviva that there is no such thing as free will; people are what they were genetically “programmed” to be, and can never truly change. The film skips ahead to Aviva's meeting Judah, who now calls himself Otto, and they have sex again. Afterward, Aviva happily exclaims that she has a feeling that, this time, she is going to be a mother.\n\nCasting\nPalindromes is most notable for having eight different actors of different ages, races, and genders play a 13-year-old girl named Aviva. Although Solondz's film premiered in official competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, it received little other laudatory notice and remains his most polarizing with critics. With regard to Solondz's employment of multiple performers to play a single character, film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his positive review, \"If the movie is a moral labyrinth, it is paradoxically straightforward and powerful in the moment; each individual story has an authenticity and impact of its own. Consider the pathos brought to Aviva by the actress Sharon Wilkins, who is a plus-size adult black woman playing a little girl, and who creates perhaps the most convincing little girl of them all. Or Jennifer Jason Leigh, three times as old as Aviva but barely seeming her age. These individual segments are so effective that at the end of each one we know how we feel, and why. It's just that the next segment invalidates our conclusions.\" Contrarily, New York Times film critic A. O. Scott concluded in his negative review, \"[...] Aviva's appearance changes -- from black to white, from fat to thin, from brunette to redhead, and at one point, to Jennifer Jason Leigh. The effect of this switching is to keep you off balance and at a remove from the story. That is not such a bad thing, because you will want to be as far away as possible.\"\n\nCast\nActors playing Aviva\nReception\nPalindromes holds a 43% rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 120 reviews with an average rating of 5.31/10.

It is the score to the Todd Solondz movie Storytelling. Belle and Sebastian experienced many problems in communication with Solondz while scoring the film, and as such only about six minutes of their music was actually used in the movie. The album contains five tracks that are recorded dialogues. The instrumental track \"Fuck This Shit\" uses the prosody of the title phrase in a number of different keys but never the words themselves. The album was the band's final release on Jeepster, as they went on to sign a deal with Rough Trade the following year.\n\nTrack listing\nCharts\nPassage 4:\nLife During Wartime (film)\nLife During Wartime is a 2009 American comedy-drama film written and directed by filmmaker Todd Solondz. The film is a loose sequel to his 1998 film Happiness and 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse, with new actors playing the same characters.Life During Wartime premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Osella award for Best Screenplay.\n\nPlot\nThe plot revolves around the Jordan sisters: Trish, Joy, and Helen. Joy has married Helen's former neighbor, Allen Mellencamp, who continues to struggle with his compulsion to make obscene phone calls.\nTrish has been raising her three children, Billy (now off at college), Timmy and Chloe. She has begun dating recently divorced Harvey Weiner, who she hopes is normal. Trish's ex-husband, Bill, has been released from prison after serving a sentence for child molestation, and heads to Florida to find out how his family, particularly his eldest son, are doing. He finds brief solace in a one-night stand with Jacqueline, a self-described \"monster\" as filled with loneliness and self-hatred as he is; however, she kicks him out the next morning when she catches him taking money from her purse.\nTrish's middle child, Timmy, is preparing for his bar mitzvah and trying to determine what it means to become a man. Trish has for years told Timmy and Chloe that Bill had died, to avoid telling them that he is a pedophile. Timmy finds out, however, and is angered to find out that she lied to him. When he asks her about the mechanics of rape, Trish urges him to scream as soon as any man touches him.\nMeanwhile, Joy takes a break from Allen, and heads to Florida to spend time with Trish. She begins having visions of Andy, a former co-worker who had committed suicide shortly after dating her. She briefly goes to California to visit Helen, who has become a successful screenwriter, and calls her husband to leave a message that she is coming home. The audience sees that Allen has committed suicide. She returns to Florida to attend Timmy's bar mitzvah.\nIn the meantime, Bill sneaks into Trish's house to find Billy's college address. He pays Billy an unexpected visit at Northern Oregon University, where they discuss their past and the time that passed while Bill was in prison; in particular, Bill asks Billy a few very blunt questions about his sex life. Bill asks for forgiveness, but Billy refuses, saying his actions are unforgivable. Bill then disappears again, reassured that Billy will not turn out to be like him.\nHarvey brings his adult son Mark to dinner at Trish's, where he and Trish introduce their children to each other. At Timmy's request, Harvey comes to Timmy's room to have a talk. Timmy asks Harvey whether he is gay or a pedophile. Harvey denies being either, and, suspecting Timmy has been molested, tries to comfort him, touching his shoulder and hugging him. Terrified, Timmy starts to scream as per his mother's earlier instructions. Trish believes that Harvey tried to molest Timmy, and dumps him.\nTimmy has his bar mitzvah, during which Joy experiences visions of Andy and then Allen, who implores her to commit suicide as he has, but Joy refuses and banishes him from her life. Timmy leaves the reception to find Mark, Harvey's son. He begs Mark (who reveals he has dealt with allegations of pedophilia, referencing events from Solondz's 2004 film Palindromes) for forgiveness, as he made his mistakes before his bar mitzvah (an event marking the beginning of moral accountability). Mark grants him forgiveness, but notes that such gestures are meaningless. Timmy then says that all he wants is his father.\n\nCast\nRelease\nCritical reception\nLife During Wartime received generally favourable reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 104 reviews, and an average rating of 6.32/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"With Life During Wartime, Todd Solondz delivers an unexpected semi-sequel to Happiness in typically uncompromising fashion.\"  On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song was performed by Devendra Banhart. The song was written by Solondz, with music by Marc Shaiman; it was produced by Beck and Banhart, with background vocals by Beck.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released by The Criterion Collection in July 2011.\nPassage 5:\nFear, Anxiety &amp; Depression\nFear, Anxiety and Depression is a 1989 American comedy film written and directed by Todd Solondz and starring Solondz, Stanley Tucci and Jill Wisoff.\n\nProduction\nThe film was Solondz's first for a major studio, after his work in film school had attracted interest and he had been offered three-picture contracts. He had wanted to title it The Young and the Hopeless and was deeply unhappy with the lack of creative control; he has called it \"a painful demoralizing experience\", and did not make another film for several years.\n\nPlot\nSolondz plays Ira Ellis, a neurotic aspiring playwright in the East Village of Manhattan, whose latest work is titled Despair. The film consists of vignettes featuring equally pretentious and as yet unsuccessful members of the arts scene including Ira's friend, Jack, a painter; his chubby girlfriend Sharon, a mime; his subsequent girlfriend, a performance artist; and Jack's cast-off girlfriend with whom he has a fling, an actress. Meanwhile, an old classmate of Ira's, Donny (played by Stanley Tucci in one of his first roles), has achieved success without apparent effort and takes up with Sharon.\n\nCritical reception\nA reviewer for The New York Times called Fear, Anxiety and Depression \"an amiable, uninspired spoof of the notion that agony and art go together\" that acknowledges its debts to other film makers (such as Woody Allen in Ira's character and mannerisms) but lacking a \"distinctive voice or vision\". A retrospective review for IFC called it \"wan and obvious\" satire.\nPassage 6:\nEdward Lachman\nEdward Lachman (born March 31, 1948) is an American cinematographer and director. He has primarily worked in independent film, and has served as director of photography on films by Todd Haynes (including Far from Heaven in 2002 and Carol in 2015, both of which earned Lachman Oscar nominations), Ulrich Seidl, Wim Wenders, Steven Soderbergh and Paul Schrader. His other work includes Werner Herzog's La Soufrière (1977), Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides (1999), Robert Altman's final film A Prairie Home Companion (2006), and Todd Solondz's Life During Wartime (2009). He is a member of the American Society of Cinematographers.\nIn 1989, Lachman co-directed a segment of the anthology film Imagining America. In 2002, he co-directed the controversial Ken Park with Larry Clark. In 2013, Lachman produced a series of videos in collaboration with French electronic duo Daft Punk, for their album Random Access Memories.\n\nLife and education\nLachman was born to a Jewish family in Morristown, New Jersey, the son of Rosabel (Roth) and Edward Lachman, a movie theater distributor and owner. He attended Harvard University and studied in France at the University of Tours before pursuing a BFA in painting at Ohio University. He has a daughter, Bella Lachman (b. 2005) who lives in Amsterdam.\n\nFilmography\nFeature film\nDocumentary films\nShort films\nTelevision\nTV movies\n\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 7:\nDaniel Mann\nDaniel Chugerman (August 8, 1912 – November 21, 1991), known professionally as Daniel Mann, was an American stage, film and television director.\nOriginally trained as an actor by Sanford Meisner, between 1952 and 1987 he directed over 31 feature films and made-for-television. Considered a true \"actor's director\", he helmed seven Oscar-nominated and two Tony Award-winning performances, collaborating with actors like Burt Lancaster, Shirley Booth, Susan Hayward, Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Dean Martin and Anthony Quinn.\nHe was nominated for several accolades, including two Palme d'Or, three Directors Guild of America Awards and a Golden Bear.\n\nBiography\nMann was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Helen and Samuel Chugerman, a lawyer. He was a stage actor since childhood and attended Erasmus Hall High School, New York's Professional Children's School and the Neighborhood Playhouse. He entered films in 1952 as a director and is known for his excellent ear for dialogue. Most of Mann's films were adaptations from the stage (Come Back Little Sheba, The Rose Tattoo, The Teahouse of the August Moon, Hot Spell) and literature (Butterfield 8, The Last Angry Man).\nMann died of heart failure in Los Angeles, California, in November 1991. He is buried in the Jewish Cemetery Hillside Memorial Park.

Solondz's work has received critical acclaim for its commentary on the \"dark underbelly of middle class American suburbia,\" a reflection of his own background in New Jersey. His work includes Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), Happiness (1998), Storytelling (2001),  Palindromes (2004), Life During Wartime (2009), Dark Horse (2011), and Wiener-Dog (2016).\n\nBiography\nSolondz was born in Newark, New Jersey. He wrote several screenplays while working as a delivery boy for the Writers Guild of America. Solondz earned his undergraduate degree in English from Yale and attended New York University's Master of Fine Arts program in film and television, but did not complete a degree.During the early 1990s, Solondz worked at NYANA as a teacher of English as a second language to Russian immigrants in New York City and described the experience as positive.Solondz is an atheist. In The A.V. Club's article \"Is There a God?\", he answered the question \"Well, me, I'm an atheist, so I don't really believe there is. But I suppose I could be proven wrong.\"\n\nCareer\n1980s\nSolondz's student short film Schatt's Last Shot was produced in 1985, and was shown at least once in 1986. The title character is a high schooler who wants to get into Stanford University, but his gym teacher hates him. The teacher fails him because he cannot make a shot in basketball. He has no luck with the girl of his dreams, but he wishes he was more like the coach, whom he challenges to a game of one-on-one.\nIn 1989 Solondz wrote and directed Fear, Anxiety & Depression, an episodic comedy about fledgling playwright Ira (played by Solondz) and his frustrating interactions with women. The film contains several musical interludes, including three songs written for the film. Stanley Tucci appears in one of his early roles as an old, disliked acquaintance of Ira, who takes up playwriting on a whim and becomes the toast of Off-Broadway.\n\n1990s\nThe frustrations of his first feature led Solondz to swear off further involvement with the industry.   More than five years later, an attorney friend urged Solondz to give filmmaking another go, and promised partial finance for any project Solondz came up with. The end result was 1995's  Welcome to the Dollhouse, which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The dark comedy follows the travails of Dawn Wiener, a bespectacled, toothy, and shy 7th-grade girl who is mercilessly teased at school and treated to alternating contempt and neglect at home. It was distinct from most earlier films about adolescent abuse due to its complex characterization.  It gave a balanced and sometimes sympathetic portrayal of the bully antagonist Brandon, and its depiction of Dawn, the ostensible protagonist and victim of the story, showed her as deeply flawed and sometimes cruel and selfish herself.  The film was a major success among critics, and a moderate success at the box office.  It was a festival hit, with screenings all over the world.\nSolondz's next piece was Happiness (1998), a highly controversial film due to the themes explored in it, which range from rape, pedophilia, incest, suicide, and murder to a bizarre sexual phone caller. After the original distributor October Films dropped it, the film was distributed by Good Machine Releasing. The movie received numerous awards, including International Critics' Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and yielded strong critical praise for Solondz.\n\n2000s\nIn 2001, Solondz released Storytelling, which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. It is a film separated into two parts, entitled \"Fiction\" and \"Nonfiction.\" The two stories share two thematic elements, but deal with each in an autonomous manner. Solondz used this format because he wanted to \"find a fresh structure, a fresh form, and a different way of tackling what may be identical geographical material.\" When Solondz initially presented the film to the MPAA, he was told that if he wished to receive a rating other than NC-17, he would have to remove a scene of explicit sex involving a white female and a black male. However, a clause in Solondz's contract allowed him to cover part of the actors with a bright red box. \"For me it's a great victory to have a big red box, the first red box in any studio feature [...] it's right in your face: You're not allowed to see this in our country.\" Solondz did, however, remove a portion of the film (which has variously been reported as either a subplot of the second story, or a third story entirely) which contained a sex scene involving two male actors (one of whom was James Van Der Beek).Solondz's next film, Palindromes (2004), raised the eyebrows of many pundits and reviewers due to its themes of child molestation, statutory rape and abortion. Like all of Solondz's previous films, Palindromes is set in suburban New Jersey. It was released unrated in the US.\nLife During Wartime (formerly known as Forgiveness) was produced by John Hart and Evamere Entertainment and released in 2009. Solondz said the film is a companion piece to Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse. Life During Wartime has characters in common with the two earlier films, but played by different actors and with loose continuity. Information about the characters in the film, and their differences from those of its predecessor Happiness, first emerged in August 2009. The film features Ally Sheedy, Renée Taylor, Paul Reubens, Ciarán Hinds, Shirley Henderson, Michael Lerner, Michael Kenneth Williams, Charlotte Rampling, Allison Janney, Rich Pecci and Chris Marquette.The film debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2009; it was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in August–September 2009, and it won the Osella award there for Best Screenplay.\n\n2010s\nIn July 2010, Solondz completed the script of his next film, Dark Horse, which was filmed in the fall of 2010. To Solondz's surprise, the Creative Artists Agency appreciated the script, the first time for a movie of his. Solondz commented that he realized this is because \"there's no rape, there's no child molestation, there's no masturbation, and then I thought, 'omg, why didn't I think of this years ago?'\"On September 5, 2011, Dark Horse was presented at the Venice Film Festival. On October 14, 2011, Dark Horse made its European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The film received a mixed reception. On April 23, 2012, Dark Horse was announced as the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival 2012.\nWiener-Dog premiered at Sundance 2016. The film tells the story of a dog, as she travels from home to home. Amazon purchased the film at the festival. Starring an ensemble cast led by Ellen Burstyn, Kieran Culkin, Julie Delpy, Danny DeVito, Greta Gerwig, Tracy Letts, and Zosia Mamet, the film serves as a spin-off from Solondz’s 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse, which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. It was released in the US on June 24, 2016 to positive reviews.\n\n2020s\nAs of June 2021, Solondz was arranging financing for his next film, Love Child. Starring Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, it is set to be a twist on the story of Oedipus.\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\nShort films\nPerformances\nRecurring characters\nAcademic work\nIn 2009, Solondz became an adjunct professor on the faculty of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He teaches a course titled Directing and Writing the Feature.\nIn May 2019, Solondz spent a week as the filmmaker in residence at the Centre for Film and Screen at the University of Cambridge.\n\nTheatre work\nIn 2018, Solondz premiered his debut play, titled Emma and Max. The production began previews October 1, opened on October 14, and ran through November 4. It starred Ilana Becker, Zonya Love, Matt Servitto, and Rita Wolf.\n\nAwards\nIn 2007, Solondz was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival.\nPassage 9:\nWiener-Dog (film)\nWiener-Dog is a 2016 American comedy film directed and written by Todd Solondz. Starring an ensemble cast led by Ellen Burstyn, Kieran Culkin, Julie Delpy, Danny DeVito, Greta Gerwig, Tracy Letts, and Zosia Mamet, the film serves as a spin-off from Solondz's 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse, which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. The film is also inspired by the 1966 drama Au Hasard Balthazar, directed by Robert Bresson.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2016. before receiving a limited release on June 24, 2016, by Amazon Studios and IFC Films.\n\nPlot\nDanny brings his cancer-surviving son Remi a wiener dog. His wife Dina does not want to deal with caring for the dog, but Danny informs her Remi is mature and old enough to help the two with the responsibilities. Dina brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to get spayed, and on their way, Remi becomes upset. Dina comforts Remi by telling him an embellished story about her childhood dog, which she claims died after giving birth to a litter of stillborn puppies. During Dina and Danny's yoga class, Remi and Wiener-Dog tear up the couch cushions and cover the living room in feathers. Wiener Dog wanders off into the kitchen, and Remi feeds her a chocolate chip granola bar. Wiener-Dog becomes very ill and spreads diarrhoea around the house. The next day, Danny brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to be euthanized.\nAt the vet, veterinary nurse Dawn Wiener takes Wiener-Dog from the consultation room before the vet can euthanise her. She brings Wiener-Dog home with her, where she nurses the dog back to life. It is loosely implied that she is estranged from her family. One day while shopping for pet food, she runs into her old ex-boyfriend (from junior high) Brandon, who invites her to visit his brother Tommy and his wife April, both with Down syndrome, in Ohio. Dawn agrees, and the two head off to Ohio, where they come across homesick Mexican hitchhikers. Once they arrive in Ohio, Brandon informs his brother that their father had died due to alcoholism. Tommy asks Brandon to stop doing drugs, and Brandon promises he has stopped, even though he was shown injecting drugs earlier in the trip. Dawn offers to leave Wiener-Dog with Tommy and April, who happily accept. On their way home, Dawn and Brandon talk about their future together and happily hold hands.\nDuring an intermission, Wiener-Dog is seen wandering across America, via strip clubs, motels and crime scenes.\nWiener-Dog then arrives with Dave Schmerz, a screenwriting professor who is attempting to get his second screenplay off the ground. One day at work, Schmerz is informed that various students and administration members are complaining about his constant negativity. In the meeting, he tearfully explains that he had tried to put real emotion into his script, but he compromised and added funny elements to make it more commercial, thus ruining it. Schmerz is asked to attend a discussion with a previous student who became a famous film director, who mocks Schmerz's teaching and encourages the students to drop out. Schmerz creates a bomb and attaches it to Wiener-Dog. Students notice and contact authorities. Dave gets stopped by authorities investigating the incident on the way home and willingly identifies himself.\nElderly Nana, who lives with her caregiver Yvette, is Wiener-Dog's final owner. She names her \"Cancer.\" Nana receives a call from her granddaughter Zoe, who is on her way to visit for the first time in several years, along with her boyfriend Fantasy, a conceptual artist. Once Zoe arrives, she asks for money in order to pay for Fantasy's new art project. Nana agrees to give her the money. While filling out the check, Zoe confides in her Nana, wondering if Fantasy is cheating on her. Once Zoe leaves, Nana goes outside and sits with Wiener-Dog, where she dreams about a younger version of herself coming back to show her what her life could have been if she had been more positive. She wakes up to discover Wiener-Dog has run away. She then spots Wiener-Dog being run over and killed by a truck.\nSix months later, a stuffed animatronic Wiener-Dog is displayed in Fantasy's art exhibit.\n\nCast\nFirst story\n\nKeaton Nigel Cooke as Remi\nTracy Letts as Danny\nJulie Delpy as DinaSecond story\n\nGreta Gerwig as Dawn Wiener\nKieran Culkin as Brandon McCarthy\nHaraldo Alvarez as Luis\nRigoberto Garcia as Jose\nDain Eulogio-Victoriano as Jose Luis\nConnor Long as Tommy\nBridget Brown as AprilIntermission\nThird story\n\nDanny DeVito as Dave Schmerz\nSharon Washington as Phillips\nDevin Druid as Dwight\nTrey Silver as Peter Jacobson\nAri Graynor as Carol Steinhart\nKett Turton as Director\nSamrat Chakrabarti as Dr. Farhard Rahman\nTrey Gerrald as Zeno\nClara Mamet as Lina\nKatherine Reis as RafaFourth story\n\nEllen Burstyn as Nana\nMelo Ludwig as Young Nana\nZosia Mamet as Zoe\nMichael Shaw as Fantasy\nMarcella Lowery as Yvette\n\nProduction\nOn October 23, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Todd Solondz would next write and direct the comedy Wiener-Dog with Julie Delpy and Greta Gerwig attached as stars, Gerwig playing Dawn Wiener.

It holds a 74% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 108 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"For filmgoers predisposed to enjoy Todd Solondz' brand of black comedy, Wiener-Dog won't disappoint — but those put off by previous works need not apply.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 66 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".Guy Lodge of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: \"Each of their mini-narratives plays out in the pause-heavy mode of highly mannered mundanity that will feel entirely natural to Solondz acolytes — and, it seems, to the actors, most of whom tackle the director’s customarily arch dialogue with brusque aplomb. Delpy, in particular, was born to deliver his harshest words, though it’s Burstyn — using very few at all, her set face shifting and falling as the script lends reasoning to her froideur — whom viewers might find themselves unable to shake.\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review writing: \"These last minutes are the best in the film and by far the most visually dazzling, even though Ed Lachman’s cinematography throughout stands as a model of subtle and elegant compositional skill tested by what are, for the most part, deliberately banal settings.\" World Socialist Web Site reviewer David Walsh gave the film a positive review, commenting that \"the hostility directed toward the contemporary art and film scene is perhaps the strongest feature of Wiener-Dog.\"\nPassage 10:\nJames Chinlund\nJames Chinlund (born March 17, 1971) is an American production designer. He was born and raised in New York City and studied Fine Art at CalArts in Los Angeles, with a focus on sculpture and large scale installation art works.

The music for their repertoire of about 1000 songs was all written by Slavko and arranged by Vilko, an academic composer. Lyrics for their songs were written by Marjan Stare, Ferry Souvan, Ivan Sivec, Franc Košir, Tone Fornezzi, Vinko Šimek and others.\nThe band changed the name several times. They started as a trio, then formed a quartet and finally formed a quintet with two or three singers. They were and remain particularly popular in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and the Slovene diaspora over the world. The band invented the Oberkrainer music, a new music genre of volksmusik and sold over 32 million records, which makes them the best selling Slovene music artists ever. They performed over 10,000 concerts all over the world, three times in the Berlin Philharmonic. Their biggest hit Na Golici (Trompetenecho), written by Slavko Avsenik and released in 1955, is according to some the most played instrumental piece of music in history. The band disbanded in 1990 due to Slavko's problems with his spine.\n\nDiscography\nSingles\nPassage 2:\nCaptain Cook und seine singenden Saxophone\nCaptain Cook und seine singenden Saxophone are a German schlager instrumental group founded in 1993.

This song was Slavko Avsenik's tribute to Planica.\n\nBackground\nMusic was written by Slavko Avsenik, lyrics written by Marjan Stare and arranged by Slavko's brother Vilko Ovsenik. Original voice was contributed by three vocals in the band at that time: Ema Prodnik, Jožica Svete and Alfi Nipič. Song world premiered at opening of 5th FIS Ski Flying World Championships on 15 March 1979 when band performed in the rain on the stage under RTV dom next to famous flying hill Letalnica bratov Gorišek. The main chorus »Planica, Planica, snežena kraljica« (Planica, Planica, snow queen) is played every time someone jumps further than 240 meters. In 1979 it was first time released on »Frochloche stunden mit music« in Germany. A year later song was first released in Slovenia on »Vesele urice«.\n\nTribute to Planica\nFrom 1946-1952 Slavko Avsenik was a national team ski jumper. But then he injured and became a musician. In 1948 he set his personal record of 74 m (243 ft) in Planica at Srednja Bloudkova (K80). Slavko was always big fan of ski jumping and especially of Planica to whom he was very emotionally attached. That's why he decided to write this song as a tribute to Planica.

It is the former home of the German-Jewish author Lion Feuchtwanger and his wife Marta. The Feuchtwangers bought this Spanish-style mansion in 1943 for only $9,000, the annual salary of a school teacher. The house was a popular meeting place for artists and the community of German-speaking émigrés. Lion Feuchtwanger wrote six of his historical novels in this house: Der Tag wird kommen, Waffen für Amerika, Die Jüdin von Toledo, Narrenweisheit oder Tod und Verklärung des Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jefta und seine Töchter, and Goya oder der arge Weg der Erkenntnis.\n\nConstruction\nVilla Aurora was part of a building project initiated by Arthur Weber and George Ley in cooperation with the Los Angeles Times, which reported routinely on the construction of this \"demonstration house\". Weber hired architect Mark Daniels and interior designer Rodney Benso. The house pipe organ was built by Santa Monica Artcraft. Villa Aurora was inspired by the Teruel Cathedral outside Sevilla, Spain. The wood for the ceilings was brought in from Spain and the fountains came from Italy. Malibu Potteries supplied the decorative tiles throughout the entire house. When Villa Aurora was finished in 1928, it featured the latest technological inventions and novelties in domestic design such as an electric garage openers, a dishwasher, a fridge and a gas range.  Due to the depression, it was not sold, and the developer Weber and his family were forced to move in themselves in 1931. Financial problems forced Weber to leave the house in 1939 and the property sat idle.\n\nVilla Aurora and the Feuchtwangers\nIn 1941, Lion Feuchtwanger and his wife Marta arrived in Los Angeles via New York and Mexico after having escaped from the South of France. Despite the fact that the Villa was in deplorable condition (with windows broken, the cellar full of debris, the garden overgrown) they bought the house in 1943 for the price of $9,000. They appreciated the location all the more as the landscape of Pacific Palisades reminded them of the Mediterranean where they had travelled extensively during the early days of their marriage. \nWith gasoline rationing in effect, travel between Pacific Palisades and Los Angeles was difficult, making purchase of outlying real estate unappealing for most. But Lion Feuchtwanger liked the solitude for his work and the decision to purchase the house came easily. Here, Feuchtwanger created his third library. Marta bought the used furniture and took care of the garden. While Lion used to buy books whenever there was money to spend, Marta bought plants and created a huge garden, which was over time diminished in size through landslides.\nDuring the war the Villa became a meeting place for fellow émigrés, just as Salka and Berthold Viertel's house in Santa Monica. Prominent members of the German emigre community who would meet at the houses included Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Arnold Schoenberg, Vicki Baum, Bruno Frank, Ludwig Marcuse, Franz Werfel and Bertolt Brecht, as well as other European expatriates like Charlie Chaplin and Charles Laughton.After Lion's death in 1958 the house was left to the University of Southern California with the stipulation that Marta would be allowed to stay for the remainder of her life and was made the caretaker of the library, which had grown to 30,000 volumes. At present the Villa is still home to 22,000 books, with the most valuable copies having been moved to the USC Feuchtwanger Memorial Library.\n\nVilla Aurora as an artists residence\nMarta Feuchtwanger lived at Villa Aurora until her death in 1987. After Marta's death the University of Southern California was looking to sell the property. The sale of the dilapidated Villa seemed imminent and USC professor Harold von Hofe asked the journalist and Feuchtwanger biographer Volker Skierka to launch an initiative to save the Villa Aurora. He also won the support of many public figures in politics and the media, such as the former head of the publishing house Rowohlt, Fritz J. Raddatz, and member of the German parliament, Freimut Duve. The goal was to create a \"Villa Massimo on the Pacific\" modeled after the artists residency Villa Massimo in Rome. In order to preserve the house as the only existing monument to European and German exiles to the West Coast of the United States, the association \"Friends and Supporters of Villa Aurora\" was founded in Berlin. The non-profit organization secured public funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, the Berlin Senate, the Berlin Lottery Foundation and the Tagesspiegel Foundation and was able to purchase and renovate the house. Prof. Frank Dimster, FAIA, restored the house and received the City of Los Angeles Historic Preservation Award in 1996.The Feuchtwanger House was landmarked as one of the Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments and also by the Pacific Palisades Historical Society. The historic organ that in addition to Marta Feuchtwanger, Bruno Walter, Ernst Toch and Hanns Eisler had played on, was restored in 2010. The historic furniture, including the beds of Marta and Lion, and their desks and chairs, are still on the premises.\nToday, Villa Aurora is an artists residence offering fellowships for German-based writers, visual artists, composers and filmmakers selected by independent committees. Together with the USC Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, the organization awards an annual Feuchtwanger Fellowship to artists who are persecuted in their home countries in memory of the history of German emigration in the 1930s.\nVilla Aurora is funded by the German Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. Sponsors and private donations further help to maintain the historic property. The Villa stands as a reminder of German exile in the United States and is a memorial to German-Exile-Culture and the persecution of the German Jews. Villa Aurora is a place for cultural encounters, creative debates and joint projects. Since 1995 around 300 artists have enlivened this place and have themselves been inspired by U.S. culture and the exiles' traces.\nThe Villa Aurora Forum in Berlin organizes the meetings of the selection committees which choose the fellows of Villa Aurora. The Forum also presents the results of the artists' works to the German public through exhibitions, screenings, readings, concerts and the publishing of editions. At the annual 'Villa Aurora Nacht' in Berlin, the newly chosen fellows are presented along with the work of the ones from the previous year.\n\nThe name \"Villa Aurora\"\nThe origin of the name \"Villa Aurora\" is most likely from the famous Roman residence built for Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. The residence Casa di Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi boasts a fresco of Aurora painted by Guercino.\n\nVilla Aurora – Berlin Office\nThe Villa Aurora is operated by two institutions: the \"Villa Aurora & Thomas Mann House e.V.\" situated in Berlin and the \"Friends of Villa Aurora Inc\" in Los Angeles.\nIn addition to administering the selection of grant recipients and the organization's overall funding, the Berlin Office produces programs and publications featuring alumni presenting results of their stays in Los Angeles to the German public.\nThe Berlin Office also develops programs focused on current transatlantic debates as well as the history of exile. Regular events include both an annual reception, which brings future fellows and alumni together with representatives from culture, politics, media, the sciences and humanities, as well as the commemoration of the Burning of the Books on May 10, 1933.\nThe office is situated at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities on Gendarmenmarkt. Once a year, the organization arranges meetings of the juries responsible for selecting artists for the Villa Aurora Fellowships and intellectuals addressing fundamental issues of our time for the Thomas Mann Fellowships. As a result of intense discussion, experts choose recipients for the subsequent year from a large number of applicants. For those selected, the Berlin Office is the first point of contact: It is where they outline their projects and plans and work with the Berlin team to initiate contacts with partners in Los Angeles.\nTogether with Reporters Without Borders and the University of Southern California's Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, Villa Aurora and Thomas Mann House e.V. grants its annual Feuchtwanger Fellowship to a writer or journalist committed to human rights or facing censorship and persecution in their home countries. Additionally, the Berlin team, in cooperation with a partner institution, invites an artist from Los Angeles to Berlin to foster sustainable cultural exchange with Villa Aurora and Thomas Mann House alumni.\n\n20 Years Villa Aurora\nOn the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Villa Aurora as an institution for cultural exchange in the US, the event Checkpoint California took place at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle.

Since few had witnessed their earlier successes, many in Europe were skeptical about their claims.  Some skeptics in the European press went so far as to claim that the stories were a \"bluff.\"  The 30 August 1908 edition of Le petit journal illustré was quoted as saying, \"The experiments that Wilbur Wright is carrying out in France at the moment victoriously responded to this accusation.\"  Among those present for the public demonstrations prior to the filming was Louis Blériot, who would cross the English Channel by plane the following year.\nIt begins with a shot of Wilbur Wright starting the engine; an unidentified assistant (quite likely his brother, Orville) is seen at the front of the aircraft.  From there, shots of the aircraft in flight with Wright at the controls along with an unidentified passenger cut to shots of onlookers on the ground, presumably military and press liaisons.  The aircraft is shown in side-to-side flybys as well as low-altitude passes directly toward and away from the camera.\nThe aerial shots begin at the 1:34 mark immediately after a shot of the aircraft coming to a landing directly approaching the camera.  A title card appears which reads Aufnahmen von der Flugmaschine aus gemacht, or \"Shots Taken from the Flying Machine.\"  From there, the shot is of the aircraft on its launch sled as it is being prepared for takeoff.  An assistant at the rear of the plane, again presumably Orville Wright, starts the engine as Wilbur Wright takes his seat at the controls.  The actual onboard shots, with the camera mounted on the left lower wing near Wright's seating position begin at approximately the two-minute mark of the film as the aircraft lifts off from the launch sled.  The canard, elevator and the elevator's control cord are in the foreground of the film as the Italian countryside (complete with livestock, a man on horseback and the ruins of a Roman aqueduct) passes beneath.Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine has been restored and archived by Filmarchiv Austria.\nPassage 8:\nCarl Maria von Weber\nCarl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 – 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, virtuoso pianist, guitarist, and critic who was one of the first significant composers of the Romantic era. Best known for his operas, he was a crucial figure in the development of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic opera).Throughout his youth, his father, Franz Anton, relentlessly moved the family between Hamburg, Salzburg, Freiberg, Augsburg and Vienna. Consequently he studied with many teachers—his father, Johann Peter Heuschkel, Michael Haydn, Giovanni Valesi, Johann Nepomuk Kalcher, and Georg Joseph Vogler—under whose supervision he composed four operas, none of which survive complete. He had a modest output of non-operatic music, which includes two symphonies; a viola concerto; bassoon concerti; piano pieces such as Konzertstück in F minor and Invitation to the Dance; and many pieces that featured the clarinet, usually written for the virtuoso clarinetist Heinrich Baermann. His mature operas—Silvana (1810), Abu Hassan (1811), Der Freischütz (1821), Die drei Pintos (comp. 1820–21), Euryanthe (1823), Oberon (1826)—had a major impact on subsequent German composers including Marschner, Meyerbeer, and Wagner; his compositions for piano influenced those of Mendelssohn, Chopin and Liszt. His best known work, Der Freischütz, remains among the most significant German operas.\n\nLife and career\nChildhood\nWeber, born in Eutin, Bishopric of Lübeck, was the eldest of the three children of Franz Anton von Weber and his second wife, Genovefa Weber, a Viennese singer. He was baptized Catholic on 20 November 1786 with the name Carl Friedrich Ernst; the alternative second name Maria appeared only later. His brother and sister died in infancy. Both parents were Catholic and originally came from the far south of Germany. The \"von\" was an affectation of his father's, who was not an aristocrat and who claimed descent from a south German noble family which was already extinct at the time.\nIn April 1779, Franz Anton had been appointed director of the prince-bishopric orchestra, Eutin, which, however, was dissolved in 1781 because of spending cuts. He then took the position of Eutin's municipal music director. Dissatisfied with this position, he resigned in 1787 and founded a theatre company in Hamburg. After a brief stay in Vienna, he joined the theatre company of Johann Friedrich Toscani (husband of Elisabeth Toscani) and Peter Carl Santorini, who performed in Kassel, Marburg, and Hofgeismar. He tried repeatedly to establish a lasting company of his own but had only intermittent success.Franz Anton's half-brother, Franz Fridolin, married Cäcilia Stamm and had four daughters—Josepha, Aloysia, Constanze, and Sophie—all of whom became notable singers. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart attempted to woo Aloysia, composing several pieces for her. After she rejected his advances, Mozart went on to marry Constanze; thus Mozart's wife was a cousin of Carl Maria von Weber.\nA gifted violinist, Franz Anton had ambitions of turning Weber into a child prodigy like Mozart. Weber was born with a congenital hip disorder and did not begin to walk until he was four. But by then, he was already a capable singer and pianist.\n\nEducation\nFranz Anton gave Weber a comprehensive education, which was frequently interrupted by the family's moves. In 1796, Weber continued his musical education in Hildburghausen, where he was instructed by the oboist Johann Peter Heuschkel. After moving to Salzburg in autumn 1797, Weber studied from 1798 with Michael Haydn, younger brother of the better-known Joseph Haydn, who agreed to teach Weber free of charge.\nHis time in Salzburg was overshadowed by the death of his mother Genovefa, who succumbed to tuberculosis on 13 March 1798, and that of his one-year-old sister Antonetta on 29 December 1798 in Munich. After the death of Carl's mother, his paternal aunt Adelaide took over the care of him.\nA visit to Joseph Haydn in Vienna, presumably in hope of advanced teaching, was fruitless. In autumn 1798, Weber moved to Munich where he studied singing with Johann Evangelist Wallishauser and composing with Johann Nepomuk Kalcher, who supervised Weber's first opera, Die Macht der Liebe und des Weins (The Power of Love and Wine). Like his other compositions of that period, this opera is lost. Six fughettas for piano of the twelve-year-old Weber were published in Leipzig.\nWeber's musical education was extended by a mastering of lithography which he learned in the workshop of Alois Senefelder (the inventor of the process) and Franz Gleißner (autumn 1799). A set of his Variations for the Pianoforte was lithographed by Weber himself.\nIn 1800, the family moved to Freiberg in Saxony, where Weber, then 14 years old, wrote an opera called Das stumme Waldmädchen (The Silent Forest Maiden). It was produced at the Freiberg and Chemnitz theatres and later in Saint Petersburg (1804), Vienna (1805/1805) and Prague (1806). The young Weber also began to publish articles as a music critic, for example in the Leipziger Neue Zeitung in 1801.\nIn 1801, the family returned to Salzburg, where Weber resumed his studies with Michael Haydn. Weber composed his third opera Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn (Peter Schmoll and His Neighbours) which his teacher approved. After a concert tour in 1802 the Webers returned to Augsburg where it is believed Peter Schmoll premiered.\nIn mid 1803, Weber continued his studies in Vienna with Abbé Vogler, founder of important music schools in Mannheim, Stockholm, and Darmstadt. Another famous pupil of Vogler in Darmstadt was Jakob Meyer Beer, later known as Giacomo Meyerbeer, who became a close friend of Weber. In letters they addressed each other as \"brother\".\n\nEarly career 1804–1810\nVogler recommended the 17-year-old Weber for the post of Director at the Breslau Opera in 1804; Weber was offered and accepted the post. He sought to reform the Opera by pensioning off older singers, expanding the orchestra, and tackling a more challenging repertoire. His ambitious and dedicated work as director of the orchestra was acknowledged, though his tempi were frequently criticized as too fast. As the daily routine did not leave sufficient time for his own creative work, Weber did not seek to extend his two-year appointment.After an interlude at the court of Duke Eugen of Württemberg, who resided in Silesia, Weber served from 1807 to 1810 in Stuttgart as private secretary to Duke Ludwig, brother of King Frederick I of Württemberg. Weber's time in Württemberg was plagued with troubles. He fell deeply into debt and became entangled in the financial manipulations of his employer, e.g. the sale of confirmations of ducal service which exempted the purchaser from military service. Weber was arrested and charged with embezzlement and bribery. As he could disprove the allegations, the case was brought under civil law to avoid compromising the de facto manipulator, the brother of the king. Weber agreed to pay the costs (the last payment was made in 1816) and was banished from Württemberg together with his father.As a sobering side effect, Weber started to keep a diary to list his expenses and correspondence, and make occasional comments on special events.Weber remained prolific as a composer during this period, writing a quantity of religious music, mainly for the Catholic mass. This, however, earned him the hostility of conservatives working for the re-establishment of traditional chant in liturgy. In his biography of Weber, Warrack notes that Weber was an accomplished guitarist. It was in this year that his first song with guitar accompaniment, \"Liebeszauber\", was printed. Some of his most original and innovative songs were written during the following years, including \"Er an Sie\" (1808) and \"Was zieht zu deinem Zauberkreise\" (1809).\n\nLater career 1810–1826\nIn 1810, Weber visited several cities throughout Germany; 1811 was a pivotal year in his career when he met and worked with the Munich court clarinetist Heinrich Baermann and composed the Concertino in E♭ Major, Op. 26, J. 109, and the two concerti J. 114 and J. 118 for him; from December 1811 through March 1812, Weber went on tour with Baermann playing the clarinet works, and it was some of the final concerts on this tour that changed public, critical, and royal opinions of Weber's work, and helped him to mount a successful performance of Silvana in Berlin later that year.\nFrom 1813 to 1816, he was director of the Opera in Prague; from 1816 to 1817 he worked in Berlin, and from 1817 onwards he was director of the prestigious Opera in Dresden, working hard to establish a German opera, in reaction to the Italian opera which had dominated the European music scene since the 18th century. He was inspired in this endeavour by the ideals of the Sturm und Drang period, and also by the German folk song collection \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" by Arnim and Brentano. It was in 1816 that he wrote the Duet Op. 38 for guitar and piano, possibly inspired by similar works printed in Vienna by such composers as Hummel and Diabelli. On 4 November 1817, he married Caroline Brandt, a singer who created the title role of Silvana. In 1819, he wrote perhaps his most famous piano piece, Invitation to the Dance.\n\nThe successful premiere of Der Freischütz on 18 June 1821 in Berlin led to performances all over Europe. On the very morning of the premiere, Weber finished his Konzertstück in F minor for Piano and Orchestra, and he premiered it a week later.\nIn 1823, Weber composed his first (and only) full-length, through-composed opera Euryanthe to a libretto by Helmina von Chézy, several passages of which (notably the music for the villainous couple Lysiart and Eglantine) anticipate the early, romantic operas of Richard Wagner. In 1824, Weber received an invitation from The Royal Opera, London, to compose and produce Oberon, based on Christoph Martin Wieland's poem of the same name. Weber accepted the invitation, and in 1826 he travelled to England, to finish the work and conduct the premiere on 12 April.\nWeber was already suffering from tuberculosis when he visited London. He conducted the premiere and twelve sold-out performances of Oberon in London during April and in May, and despite his rapidly worsening health, he continued to fulfil commitments for private concerts and benefits.\nHe died in his sleep during the night on 5 June 1826 at the home of his good friend and host Sir George Smart; he was 39 years old. He was buried in London.\nEighteen years later, in December 1844, his remains were transferred to the family burial plot in the Old Catholic Cemetery (Alter Katholischer Friedhof) in Dresden at the side of his youngest son Alexander, who at the age of 19 had died of measles seven weeks before. The simple gravestone, designed by Gottfried Semper, lies against the northern boundary wall. Wagner composed a eulogy \"An Weber's Grabe\" WWV 72 for the reburial. The piece for male choir a cappella was premiered on 16 December 1844 in Dresden. For this occasion Wagner also composed Funeral Music for Winds after Themes from \"Euryanthe\" of Weber, WWV 73.\nWeber's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos (The Three Pintos) was originally given by his widow to Meyerbeer for completion; it was eventually completed by Gustav Mahler, who conducted the first performance in Leipzig on 20 January 1888.\n\nLegacy\nWeber's operas Der Freischütz, Euryanthe, and Oberon greatly influenced the development of the Romantische Oper (Romantic opera) in Germany. Der Freischütz came to be regarded as the first German opera, Euryanthe developed the leitmotif technique to an unprecedented degree, while Oberon may have influenced Mendelssohn's music for A Midsummer Night's Dream and, at the same time, revealed Weber's lifelong interest in the music of non-Western cultures. This interest was first manifested in Weber's incidental music for Schiller's translation of Gozzi's Turandot, for which he used a Chinese melody, making him the first Western composer to use an Asian tune that was not of the pseudo-Turkish kind popularized by Mozart and others.\n\nWeber's compositions for clarinet, bassoon, and horn occupy an important place in the musical repertoire. His compositions for the clarinet, which include two concertos, a concertino, a quintet, a duo concertante, and variations on a theme from his opera Silvana, are regularly performed today. His Concertino for Horn and Orchestra requires the performer to simultaneously produce two notes by humming while playing—a technique known as \"multiphonics\". His bassoon concerto and the Andante e Rondo ungarese (a reworking of a piece originally for viola and orchestra) are also popular with bassoonists.\nWeber's contribution to vocal and choral music is also significant. His body of Catholic religious music was highly popular in 19th-century Germany, and he composed one of the earliest song cycles, Die Temperamente beim Verluste der Geliebten ([Four] Temperaments on the Loss of a Lover). Weber was also notable as one of the first conductors to conduct without a piano or violin.\nWeber's orchestration has also been highly praised and emulated by later generations of composers—Berlioz referred to him several times in his Treatise on Instrumentation while Debussy remarked that the sound of the Weber orchestra was obtained through the scrutiny of the soul of each instrument.\nHis operas influenced the work of later opera composers, especially in Germany, such as Marschner, Meyerbeer, and Wagner, as well as several nationalist 19th-century composers such as Glinka. Homage has been paid to Weber by many 20th-century composers, such as Debussy and Stravinsky. Mahler completed Weber's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos and made revisions of Euryanthe and Oberon while Hindemith composed the popular Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber, based on Weber's lesser-known keyboard works and the incidental music to Turandot.\nWeber also wrote music journalism and was interested in folksong, and learned lithography to engrave his own works.\n\nA virtuoso pianist himself, Weber composed four sonatas, two concertos, and the Konzertstück in F minor (Concert Piece), which inspired composers such as Chopin, Liszt, and Mendelssohn. The Konzertstück provided a new model for the one-movement concerto in several contrasting sections (such as Liszt's, who often played the work), and was acknowledged by Stravinsky as the model for his Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra. Weber's shorter piano pieces, such as the Invitation to the Dance, were later orchestrated by Berlioz, while his Polacca Brillante was later set for piano and orchestra by Liszt. However, Weber's piano music all but disappeared from the repertoire. There are several recordings of the major works for the solo piano, including complete recordings of the piano sonatas and the shorter piano pieces, and there are recordings of the individual sonatas by Claudio Arrau (1st sonata), Alfred Cortot and Emil Gilels (2nd sonata), Sviatoslav Richter (3rd sonata), and Leon Fleisher (4th sonata). The Invitation to the Dance, although better known in Berlioz's orchestration (as part of the ballet music for a Paris production of Der Freischütz), has long been played and recorded by pianists (e.g., by Benno Moiseiwitsch [in Carl Tausig's arrangement]). Invitation to the Dance also served as the thematic basis for Benny Goodman's swing theme song for the radio program Let's Dance.\n\nWorks\nNotes and references\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nAlfred Woltmann\nAlfred Woltmann (18 May 1841 – 6 February 1880) was a German art historian.  He was born at Charlottenburg, studied at Berlin and Munich, and was appointed professor of art history successively at the Karlsruhe Polytechnicum (1868) and at the universities of Prague (1874) and Strasbourg (1878).  Conjointly with the author he adapted the fifth volume of Schnaase's Geschichte der bildenden Künste for the second edition (1872), and with Karl Woermann began a Geschichte der Malerei (1878), completed after his death by his collaborator.  Besides his principal work, Holbein und seine Zeit (second edition, 1873–76), he wrote:  \n\nDie deutsche Kunst und Die Reformation (second edition, 1871)\nDie Baugeschichte Berlins (1872)\nGeschichte der deutschen Kunst in Elsass (1876)\nDie deutsche  Kunst in Prag (1877)\nAus vier Jahrhunderten niederländischdeutscher Kunstgeschichte (1878)\nPassage 10:\nJokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious\nJokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious (German: Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten) is a 1905 book on the psychoanalysis of jokes and humour by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. In the work, Freud describes the psychological processes and techniques of jokes, which he compares to the processes and techniques of dreamwork and the unconscious.\n\nContents\nFreud claims that \"our enjoyment of the joke\" indicates what is being repressed in more serious talk. Freud argues that the success of the joke depends upon a psychic economy, whereby the joke allows one to overcome inhibitions.According to Freud, understanding of joke technique is essential for understanding jokes and their relation to the unconscious, however, these techniques are what make a joke a joke. Freud also noted that the listener laughing really heartily at the joke will typically not be in the mood for investigating its technique.\n\nStructure\nThe book is divided into three sections: \"analytic,\" \"synthetic\" and \"theoretical.\"\n\nAnalytic part\nThe book's first section includes a discussion on the techniques and tendencies of jokes.\n\nSynthetic part\nThe second section includes a discussion on the psychological origins and motives of the joke and the joke as a social process.\n\nTheoretical part\nThe book's final section discusses the joke's relation to dreams and the Unconscious.\n\nSee also\nHumour in Freud\nSigmund Freud bibliography", "answers": ["19 November 1786"], "length": 5913, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4beefe473acde45f1accb31e6f45cff16e0a8b47eefd032e"}

He served as a delegate to the United States Congress from the Michigan Territory, as the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, and as mayor of Detroit.\n\nEarly life\nPart of the prominent Pennsylvania Biddle family, John Biddle was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1792, the son of Hannah Shephard and Charles Biddle, former Vice President of Pennsylvania, and nephew of Commodore Nicholas Biddle. He attended the common schools before entering and graduating from Princeton College.\n\nCareer\nAt the outbreak of the War of 1812, Biddle enlisted in the U.S. Army and was appointed a second lieutenant in the Third Artillery on July 6, 1812, and promoted to first lieutenant March 13, 1813. He was attached to the staff of General Winfield Scott on the Niagara Frontier for most of the war. He became captain in the Forty-second Infantry October 1, 1813, served as assistant inspector general with the rank of major from June 19, 1817, to June 1, 1821, and commanded Fort Shelby in Detroit for some time.After leaving the military, Biddle was appointed paymaster and Indian agent at Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1821 and 1822. He was register of the land at Detroit in Michigan Territory, 1823–1837; commissioner for determining the ancient land claims at Detroit, Mackinaw, Sault Ste. Marie, Green Bay, and Prairie du Chien.\n\nPolitics and civic leadership\nBiddle served as mayor of Detroit in 1827 and 1828. He was elected a delegate from the Territory of Michigan to the Twenty-first Congress and served from March 4, 1829, until his resignation on February 21, 1831. He was president of the convention that framed the State constitution for Michigan in 1835, even though his Whig Party was in the minority. He ran unsuccessfully as the Whig candidate for election to the United States Senate and later for Governor of Michigan. Biddle was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1841 and served as speaker, and was a Trustee of the University of Michigan.Biddle was president of the Michigan Central Railroad. He also served as the first president of Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank, and was a bank director from 1829 through 1838. He was also active in the civic life of Detroit, being elected vice president of the Detroit Athenaeum, active in the Association for Promoting Female Education in the City of Detroit, and vice president (1828–1837) and president (1837) of the Historical Society of Michigan.\n\nPersonal life\nOn January 21, 1819, he married Eliza Falconer Bradish (1795–1865), the daughter of James Bradish (1772–1799) and Margaretta Thompson (1770–1846) of New York. The couple had four children that lived to adulthood:\nMargaretta Falconer Biddle (1825–1913), who married Andrew Porter (1820–1872), a Civil War general\nWilliam Shepard Biddle (1830–1901), who married Susan Dayton Ogden (1831–1878), daughter of Elias B. D. Ogden, a  New Jersey Supreme Court Justice\nMajor James Biddle (1833–1905)\nEdward John Biddle (1836–1892)In 1859, Biddle went to White Sulphur Springs in what is now West Virginia, for the summer, and died there. He is interred in Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan.\n\nWyandotte\nIn 1818, Biddle acquired 1,800 acres (7.3 km2) of land south of Detroit. He constructed a summer estate on the land, completed in 1835. Biddle named his estate \"Wyandotte\" after the Native American people who had once lived there. Biddle's home stood where the George P. MacNichol House how sits. Biddle and his family retired to the Wyandotte estate in 1836. However, Biddle was uninterested in farming the estate, and spent much time on his estate near St. Louis, Michigan. In 1853, he sold the Wyandotte estate to Eber Brock Ward of Eureka Iron & Steel Works, who developed the area into the city of Wyandotte, Michigan. Jefferson Avenue, which stretches from New Baltimore to East Rockwood, is named Biddle Avenue through Wyandotte. After selling the Wyandotte estate, Biddle and his wife returned to Philadelphia, and later the couple spent much time in Paris.\n\nDescendants\n\nHis grandson (William Shepard Biddle's son), also named John Biddle (1859–1936) became Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.\nPassage 2:\nJohn Biddle (United States Army general)\nMajor General John Biddle (February 2, 1859 – January 18, 1936) was a career United States Army officer who became superintendent of the United States Military Academy.\n\nEarly life\nBiddle was born in Detroit, Michigan. His father was William Shepard Biddle (1830–1902) and mother was Susan Dayton Ogden (1831–1878). His Biddle family included many political and military leaders, including grandfather John Biddle (1792–1859) and great-grandfather Charles Biddle (1745–1821). His maternal great-grandfather, Aaron Ogden, served as governor of New Jersey. His maternal grandfather, Elias B. D. Ogden, served as  associate justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.His siblings were Dr. Andrew P. Biddle, First Lieutenant William S. Biddle Jr. and Eliza (Lily) Biddle, wife of Episcopal Bishop G. Mott Williams.Biddle was raised outside the United States until he was a teenager, and he attended schools in Geneva and Heidelberg. He then attended the University of Michigan for a year, where he became a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, but left to attend the United States Military Academy. He graduated in 1881, ranked second of 53. His high class ranking earned him a second lieutenant's commission in the first choice of most top graduates, the Corps of Engineers.\n\nMilitary career\nBiddle was commissioned an engineer. Biddle was in charge of river and harbor work at Nashville, Tennessee from 1891 to 1898. When the Spanish–American War broke out, he became Chief Engineer of Volunteers, serving in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines. He was awarded the Silver Star. From 1901 to 1907 he was Engineer-Commissioner in charge of public works in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, he was in charge of river and harbor work in San Francisco from 1907 to 1911 and then served as an observer with the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front from November 1914 to June 1915. He then was in charge of river and harbor improvements in Baltimore, Maryland. Biddle served as the superintendent of the US Military Academy at West Point from July 1916 to June 1917. When the United States entered World War I, he commanded a brigade of engineer regiments, then served as acting United States Army Chief of Staff in Washington while Chief of Staff Tasker Bliss was in London. In 1918 he was again sent overseas to take charge of American troops in Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nDeath\nBiddle died in San Antonio, Texas after a long illness.His nephew William Shepard Biddle III (1900–1981), rose to be major general after commanding the 113th Cavalry Regiment in World War II, and the 11th Constabulary Regiment in the German occupation.\n\nAwards and decorations\nUnited KingdomRoyal Victorian Order (commander) (1919)\nOrder of the Bath (knight commander) (1918)United StatesArmy Distinguished Service Medal\nSilver StarThe citation for his Army DSM reads:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Major General John Biddle, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. In command of American troops in England, by his tact and diplomacy in handling intricate problems, General Biddle made possible the successful transshipment of many thousands of men to France. To his executive ability and efficient handling, control, and dispatch of casual troops through England is largely due.\nPassage 3:\nAnthony Biddle (Paralympian)\nAnthony John Biddle  (born 18 June 1975) is an Australian Paralympic tandem cyclist and athlete. He was born in the New South Wales city of Gosford. He competed in athletics without winning any medals at the 1996 Atlanta Games and the 2000 Sydney Games. At the 2004 Athens Games, he switched to cycling and won a gold medal in the Men's 1 km Time Trial Tandem B1–3 event, for which he received a Medal of the Order of Australia, and a bronze medal in the Men's Sprint Tandem B1–3 event. Kial Stewart was his pilot for both events.\nPassage 4:\nJohn Biddle (yachting cinematographer)\nJohn Scott Biddle (June 7, 1925 – October 1, 2008) was a foremost yachting cinematographer and lecturer, establishing a film-making career that spanned more than forty years.  His films captured not only the technical aspects of sailing but also the human story in events as tranquil as a Nova Scotia cruise and as grand as the America's Cup Races.\n\nEarly life\nBiddle was born on June 7, 1925, near Philadelphia, the fourth of five children.  His parents, were both from prominent Philadelphia families.\nHis father was Brigadier General Nicholas Biddle (1893–1977), whose great-grandfather was Nicholas Biddle, President of the Second Bank of the United States.\nHis mother was Sarah Lippincott Biddle (1894–1962), whose paternal grandfather Joshua Ballinger Lippincott  (1813–1886) founded J. B. Lippincott Company, and maternal grandfather Joseph Wharton (1826–1909) founded the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  His colorful family included cousins Livingston L. Biddle, Jr. and Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.\nBiddle's father served a lifelong term with the National Guard, was active in both World Wars, and was a well-noted, big-game hunter.  He was commissioned to travel the world and bring back specimens; some of his ‘trophies’ still reside at Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences. During Nicholas’ travels, he would film the hunts, then return home and allow young John to experiment with his movie camera and all his unexposed film.John tinkered further with the camera at his family's summer home in Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he also mastered the idiosyncrasies of ocean sailing. Focusing on his brothers, sisters and twelve cousins as subjects on and around Narragansett Bay, he refined his choice of angles, composition, containment of action within the frame and editing.\n\nSchool and military years\nBiddle, and his many cousins, attended Meadowbrook School, then went on to Kent School in Connecticut.  He turned 18 in 1943 and served in the infantry during World War II.  A bad tooth sent him to the back of the lines during fighting in Belgium. There it was noticed that he could play piano and work a movie projector, so he was assigned to entertain the troops.  Shortly thereafter, he discovered two thirds of his platoon had been killed in a firefight.  His entertaining skills likely had spared his life. They also led to an unlikely occurrence: brother Nicholas Jr., who was fighting in the same region, learned that John was working at the back of the lines and flabbergasted him with a visit.  After the war, John attended Trinity College, then returned overseas to Germany with the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Korean War.\n\nYachting cinematographer\nIn the 1950s, Biddle spent several years working as an engineer while snapping wedding and baby photos on the side.  His father would have liked him to enter the family insurance business, Biddle, Bishop and Smith (now named Biddle & Company), but John saw a different path.  After watching a John Jay skiing film, he imagined himself doing the same thing with sailing.  The following June he embarked on the 1956 Bermuda Race aboard cousin Charles Wharton's 51-foot cutter, Souvenir with his film camera along.  He combined that footage with three other pieces he shot that summer, and booked himself into yacht clubs for his first lecture-show.For over four decades, Biddle shot films of dinghy races, Tall Ships events and everything in between. Over seventy types of boats were shown in his documentary-style presentations. 16 mm Bell and Howell in hand, he filmed 130 feet off the deck of square-riggers and fifteen feet underwater.  He filmed from Greenland down to the Islands, from Greece to New Zealand.  He shot ocean races like the Fastnet Race, classic sailing regattas like the Friendship Sloop Regatta, cruises, celebrations, native fishboat races, small boat races.  To capture viewable images on the rolling, bouncy seas, he used (and later marketed) what he called the Biddlestick – a monopod-like stick which he attached to his movie cameras, allowing him to hold onto deck stays while keeping the camera steady.\nIn addition to his annual show, Biddle made promotional films for boat manufacturers and sailboat classes, filmed a five-episode TV series for Mercury Marine called \"Let’s Go Boating\" narrated by Lloyd Bridges, and occasionally filmed for private clients.\n\nLecturer\nEach year, Biddle would film three to four events in the summer months, edit the mile of film into a 90-minute presentation in the fall, write a script for same, have music pulled for the film and edit the music to fit.  In winter, he would begin a five-month tour of the United States, Canada, Bermuda, the Caribbean (and occasionally Europe and Australia) where he would present his films in person as many as 100 times, primarily at yacht clubs.  For many of Biddle's audience, his show presented the only opportunity to see the highlights of the past year's sailing events.  One of the great attractions was his ability to catch the amusing and exhilarating aspects of sailing, not only on film, but in his quick-witted, dry-humored delivery peppered with terms like \"callapso flapitis\", referring to frantic moments on the boat.  Biddle was his own production company, performing the tasks of: contact agent, scheduler, publicist, copywriter, photo developer, poster designer, accountant, cinematographer, film editor, scriptwriter, music editor, driver, porter, set-up man and performer.\n\nFamily life\nBiddle married Mary McMichael in 1961 in Jamestown, Rhode Island and they had two children, Sophie in 1964 and Scott in 1966.  Mary assisted John in filming the early America's Cup races.  She had a stroke shortly after the birth of Scott and died five years later.  Following this, Biddle managed to spend time at home with his children while continuing his career on the road and was able to include Sophie and Scott on trips to Bermuda, a cruise to Maine and trips to various lecture dates.  In March 1977, he married Amy McKay van Roden in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania with three stepchildren: Winifred, Peter and Julie.\n\nCareer highlights\nBiddle filmed two races multiple times.  The Bermuda Race he sailed 11 times to capture the stories that this pre-eminent, East Coast distance race delivered.  Despite the race's long history and prestige, Biddle is the only film-maker to have focused on it.  He also filmed the international yacht racing event, the America's Cup, all ten times when 12-metre class boats were used, from 1958 to 1987.  For this, he took footage of the Sparkman & Stephens test tanks, of the spring practices, the summer trials, the Newport, Rhode Island balls, the dock happenings and the September finals. He was invited to shoot on board the 12-metre yachts by mercurial skippers  including Ted Turner, Dennis Conner, Ted Hood and Bus Mosbacher.  The rare invitations were granted because of his nautical proficiency and ability to get key shots while staying clear of onboard action.\n\nFinal years\nAfter moving to Jamestown in 1980, Biddle became active with the Jamestown Community Chorus and directed the town talent show for several years.During his career, Biddle created 140 sailing films which he placed into 41 annual lecture shows from 1956 to 1996.  He made over 3,000 presentations to audiences as large as 3,000 people.  In the summer of 2008, Biddle was nominated for induction into the America's Cup Hall of Fame at the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Bristol, Rhode Island. He fell ill with cancer soon thereafter and died on October 1, 2008, at the age of 83 in Middletown, Rhode Island.  The formal induction ceremony was held in April 2009.  Gary Jobson said of Biddle's film-making achievement, “His film archive is one of the most comprehensive and important yachting libraries in existence”.  Biddle was also inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2018.\nPassage 5:\nJohn Biddle (Unitarian)\nJohn Biddle or Bidle (14 January 1615 – 22 September 1662) was an influential English nontrinitarian, and Unitarian. He is often called \"the Father of English Unitarianism\".\n\nLife\nBiddle was born at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. He studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, taking an M. A. in 1641. At the age of 26, he became headmaster of the Crypt Grammar School, Gloucester. The school had links to Gloucester Cathedral, and since he was obliged to teach his pupils according to the Catechism of the Church of England, he immersed himself in the study of the Bible. He concluded from his studies that the doctrine of the Trinity was not supported by the Bible, and set about publishing his own views on the nature of God.He was imprisoned in Gloucester in 1645 for his views, but released on bail. He was imprisoned again by Parliament in 1646 and, in 1647, while he was still a prisoner, his tract Twelve Arguments Drawn Out of Scripture was published. Henry Vane defended Biddle in the House of Commons, and he was released on bail in 1648. After a short while he was again imprisoned, in Newgate, where he remained until amnestied by the 1662 Act of Oblivion. Biddle and the MP John Fry, who had tried to aid him, were supported by the 1649 Leveller pamphlet Englands New Chaines Discovered. Biddle was strongly attacked by John Owen, in his massive work Vindiciae Evangelicae; or, The Mystery of the Gospel Vindicated and Socinianism Examined.\nHe was again in trouble with the Parliament of 1654–55, which ordered his book A Two-fold Catechism seized. Motions were made against Biddle as a part of the Commons’ debate on the Instrument of Government's provisions for religious liberty. They marked the moment when the house's attempts to suppress sectarian radicalism faltered. Parliament was dissolved in January 1655, which ended the proceedings against Biddle, and he was released in May of that year. Biddle found himself in trouble only weeks later when the City Presbyterians decided to prosecute him using the Blasphemy Ordinance of 1648. This scared the sects (especially the Baptists) who, seeing a worrying precedent that could lead to them also being prosecuted, then rallied to his side. Oliver Cromwell exiled him to the Scilly Isles, out of the jurisdiction of any hostile English Parliaments. By exiling Biddle, Cromwell avoided a test case that could have put significant numbers of the sects at risk of prosecution. He was released in 1658. He was imprisoned once more, and became ill, leading to his death. His body was \"conveyed to the burial place joyning to Old Bedlam in Moorfields near London, was there deposited by the Brethren, who soon after took care that an altar monument of stone should be erected over his grave with an inscription thereon.\"A biography of Biddle by Joshua Toulmin was published in 1789.\n\nWorks\nA Two-fold CatechismHe is believed to have translated the Polish Racovian Catechism into English.\n\nViews\nHe denounced original sin, denied eternal punishment, and translated a mortalist tract. He condemned the Ranters. He affirmed that the Bible was the Word of God and his Christology appears to be Socinian, denying the pre-existence of Christ but accepting the virgin birth. Biddle's denial of the pre-existence of Christ was the main target of works including Puritan theologian John Owen's A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity (1669).\n\nLegacy\nBiddle's appeal for conscience was one of the major milestones of the establishment of religious freedom in England. More recently Biddle's combination of Socinian Christology and millennialism has led to a rediscovery of his work among Christadelphians and other non-Trinitarian groups in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nExplanatory notes\nPassage 6:\nCharles J. Biddle (aviator)\nMajor Charles John Biddle (13 May 1890 – 22 March 1972) was an American aviator, attorney, and author. He was a flying ace during World War I. Postwar, he launched a career in law and wrote his memoirs.\n\nFamily and early life\nCharles John Biddle was born on 13 May 1890 at Andalusia, the Biddle family estate near Philadelphia.\nHis father was Charles Biddle (1857–1923) and mother was Letitia Glenn. His grandfather Charles John Biddle (1819–1873) was a soldier in the Union Army and subsequently a member of the United States House of Representatives. Andalusia was the estate of his great-grandfather, banker Nicholas Biddle (1786–1844).  He was an hereditary member of the Aztec Club of 1847.\nHe graduated from Princeton University in 1911, and from Harvard Law School three years later. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, but interrupted his nascent career to serve in World War I.\n\nWorld War I service\nBiddle joined the  Lafayette Flying Corps in France on 8 April 1917. He was assigned to Escadrille 73 as a private on 28 July 1917, under the command and mentorship of Albert Deullin.  He was promoted to corporal on 2 June and to sergeant on 1 December.  Biddle initially fought several indecisive combats with a Spad VII, but success evaded him until 5 December 1917. Flying a SPAD XIII, he downed the Albatros two-seater of Leutnants Fritz Pauly and Ernst Sauter of FFA 45 despite a malfunction by both his Spad's machine guns.\nBiddle transferred to the American 103rd Aero Squadron on 10 January 1918 and was commissioned as a captain in the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps on 12 January 1918.  He then reverted to the Spad VII for his 12 April win over a Halberstadt CL.II over Corbeny. He moved on to the 13th Aero Squadron (nicknamed \"The Devil's Own Grim Reapers\").\nOn 1 August, he shared his first two victories with William Howard Stovall, John Seerly, and H. B. Freeman. He shot down three more enemy planes afterwards-his 5th official credit was a Rumpler CIV of Fliegerabteilung 46LB {pilot Eichler {POW} observer Gröschel {DOW} August 16, 1918.  He was at one point entrusted with the only SPAD XII issued to Americans.  He was promoted to the rank of major on 1 November  and was given command of the 4th Pursuit Group.  He returned to the United States on 19 December and was discharged from the Army on 25 January.In recognition of his service, the French awarded him both the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre, and he received the American Distinguished Service Cross and the Belgian Order of Leopold II.After the war, Biddle wrote a book entitled The Way of the Eagle.\n\nLegal career\nBiddle initially practiced law in the Drexel Building with his father's firm. Following his father's death, he joined the law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath (not using that name at the time) in 1924. He was the firm's first lateral partner and brought clients that  included the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (founded by Benjamin Franklin) and the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. Biddle became a partner in 1925 and was a major force at the firm for decades. In the 1950s, he led the defense of Merck Sharp & Dohme in a major case concerning price-fixing. At a trial in Trenton, New Jersey, he argued successfully for Merck's acquittal with Thomas E. Dewey who represented Eli Lilly.Biddle also sued the U. S. government on behalf of three widows who lost their husbands in a B-29 Superfortress crash in 1948. This case was the first in which the government claimed national security privileges for its documents, as the B-29 was carrying out experiments with radar control of airborne drones. The case was settled without the government production of documents. In 2003, partner Wilson M. Brown III used the Charles Biddle case to establish a precedent to reopen a case on behalf of the survivors of the scientists killed in a 1948 B-29 crash. The US government still claimed national security for its defense. The U. S. Supreme Court examined its own prior decision of the case; the government claim was exposed as a fraudulent one used to cover up neglect in maintenance and poor air crew training as the cause of the accident.He died in 1972.\n\nHonors and awards\nDistinguished Service Cross (DSC) citation\nThe Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Charles John Biddle, Captain (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action in the region of Damvillers, France, September 26, 1918. During an engagement between 11 Spads and 12 enemy Fokkers, Captain Biddle, perceiving a comrade in distress from the attack of two planes, dived upon them and by his fire forced them to withdraw. His prompt action saved the life of his comrade, who was in imminent danger of being shot to the ground. (General Orders No. 60, W.D., 1920)\nOrdre de Léopold citation\nFor extraordinary heroism in action on 12 April 1918 near Corbeny, France, and on 15 May 1918, near Ypres, Belgium. Captain Biddle has daily shown himself an excellent and remarkable example of courage, energy and skill, leading his pilots to the attack at every opportunity and making his flight a most efficient one. On 12 April, he attacked and destroyed an enemy two-seater which crashed between the trenches at Corbeny. On 15 May, while leading his patrol, he attacked, at very low altitude and far within the enemy lines, an enemy two-seater, killing the observer and forcing him down. A few minutes later he engaged a second enemy plane at very close range. Wounded in his leg, his plane and motor riddled, Captain Biddle was forced to land in 'No Man's Land' less than 70 yards from the German trenches in the region of Ypres. With remarkable courage and presence of mind and despite his wound, he detached himself from his smashed machine and made his way from shell hole under intense artillery, machine gun and rifle fire, to an advanced British Observation post.French Croix de Guerre citation, 4 June 1918\nPilot of marvelous spirit. Attacked two enemy two-seaters successfully behind their lines, probably shooting down the first. Wounded and disabled in the course of the second combat, by sheer strength he succeeded in landing in no man's land and after passing the day in a shell hole, by night he got back to the Allied trenches.\n\nSee also\nList of World War I flying aces from the United States\n103rd Aero Squadron\nPassage 7:\nCharles John Biddle\nCharles John Biddle (April 30, 1819 – September 28, 1873) was an American soldier, lawyer, congressman, and newspaper editor.\n\nBiography\nBiddle was born and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Nicholas Biddle, president of the Second Bank of the United States, and nephew of Congressman Richard Biddle. Charles Biddle graduated from Princeton in 1837, where he studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1840.\n\nBiddle served in the Mexican–American War, serving as captain and company commander in the Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen. He was brevetted to the rank of major for gallantry in the Battle of Chapultepec. At the close of the war, he returned to Philadelphia to practice law.In May 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms, he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania Reserves, rising in May to the rank of colonel in command of the 42nd Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry (13th Reserves), also known as the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles. In October of that year he was elected to the Thirty-seventh United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward J. Morris. He was tendered a commission as a brigadier general, but declined it, and then resigned from the army in February 1862.After the war, he became one of the proprietors and editor-in-chief of the Philadelphia Age, and retained that position for the remainder of his life. His literary work was confined mainly to editorial contributions to the columns of this journal. His only separate publication was The Case of Major André, a carefully prepared essay read before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which vindicated the action of George Washington. The immediate occasion was a passage in Lord Mahon's History of England that denounced the execution of André as the greatest blot upon Washington's record. By an authority so high as the London Critic, this essay was subsequently pronounced a fair refutation of Lord Mahon's charge.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nBiddle family\nThe Biddle family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is an Old Philadelphian family descended from English immigrants William Biddle (1630–1712) and Sarah Kempe (1634–1709), who arrived in the Province of New Jersey in 1681. Quakers, they had emigrated from England in part to escape religious persecution. Having acquired extensive rights to more than 43,000 acres (170 km2) of lands in West Jersey, they settled first at Burlington, a city which developed along the east side of the Delaware River.William Biddle, 3rd (1698–1756), and John Biddle (1707–1789), two third-generation brothers, moved from Mount Hope (1684) near Bordentown, also on the east side of the Delaware, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the 1720s and 1730s. They constituted the first generation of the Philadelphia Biddle family, which became involved in the business, political and cultural life of Pennsylvania and the United States.\n\nFamily members\nBranch of William Biddle, 3rd (1698–1756) and Mary Scull (1709–1789)\nBranch of John Biddle (1707–1789) and Sarah Owen (1711–1773)\nSee also\nBiddle House (Mackinac Island)\nList of United States political families\nPassage 9:\nSocinian controversy\nThe Socinian controversy in the Church of England (sometimes called the First Socinian controversy to distinguish it from a debate around 1800 mainly affecting Protestant nonconformists; and also called the Trinitarian controversy) was a theological argument on christology carried out by English theologians for around a decade from 1687. Positions that had remained largely dormant since the death in 1662 of John Biddle, an early Unitarian, were revived and discussed, in pamphlet literature (much of it anonymous).\nThis controversy was part of a larger debate after the Act of Toleration 1689, which excluded anti-trinitarian beliefs. By the end of the 1690s it had become clear that, for the time being, religious tolerance would not be extended.  Formally, the Blasphemy Act 1697, directed against Unitarians, with religious disabilities against non-trinitarian believers, continued in law and settled the matter until the early nineteenth century. On the other hand, the arguments had become well aired, and the Church of England was shown to be hardly united on the theology. An unintended consequence of strong attacks by theologically orthodox Anglicans, in the longer term, was a resulting greater de facto tolerance extending among English Protestants, after a halt was called to the aggressive stance in particular of William Sherlock. This tolerance, becoming a hallmark of Latitudinarian views as they changed into low church attitudes, worked its way out in controversies of the eighteenth century.\n\nDetailed history\nThe Socinian argument, of which little had been heard for 25 years, was revived in 1687 by the publication of a ‘Brief History’ of the unitarians, as they from now on often designated themselves (see Stephen Nye). There followed (1689) a sheet of ‘Brief Notes’ on the Athanasian creed (see Thomas Firmin).These two publications prompted William Sherlock's Vindication (1690) of the doctrine of the Trinity. Shortly afterwards (11 August 1690) the subject was also taken up by John Wallis. The Socinians and others accused Sherlock's ‘Vindication’ of tritheism; and reputedly this work had the effect of making a Socinian of William Manning and an Arian of Thomas Emlyn. Sherlock's position was attacked also by another Anglican, Robert South, with a mixture of irony and invective.Sherlock's doctrine, as preached at Oxford by Joseph Bingham, was condemned by the hebdomadal council (25 November 1695), as ‘falsa, impia et hæretica’ (false, impious and heretical). Sherlock defended himself in an ‘Examination’ (1696) of the decree.On 3 February 1696 William III addressed to the hierarchy ‘Directions,’ drawn up by Thomas Tenison, prohibiting the use of ‘all new terms’ relating to the Trinity. In his ‘Present State of the Socinian Controversy’ (1698, but most of it printed 1696) Sherlock in practical terms gave up on the positions that had been impugned.Literature related to the argument was still voluminous, however, in the period up to 1704. One notable reader and student of the debate was John Locke.\n\nTimeline of publications\nPassage 10:\nHarry Sweet\nHarry Sweet (October 2, 1901 – June 18, 1933) was an American actor, director and screenwriter. He appeared in 57 films between 1919 and 1932.  He also directed 54 films between 1920 and 1933, including one Harry Langdon short, two of the Tay Garnett- penned comedies Stan Laurel made for Joe Rock, and fifteen of the earliest entries in the Edgar Kennedy \"Average Man\" series.\nSweet was an acrobat before he became an actor, which led to his doing his own stunts in films.\n\nDeath\nOn June 18, 1933, Sweet was location scouting by private plane in the vicinity of Big Bear Valley. That night, at 7:15 pm, a plane crashed and sank to the bottom of Big Bear Lake, with the authorities initially uncertain as to the identity of the pilot as well as the number and identity of the plane's passengers; on June 19, Bert Gilroy, a film associate of Sweet's, left Los Angeles for Big Bear after efforts to contact the director in that city failed. Hours after the accident, when the plane was pulled from 28 feet of water, the bodies of Sweet, actress Claudette Ford, and scenario writer Howard (Hal) Davitt, were found in the cockpit; the coroner's investigation determined Sweet had drowned and that his companions had both died from fractured skulls suffered in the crash.\n\nSelected acting filmography\nCarnival Boat (1932)\nHer Man (1930)\nHit the Deck (1930)\nHomesick (1928)\nFascinating Youth (1926)\nSmart Alec (1921)\n\nSelected directing filmography\nShe Outdone Him (1933)   July 21, 1933        Script: Hugh Cummings, Harry Sweet\nGood Housewrecking (1933)    June 16, 1933        Script: Harry Sweet\nA Merchant of Menace (1933)   April 21, 1933        Script: Leslie Goodwins, Walter Weems\nArt in the Raw (1933)    February 24, 1933        Script: Ben Holmes, Harry Sweet  ...\nFish Feathers (1932)     December 16, 1932        Script: Hugh Cummings, Harry Sweet\nSham Poo, the Magician (1932)     November 25, 1932        Script: Hugh Cummings, Harry Sweet\nParlor, Bedroom and Wrath (1932)   October 14, 1932        Script: Hugh Cummings, Harry Sweet\nThe Golf Chump (1932)     August 5, 1932        Script: Hugh Cummings, Harry Sweet\nHigh Hats and Low Brows (1932)     July 11, 1932        Script: Arthur 'Bugs' Baer, Ralph Ceder \nGiggle Water (1932)     June 27, 1932        Script: Harry Sweet\nStealin' Home (1932)    May 9, 1932        Script: Arthur 'Bugs' Baer, Ralph Ceder\nRule 'Em and Weep (1932)   May 2, 1932        Script: Edward Earle, Walter Weems\nMother-in-Law's Day (1932)    April 25, 1932        Script: Harry Sweet\nExtra!

It was the first overall meeting between the two schools.\n\nSan Jose State Spartans\nBecause the Spartans finished 5–7 in their regular season, they would ordinarily be bowl-ineligible.  However, only 77 teams finished at .500 or better on the season, leaving three bowl slots open to 5–7 teams based on their Academic Progress Rate (APR).  The Spartans ranked fourth among such teams, after Nebraska and Missouri and together with Minnesota. However, since Missouri did not accept a bowl bid, the Spartans were invited to the Cure Bowl, which they accepted.This was the Spartans' tenth bowl game (with a 6–3 all-time record in bowl games) and their first since the 2012 Military Bowl, where they defeated Bowling Green by a score of 29–20.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers\nAfter finishing 6–6 in their regular season, bowl director Alan Gooch extended an invitation for the Panthers to play in the game, which they accepted.This was the first bowl game in school history for Georgia State, seven years after football was approved, five years after they kicked off, and two years after joining the Football Bowl Subdivision.

It opened in 1936 as Orlando Stadium and has also been known as the Tangerine Bowl and Florida Citrus Bowl.  The City of Orlando owns and operates the stadium.Camping World Stadium is the current home venue of the Citrus Bowl and the Pop-Tarts Bowl. It is also the regular host of other college football games including the Florida Classic between Florida A&M and Bethune-Cookman, the MEAC/SWAC Challenge, and the Camping World Kickoff. The stadium was built for football and in the past, it has served as home of several alternate-league football teams and currently serves as the home of the Orlando Guardians of the XFL. From 2011 to 2013, it was the home of the Orlando City SC, a soccer team in USL Pro. From 1979 to 2006, it served as the home of the UCF Knights football team. It was one of the nine venues used for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The stadium has also hosted the NFL's Pro Bowl four times.\n\nStadium history\nConstruction on the stadium began in 1936 as a project of the Works Progress Administration under President  Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The stadium was built to the immediate east of the baseball park Tinker Field, which opened in 1914. The stadium opened later in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 as Orlando Stadium. The first college football bowl game was played on January 1, 1947. Catawba defeated Maryville 31–6 in the inaugural Tangerine Bowl. 2,000 seats were added in 1952. During this period, the stadium was known as the Tangerine Bowl. 5,000 more seats were added in 1968, along with the first press box.\nFrom 1974 to 1976 an expansion project raised the capacity to 50,612, including a 3,600-seat upper deck on the east sidelines. However, shortly after completion the project proved to be a public fiasco and potentially an architectural and engineering failure. On November 27, 1976, the first major game was held at the expanded stadium, a regular season matchup between Florida and Miami. During the game, the newly-constructed upper deck noticeably swayed whenever fans stood up and cheered. The deck vibrated, fences and railings shook and creaked, causing an unnerving sensation for the patrons sitting in those sections. The swaying and shaking was noticeable again about a month later during the 1976 Tangerine Bowl game. The swaying was so pronounced that some fans vowed never to sit in those seats again, while some refused to return to the stadium at all. Before long, engineering evaluations, as well as legal investigations, uncovered numerous missteps, rushing, and cut corners in the stadium's design. While it was believed that the upper deck was structurally sound and met building codes, it nevertheless was deemed a failure. Additional problems included inadequate access to restrooms in the upper deck, gaps between the sections which required obstructive fences, and the fact that the upper deck was built at such an angle that it had poor sight lines. Meanwhile, unsightly I-beams installed to hold up the upper deck now blocked seats in the lower deck that were previously unobstructed.The maligned stadium's reputation was heavily tarnished after the upper deck scandal, criticized by public officials, media, and fans. Further complicating the situation was UCF's pending move to the stadium for 1979. The city finally received a settlement of $900,500 from the stadium's engineers, architects, and designers, money that was soon appropriated for new improvements. The infamous steel east upper deck was dismantled in May 1980.After various new improvements, and a $30 million renovation that added new concrete upper decks to both sides, a capacity of 65,438 was established in 1989. In 1983, the Florida Department of Citrus was added as a title sponsor for the facility, at a price of $250,000. From 1999 to 2002, key stadium improvements included the addition of contour seating, two escalators, and a new 107-foot (33 m) wide scoreboard/video screen. A new sound system, along with two full-color ribbon displays along the upper decks, were also added. The expansion resulted in the upper deck overhanging Tinker Field's right field area, albeit at a significant height.\n\nEvents hosted\nFootball\nProfessional football\nCamping World Stadium has been home field to several short-lived professional football teams. From 1966 to 1970, the stadium was home to the Orlando Panthers of the Continental Football League. In 1974, the Florida Blazers of the World Football League played their only season in existence at the Tangerine Bowl. The USFL's Orlando Renegades played one season in 1985. The Orlando Thunder of the WLAF called the Citrus Bowl home in their two-season existence during the early 1990s, while the XFL's Orlando Rage played there in 2001 as well as the UFL's Florida Tuskers, occupying the stadium for 2 seasons from 2009, before moving to Virginia Beach as the Virginia Destroyers in 2011. The Orlando Fantasy of the Lingerie Football League moved to the stadium shortly after, having previously used the UCF Arena.\nIn 2022, it was announced that Orlando had been chosen to be the home of one of the third  incarnation of the XFL’s eight teams and that the team would play its home games at Camping World Stadium. The Orlando Guardians are set to start playing in the 2023 XFL season.\nThe stadium hosted the National Football League's all-star game, the Pro Bowl, from 2017 through 2020. Seven NFL preseason games have been held at the stadium..\n\nCollege football\nThe stadium has hosted various college football games, including many bowl games:\n\nSince 1947 (except for 1973), the stadium has hosted a bowl game, currently known as the Citrus Bowl, typically played on January 1 or January 2. The bowl has also been known by different names, and has also been held during December, at various times during its history.\nThe December 1958 edition of the game, then known as the Tangerine Bowl, was notable for the segregation policy of the stadium operators, the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), leading to the University at Buffalo declining their bowl bid, as their two black players would not have been allowed to play.\nSince 1997, the stadium has been home to the Florida Classic, an annual game between Bethune–Cookman University and Florida A&M University.\nSince 2001, the stadium has hosted a December bowl game, which has undergone several name changes due to sponsorship changes—since May 2023, it is known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.\nIn 2010 and 2011, the stadium hosted the East–West Shrine Game, which then moved to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nThe stadium hosted the Cure Bowl, a December bowl game, from 2015 through 2018 and again in 2020.\nThe stadium hosted the 1979 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game, 2005 C-USA Championship Game, and 2016 ACC Championship Game.\nRollins College of Winter Park, Florida, was the first college to use the then-named Orlando Stadium as its home field. It played there prior to and after World War II.\n\nHigh school football\nThe Florida High School Athletic Association state football championships are held at Camping World Stadium.\nThe varsity football team from nearby Jones High School used Camping World Stadium as a regular season home field for decades through the end of their 2011 season. The school started playing home football games on their own field beginning on August 31, 2012.\n\nSoccer\nThe playing surface is large enough for use in international soccer matches, and it was a venue for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In five matches, attendance averaged over 60,000 per match. In 1996, Olympic soccer matches in both the men's and women's competitions were held at the stadium.\nIt hosted the USISL A-League Orlando Sundogs in 1997. It also hosted the Major League Soccer All-Star Game in 1998. The stadium was the home of Orlando City SC, a soccer team in the USL Pro League. In 2013, the investment group that owned that club was awarded an expansion team in Major League Soccer. They spent their 2014 season in USL Pro at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista while Camping World Stadium was being renovated.\nDuring the 2013 season, Fifth Third Bank owned naming rights to the field for Orlando City matches. Its name during those matches was Fifth Third Bank Field at the Citrus Bowl.\nOrlando City played their final USL Pro match at Camping World Stadium on September 6, 2013. They won the USL Pro Championship over Charlotte Eagles, 7–4, before a crowd of 20,886. The last soccer event held at Camping World Stadium before its renovation was an international friendly between the women's teams of the United States and Brazil. The U.S. won the match, 4–1, before a crowd of 20,274.Orlando City, now playing in Major League Soccer, returned to Camping World Stadium for the 2015 and 2016 seasons.\nThe Orlando Pride, the National Women's Soccer League 2016 expansion team owned by Orlando City SC, played in Camping World Stadium while the Orlando City (now Exploria) Stadium was completed.\nCamping World Stadium was one of the venues for Copa América Centenario in June 2016. Three group stage matches were held there, Paraguay vs Costa Rica on June 4, Bolivia vs Panama on June 6 and Brazil vs Haiti on June 8.\nThe stadium hosted the Mexico national football team vs. Guatemala \"MexTour\" on April 27, 2022.\nThe 2022 Florida Cup exhibition soccer match between Arsenal and Chelsea, 4–0, had an attendance of 63,811, a record crowd for a soccer match at the stadium.\n\n1994 FIFA World Cup matches\nClub Friendlies\nWrestleMania\nOn March 30, 2008, the stadium hosted WrestleMania XXIV, the 2008 edition of WWE's flagship professional wrestling pay-per-view. The first WrestleMania held in Florida, and the second to be held entirely outdoors since WrestleMania IX at Caesars Palace, it had a reported attendance of 74,635—the largest crowd in stadium history. It was estimated to have brought in $51.5 million in revenue to the local economy.WWE returned to Camping World Stadium to host WrestleMania 33, which took place on April 2, 2017. WWE claimed an attendance record of 75,245, exceeding the total of WrestleMania XXIV.\n\nOther events\nThe Citrus Bowl was the site of two Billy Graham Crusades, the most recent of which took place in 1983.\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympics, it hosted some of the football (soccer) preliminaries.\nDrum Corps International has held its annual World Championships at the stadium four times in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2003\nThe Feld Entertainment-promoted Monster Jam shows held there every year featured a track similar to the one at Sam Boyd Stadium in 2008 and 2009.

Lack of an agreement to rectify these issues led UCF to consider relocating, or spend considerable expense to upgrade the facility at its own cost. In addition, the stadium's capacity was seen as too large for UCF, leaving the stadium an appearance of being empty even with attendance of as much as 30,000–40,000 people per game. UCF's all-time attendance record was 51,978 for the 2005 C-USA Championship Game versus Tulsa. Furthermore, the stadium was located over 10 miles (16 km) from the university's main campus in East Orlando, with travel times of up to a half-hour due to traffic. In 2005, UCF officials led by university president John Hitt made the decision to construct a new on-campus stadium, which opened for the 2007 season.\nOrlando officials began exploring stadium refurbishment project in 2004, when the Capital One Bowl bid to become a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game, but was not chosen due to the stadium's aging condition. Camping World Stadium also submitted a bid for the ACC Championship Game, but lost to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The key reasons for losing the bids were the lack of modern luxury boxes, bench seating, and capacity. The hopes for Camping World Stadium became reality when, on September 29, 2006, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer announced an agreement on a $175-million renovation of Camping World Stadium. It is part of the \"Triple Crown for Downtown\", a $1.1-billion plan to redo the Orlando Centroplex with a new $480-million arena for the Orlando Magic, a new $375-million performing arts center, and the Camping World Stadium improvements. Conceptual drawings for the possible improvements include enclosed concourses on the east and west sides of the stadium and additions to the north side that will finally complete the lower bowl. The Orlando/Orange County Interlocal Agreement was approved by the Orlando City Council on August 6, 2007. However, the plans were heavily affected by the Great Recession of 2007–08.\n\nIn 2010, the natural grass surface was replaced with AstroTurf Gameday Grass 3D after the 2009 Champs Sports Bowl and 2010 Capital One Bowl were marred by poor field conditions that led to two football player injuries. Stadium conditions once again prompted a review of the stadiums condition. Finally, it was announced in May 2013 that the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium would undergo a reconstruction during 2014, at a cost of less than US$200 million. The cost estimate as of March 2014 was US$207 million. The stadium's upper level seating was retained, but the entire lower bowl structure was demolished.\nIn the newly reconstructed stadium there are two 360-degree concourses, a 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) plaza deck (\"Party Deck\") in the north end zone, 41,000 all-new lower bowl seats with six additional inches of leg room & chairbacks, multiple giant video displays, new team facilities including locker rooms training rooms and attached media, new stadium operations facilities to allow better efficiency in food service, security, first aid and maintenance, new concessions and restrooms, and an open-air façade. The new mezzanine is now referred to as the \"Plaza level\". The upper deck, previously numbered the \"300\" level, is now numbered the \"200\" level.\nThe reconstruction began immediately following a groundbreaking event held at the stadium on January 29, 2014, and demolition of the entire lower bowl lasted 25 days. The first event at the renovated Camping World Stadium was the 2014 edition of the Florida Classic on November 22, 2014. The Bethune-Cookman Wildcats defeated the Florida A&M Rattlers, 18–17 in overtime.Orlando City returned to the renovated Camping World Stadium for the 2015 season, their first season in Major League Soccer, while awaiting construction of their own soccer-specific stadium. In their first match, a 1–1 draw against fellow expansion team New York City FC on March 8, 2015, they drew a sellout crowd of 62,510, the largest attendance for a soccer match at the venue.The United States women's national soccer team returned to Camping World Stadium on October 25, 2015. They defeated Brazil again, 3–1. The attendance of 32,869 was the largest attendance for a standalone USWNT friendly in the state of Florida.The Orlando Pride, the expansion National Women's Soccer League team owned by Orlando City SC, played in Camping World Stadium until the Orlando City Stadium was complete. On April 23, 2016, they broke the record for attendance at an NWSL game, setting at 23,403, when the Pride beat the Houston Dash, 3–1.On November 19, 2015, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL announced that Camping World Stadium would be one of the host venues for the Copa América Centenario soccer tournament in 2016.On April 26, 2016, Florida Citrus Sports announced that they had sold naming rights for the stadium to Camping World. Camping World also became the title sponsor of the stadium's college football kickoff game through at least 2019, and the annual December bowl game held at the stadium was known as the Camping World Bowl from 2017 through 2019. These naming changes did not affect the Citrus Bowl or the Florida Classic.In 2021, Camping World Stadium renovations included modernizing and improving the north endzone seating bowl, concession areas, club-level seating, and new premium mezzanine clubs on east and west. The project was completed on a fast-track schedule of less than 12 months by Construction Manager Barton Malow. During the work, the City of Orlando and Florida Citrus Sports hosted several events at the stadium. All were held without incident due to specialized safety techniques that separated construction activities, visitors, and staff.\n\nSeating and attendance\nPrior to the 2014 renovation, the stadium had 65,000 permanent seats. The lower bowl lacked permanent seats in the north end zone, though temporary bleachers could be erected there if necessary. The temporary bleachers were last used for the 2005 Capital One Bowl, which had an attendance of 70,229.\nFollowing the renovation, the seating capacity was reduced to 60,219 due to the introduction of chair-back seats in the lower bowl and Plaza Level. The upper deck continues to have bench seats. Temporary bleachers can be added in the Plaza level in place of the Party Deck to increase the capacity to 65,194.\n\nIn popular culture\nCamping World Stadium (then still known as the Citrus Bowl) was a filming location for the 1998 Adam Sandler movie The Waterboy. In the film, the Citrus Bowl depicted both the home stadium of the fictional University of Louisiana Cougars as well as the venue of the climactic Bourbon Bowl game.\nExterior shots of the then-Citrus Bowl were used in the television series Coach, starring Craig T. Nelson as Coach Hayden Fox. In the show, the Citrus Bowl was the home stadium of the fictional Orlando Breakers franchise, which Coach Fox led during the series' final two seasons (1995–1997). The change, which coincided with a production move to Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios), reflected the real-life expansion team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nSee also\nList of association football stadiums by capacity\nPassage 9:\n2016 Citrus Bowl (January)\nThe 2016 Citrus Bowl was an American college football bowl game played on January 1, 2016 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The 70th edition was one of the 2015–16 NCAA football bowl games that concluded the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The game was televised by ABC.

This was their 42nd bowl game appearance.\n\nGame summary\nScoring Summary\nStatistics\nPassage 10:\nCitrus Bowl\nThe Citrus Bowl  is an annual college football bowl game played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group that also organizes the Pop-Tarts Bowl and Florida Classic.\nThe game was first played as the Tangerine Bowl in 1947 before being renamed as the Florida Citrus Bowl in 1983. When Capital One was the game's title sponsor between 2001 and 2014, the game was referred to as the  Capital One Bowl from 2003 to 2014. Other previous sponsors include CompUSA (1994–1999), Ourhouse.com (2000), Buffalo Wild Wings (2015–2017), Overton's (2018), and  Vrbo (2019–2022).  On November 15, 2022, Kellogg's signed on as title sponsor of the game, placing its Cheez-It brand of snack crackers in the title position. Accordingly, the game is officially named the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl.Since becoming one of the premier bowls, the Citrus Bowl is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on New Year's Day and broadcast nationally on ABC. When January 1 is a Sunday, the game has been played on January 2 or December 31, to avoid conflicting with the National Football League (NFL) schedule. As of 2019, at $8.55 million per team, it has the largest payout of all bowls other than those that are part of the College Football Playoff (CFP). In nearly every year since 1985, the game has featured two teams ranked in the Top 25.\n\nHistory\nTangerine Bowl (1947–1982)\nThe game, which began play in 1947, is one of the oldest of the non-CFP bowls, along with the Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl. By 1952, the game was dubbed the \"Little Bowl with the Big Heart\", because all the proceeds from the game went to charity.Before 1968, the game featured matchups between schools throughout the South, often featuring the Ohio Valley Conference champion or other small colleges, although a few major colleges did play in the bowl during this early era as well.\nFrom 1964 through 1967, it was one of the four regional finals in the College Division (which became Division II and Division III in 1973), along with the Pecan, Grantland Rice, and Camellia bowls.\nIn 1968, the Boardwalk Bowl in Atlantic City took over as a regional final, and the Tangerine Bowl became a major college bowl game, featuring teams from the University Division (which became Division I in 1973).\nTangerine Bowl naming was used through the December 1982 playing. While that naming was re-used nearly two decades later, that was for three editions of a bowl game with a different lineage.\n\nFlorida Citrus Bowl (1983–2002)\nIn March 1983, the name of the game was changed from Tangerine Bowl to Florida Citrus Bowl, via a $1.25 million agreement with the Florida Citrus Commission; the bowl's organizing committee also changed its name from Tangerine Sports Association to Florida Citrus Sports Association. A month earlier, organizers had rejected a proposal to rename the game to Grapefruit Bowl.In 1986, it was one of the bowl games considered for the site of the \"winner take all\" national championship game between Penn State and Miami, before the Fiesta Bowl was eventually chosen.\nThe 1990 season game had national championship implications; Georgia Tech won the Florida Citrus Bowl, finished 11–0–1, and was voted the 1990 UPI national champion.\nThe 1997 season game, which featured nearby Florida beating Penn State, holds the game's attendance record at 72,940.\n\nCapital One Bowl (2003–2014)\nStarting with the January 2003 edition, the bowl was renamed as the Capital One Bowl, with title sponsorship by Capital One.\nIn 2004, the bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. In July 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build the Amway Center for the Orlando Magic, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl stadium.\nFollowing the January 2014 game, Capital One ceased its sponsorship of the bowl, and moved its sponsorship to the Orange Bowl.\n\nCitrus Bowl (2015–present)\nBuffalo Wild Wings was announced as the new sponsor of the bowl game, which was renamed as Citrus Bowl, for the January 2015 edition. Buffalo Wild Wings had previously been the title sponsor of what had been the Insight Bowl. In the offseason of 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings ceased sponsoring the bowl.\nThe 2016 season game was played on December 31, the first time in 30 years that the game was not played on January 1st or 2nd.\n\nConference tie-ins\nFrom 1968 through 1975, the bowl featured the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion against an opponent from the Southern Conference (1968–1971), the Southeastern Conference (SEC) (1973–1974), or an at-large opponent (1972, 1975). MAC teams were 6–2 during those games.\nAs the major football conferences relaxed restrictions on post-season play in the mid-1970s, the bowl went to a matchup between two at-large teams from major conferences, with one school typically (but not always) from the South.\nFrom the 1987 season through the 1991 season, the bowl featured the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champion against an at-large opponent. ACC teams were 3–2 during those games.\nFrom the 1992 season through the 2015 season, the bowl featured an SEC vs. Big Ten matchup – the SEC won 14 of those games, while the Big Ten won 10.\nDuring the 1990s, the second-place finisher in the SEC typically went to this bowl. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, speaking to the fact that Tennessee occupied that spot three of four years as Florida finished first, famously quipped \"You can't spell 'Citrus' without U-T!\"Currently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the CFP selection process for both conferences. Since the formation of the CFP, the Citrus Bowl has a chance to occasionally host an ACC team, replacing the Big Ten representative. This will happen the years in which the Orange Bowl is not a CFP semi-final game and selects a Big Ten team to match against their ACC team. This happened following the 2016 season, as the Orange Bowl was not a CFP semi-final and invited Michigan of the Big Ten to face Florida State of the ACC; the Citrus Bowl then invited Louisville of the ACC to face LSU of the SEC.  The next year, Wisconsin was invited to the Orange Bowl, so the SEC's LSU was pitted against Notre Dame, who received an invite in lieu of an ACC team.\n\nRacial integration\nThe undefeated 1955 Hillsdale College football team refused an invitation to the game when bowl officials insisted that Hillsdale's four African-American players would not be allowed to play in the game.The University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to the Tangerine Bowl in 1958. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field. Buffalo did not become bowl-eligible for another 50 years. During the 2008 season, when the Bulls were on the verge of bowl eligibility, the 1958 team was profiled on ESPN's Outside the Lines. The 2008 team went on to win the Mid-American Conference title, and played in the International Bowl.\nBy 1966, the OHSAA's rule had been changed, and Morgan State of Baltimore, under head coach Earl Banks, became the first historically black college to play in (and win) the Tangerine Bowl.\n\nGainesville\nIn early 1973, construction improvements were planned for the then 17,000-seat Tangerine Bowl stadium to expand to over 51,000 seats. In early summer 1973, however, construction was stalled due to legal concerns, and the improvements were delayed. Late in the 1973 season, Tangerine Bowl President Will Gieger and other officials planned to invite the Miami Redskins and the East Carolina Pirates to Orlando for the game. On November 19, 1973, East Carolina withdrew its interests, and the bowl was left with one at-large bid. In an unexpected and unprecedented move, game officials decided to invite the Florida Gators, and move the game to Florida Field in Gainesville, the Gators' home stadium. The larger stadium was needed to accommodate the large crowd expected. The move required special permission from the NCAA, and special accommodations were made. Both teams were headquartered in Orlando for the week, and spent most of their time there, including practices, and were bused up to Gainesville.\nThe participants were greeted with an unexpected event, a near-record low temperature of 25 °F (−4 °C). Despite the home-field advantage, in the game nicknamed the \"Transplant Bowl\", Miami, who found the cold much more to its liking, defeated the Gators, 16–7. One of the players on the victorious Redskins squad was future Gators coach Ron Zook.\nThe one-time moving of the game, and the fears of a permanent relocation, rejuvenated the stalled stadium renovations in Orlando. The game returned to Orlando for 1974, and within a couple of years, the expansion project was complete.\n\nMascot Challenge\nThe \"Capital One Mascot Challenge\" (formerly known as the \"Capital One National Mascot of the Year\") was a contest where fans voted for their favorite college mascot. The contest began in 2002 with the winner being named during the halftime; the winning school was awarded $20,000 towards their mascot program. With the ending of Capital One's sponsorship of the Citrus Bowl, the challenge was moved in 2014 to the Orange Bowl with Capital One's sponsorship of that game. The 2014 season was also the last time that the contest was held.\n\nGame results\nRankings are based on the AP Poll prior to the game being played.

revenue generating company in the United States. Headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, the company specializes in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products, serving more than 100,000 locations. The company also manufactures medical and surgical products, including gloves, surgical apparel, and fluid management products. In addition, it operates one of the largest networks of radiopharmacies in the U.S. Cardinal Health provides medical products to over 75 percent of hospitals in the United States.\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began whole selling drugs. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983.In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's. From 1991 to 1996, the company's sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion. The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994, and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.\n\n2000–2019\nR. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board. In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.In 2009, Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion with David Schlotterbeck as CEO. Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.In December 2013, it was announced that Cardinal Health would partner with CVS Caremark to form a generic drug sourcing operation in the United States. The venture was named Red Oak Sourcing and began operations in July 2014.Between 2014 and 2016, Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's \"Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act\". The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.In January 2018, Michael Kaufmann assumed the role of CEO after serving as CFO of the company.\n\nOpioid lawsuits\nIn 2019, Cardinal was one of several drug distributors named in lawsuits related to the opioid crisis in the US. In July 2021, Cardinal Health and other pharmaceutical companies agreed to participate in a $26 billion settlement. Cardinal will pay $6.4 billion over 18 years.In May 2020, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter sued Cardinal Health in Bryan County District Court, Oklahoma. The lawsuit alleged that he company's actions helped fuel Oklahoma's opioid crisis. The suit was filed along with lawsuits against AmerisourceBergen and McKesson, and the three lawsuits allege that the three companies provided \"enough opioids to Bryan County that every adult resident there could have had 144 hydrocodone tablets.\"\n\n2020–present\nAs of August 2021, it is ranked 14 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2020 annual revenue of $152.9 billion. The firm employs 48,000 people worldwide.\n\nAcquisitions\nIn 1995, Medicine Shoppe International, the country's largest franchiser of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.In 1997, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen Brunswig Corp., to which McKesson Corporation responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen. Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). In 2001, the company acquired Bindley Western Industries, a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding, a specialty pharmaceutical services company, for $517 million. In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, an independent pharmaceutical wholesaler, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent. From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal sold Yong Yu in 2017 to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. for $1.2 billion.In July 2014, Cardinal Health and CVS formed Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States. The companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. Cardinal sold the division in August 2021 to Hellman & Friedman, a private equity firm, for $1 billion.In April 2017, Cardinal Health announced the plan to acquire the patient product portfolio from Medtronic for $6.1 billion. The acquisition was completed on July 30, 2017.\n\nFinances\nFor the fiscal year 2020, Cardinal Health reported an annual revenue of $152.9 billion an increase of 5.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Cardinal Health's shares traded at over $51 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$14.97 billion in August 2021.\n\nControversy\nRestatements\nIn September 2004, Cardinal Health announced plans to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003, and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope.\"\n\nFDA action\nIn August 2006, Cardinal Health ceased production of its Alaris SE infusion pump after approximately 1300 units were seized by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In February 2007, Cardinal Health signed a consent decree with the FDA which promised procedures to guarantee the safety of the Alaris SE. After FDA inspections, Cardinal Health entered into a further consent agreement with the FDA in 2009.\n\nDEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion\nIn 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington. On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an \"imminent danger to the public.\" The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills. These orders were filed after Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole met with Rannazzisi to ask if he had met with Cardinal about the investigation. Cole stated that he believed “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say” regarding the investigation. That year, Cardinal and the DEA reached a settlement that suspended Cardinal's facility in Lakeland, Florida from selling pain killers or other drugs for two years. In 2016, Cardinal was fined $44 million for after the investigation concluded.In January 2022, Cardinal Health, Johnson & Johnson, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen agreed to pay $26 billion to settle with all but five of the states suing them. Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95 billion in penalties.\n\nCardinal Health Foundation\nThe Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation. In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program. Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards. In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children's hospitals.\nPassage 3:\nKansas City Southern Depot, Zwolle\nThe Kansas City Southern Depot is a former Kansas City Southern Railway station located at the intersection of Spanish and Port Arthur Streets in Zwolle, Louisiana. Built in 1914, the depot is the only surviving building connected to the railroad in Zwolle. The railroad was built through the Zwolle area in 1896, and the town was founded shortly thereafter; the 1914 depot was a replacement for the town's original station. The railway station was an important shipping center for the town's lumber industry; lumber was Sabine Parish's chief export from the early 1900s through the 1940s, and the railroad made Zwolle one of the two main milling towns in the parish.The depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 7, 1989.\nPassage 4:\nCounce, Tennessee\nCounce is an unincorporated community in Hardin County, Tennessee. Counce is located on Tennessee State Route 57 near the Mississippi border. The community is adjacent to the Tennessee River near the Pickwick Landing Dam. Counce is the terminus of a Kansas City Southern line which was originally the Corinth and Counce Railroad and later became part of the MidSouth Rail Corporation before Kansas City Southern took over MidSouth. Counce was named after the Counce families, who were the first families to inhabit the community.\n\nDemographics\nPassage 5:\nKansas City Southern Bridge\nThe Kansas City Southern Bridge is a rail crossing of the Kansas River.  It has two main spans, and a smaller span at the west end.  It is a thru-truss, and closed to traffic.  It was built in 1905, by the Kansas City Southern Railway, and was closed in 1983.  The bridge's rails are cut off at each end. It survived the 1951 Kansas City flood. It is located about 100 feet (30 m) south of James Street over the Kansas River.\n\nSee also\nKansas City Southern Railroad Bridge, Cross Bayou, Shreveport, Louisiana\nPassage 6:\nVicksburg Southern Railroad\nThe Vicksburg Southern Railroad (reporting mark VSOR) is a Shortline railroad in and near Vicksburg, Mississippi, United States, owned by Watco. It connects with the Kansas City Southern Railway's Meridian Speedway in Vicksburg, and stretches north to Redwood and south to Cedars. The line was once part of a main line between Memphis and New Orleans, completed by the Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railway, a predecessor of the Illinois Central Railroad, in about 1884. The Illinois Central Gulf Railroad sold the remaining portions near Vicksburg, along with the present Meridian Speedway, to the MidSouth Rail Corporation in 1986, and in 1993 the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) gained control of MidSouth, subsequently absorbing it. The newly created Vicksburg Southern leased the lines from KCS in January 2006.\nPassage 7:\nKaw River Railroad\nThe Kaw River Railroad (reporting mark KAW) is a Kansas City, Missouri railroad, established in June 2004. Twelve miles of original track served the Kansas City Southern Railroad customers in Kansas City and Union Station. The original KAW was a Kansas City Southern Railway Company property and was the first shortline Watco began operating for KCS, serving customers in the Greater Kansas City area and handling interchanges among the BNSF, KCS, and Union Pacific. The April 2005 expansion was a BNSF property serving customers in Clay County, Missouri, and interchanges with the BNSF at Birmingham, Missouri. The KCTL interchanges with all the Class I railroads serving Kansas City.The KAW operations office is located in Kansas City, Kansas; Customer Service is located in both Pittsburg and Kansas City, Kansas.\nCollectively, the KAW and KCTL handle approximately 15,000 carloads of animal byproducts, chemicals, plastics and industrial products annually.  The KAW also has a transload site available for handling dry bulk products and other carload traffic.\n\nAdditions and expansions\nThe Kaw expanded from its original form in April 2005 by adding 16 miles of track from Birmingham, Missouri to Kearney, Missouri. In March 2006 the KAW took up operations for the Kansas City Terminal Railway (KCTL), adding more than 30 customers. In May 2007, nearly 15 miles of industrial track were added to serve customers of the Bedford Yard.\nPassage 8:\nKansas City Southern Railway\nThe Kansas City Southern Railway Company (reporting mark KCS) was an American Class I railroad. Founded in 1887, it operated in 10 Midwestern and Southeastern U.S. states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. KCS had the shortest north-south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri, and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe focus of the routes was the fastest way to connect Kansas City to salt water ports (it was 800 miles from Kansas City to the Gulf of Mexico compared to 1,400 miles between Kansas City and the Atlantic Ocean ports.KCS operated over a railroad system consisting of 3,984 route miles (6,412 km) that extend south to the Mexico–United States border at which point another KCS-operated railroad, Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), hauls freight into northeastern and central Mexico and to several Gulf of Mexico ports and the Pacific Port of Lázaro Cárdenas.\nCanadian Pacific Railway purchased KCS in December 2021 for US$31 billion. On April 14, 2023, the railroads merged to form Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the first and only to directly serve Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\nHistory\nOrigins (1887–1900)\nArthur Stilwell began construction on the first line of what would eventually become the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1887, in suburban Kansas City, Mo. Together with Edward L. Martin, Stilwell built the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway, a 20-mile long railroad, which was incorporated in 1887 and began operation in 1890.\nIn 1897, Stilwell completed the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (KCP&G) with a route running north and south from Kansas City to Shreveport, Louisiana, terminating at Port Arthur, Texas. In order to comply with Louisiana laws Stilwell, William S. Taylor, E. L. Martin, and others, officers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Trust Company of Kansas City, Missouri, as well as the KCP&G, incorporated the Kansas City, Shreveport & Gulf Railway Company (KCS&G) on September 27, 1894, to build or acquire railroads in Louisiana. The Arkansas Construction Company completed a 41.10-mile line from Arkansas-Louisiana State line (northern terminus with the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company) to Shreveport on April 15, 1896. The Kansas City Terminal Construction Company completed a 76.40-mile Shreveport to Many line on October 26, 1896, an 85.80-mile Many to De Quincy line on June 30, 1897, and the 19.16-mile De Quincy to the Louisiana-Texas state line on September 11, 1897, where the southern terminus was with the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company. A 26.60-mile narrow gauge branch line was acquired from the Calcasieu, Vernon & Shreveport Railway Company (CV&S), through the Arkansas Construction Company, that ran from De Quincy, West Lake, Lake Charles, and Lockport, and the construction company widened the tracks to standard gauge.  \nIn 1895 the KCP&G entered into a contract with the KCS&G to operate and maintain its property.In 1900, KCP&G was taken over by the Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS).By 1914 the KCS owned the separate entities of the Arkansas Western Railway Company, Fort Smith & Van Buren Railway Company, Kansas City, Shreveport & Gulf Railway Company, the Kansas City, Shreveport & Gulf Terminal Company, the Maywood & Sugar Creek Railway Company, the Port Arthur Canal & Dock Company, the Poteau Valley Railroad Company, the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company, the Arkansas Western Railway Company, the Glenn Pool Tank Line Company, the Joplin Union Depot Company, the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company, and the K. C. S. Elevator Company.\n\n20th century (1900–2000)\nIn 1962, Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. (KCSI) was established when the company began to diversify its interests into other industries. At that time, KCS became a subsidiary of KCSI. In 2002, KCSI formally changed its name to Kansas City Southern (KCS), with KCS remaining a subsidiary.\nFrom 1940 to 1969, the Kansas City Southern operated two primary passenger trains, the Flying Crow (Trains #15 & 16) between Kansas City and Port Arthur (discontinued on May 11, 1968) and the Southern Belle (Trains #1 & 2) between Kansas City and New Orleans (discontinued on November 2, 1969). In 1995, a new Southern Belle was created as an executive train to entertain shippers and guests. It also pulls the Holiday Express train in December, making the rounds to several KCS cities and stations.\n\nAccess to Mexico\nin 1996 Kansas City Southern Industries purchased a Mexican government concession to operate trains on a rail system in Mexico. This was due to the privatization of the Mexican railways which was losing money, had fallen into a state of disrepair, and needed expensive infrastructure upgarding to become profitable. The concession was to operate the 5,335-kilometer (3,315 mi) \"Northeast Railroad\" connecting Monterrey and Mexico City with a US port of entry at Laredo, Texas and seaports at Lázaro Cárdenas and Veracruz. This potentially very profitable concession was hotly bid on by many major companies, including the very large Union Pacific Railroad. Thie Northeast Railroad tracks carried 46% of all rail traffic in Mexico and 60% of all freight coming from and to the United States. Eleven of fourteen of Mexico's auto assembly plants, plus two more under construction, are located on this line. Auto and parts freight traffic accounted for 9% of the 2012 total carloads.\n\n21st century (2000–present)\nOn March 21, 2021, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) announced that it was purchasing KCS for US$29 billion.   Prior, a competing cash and stock offer was made by Canadian National Railway (CN) on April 20, 2021 at $33.7 billion. On May 13, 2021, KCS announced in a statement that they planned to accept the higher offer from CN, but would give CP until May 21 to come up with a higher bid, which was not made. However, CN's merger attempt would be blocked by a STB ruling in August 2021 that the company could not use a voting trust to assume control of KCS, due to concerns about potentially reduced competition in the railroad industry.On September 12, 2021 KCS accepted a new $31 billion offer from CP. Though CP's offer was lower than the offer made by CN, the STB permitted CP to use a voting trust to take control of KCS. The voting trust allowed CP to become the beneficial owner of KCS in December 2021, but the two railroads operated independently until receiving approval for a merger of operations from the STB. That approval came on March 15, 2023, which permitted the railroads to merge as soon as April 14, 2023. The merger was completed on April 14.\n\nOperations\nKCS hauls freight for seven major government and business sectors: agriculture and minerals, military, automotive, chemical and petroleum, energy, industrial and consumer products and intermodal.KCS has the shortest north-south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri, and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The KCS, along with the Union Pacific railroad, is one of only two Class I railroads based in the United States that has not originated as the result of a merger between previously separate companies.\nThe company owns or contracts with intermodal facilities along its rail network in Kansas City, Mo; Jackson, Miss.; Wylie, Texas; Kendleton, Texas; and Laredo, Texas.KCS operates over a railroad system consisting of 3,984 route miles (6,412 km) that extend south to the Mexico–United States border at which point another KCS railroad, Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), can haul freight into northeastern and central Mexico and to the Gulf of Mexico ports of Tampico, Altamira, and Veracruz, as well as to the Pacific Port of Lázaro Cárdenas, fulfilling the vision of KCS founder Arthur Edward Stilwell.\n\nCorporate structure\nKansas City Southern Railway was owned by Kansas City Southern, known as Kansas City Southern Industries until 2002, which in turn also owned other companies like Kansas City Southern de México and the Panama Canal Railway's operator, Panama Canal Railway Company.\n\nBibliography\nKansas City Southern History (2008), History of the Kansas City Southern Railway.

(reporting mark KCSM) was a Mexican railroad and operating subsidiary of Kansas City Southern (KCS). The company was founded in 1996 as Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (reporting mark TFM), a joint venture between KCS and Transportación Maritima Mexicana after the companies won a concession from the Mexican government to operate the 5,335-kilometer (3,315 mi) Northeast Railroad connecting Monterrey and Mexico City with a US port of entry at Laredo, Texas and seaports at Lázaro Cárdenas and Veracruz. In 2005, KCS bought out its partner's shares in the railroad, giving it full control.\nCanadian Pacific Railway purchased KCS in December 2021 for US$31 billion. On April 14, 2023, the railroads merged to form CPKC Railway, the first and only to directly serve Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\nHistory\nKansas City Southern de México was originally formed in 1996 when Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportación Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a government concession to operate on a rail system in Mexico. It was the Mexican President, Ernesto Zedillo, who proposed the privatization of the Mexican railways because the Mexican railway system had fallen into a state of disrepair and needed drastic work to become profitable. Since the late 1930s, Mexican trains and tracks were the property of the government as Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (Mexican National Railways). When the decision to privatize the railroad was made, only 15% of freight was moved by rail in Mexico (versus 42% in the US).\nThe most sought-after portion of the concessions, called the Northeast Railroad, was bid on by many major companies, including the United States' largest railroad company, Union Pacific Railroad. This concession included about 5,335 kilometers (3,315 mi) of track with connections to many key cities, including Monterrey, Mexico City, and Laredo, Texas. This track carried 46% of all rail traffic in Mexico and 60% of all freight coming from the United States. KCSM and TMM bid and won the concession for US$1.4 billion for the rights to operate the concession, paying 49% and 51% respectively.\nIn 2005, Kansas City Southern Industries purchased Transportación Maritima Mexicana's share in TFM, giving them full ownership of the company, and the TFM was officially renamed Kansas City Southern de México.11 of 14 of Mexico's auto assembly plants, plus two more under construction, are located on the railroad. Automobile traffic (autos and parts) accounted for 9% of the 2012 total carloads.\n\nKey connections\nGuadalajara\nLaredo, Texas – United States port of entry\nLázaro Cárdenas – Pacific Ocean port\nMéxico City – served by Ferrovalle, a terminal railroad co-owned by KCSM\nMonterrey\nQueretaro\nSaltillo\nSan Luis Potosí\nTampico\nVeracruz – Atlantic Ocean port\n\nSee also\nKansas City Southern Railway\nRail transport in Mexico\nRailroad classes\nPassage 10:\nKansas City Southern (company)\nKansas City Southern (KCS) was a pure transportation holding company with railroad investments in the United States, Mexico, and Panama. The KCS rail network included about 7,299 miles (11,747 km) of track in the U.S. and Mexico.\nIts primary U.S. holding was the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), a Class I railroad that operated about 3,984 route miles (6,412 km) in 10 states in the midwestern and southeastern United States. KCS's hubs include Kansas City, Missouri; Shreveport, Louisiana; New Orleans; Dallas; and Houston. Among Class I railroads, KCS had the shortest route between Kansas City, the second-largest rail hub in the country, and the Gulf of Mexico. Its primary international holding was Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), which operated about 3,315 route miles (5,335 km) in 15 states in northeastern, central, southeast-central and southwest-central Mexico. KCSM reached the Gulf of Mexico ports of Tampico, Altamira, and Veracruz, and the Pacific Ocean deepwater container port of Lázaro Cárdenas. KCS obtained 100% of ownership of KCSM in 2005, making KCS the only U.S. Class I Railroad to own track in Mexico.The company also owned half of Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC), which operates the Panama Canal Railway, providing ocean-to-ocean transshipment service between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The 47.6-mile (76.6 km) railroad served as an intermodal line for world commerce and complements the Canal, the Colón Free Trade Zone, and the Pacific and Atlantic ports. As of 2009, PCRC's wholly owned subsidiary, Panarail Tourism, offered passenger service for business commuters, tourists, and private charters.Beginning in 2021, KCS became the subject of a bidding war between Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway. Canadian Pacific (CP) emerged as the winner. CP then sought a merger, which was approved by the US Surface Transportation Board on March 15, 2023, and the combined \"Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited\" was created on April 14, 2023. The combined company forms the only railroad serving all of the countries in the North American trade zone (Canada, Mexico, and the United States).\n\nHistory\nIn 1887, Arthur Edward Stilwell and Edward L. Martin began construction on and incorporated the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway in suburban Kansas City, Missouri. Beginning operations in 1890, the railroad served the Argentine District in Kansas City, Kansas; Independence, Missouri; and the riverside commercial and industrial districts of Kansas City.\nWhile the Belt Railway was a success, Stilwell had a much bigger dream. Over the ensuing decade, the line grew through construction and acquisition of other roads, such as the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway, to become a through route between Kansas City and Port Arthur, Texas. With the final spike being driven north of Beaumont, Texas, on September 11, 1897, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (KCP&G) was completed. In 1900, KCP&G became The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS). In 1939, KCS acquired the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway (L&A), providing a route extending from Dallas to New Orleans, via Shreveport, Louisiana.\nIn 1962, KCS reorganized as a holding company, Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. (KCSI), as it began to diversify its interests into other industries under the CEO William Deramus III. The new KCSI focused primarily on the financial industry, along with the rail industry. In 1969, KCSI started the two largest companies that came out of the diversification: DST Systems and Janus Capital Group, which was known as Stilwell Financial at the time. DST Systems is a software development firm that specializes in information processing and management, with the goal of improving efficiency, productivity, and customer service. Janus Capital Group is a finance firm that provides growth and risk-managed investment strategies.\n\nExpansion in the 1990s\nThe core KCSI rail system changed little until the 1990s, when the purchase of MidSouth Rail extended KCSI's reach east from Shreveport into Mississippi and Alabama. Combined with existing KCSI routes, this created an east-west mainline marketed as the Meridian Speedway. Another acquisition, the Gateway Western Railway, extended KCS's reach from Kansas City to St. Louis, Missouri, and Springfield, Illinois.\nThe 1990s also saw KCSI expand into Mexico with the acquisition of partial interests in the Texas Mexican Railway (TM) and Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM).  TFM was created when KCSI and Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a government concession to operate a rail system in Mexico. The concession was also bid on by many other major companies, including the United States' largest railroad, Union Pacific Railroad. KCSI and TMM bid on, and won, the concession for $1.4 billion USD, paying 49% and 51%, respectively. TMM already partially owned the Texas Mexican Railway through a previous concession from the Mexican government. TM was particularly important to KCSI because they held the link from KCSI tracks to TFM tracks via trackage rights over the Union Pacific line.\nShortly after acquiring the Mexican government's concession, KCSI entered into another joint venture to purchase a government concession.  On June 19, 1998, the government of Panama turned over control of the Panama Canal Railway to Kansas City Southern Railroad and the privately held Lanigan Holdings, LLC. This created the Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC).\nAfter these large capital outputs, KCSI needed new money to improve the Mexican and Panamanian concessions they had purchased, and to continue to make capital expenditures in the future. To fund these efforts, KCSI spun off all assets that were not essential to the rail businesses. Doing this essentially paid off the purchase of their two existing concessions and freed up money to improve them. The first major improvement that took place was in 2000 and 2001 when the PCRC upgraded the railway to handle large, intermodal shipping containers, along with passenger transport.\nIn 2002, the Kansas City Southern Industries formally changed its name to Kansas City Southern (KCS) after spinning off many subsidiary businesses that were not directly related to the railroad business (the largest of which were Janus Capital Group and DST Systems). In 2005, Kansas City Southern purchased TMM's share in TFM and TM, giving them full ownership of the companies. TFM was officially renamed Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V.  The Texas Mexican Railway retained its original name and is a subsidiary of KCS.In June 2009, the Kansas City Southern began operating on new trackage between Victoria and Rosenberg, Texas, known as the Macaroni Line\n.Patrick J. Ottensmeyer  was named President in April 2015 and CEO in June 2016, succeeding David Starling. Ottensmeyer had served as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing and Chief Financial Officer. He was named Railroader of the Year by Railway Age for 2020.In September 2020, the company rejected takeover offers from Global Infrastructure Partners that ranged up to $23 billion; the final offer valued the company at a 17% premium over its share high in February 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMerger with Canadian Pacific Railway\nIn March 2021, Calgary-based Canadian Pacific Railway offered over $25 billion to purchase KCS. The purchase would allow the Canadian company to create the first rail network connecting the United States, Mexico and Canada. However, in May 2021, Canadian National Railway announced a superior bid to CP's, which KCS management later agreed to support. In August 2021, CP announced an increased bid that, while still less than CN's bid, was claimed by CP to have a greater chance of regulatory approval. While KCS's board agreed to CN's bid, shareholder and regulatory approvals were still required; on August 31, the US Surface Transportation Board (STB) denied a voting trust between CN and KCS.With the decision by the STB, KCS re-engaged with CP on CP's original offer. On September 15, KCS confirmed that it had terminated its agreement with CN and would support CP's revised offer. Kansas City Southern's shareholders voted to approve the merger on December 10, 2021.  The transaction closed in early 2022, following which KCS was held in a previously-approved voting trust pending approval by the STB; the combined company was to be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC). The combined \"Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited\" would form the first railroad serving all of the countries in the North American trade zone (Canada, Mexico and the United States).On March 15, 2023, the STB approved the merger between the two companies, which was completed on April 14, 2023.\n\nSubsidiaries\nIn addition to KCS, KCSM and PCRC, Kansas City Southern’s subsidiaries include:\n\nGateway Eastern Railway Company (GWWE) is a wholly owned subsidiary of KCS.  GWWE provides rail service over about 17 miles (27 km) of track in the East St. Louis, Illinois, area.\nMeridian Speedway, LLC (MSLLC) is a majority-owned, consolidated subsidiary that owns the former KCS rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is a portion of the KCS rail route between Dallas and Meridian, and is known as the \"Meridian Speedway.\" Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS), through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Alabama Great Southern Railroad, owns a minority interest in MSLLC.\nSouthern Capital, Development, and Industrial Services Companies: The Southern Capital company consists of bulk storage facilities complete with ocean terminals (Pabtex) along with a tie and timber plant (Trans-Serve, Inc., also known as Superior Tie and Timber).  The Southern Development Company is a holding company that owns various properties.  The Southern Capital Corporation, LLC is a leasing company owned jointly by KCS and GATX Capital Corporation of San Francisco, California, Southern Capital Corporation has the rail assets that once belonged to Carland and KCS, as well as the loan portfolio once owned by Southern Leasing Corporation.\nThe Texas Mexican Railway Company (TexMex) is wholly owned by KCS. TexMex consists of a 157-mile (253 km) railway that connects Corpus Christi, Texas to Laredo, Texas. TexMex also owns 400 miles (640 km) of Union Pacific trackage rights that spans from Beaumont, Texas to Robstown, Texas. With its trackage rights and physical railway, the Texas Mexican Railway connects KCSM and KCS at Laredo and Beaumont. TexMex also owns the Texas Mexican Railway International Bridge. It is the only rail bridge that connects the United States with Mexico through Laredo, and 40% of all rail traffic that travels to Mexico crosses over this bridge. Without TexMex, it would be nearly impossible for KCS and KCSM to act as a single company under Kansas City Southern.\nKCS also owns a handful of non-core businesses.  These minor subsidiaries, holding companies or minority investments (investments in which KCS has less than 50 percent ownership), have few employees and serve to support the rail operation. These include Canama Transportation, Caymex Transportation, Inc., Rosenberg Regional LLC, Joplin Union Depot, Kansas City Terminal Railway, Port Arthur Bulk Marine Terminal Co. and Veals, Inc.\n\nCompany officers\nThe following is a list of the executives heading KCS since 1889.\n\nSee also", "answers": ["no"], "length": 6445, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5fdd140211b5a3c1c879875b2c782e573cf4df4f68c8408e"}
{"input": "Do Dillingham Airport and Rafael Hernández Airport both handle civilian (passenger) service?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPuerto Rico Firefighters Corps\nThe Puerto Rico Firefighters Corps (PRFC); is the statewide fire department that provides fire protection, rescue, and protection from other hazards in the U.S. Estado Asociado Libre of Puerto Rico. It was established in 1942 under the Puerto Rico Fire Services. In addition, it offers fire protection services to all the airports under the authority of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority, Rafael Hernández Airport, and Mercedita Airport and they serve as crash rescue divisions. A separate agency, the Puerto Rico Medical Emergency Corps, provides emergency medical services to all Puerto Rico.\n\nHistory\nPuerto Rico firefighters have their origins in the southern town of Ponce. In 1823, Spanish Governor Miguel De La Torre, became deeply concerned by a large fire that occurred in Ponce, on February 27, 1820. This fire almost destroyed the town. As a result, it became mandatory for every male between 16 and 60 years to be a volunteer firefighter. Firefighters at this time had to provide their own fire-fighting tools such as picks, shovels, and buckets. Unfortunately, this first fire corps saw its decline once Governor De La Torre left his post.\nAnother major fire occurred in the Playa de Ponce sector of Ponce in 1845. This moved the Conde de Marisol, ruler of the island at that time, to create a new voluntary fire-fighting organization. In 1862, under the auspices of the mayor of Ponce, Luis Quijano Font, the fire corps was reorganized as The Fire Services and Thomas Cladellas was appointed Fire Chief.\nIn 1879, the Fire Services reorganized again, this time under the leadership of Ponce architect Juan Bertoly. Finally, Puerto Rico's fire fighting force reorganized in a more permanent manner in 1883 while Maximum Meana was mayor of Ponce. It consisted of 400 firefighters. Its officers were Julio Steinacher, Juan Seix (Senior Chief), Oscar Schuch Oliver (Second Chief), and Fernando M. Toro (Head Brigade and Charge of the Academy of Gymnastics).\nOn January 25, 1899, Pedro Sabater and Rafael Rivera Esbri, were among a group of firefighters fighting a fire in the U.S. powder magazine barracks, near today's Ponce High School in downtown Ponce. There were stored at that location large quantities of bullets, ammunition, and gunpowder. Had the fire reached this munition depot, it would have surely destroyed the whole town. These heroes saved the lives of many people and saved the town of a conflagration.\nIn 1918, the Mayoral brothers built the first motorized pump in Puerto Rico, using the chassis of a Pope Hartford. In 1930, Raul Gándara joined the Ponce Fire Service as Lieutenant; he would later become Puerto Rico's first Fire Chief.\n\nIsland-wide fire services\nIn 1942, the Puerto Rico Legislature passed Act #58 of May 9, 1942, also known as \"The Fire Service of Puerto Rico Act\", in which the Puerto Rico Insular Fire Services was created. The governor of the island at the time, Rexford Guy Towell selected Raul Gandara as fire chief. Mr. Gandara was, at the time, captain of the Ponce Fire Corps.\nLater, in 1953, it was called the Puerto Rico Fire Services, because of the new formed Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. By that time, they were using Mack trucks bought from the United States, specialized for fire extinguishing. On December 9, 1993, Law #58 was amended and it was called until this day as the \"Cuerpo de Bomberos de Puerto Rico\". On May 12, 2010, Carmen I. Rodriguez Diaz became the first woman in the history of the Cuerpo de Bomberos to become Chief of the CBPR.\n\nDivision/Bureaus\nThe CBPR is divided into different businesses and divisions to get a provide more effective fire protection coverage for the communities. These are:\n\nFire Extintion Bureau\nThis program provides firefighting, rescue and emergency and disaster situations, protection from natural disasters and coordinates interaction with other agencies in operations.

The employees then ignited the flammable liquid, but the fire quickly burned out of control; then, the fire stated to burn the second floor where the casino was packed of people; and then, thick black smoke covered the rest of the floors. And to make matters worse, the hotel was filled of American tourists and local citizens. Around 3:40 p.m., the nearest firehouse, the San Juan Metropolitan Station, received the first call. Later on scene, 14 fire trucks, more than 100 firefighters and 35 ambulances responded to the call. Later that evening, 4 helicopters including National Guard and State Police started airlifting people from the rooftop of the hotel to the beach on the back of the hotel. In the end, 97 people died. Most of them died of smoke inhalation, others died burned beyond recognition, and 140 people were injured. The cause of the fire was criminal arson, because of economic problems between employees and employers. This made the Dupont Plaza Hotel arson the most deadly fire In Puerto Rican history.\n\nHumberto Vidal Explosion\nThe Humberto Vidal explosion was a gas explosion at the Humberto Vidal shoe store, located in the Río Piedras area of San Juan, Puerto Rico, that killed 33 people and injured 69 others when the five-story building collapsed on February 21. November 1996. It is speculated that the probable causes of the explosion were due to negligence and lack of training of the employees and supervisors of the gas company with the name of San Juan Gas Company. It is considered one of the worst disasters on the island.\nThe explosion occurred around 8:35 in the morning on Thursday, November 21, 1996, in the middle of a bustling commercial center in Río Piedras. The six-story building that housed shoe, jewelry and music stores as well as the headquarters of the Humberto Vidal Shopping Center were literally destroyed and later demolished.\nThe immediate theory was that the origin of the explosion was a bomb planted by clandestine paramilitaries as an act of subversion. But there were no traces of explosive elements nor were flammable or incendiary materials found, which could have been used.\nThe President of the United States, Bill Clinton, declared a disaster area and the victims were helped with federal resources, including the assistance of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which initiated the investigation. The San Juan Gas Company, owned by Enron Corporation, disclaimed responsibility, mentioning that they did not supply gas service to the building at the time of the explosion.\n\nGulf Refinery explosion\nOn October 23, 2009, at 12:23 AM, seven oil storage tanks from the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation (CAPECO) in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, exploded causing an expansive wave from the epicenter into a five-mile radius. Puerto Rico Fire Corps units from the towns of Bayamón, Cataño, and Guaynabo arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the explosion. An hour later, fire units from San Juan, Toa Baja, and the municipal fire units from San Juan, Bayamón, and Carolina arrived to assist in what was considered to be the biggest fire explosion in Puerto Rico's history. The communities of Puente Blanco and Fort Buchanan were evacuated. The explosion was heard as far away as the town of Cidra. On the afternoon of the explosion, units from Ponce, Caguas, and Arecibo joined on the firefight. Governor Luis Fortuño declared a state of emergency on that area, and President Barack Obama separately declared a federal state of emergency in Puerto Rico, clearing the way for federal agencies to coordinate disaster relief and authorizing the use of federal funds. Personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), and the Department of Homeland Security arrived in Puerto Rico starting October 24 to investigate the fire.\nThe Puerto Rico National Guard was activated to help the local units with logistics in the area. The fire was contained two days later, on the night of October 25. Though there were no deaths, six people were injured, including one firefighter who was affected by smoke inhalation. The cause of the explosion is still being investigated. However, many questions have surfaced, and the investigation continues without a clear understanding of the events that night.\n\nPhotos\nPassage 2:\nTwin Hills Airport\nTwin Hills Airport (IATA: TWA, FAA LID: A63) is a state-owned, public-use airport serving Twin Hills, in the Dillingham Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska. Scheduled airline service to Dillingham Airport is provided by Peninsula Airways (PenAir).As per Federal Aviation Administration records, this airport had 395 commercial passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, a decrease of 23% from the 510 enplanements in 2007. Twin Hills Airport is included in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (2009–2013), which categorizes it as a general aviation facility.Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned A63 by the FAA and TWA by the IATA.\n\nFacilities and aircraft\nTwin Hills Airport has one runway designated 18/36 with a gravel surface measuring 3,000 by 60 feet (914 x 18 m). For the 12-month period ending February 28, 2009, the airport had 1,900 aircraft operations, an average of 158 per month: 87% air taxi and 13% general aviation.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nPassage 3:\nPunta Borinquen Radar Station\nPunta Borinquen Radar Station is a facility of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard home for the 141st Air Control Squadron. Located adjacent to Rafael Hernández Airport (which operates at the old Ramey Air Force Base), in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The facility has operated since 1964 when the 140th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (ACWS) was created under the control of Air Defense Command (ADC).\n\nSee also\nAir National Guard\nPuerto Rico National Guard\nMilitary of Puerto Rico\nPassage 4:\nRafael Hernández Airport\nRafael Hernández International Airport (Spanish: Aeropuerto Internacional Rafael Hernández) (IATA: BQN, ICAO: TJBQ, FAA LID: BQN) is a joint civil-military airport located in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It is named after the Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín. It is Puerto Rico's second largest international airport in terms of passenger movement. It is located in Porta del Sol tourist region, in Puerto Rico's west coast. It is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and to the Caribbean Branch of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations. The airport has the longest runway in the Caribbean region.\nIn the past, the airport has been served by major carriers like Capitol Air, Pan Am (II and III), Kiwi International Air Lines, TWA, American Airlines, Aeronaves de Puerto Rico and Delta Connection, and by Turkish Airlines Cargo on the cargo airline side. Taesa flew in 1996 from Benito Juárez International Airport in Mexico City, and at one time, Arrow Air flew domestic jet service between it and San Juan as well as to JFK International Airport in New York. Pan Am III also flew jets between Aguadilla and San Juan during the early 2000s. Currently, although the airport lacks non-stop flights to Asia, it is the only airport in Puerto Rico served by an Asian commercial airline, in this case by Emirates Sky Cargo.\n\nHistory\nIn 1939, the Army sent Major George C. Kenney to Puerto Rico to conduct a preliminary survey of possible air base sites on Puerto Rico. He examined a total of 42 sites and declared that Punta Borinquen the best site for a major air base. Planted sugar cane farms covered some 3796 acres that the government purchased for military use in the first week of September 1939 at a cost of $1,215,000. Later that year, Major Karl S. Axtater assumed command of what was to become Borinquen Army Air Field.\nWith the establishment of an independent United States Air Force in 1947, the complex was renamed Ramey Air Force Base in 1948. Ramey AFB was home to a Strategic Air Command bombardment wing and housed a number of B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bombers.  The B-36s were later replaced by B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers and KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft, while a tenant weather reconnaissance squadron operated WB-47 Stratojet and WC-130 Hercules aircraft. Due to the size and weight of the B-36, the runway at Ramey had to be built to a length of 11,702 ft and a width of 200 ft, added an 870 ft Blast Pad at each end and a 50 ft shoulder on each side.\nThe closure of what became Ramey Air Force Base began in 1971 and lasted until 1973. Following its closure, it was converted into a civilian airport. It used to receive domestic commercial flights by Prinair and Vieques Air Link as well as service from JFK International Airport in New York City with Capitol Air, and 707 passenger flights from Miami with Southeast Airlines. It is also noted for being the place that the large clothing company, Wrangler Jeans used to land their planes filled with company-related cargo as part of their airline operation, Wrangler Aviation, which was later  renamed to Sky Lease Cargo.\nIn the mid and late 1970s, the Ahrens Aircraft Corporation attempted to set up operations at former USAF industrial facilities at the airport in order to manufacture the Ahrens AR 404 regional airliner, a short takeoff and landing (STOL) turboprop aircraft, with financial incentives promised by the Puerto Rican government for development. However, a subsequent government investigation over these incentives ensued and the project was cancelled after only two AR 404s were built at Rafael Hernández Airport.\nIn 2004, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced that it would be remodeling and expanding BQN to accommodate more flights and passengers. An expansion of the terminal building and a new parking lot were among the projects in mind, with said expansion being inaugurated on July 12, 2005.\nSince the closure of Ramey AFB in 1974, the airport's control tower had remained standing, but was non-operational, limiting the airport to UNICOM communication as an uncontrolled airport.  Following refurbishment of the former USAF control tower in 2006 and 2007, the newly renovated control tower became operational on July 5, 2007.\nOn February 20, 2012, it was announced by both the mayor of Aguadilla and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce that the airport will be designated a \"free trade zone\" (FTZ), as are many other airports in the U.S., a move that is believed will improve the development of the airport and surrounding areas.\nOn April 10, 2014, Lufthansa Technik announced the creation of a maintenance, repair and overhaul center (MRO) at the airport.  This created operations for maintenance of Lufthansa Aircraft flying on the Americas, starting with 2 reconditioning lines by C and D checks for the Airbus A320, with plans to expand up to 5 reconditioning lines.\n\nPassenger service\nIn 1988, Carnival Airlines and ATA began passenger jet service. In the 1990s, American Airlines, joined those two airlines, followed by Pan Am II and TWA. Carnival Airlines provided Airbus A300 service to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey and Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the early 1990s, Carnival Airlines also operated the first intra-Puerto Rican jet service from the airport to Ponce with Boeing 727s and Airbus A300s. Another carrier, Prinair, also had previously conducted operations at Rafael Hernández Airport. North Cay Airways also provided passenger air service from San Juan at some time during the airport's history.In 2000, North American Airlines reopened passenger service with a non-stop flight to New York JFK three times a week. Later, Continental Airlines joined North American with a daily flight to their hub in Newark. Continental has since merged with United Airlines, and the latter airline has continued to provide service. Boston-Maine Airways began service to Orlando Sanford International Airport in Florida and to Santo Domingo.\nIn 2005 JetBlue began a daily flight to their hub at New York JFK. Soon after the arrival of JetBlue, North American ceased operations. As a result, JetBlue announced that it would add a second daily flight to New York JFK.\nIn 2006, Delta Connection began regional jet service to Atlanta, Georgia five times a week, although this service ended on January 20, 2007, as part of Delta's restructuring plan. Later in 2007, JetBlue began service to Orlando International Airport in Florida.\nIn the summer of 2007 Spirit Airlines announced plans to begin service from the airport to their hub in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with a flight five times a week during the summer. It then reduced its service frequency to a flight two times a week.\nIn 2007 there were 59 flights per week, 1 daily flight to New York City, 1 to Newark and Orlando and a flight 5 times per week to Fort Lauderdale.\nSpirit increased their flight frequency to daily to/from Fort Lauderdale. In addition, Spirit added a daily non-stop service to Orlando in February 2008. JetBlue continued to have two daily flights to New York City after the holiday season, adding a second daily flight to/from Orlando on May 1, 2008.  On June 2, 2008, Pan Am World Airways Dominicana restored service between the airport and Santo Domingo-Las Americas as well as to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.\nOn May 24, 2022, Frontier Airlines launched service for the first time between Orlando International Airport (MCO). The new service operates three to four times weekly and marks the airline's 13th route serving Puerto Rico from destinations in the U.S. and the Caribbean.\n\nFacilities\nRafael Hernández Airport covers an area of 1600 acres (647 ha). BQN has one runway, 8/26: 11,702 ft x 200 ft (3,567 m x 61 m) Asphalt/Concrete.\n\nNorth Side\nThe north side of the airport consists of a passenger terminal with an international side capable of handling flights of over 200 passengers. It also hosts the Main Cargo Terminal, the FedEx Terminal, and the General Aviation Terminal. The north side also houses the Copeca Jet Center Executive Terminal, as well as five service hangars. The military side of the airport is also located on the north side, housing Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, a United States Coast Guard facility, as well as the 141st Air Control Squadron (which operates at the Punta Borinquen Radar Station), a non-flying unit of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. Many Federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the United States Border Patrol Ramey sector and the CBP Air and Marine Operations Caribbean Branch based their operations on this side of the airport.\n\nSouth Side\nThe south side of the airport is the largest portion of the airport, but is currently undeveloped. Since the airport was transferred from the U.S. Air Force and the General Services Administration (GSA) to Puerto Rico Port Authority in 1973, the south side has been the object of various disputes and competing political campaign promises by local elected officials and local political candidates. Despite such promises over the past four decades, the south side remains undeveloped. Under the administration of Sila M. Calderón and Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, a master plan was conceived to turn the south side into an air cargo hub for the Caribbean, but local residents objected to the use of the south side for cargo rather than a modern passenger terminal.\n\nPassenger Terminal\nThe passenger terminal was upgraded to include air conditioning, more space for modern airline ticket counters and car rental counters. It consists of two gates, Gate 14 and Gate 15. Gate 15 is used for departures while Gate 14 is used for arrivals. The terminal is divided into two sections, domestic and the international, with the domestic side equipped with a United States Department of Agriculture facility, while the international side contains a United States Customs inspection facility.\n\nCargo Terminal\nThe cargo section of the airport is divided in two sections, the Main Terminal and the FedEx Terminal. The FedEx Terminal is home to FedEx and its local affiliates.  The remaining Cargo Carriers are located in the Main Terminal.\nThe U.S Coast Guard and various reserve components of the Armed Forces maintain a military presence within the former Air Force base. Many Federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the United States Border Patrol Ramey sector and the CBP Air and Marine Operations Caribbean Branch operate at the airport.\n\nFuture expansion\nA January 16, 2010 news report stated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved a master plan to redevelop the Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla that would involve an investment of $1 billion over the next 20 years. In 2010 the Aguadilla airport had two commercial passenger gates. The master plan calls for a total of 30 commercial passenger gates.There are also plans to expand the airport access road.There are official plans to renovate the runway to coincide with FedEx’s expansion. There are plans to add a second runaway to the airport.\nIn June 2021, an official plan of expansion was announced by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and paid by the FAA. The expansion plan includes building a new runway to replace the current one completed by 2027 as the current runway has only five years left of service, having been built in the 1930s for World War II.\nAside from the new runway, a new passenger terminal and three new cargo warehouses are planned to be built. The Puerto Rico Ports Authority seeks to bring back airlines with the new expansion. There are also plans to renovate the airport's facilities including bathrooms, relocating stores, adding jet bridges and more.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nPassenger\nJetBlue studied expansion for the 3 main airports in Puerto Rico for 2011 (Aguadilla, Ponce, and San Juan) and is one of two airlines that operate in all three airports. In the past American Airlines offered service to their hub in Miami from Rafael Hernández Airport. Previously the airport was closed due to the pandemic and passenger flights weren't permitted. On April 1, 2021, the airport reopened for passenger flights.\n\nCargo\nStatistics\nThis table shows the continuous growth of passenger traffic at the airport since 2001, but affected in 2009 by the lack of new flights: For year 2007 the airport transported 400,473 passengers, nearly a 500% increase in five years. Rafael Hernández Airport has an average of 47 regular passengers flights per week.\n\nAccess\nThe airport can be accessed via two highways from  PR-2.\n\nArecibo and points east including Isabela and Camuy are connected to the airport via PR-110.\nMayagüez and points south including downtown Aguadilla, Rincon, and Cabo Rojo are connected to the airport via PR-107.\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn April 26, 1991, Douglas DC-3C N136FS of Four Star Air Cargo was destroyed when a fire broke out in the cockpit whilst the aircraft was taxiing for take-off on a mail flight to Cyril E. King Airport, Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands.\nOn February 3, 1992, a C-54 of Dominican airline Aerolineas Mundo-AMSA had a runway collision with a Lockheed Super Constellation, suffering a fire and being damaged beyond repair.\nOn August 7, 2002, a a C-130 Hercules had taken off from BQN before crashing in Caguas, killing all 10 occupants.\nOn August 30, 2013, a Martinair Cargo MD-11 aircraft, taking off for a flight to London Stansted Airport, suffered an engine fire and had to abort the takeoff. There were no injuries to the plane's crew, but the airplane suffered substantial damage to the number one engine, nacelle and aircraft's structure.\n\nSee also\nTransportation in Puerto Rico\nList of airports in Puerto Rico\nPassage 5:\nKoliganek Airport\nKoliganek Airport (IATA: KGK, ICAO: PAJZ, FAA LID: JZZ) is a state-owned, public-use airport located one nautical mile (1.85 km) east of the central business district of Koliganek, in the Dillingham Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska. Scheduled airline service to Dillingham Airport is provided by Peninsula Airways (PenAir).As per Federal Aviation Administration records, this airport had 481 commercial passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, a decrease of 21% from the 606 enplanements in 2007. Koliganek Airport is included in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (2009–2013), which categorizes it as a general aviation facility.Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned JZZ by the FAA and KGK by the IATA.\n\nFacilities and aircraft\nThis airport opened in 1997, replacing the former airport located at 59°43′28″N 157°17′09″W. The current airport has one runway designated 9/27 with a gravel surface measuring 3,000 by 75 feet (914 × 23 m).\n\nAirlines and destinations\nPassage 6:\nFina Air\nFina Air was an airline based in San Juan, Puerto Rico named after Josefina Canto who was the mother of Lazaro Canto. It operated charter flights to the Dominican Republic from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla and Eugenio María de Hostos Airport in Mayagüez. The airline has now ceased operations.\n\nHistory\nThe airline was established in 2003 by Lazaro Canto (Founder and Chief Executive). In the June 7 edition of the newspaper El Vocero, the management of Fina Air announced that the airline would begin flying on July 15, 2003, connecting San Juan and Mayagüez with six Dominican Republic destinations. The airline planned to expand to other countries within the Caribbean by 2005 and acquire jet aircraft. The July 15 date, however, was later changed to October 2. The 2005 expectations for acquiring jets and opening new routes were never met.\n\nServices\nApart from operating regularly scheduled services from Aguadilla, they also rented airplanes to United States immigration services, to return illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic back home.\nFina Air was partnered with the U.S. group called Viva Airlines. The people involved left a list of unpaid debts, lawsuits, and unhappy investors after the death of Chief Executive Officer Lazaro Canto.\n\nFleet\nThe Fina Air fleet of 3 Saab 340 aircraft have been purchased by an aircraft leasing company and were later operated by RegionsAir as Continental Connection, flying out of Cleveland. The airline did try to purchase 2 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 aircraft but the purchase was cancelled. After several flights cancelled from July to August 2005, the airline Fina Air conducted an activity in the Dominican Republic to compensate customers affected in the months of December and January, which granted money in cash awards and added works of art by members of the Oro Sólido music band and by Johnny Ventura, all customers signed documents stating that they were pleased with the agreed compensation.\nOne of Fina Air's SAAB 340 airplanes later crashed in Argentina, as Sol Líneas Aéreas Flight 5428.\n\nLivery\nBecause Puerto Rico is politically a part of the United States, Fina Air (not to be confused with the cargo airline Fine Air), had the American flag painted on their planes' fuselages. However, most of Fina Air planes carried the colors of the Puerto Rican flag.\nPassage 7:\nDillingham Airport\nDillingham Airport (IATA: DLG, ICAO: PADL, FAA LID: DLG) is a state-owned public-use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) west of the central business district of Dillingham, a city in the Dillingham Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska.

The airport is located on the north coast of Curaçao, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from the capital Willemstad. Curaçao International Airport services flights from the Caribbean region, South America, North America and Europe and has the third longest commercial runway in the Caribbean region after Rafael Hernández Airport in Puerto Rico and Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport in Guadeloupe. The airport serves as a main base for Divi Divi Air, Jetair Caribbean as well as EZAir; it formerly served as a main base for ALM, KLM, DCA, DAE and Insel Air.\nLocated on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, the airport connects Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean. Curaçao International Airport is served by several airlines. It has one of the longest runways in the Caribbean, accommodating up to a Boeing 747. In the early fall of 2014, Curaçao International Airport opened a new General Aviation Center offering premier service in a separate building with a private entrance and exit and special amenities.\n\nHistory\nThe airport was initially called Hato Airport, namesake to the nearby town of Hato. On Tuesday, 5 January 1954, the airport was renamed Dr. Albert Plesman airport. Plesman, director of the Royal Dutch Airlines for the Netherlands and Colonies, had died a few days earlier. Often it was spoken of Aeropuerto Plesman or Plesman Airport, unofficially also the name Hato remained in use till this day. Nowadays, the official name is Curaçao International Airport. It will be unnecessary to set out in detail, of which it is of paramount importance, that the Dutch aviation industry gets a firm footing in the vicinity of the Caribbean sea, where air traffic is now becoming more and more a factor of economic significance.' - Albert Plesman\nWith the above argument, in March 1934, Albert Plesman, director of KLM, hoped to receive financial support from the Comité Vliegtocht Nederland-Indië. It was a new plan to head to the West. In the 1920s, it started to interest itself in the Caribbean region. Curaçao was developing itself in a beneficial way due to the presence of the oil refinery, and a growing number of people were starting to choose the region with the purpose of vacationing. Aviation companies were paying close attention to these developments and were researching if it was possible to create a connection between the United States, Curaçao and South America. The West Indische Gouvernement constructed a runway at the Hato plantation in Curaçao,\nOn 22 December 1934, the Snip plane arrived in Curaçao after an 8th day during a trip with the route Amsterdam-Marseille-Alicante-Casablanca-Porto Praia-Paramaribo-La Guaria-Curaçao.\nHato was one of the most important and busiest airports in the Caribbean during the Second World War. The airfield was used by the US Air Force for patrols against submarines.\nDuring the 1960s, the 'Bestuurscollege' commissioned Netherlands Airport Consultants B.V. (NACO) to design a Master plan for the airport. This assignment was in connection with the expected arrival of the Boeing 747. The 'Jumbo' first flew on 9 February 1969.\nCuraçao International Airport N.V. (Curinta) was founded in 1977 and operated the Airport until 2013. Its predecessor was the 'Luchthavenbedrijf', which was a department of the Government of Curaçao.\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force conducting antisubmarine patrols. Flying units using the airfield were:\n\n59th Bombardment Squadron (VI Bomber Command) 10 March 1942 – 13 July 1943 (A-20 Havoc)\n32d Fighter Squadron (36th Fighter Group, Antilles Air Command, XXVI Fighter Command) 9 March 1943 – 13 March 1944, (P-40 Warhawk)\nDetachment operated from: Dakota Field, Aruba, 9 March 1943 – 9 March 1944\nDetachment operated from: Losey Army Airfield, Puerto Rico, 9 March – 4 June 1944\n25th Bombardment Group (VI Bomber Command), 1 August – 5 October 1943\n\nAirport Expansion Project\nCuraçao Airport Partners (CAP) started off the expansion and visible enhancement of Curaçao International Airport as part of the Airport Expansion Project:\n\n2014: Enhancement and expansion of the Check-In area and airport boulevard.\n2016: Groundbreaking Ceremony of the Curaçao International Airport Terminal Expansion Project.\n2016: Inauguration Arrivals Hall and inauguration of airport food&beverages services and stores. CAP now also provides a safer landside flow, as the 'road' right in front of the airport has been adjusted into a boulevard for pedestrians. Families, kids, airport employees and users can safely enjoy this area of the airport, while having a clear overview of the surroundings.\nSpantenbier Terminal Expansion on 1 June.\n\nThe Spantenbier and Terminal Expansion\nThe Terminal Expansion Project is a crucial component of the Airport Expansion Project. The SPANTENBIER of the expanded eastern part of the terminal marks yet another important milestone in the Airport Expansion Project. \nImportant partner in this development is governmental company Curaçao Airport Holding, which is also investing significantly in the realization of the Terminal Expansion Project.\nFollowing this milestone, we will continue with the development of the terminal, which when inaugurated, will have doubled the Departure waiting area.

The show features the Duggar family: parents Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar and their 19 children – nine daughters and ten sons – all of whose names begin with the letter \"J\". During the duration of the show, two children were born, three children were married, and four grandchildren were born.\nThe show focuses on the life of the Duggar family, who are devout independent Baptists, and frequently discusses values of purity, modesty and faith in God. The Duggars avoid birth control, saying they have decided to allow God to determine the number of children they have. All of the children are homeschooled and access to entertainment such as movies and television is limited. They practice chaperoned courtship, in which a couple becomes acquainted only in a group setting. The values presented on the show have been associated with the Quiverfull movement, which has been described as promoting strict family conformity, male hierarchies and subservient roles for women. The Duggars have stated that they are not associated with the Quiverfull movement. However, in an article formerly published on their website titled \"Why Have Such a Large Family?\", the Duggars reference Psalms 127:3-5, from which the Quiverfull movement name comes. Moreover, in 2001, Jim Bob and Michelle were interviewed for an article published on a Quiverfull affiliated website. The Duggar family has also been connected with the Institute in Basic Life Principles and the Advanced Training Institute, both of which were founded by Bill Gothard.\nThe series began on September 29, 2008, and concluded on May 19, 2015. The show was TLC's most popular, averaging 2.3 million viewers per new episode in Season 10 and scoring in the Nielsen \"Cable Top 25\".On May 22, 2015, TLC suspended the series when the Duggars' eldest son Josh publicly apologized for having \"acted inexcusably\" following reports that he molested five girls, including some of his sisters, by fondling them. These events occurred in 2002 and 2003, when Josh was 14 to 15 years old and prior to the beginning of the show. On July 16, 2015, TLC announced that the show was officially canceled and would not resume production. A spin off show, Counting On, aired in December 2015 and was cancelled in 2021, due to Josh Duggar's arrest for child pornography.\n\nBackground\nThe Duggars live in Tontitown, Arkansas, near Springdale and originally appeared in several TLC and Discovery Health one hour specials, mostly focused on four of Michelle's last five deliveries. Jim Bob Duggar has an older sister, Deanna, who occasionally appears on the show. Michelle Duggar (née Ruark) has six older siblings (Pamela Ethel, Kathie Ann, Evelyn Alice, Carolyn Jeannite, Freda Louise and Garrett Floyd Jr.). The couple met in the early 1980s when Duggar and a fellow church member were sent for a follow up visit after Michelle experienced a religious conversion. The Duggars were married on July 21, 1984, just after Michelle's high school graduation. When they married, she was 17 and he was 19; neither attended college. Together they first launched a used-car business, then towing and real estate businesses; both are licensed real estate agents.The Duggars initially chose to wait before having children and used birth control pills in the early years of their marriage. Their eldest child, Joshua, was born in 1988. They resumed using oral contraceptives after his birth, but conceived again, despite this precaution; however, Michelle miscarried early in her pregnancy. She has mentioned that they named this child Caleb, despite not knowing the baby's sex. After consulting a doctor, the Duggars were told that birth control can (in some cases) allow conception, but cause miscarriage. As a result, they decided to stop using birth control and allow God to determine the number of children they would have. Michelle soon became pregnant again, this time with her first set of twins, Jana and John-David. Michelle gave birth 17 times, over a period of 21+1⁄2 years, approximately one birth every 15 months.\nThe high number of children is partly related to their Fundamental Baptist beliefs that prohibit contraception. They only watch programs they consider to be wholesome family television and various historical events. Their Internet service is filtered. They adhere to certain standards of modesty in clothing, in accordance with their religious beliefs. Shorts and tank tops are prohibited, and the women do not wear skirts that go above the knee. According to Michelle Duggar, such standards are mandated by scripture. They believe that baring one's thigh is \"nakedness and shame\" and runs the risk of \"defrauding\" others – or stirring up and arousing \"desires in someone else that cannot be righteously fulfilled\". They avoid beaches and public swimming areas \"because it's just too hard for the guys to try to keep their eyes averted in those situations\". Female family members keep their hair long, and males are clean-shaven and short-haired. They practice chaperoned courtship, where the couple get to know one another in a group setting. The Duggars describe this as \"dating with a purpose\". The Duggar children cannot begin a courtship without parental permission. Before a courtship officially begins, an interested man must speak to the woman's father.\n\nJim Bob Duggar served as a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002. He was defeated for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate by incumbent Tim Hutchinson in 2002 by a vote of 71,576 to 20,546. He later became a real estate agent and investor. The Duggars' income is derived from rental proceeds of commercial properties they own. Prior to the scandal surrounding son Josh, they lived debt-free.Construction of their 7000-square-foot house began in 2000, when they bought the lot and ordered two steel frames. One of the frames was not drilled correctly, so the Duggars received a third frame, which was used to build the girls' room and the industrial kitchen. Discovery Networks completed the build, finding local Arkansas construction workers to donate their skills and time. The home was completed on  January 20, 2006. Some of the painting, decorating, furnishings, appliances, and other finishing touches (such as a stocked pantry) were provided by Discovery Networks and corporate sponsors, as part of the one-hour television special entitled 16 Children and Moving In.\n\nBut there were longstanding questions about the way \"19 Kids and Counting\" (...) were able to skirt child labor laws because they were classified as documentaries. A 2010 investigation by The Times revealed that producers of \"19 Kids and Counting\" and other reality TV programs had not obtained work permits to employ minors under 16. Patriarch Jim Bob Duggar said at the time the family didn't consider the filming to be work. (...) And the questions go beyond labor law. As children, the Duggars' offspring were conscripted into a reality show that stripped them of their privacy and anonymity, all in service of their parents' extreme religious beliefs.\n\nSeries overview\nEvents during the series\nMichelle Duggar gave birth via emergency C-section to the couple's 19th child, Josie Brooklyn Duggar, on  December 10, 2009, six months into her pregnancy. When she was rushed to the hospital for gallstones, doctors discovered that she was pre-eclamptic and performed an emergency delivery. Josie was premature at only 1 lb, 6 oz at birth. Nearly four months later on April 6, 2010, the Duggars were able to take the baby to their temporary rental home in Little Rock while they awaited medical approval to take her home to Tontitown.The Duggars took Josie home to Tontitown for good on June 23, 2010. By that December she weighed 15 lbs 12 oz.On December 2, 2008, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's book The Duggars: 20 and Counting! was released. Their second book, A Love That Multiplies, was released on June 7, 2011. The eldest four girls – Jana, Jill, Jessa and Jinger – authored Growing Up Duggar: It's All About Relationships, which was released on March 4, 2014.On November 8, 2011, Michelle Duggar and the family appeared on NBC's Today Show to announce she was expecting their 20th child. On December 8, 2011, the Duggars announced that Michelle had miscarried 20 weeks into her pregnancy. Six days later, they held a memorial service for the stillborn baby girl that they named Jubilee Shalom (meaning celebration and peace).A few months after the birth of their daughter Mackynzie, Josh and Anna Duggar learned that she was pregnant with their second child, but the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. On their daughter's first birthday, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting again. The couple welcomed their second child, Michael James, on June 15, 2011. They learned that they were expecting again in September 2012.\nJosh Duggar was offered a job at the Family Research Council during his wife's pregnancy with their third child. Marcus Anthony was delivered by a midwife on June 2, 2013. Duggar announced that he was hired to be the executive director of the Family Research Council's political action committee, FRC Action, on June 18, 2013, and that the family would move to Washington, D.C.On December 2, 2014, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting their fourth child.The Duggars issued an announcement that Jessa Duggar was in a courtship with Ben Seewald on September 18, 2013. The couple met through their church. On August 15, 2014, after eleven months of courtship, the couple announced their engagement and were married on  November 1, 2014.Jill Duggar's courtship with Derick Dillard was announced on  March 31, 2014. They were introduced by Jim Bob Duggar and became further acquainted via supervised Skype and text conversations while Dillard was serving as a missionary in Nepal. Jill Duggar and her father traveled to Nepal to meet Dillard in person and began a formal courtship in November 2013. The couple announced their engagement on April 9, 2014, and were married on June 21, 2014.The Dillards announced their first pregnancy on August 20, 2014. Their son, Israel David Dillard, was born on April 6, 2015.The Seewalds announced their first pregnancy on April 21, 2015, having waited until the second trimester.On July 16, 2015, TLC announced that the series was officially canceled.\n\nReception\nArnold Hamilton of The Dallas Morning News described 19 Kids and Counting as \"part Little House on the Prairie, part Yours, Mine & Ours–except the only blending in this real-life family occurs with restaurant like precision at mealtimes\". He described the Duggars as acting \"against the trend\", considering the 2002 US Census found that only 0.3 percent of women aged 15 to 44 have given birth to seven or more children and that this number has declined steadily since 1976.In an op-ed for The New York Observer, Nina Burleigh described the Duggars as \"good TV. Good, sugarcoated rat poison, politically speaking\", referring to the Duggars' political activity such as their opposition to abortion and their lobbying efforts against legislation that would allow transgender people to use public restrooms matching their gender identity.In an article published in the Journal of Religion and Popular Culture, Christy Mesaros-Winckles described the Duggars as \"unofficial spokespeople for the Quiverfull movement\". Referring to the first season of the show, Mesaros-Winckles said that the Duggars introduced themselves and their religious beliefs with the \"subtle and disturbing\" message of conformity and \"rigid male hierarchy\" associated with the Quiverfull movement. Mesaros-Winckles asserted that the show provides a platform for the legitimization of this movement, while downplaying \"patriarchal gender roles and strict family conformity\". Mesaros-Winckles also said that the Duggars \"try to convince the audience that their way of life is best for raising healthy, godly children\" and that a large family is a \"biblical mandate\". She concluded that, despite the small size of the Quiverfull movement, with perhaps only several thousand followers, the show 19 Kids and Counting has brought the movement to the forefront of American culture.Feminist Amanda Marcotte referred to the Duggars as part of the \"Christian patriarchy movement\", which she described as interchangeable with the Quiverfull movement, saying that the Duggars promote sexist values which run counter to mainstream American culture.\nThe Duggars have said they are not part of the Quiverfull movement, stating: \"We are simply Bible-believing Christians who desire to follow God's Word and apply it to our lives.\"\n\nCriticism\nThe Duggar family has received criticism due to their stance on LGBT issues. In August 2014, Michelle Duggar recorded a political robocall regarding legislation affecting transgender individuals, which The Huffington Post described as \"transphobic\" and The Washington Post described as \"anti-anti-discrimination\". The robocall includes Michelle saying: \"The Fayetteville City Council is voting on an ordinance this Tuesday night that would allow men – yes, I said men – to use women's and girls' restrooms, locker rooms, showers, sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only. I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.\" In response to this robocall, a petition was started on Change.org calling for TLC to cancel the show 19 Kids and Counting, which received over 100,000 signatures. In response to the first petition, a second petition was started asking TLC to keep the show on the air, which also received over 100,000 signatures.In November 2014, the Duggars asked married couples to take a picture while kissing and share it on their Facebook page. Several users noted that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted from the Duggars' Facebook page. While working for the Family Research Council, the Duggars' eldest son Josh Duggar said, \"I truly believe every child deserves a mother and a father\"; the Family Research Council has been labeled as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, with SPLC saying they were designated as such due to their publication of \"anti-gay propaganda\". Josh Duggar has been described as an \"anti-gay activist\" by GLAAD.\n“19 Kids and Counting” also regularly documented the Duggars at events organized by the group in ways that omitted key information: For instance, episodes featuring commencement ceremonies from Alert Academy, an IBLP-led quasi-boot camp, never mention that the program denounces homosexuality and endorses the use of “loving corporal correction” on children. (...) The Duggars are associated with the Biblical patriarchy movement, which holds that men are ordained by God to be the leaders of their households and strongly discourages birth control. (...) “19 Kids” and “Counting On” made it seem like “it’s quirky and zany to run a household with that many children,” says Kathryn Joyce, author of “Quiverfull: Inside the Christian Patriarchy Movement,” when in reality older girls are often forced to serve as co-parents to the detriment of things like their education.  Once the Duggar girls reached adulthood, there were few options available to them other than marriage, kids and reality TV.\nIn January 2023, Jinger Duggar Vuolo, the sixth child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar who appeared on both \"19 Kids and Counting\" and its spinoff \"Counting On\", would criticize her family's \"cult-like\" religious beliefs, telling People Magazine things like \"Fear was a huge part of my childhood,\" \"I thought I had to wear only skirts and dresses to please God. Music with drums, places I went or the wrong friendships could all bring harm\" and that \"the teaching I grew up under was harmful, it was damaging, and there are lasting effects. Vuolo also provided more criticism of the Duggar family in her book Becoming Free Indeed: My Story of Disentangling Faith From Fear.\n\nJosh Duggar molestation controversy\nOn May 21, 2015, a police report from 2006 was revealed to the public by In Touch Weekly magazine, stating sexual molestation allegations against the Duggars' eldest son, Josh Duggar. The report states that, in 2002–2003, Josh – then 14 to 15 years old – fondled five girls, including four of his sisters, by touching their breasts and genital regions on multiple occasions while they were asleep and on a few occasions while they were awake. These events occurred prior to the beginning of the TLC series. The case was never fully investigated, and the statute of limitations has now expired. On May 22, 2015, TLC removed all reruns of the show that were previously set to air from its current airing schedule, with the statement: \"We are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time.\"In the wake of the controversy, more than twenty advertisers, including General Mills, Walgreens, Payless ShoeSource, Choice Hotels, Pizza Hut, Sweet Leaf Tea and Crayola, announced that they were pulling their ads from the show;Hulu also removed the show's entire back catalog of episodes from its streaming service. Public reaction to the revelation led to several petitions calling for TLC to cancel the series on Change.org, citing conflict between the reported events and the show's promotion of family values.Josh, along with his wife and his parents, responded to the revelations. Josh apologized, stating he had \"acted inexcusably\" and resigned from his position at the Family Research Council. Anna stated that she knew about Josh's actions two years before she married him and believed that the counseling he received after the incidents \"changed his life\". The Duggars described this time as a dark period in their lives and said it caused their family \"to seek God like never before\". They were featured in an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File on June 3, 2015, where they answered questions regarding the scandal.On April 29, 2021, six years after the show's cancellation, Josh was arrested for possession of child pornography and later convicted.  See Josh Duggar's 2021 arrest, trial, and conviction.\n\nCancellation\nOn July 16, 2015, Discovery Communications, parent company of TLC, confirmed to CNN that the show was officially canceled and that all further production would be ceased. In the wake of the allegations, the network announced that it would produce a one-hour, commercial-free documentary special on child abuse, which would include Jill and Jessa Duggar.TLC had paid the Duggar family an estimated $25,000–$45,000 per episode. One branding expert estimated that the loss of endorsements, speaking engagements and book deals based on the show could cost the Duggars an estimated $25 million a year.A three-part spin-off series, Jill and Jessa: Counting On, focusing on newlyweds Jill and Derick Dillard, Jessa and Ben Seewald, Anna Duggar and several of the other adult Duggar children (sans Josh) aired in December 2015. Its first episode attracted more than 2.2 million viewers, according to a report by The Nielsen Company. The third episode garnered the highest ratings and viewership, at 2.5 million viewers, and ranked in the Top 5 cable shows for the night. In March 2016, it was announced that Counting On had been picked up for a full season, which premiered on March 15, 2016.\n\nDuggar family\nParents\nJames Robert \"Jim Bob\" Duggar\nMichelle Annette Duggar (née Ruark)\n\nChildren\nAvailability\nDVDs\nPassage 3:\nSt Ursula's College, Toowoomba\nSt. Ursula's College is a Catholic independent  girls' secondary boarding and day school in Newtown, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. The school was established in 1931 by Ursuline nuns. The college is administered by the Catholic Diocese of Toowoomba.\nThe school is heavily influenced by the teachings of Saint Angela Merici.

Many of the species are popular for aquaria, species in the genus Sewellia are most commonly sold in the aquaria trade. They have a number of similarities with the Cobitidae, their sibling family of \"loaches\", such as multiple barbels around the mouth.  They should not be confused with the loricariids, which look similar but are a family of catfish.\nMost species are rheophilic, living in swift, clear and well-oxygenated streams. Several species of the family live in fast-flowing streams or torrents and have modified ventral fins used for clinging to rocks.The subfamily Nemacheilinae has recently been separated as a distinct family, Nemacheilidae (stone loaches) and several genera have been separated into the family Gastromyzontidae.\nPassage 6:\nLights Out (manhwa)\nLights Out is the nine-volume manhwa written by Lee Myung-jin, the author of Ragnarok. \nThe story is about the high school student Nam Gung Geon, a violent transfer student from the Chi Jon High School to Puk Ye High School.

Promotion is based on time so, when as competitors get faster they are promoted to division 8 and so on. In a regional competition divisions 9, 8 and 7 races are 4 miles, 6, 5 and 4 are 8 miles and 3, 2 and 1 are 12 miles. Some races include portages, which is where competitors get out of the boat, run round an obstacle of some sort, typically a lock, before getting back in and carrying on.\n\nSprint racing\nSprint kayak racing is very similar to sprint track racing. It is an Olympic discipline and races are run on a regatta course of 9 lanes. Paddlers compete in 200m, 500m and 1000m events in K1s, K2s and K4s. Like marathon racing, these races are also seeded based on ability and, depending upon speed, competitors are placed in groups A to D. As a beginner competitors start in group D and as they improve their times competitors move up through to group A. Sprint regattas take place 5 times a year at the Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre in Nottingham, home and training ground of the Team GB Canoe Sprint Team.\n\nLightning racing (Under 10 and Under 12)\nFor the under 12s there's a special racing kayak used called a Lightning. The divisions are Under 12 boys, Under 12 girls, Under 10 boys and Under 10 girls. Marathon lightning races are usually 2.5 miles and sprints are usually 200m and 500m. The club also has K2s and K4s for juniors that want to paddle and race with a friend!\n\nBeginners\nEveryone starts out as a beginner so the club offers Introduction to Kayaking sessions, which gets beginners to a standard were they can paddle with a group. In these sessions beginners will learn about the boats, paddling techniques and safety requirements. Once completed, they can then attend two free trial club sessions before deciding whether to fully join the club. As a member, beginners will first join the club sessions on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings with other people with a similar ability and follow training sessions developed by one of the 25 qualified coaches.\n\nPaddle-Ability\nThe club caters for everyone, including those that are registered disabled, and has specially adapted canoes and kayaks if the paddler is unable to use a standard boat. The club focuses on each individual's abilities with one-to-one and, if needed, two-to-one coaching to help the paddler achieve their goals. Paddle-Ability paddlers can enter sprint and marathon races and represent Great Britain in the Team GB Paracanoe Squad.\n\nIn the community\nNorwich Canoe Club often go out into the community and work with people of all ages and abilities who may not, otherwise, have a chance to go canoeing. As a community amateur sports club they recognise that there are barriers for some people wanting to participate in canoeing. To try to break down these barriers the club has developed a Community Outreach Programme, which offers canoeing to local groups and organisations. Club coaches and members regularly go into schools, day-care centres, public places, and fêtes to promote and demonstrate the sport, including competitions using indoor kayak machines and on-the-water taster sessions.\nPassage 9:\nCounting On\nCounting On (formerly Jill & Jessa: Counting On) is an American reality television show that aired on the cable channel TLC from 2015 to 2020.

{"input": "Who holds the world record for jumping over 6 buses and appeared on the British television series \"The Jump\"?", "context": "Passage 1:\nKathy Bergen\nKathy Bergen (born December 24, 1939) is an American Masters athletics track and field athlete. She is the current world record holder in the W70 100 meters and the high jump. She also holds the Indoor World records for the W65 high jump, the W70 60 meters, 200 meters and high jump. And she holds the American record for the W70 200 meters and the W65 high jump. She is the oldest woman to break the 15 second barrier in the 100 meters and to break 32 seconds in the 200 meters.\nShe is also the first 70-year-old woman to jump 1.30 meters in the high jump at USATF Masters Championships in Sacramento in 2010.\n54 and a half years of age is not the normal time for someone to become an athlete. Even amongst senior athletes, where groups correspond with ages evenly divisible by 5, that would be disadvantageous. But the mother of five was not approaching the sport with high aspirations. Her only previous athletic pursuits were two years of high school basketball and many years of playing tennis at as high as 4.0 level and occasionally playing doubles with her husband, Bert.  It was chasing the ball in those tennis matches that her husband noticed she was rather quick. Both of them went to the Pasadena Senior Olympics in 1994, where her relative speed vs. other people in her age group showed up. By the end of 1996, she already held the W55 American record in the high jump. She has a professional coach, who has worked with athletes more than 50 years her junior.\n\"She hasn't reached her peak yet, I definitely think we can break the records she already set.\"\nIn 2010, she set the W70 100 meter World Record before an audience of thousands at the Mt. SAC Relays.Bergen was featured in ESPN Magazine October 1, 2012 issue in an article called \"Senior moments.\"Upon ageing up to the 75-79 age group in 2015, Kathy broke 6 World Records-3 Indoor Records in the 60m, 200m and high jump, 3 Outdoor Records in the 100m, 200m and high jump.  She also broke an American Record in the discus throw.  USATF Masters committee named her 2015 co-winner of the Female Masters Athlete of the Year AwardOn February 16, 2020 at the Southwest Region Masters Meet held at the University of Houston, Kathy broke three Indoor World Records in the W80-84 age group. The first was in the high jump in which she jumped 1.20 m, which is an age-graded 117.31%. She ran 10.02 in the 60m and 35.66 in the 200m before the indoor season was cancelled.  In October at the outdoor Texas vs World meet she added 2 more World Records to her haul in 2020.  She high jumped 1.15m and ran the 100m in 16.62 sec.\nIn 2021 at the Striders Meet of Champions, Kathy broke 2 more World Records-100m in 16.26 sec and the 200m in 35.34 sec.  At the Masters Outdoor Championships in July, she won 4 golds in the W80-84 discus, 100m, 200m and high jump and led off in the W65-69 4x100m relay which broke the American Record by 7 seconds in the time of 1:05.16 sec.  She lowered the 100m record 2 more times to 16.23 at the CA Senior Games Championship.\nIn October 2021 the USATF Masters Committee voted her the Masters Athlete of the Year.\nBergen was elected to the USATF Masters Hall of Fame in 2008.\nIn March 2023 at the USATF Masters Indoor Championship held in Louisville, KY Kathy led off the 4x200m relay which broke the W65-69 American Record.\nPassage 2:\nPedro Pérez\nPedro Damián Pérez Dueñas  (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpeðɾo ˈpeɾes]; February 23, 1952 – July 18, 2018) was a Cuban triple jumper, who set the world record in the men's triple jump event on August 5, 1971, jumping 17.40 metres, while still a 19-year-old Junior athlete, in the final of the Pan American Games. His mark was a centimeter improvement over the three-year-old record of Viktor Sanyeyev set as the last of 5 world record improvements during the 1968 Olympics emphasizing the advantage of jumping at altitude.  Cali, Colombia is also considered at altitude.  While Sanyeyev reclaimed the record at sea level in Sukhumi, the next record in succession by João Carlos de Oliveira was also set at altitude in Mexico City and lasted ten more years. While he was the standing world record holder during the 1972 Olympics, he only managed a 15.72 and did not get out of the qualifying round. He improved four years later, taking the early lead in the final before eventually finishing in fourth place. Also he is level 6 on Faceit in csgo!!\nPérez was born in Pinar del Río, Cuba. He died on July 18, 2018, at the age of 66.\n\nAchievements\nPassage 3:\nCliff jumping\nCliff jumping is the leaping off a cliff edge, usually into a body of water, as a form of sport.  It may be done as part of the sport of coastal exploration or as a standalone activity. Particular variations on cliff jumping may specify the angle of entry into the water or the inclusion or exclusion of human-made platforms or other equipment. Cliff diving and its close relative tombstoning are specific to water landing (with diving usually implying a head-first entry and tombstoning implying a feet-first entry). Cliff jumping with the use of a parachute would typically be classified as a form of BASE jumping.Cliff jumping has inherent dangers due to the high velocity that can be attained during a long fall. Multiple cliff-jumping fatalities are reported every year.\nIn 2015 a world record for cliff jumping was set by Laso Schaller, with a jump of 58.8 m (193 ft).\n\nMajor variants\nTombstoning\nTombstoning is a form of cliff jumping popular in the United Kingdom characterized by upright vertical position of the body as it enters the water, and the activity's name derives from a similarity between this posture and the form of a tombstone.\n\nPlatform jumping\nAt alternative to a cliff as a launch point is a human-made platform. Jumping platforms may purpose built or improvised, but they may also be repurposed existing infrastructure such as a railway bridges.\n\nDangers\nIn the UK between 2004 and 2008, tombstoning lead to 139 incidents in which a rescue or emergency response was required. Spinal injuries occurred with 20% of these, and 12 people died.In recent years, injuries and deaths related to cliff jumping has increased calls for responses from local authorities and emergency services. A reaction to serious injuries and deaths at one popular tombstoning site, Plymouth Hoe, has led to the dismantling of seafront diving boards and closure of parts of the waterfront to discourage the activity.\n\nImpact with water\nWater resistance increase with the speed of entry, so a high-velocity dive induces rapid and potentially dangerous decelleration. Jumping from a height of 20 feet (6.1 m) results in a person hitting the water at 25 mph (40 km/h), an impact strong enough to potentially result in temporary paralysis of the diagraphm, a compressed spine, broken bones, or concussion. Horizontal velocity attained from a running jump may also add to the impact speed.\n\nCold water shock\nA phenomenon known as cold water shock and can disrrupt the abilities of divers who enter very cold water\n\nImpact with submerged objects or terrain\nSubmerged objects also pose a direct risk to jumpers, who may sustain severe physical trauma upon colliding with them, or risk becoming entangled and unable to surface. A too-shallow lakebed or seabed can also cause impact injury. In ocean conditions, tides can greatly affect water depth.\n\nCurrents\nAs with any other water-based activity, string currents can make timely exit from the water impossible.\n\nPopular cliff jumping locations\nPonte Brolla, Italy\nPlaya Forti, Curaçao\nDiving Board Island, Bermuda\nSouth Point, Hawaii\nNegril, Jamaica\nPossum Kingdom Lake, Texas\nClarence Cove, Bermuda\nNusa Lembongan, Bali\nLaie Point, Hawaii\nAmoudi Bay, Greece\n\nSee also\nExternal links\nThe dictionary definition of cliff jumping at Wiktionary\nPassage 4:\nGeorge Horine\nGeorge Leslie Horine (February 3, 1890 – November 28, 1948) was an American athlete who mainly competed in the high jump. He is credited with developing a technique called a forerunner to the western roll, a technique he developed due to the layout of his backyard where he practiced which was considered \"backward\" at the time. While on the track team at Stanford University, his technique was corrected to the more conventional jumping style of the time. He equalled the NCAA record in the event at 6' 4\" as a sophomore. His junior year, 1912, he reverted to his old style, improving to 6' 4 3/4\" and then a world record 6' 6 1/8\". A few weeks later at the Olympic Trials, he improved again to jump 6' 7\" making him the first man to break the 2 metres (6 ft 6.7 in) barrier. It was the first high jump world record ratified by the IAAF. He never improved upon his record, which stood for two years.\n\nBiography\nHorine was born in Escondido, California on February 3, 1890.He competed for the United States at the 1912 Summer Olympics held in Stockholm, Sweden where he won the bronze medal in  men's high jump event. He also competed for the USA in an exhibition baseball tournament in Stockholm.He died at his home in Merced, California on November 28, 1948.\n\nSee also\nHistory of high jump\nMen's high jump world record progression\nPassage 5:\nÅsarna IK\nÅsarna IK, founded in 1924, is a Swedish sports club in Åsarna, Jämtland. The club has had many prominent competitors in cross-country skiing, which is evident in the nickname of the village Åsarna, Guldbyn (Gold Village), which was coined after the 1988 Winter Olympics when three out of the four competitors in the men's relay competition came from the club. Åsarna IK has also spawned prominent track and field athletes.\n\nHistory\nThe club was founded on 1 May 1924 as Åsarna IK, before changing name on 1 February 1942, following a merger with Åsarna BK. Anton Bolinder (b. 1915), who started jumping in a gravel pit in Åsarna, became the European champion in high jump in 1946 (jumping 1,99 m), and runner John Isberg broke the junior world record for 1500 m five times in the 1940s. By the time of their international breakthroughs, both Bolinder and Isberg hade changed clubs to IFK Östersund. Bolinder became Swedish champion twice in high jump. In mid 2015 a book about Åsarna IK appeared. The club's chairperson since 2014, Ingvar Borg (1954–2017), died in a snow scooter accident in December 2017.\n\nNotable skiers from Åsarna IK\nJens Burman\nHanna Erikson\nIda Ingemarsdotter\nMats Larsson\nMoa Lundgren\nTorgny Mogren\nLars Nelson\nAnna Olsson\nJohan Olsson\nJan Ottosson\nThomas Wassberg\nEmma Wikén\nLars-Göran Åslund\n\nWinners of Vasaloppet\nSofia Lind – 1996, 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005\nHans Persson – 1984\nPeter Göransson – 1998\nJan Ottosson – 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994\nPassage 6:\nEddie &quot;The Eagle&quot; Edwards\nMichael David Edwards (born 5 December 1963), better known as Eddie the Eagle, is an English ski jumper and Olympian who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping, finishing last in the Normal Hill and Large Hill events. He held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001.  He also took part in amateur speed skiing, running at 106.8 km/h (66.4 mph), and became a stunt jumping world record holder for jumping over 6 buses.In 2016, he was portrayed by Taron Egerton and Tom and Jack Costello in the biographical film Eddie the Eagle.\n\nBackground\nEdwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family calls him by his given name, Michael. \"Eddie\" is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname. After a taste of skiing on a school trip aged 13, he developed his skills on dry slopes, then worked for a season at Glenshee in Scotland. Having not made the grade as a downhill skier, he switched to ski jumping as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place.Edwards began jumping under the supervision of John Viscome and Chuck Berghorn in Lake Placid, New York, using Berghorn's equipment, although he had to wear six pairs of socks to make the boots fit. He was disadvantaged by his weight—at about 82 kg (181 lb, 12st 13lb), more than 9 kg (20 lb) heavier than the next heaviest competitor—and by his lack of financial support for training, being totally self-funded. Another problem was that he was very far-sighted, wearing thick glasses under his goggles, which would mist up at altitude.Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships in Oberstdorf in Bavaria, West Germany, and was ranked 55th in the world. This performance qualified him as the sole British applicant for the 1988 Winter Olympics ski jumping competition. He received confirmation of his qualification for the games while working as a plasterer and temporarily residing in a Finnish mental hospital, due to lack of funds for alternative accommodation rather than as a patient.Edwards' jump of 71 m at Calgary in the Winter Olympics was then a British record (now 134.50 m held by Halifax-born Sam Bolton). His Olympic jump still puts him sixth on the all-time list of British ski jumpers.\n\n1988 Winter Olympics\nDuring the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events. In the 70 m, he scored 69.2 points from two jumps of 61.0 m; second-last Bernat Solà Pujol of Spain scored 140.4 points from 71 m and 68.5 m jumps; winner Matti Nykänen of Finland had 229.1 points from 89.5 m jumps. In the 90 m, Edwards scored 57.5 points from 71 m and 67 m jumps; third-last Todd Gilman of Canada had 110.8 points from 96 m and 86.5 m; Nykänen won again, with 224 points from 118.5 m and 107 m.From the beginning, the press version of his story was \"embroidered with falsehoods\". Edwards commented, \"They said I was afraid of heights. But I was doing sixty jumps a day then, which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do.\"His lack of success endeared him to people around the globe.  He subsequently became a media celebrity and appeared on talk shows around the world, appearing on The Tonight Show during the Games. The press nicknamed him \"Mr. Magoo\", and one Italian journalist called him a \"ski dropper\".At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution. King said, looking at the competitors, \"You have broken world records and you have established personal bests. Some of you have even soared like an eagle.\"\n\n\"Eddie the Eagle\" Rule\nFollowing the widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were made stricter, making it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example: the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and be placed in the top 30 percent or the top 50 competitors, whichever is fewer.Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, or the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He got a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to support his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, but failed to qualify for those as well.\n\nReturn to Calgary and other media appearances\nOn 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games. During his visit, he rode the zip-line at Canada Olympic Park with a member of the Jamaican bobsled team (the ride simulates the speed of a ski jumper) and led a procession of skiers down the slopes of the park while carrying an Olympic torch.Edwards was chosen as a torchbearer in the relay for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He ran with the torch on 7 January 2010 in Winnipeg.Edwards released a book (and a video) called On the Piste. \nIn 1991, he recorded a single in Finnish entitled \"Mun nimeni on Eetu\" (\"My name is Eetu\"), B-sided with \"Eddien Siivellä\" (\"On Eddie's Wing\"), though he does not speak Finnish. Edwards learned the lyrics phonetically and the song reached № 2 in the Finnish charts. The songs were written by Finnish singer Irwin Goodman.In the same year (1991), Edwards completed a charity ski jump at a ski slope in Christchurch, Dorset. He raised £23,000 for BBC Children in Need by jumping over 10 cars using a ski jump made of scaffolding.\nEdwards appeared in a number of advertising campaigns, e.g. on television, promoting cars, and commanded fees of £10,000 an hour. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming that a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly. In 2003, he graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in law. \"I've been interested in law since taking out a civil action against my trustees 10 years ago\", he said in a 2001 interview.On 25 February 2012, he appeared as a competitor on episode 2 of BBC1's Let's Dance for Sport Relief, 2012 and got through to the final on most public votes. His performances were accompanied by the Royal British Legion Band & Corps of Drums Romford.In 2013, he won the first series of the British celebrity diving programme Splash!, mentored by Tom Daley.In January 2014, he commentated on the Channel 4 TV programme The Jump, where 12 famous people took part in winter sports. As part of each episode, Edwards jumped off the largest of three ski jumps. In the same year, he appeared as a guest on the ITV2 comedy show Fake Reaction.\n\nIn 2017, he returned to the ski jumping facilities at Canada Olympic Park, where he had taken part in the Olympics in 1988, to make some jumps that were his first in over 15 years.In 2021, Edwards appeared on the UK version of The Masked Dancer masked as Rubber Chicken. He was the fourth celebrity to be unmasked.\n\nBiopic\nA biopic chronicling the life story of Edwards had been planned by Irish director Declan Lowney since 2007. Comedian Steve Coogan was originally chosen for the title role, but in 2009 Lowney announced that Rupert Grint would instead play the part. The film was scheduled to begin production once Grint completed work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2, but did not go ahead.In March 2015, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had acquired the film, with Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman starring and Dexter Fletcher directing, from a screenplay by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton. Egerton would portray the adult Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards, Tom and Jack Costello younger versions of Edwards, while Jackman would portray his coach, Bronson Peary. It was later announced that Christopher Walken had also joined the film, portraying the role of Bronson Peary's mentor.The film, Eddie the Eagle, was released in early 2016 and grossed a worldwide total of $46.1 million. In the UK, it grossed $12.8m, making it the highest grossing British film of 2016. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 82% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\nSee also\nEric Moussambani, Eric \"the Eel\", another famously unlikely Olympian\nPhilip Boit\nTrevor Misipeka\nVinko Bogataj\nSteven Bradbury\nElizabeth Swaney\n\nBibliography\nEdwards, Eddie (2016).

She is the current world record holder in the long jump, jumping 7.52 metres on 11 June 1988. She is the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist and the 1989 World Indoor champion. She is also a former world record holder (pre IAAF) in the triple jump with 14.52 metres in 1989.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Izmail, Ukrainian SSR, Chistyakova trained at Burevestnik in Moscow. Competing in long jump, Galina Chistyakova won the 1985 European Indoor Championships and a silver medal at the European Championships one year later. In 1988 she managed to win an Olympic bronze medal in Seoul as well as jumping 7.52 metres, the current world record for women. More gold medals at Indoor Championships followed, and in 1990 she even won the first triple jump event held at the European Indoor Championships. Later that year she underwent a knee operation but never returned to her old form.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union she became a Russian citizen. At the end of her career she received Slovak citizenship and represented Slovakia. She used to hold the Slovak triple jump record with 14.41 metres, achieved in July 1996 in London. This mark was bettered by Dana Velďáková. Married to retired triple jumper Aleksander Beskrovnyi, the couple now lives in Slovakia.\n\nInternational competitions\nRecords\nPassage 8:\nVera Olenchenko\nVera Olenchenko (born March 21, 1959) is a Soviet athlete.\n\nCareer\nWhile she was one of the best long jumpers in the world, she did not make it beyond domestic competition in the prime of her career dominated by a crop of top long jumpers including Olympic champion Tatyana Kolpakova, world record holder Galina Chistyakova,  Tatyana Skachko, Yelena Belevskaya, Tatyana Rodionova, Nijolė Medvedeva, Irina Valyukevich and Larysa Berezhna.  Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the following creation of new republics, Vera was credited with the indoor long jump record for Uzbekistan, which she still holds at 6.82m.  While most of her contemporaries disappeared from the scene, Olenchenko continued jumping and made it to an international championship, not representing Uzbekistan but Russia at the 1997 world indoor championships.  Her lifetime best was 6.92 from 1985, which ranks tied for the 96th best of all time.  But she nearly duplicated that with a 6.90m on June 14, 1996.  At the time she was 37 years old and it became the new masters W35 world record.  While her record would last for four years before it was surpassed by Heike Drechsler, it remains the exact age 37 world record.  It is the only exact age record between 17 and 38 not held by the big three women of long jumping; Drechsler, Chistyakova and Jackie Joyner Kersee  Four years later, Olenchenko added the W40 record.\nPassage 9:\nPine Mountain Jump\nThe Pine Mountain Ski Jump is a ski jump located in Iron Mountain, Michigan, Dickinson County. It is part of the Kiwanis Ski Club and hosts annual FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup competitions.  \"Pine Mountain Slide is known throughout the world as one of the better jumping hills.\"  Annually in February, it \"hosts jumpers from around the world at the best tournament in the United States.\" Top-rated foreign jumpers compete. Currently (excluding ski flying hills) Pine Mountain holds the U.S. records for the longest jump in World Cup competition at 140m (459 feet), as well as the overall distance record at 144m (472.44feet). The facility also includes two smaller ski jumping hills that are built into the hill northwest of the large hill. Attendance is about 20,000 ski jumping fans year around.\n\nSpecifications\nScaffold height: 176 feet (54 m)\nScaffold length: 117m \nLength of underhill (end of take-off to outrun): 632 feet (193 m)\nLength of underhill (end of scaffold to end of outrun): 1,032 feet (315 m)\nCritical point (K-point) of landing hill: 394 feet (120 m)\nHill Size (HS): 133m \nPitch of landing hill: 39°\nEstimated speed of skiers at takeoff (variable depending on wind and other factors): 55–65 mph (89–105 km/h)\n\nHistory\nConstruction of the jump began in 1937 and was completed in 1938. At the time it was 156 feet (48 m) high.  It hosted its first competition in 1939.  In 1948, the outrun was dug out, and in 1977 the inrun tower was made larger (to the current 176 feet (54 m)) after a fire.  There have been numerous other renovations over the years.  In 1996 and 2000 the hill hosted the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup, bringing in 20,000 spectators.  However, it has not hosted one since, and now hosts annual FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup competitions.Locally known as \"Giant Pine Mountain,\" it is reputed worldwide to be one of the best ski jumping facilities.  The ski jumping fans are said to be friendly. It is also considered by most jumpers as the most challenging jump on the Continental Cup circuit and in the world. This partly is due to the fact that the top of the jump is nearly 600 feet above all of the surrounding landscape giving the jumpers the same view that they would have if they were standing on top of a 60 story skyscraper. Also, because of the jump and hill's high rise above the surrounding landscape there is a significant wind factor for jumpers making it more challenging.Excluding ski flying hills, the Pine Mountain Ski Jump is the largest ski jump in the United States and it is between the 3rd and 8th tallest man-made ski jump in the world (depending on how height is measured). There are two other ski jumps in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan: Copper Peak is the only Ski flying venue in the western hemisphere, located near Ironwood, Michigan (and has been called \"Suicide hill\"), as well as the pre-existing Suicide Hill Ski Jump located at Ishpeming, Michigan, which is near the National Ski Hall of Fame.\n\nJump records\nBelow is the list of past and current record holders:\n\nList of events held\nThe Pine Mountain ski jumping tournament has been part of the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup every year since 2004 and with the exception of the occasional Winter Olympic Games or World Cup event, the tournament is annually the most prestigious and highest level ski jumping competition held in the Western Hemisphere.

{"input": "What ingredient is in both Cosmopolitan and Cuba Libre?", "context": "Passage 1:\nCuba Libre\nRum and Coke, or the Cuba libre ( KEW-bə LEE-bray, Spanish: [ˈkuβa ˈliβɾe]; literally \"Free Cuba\"), is a highball cocktail consisting of cola, rum, and in many recipes lime juice on ice. Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola (\"Coke\") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardí; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.\nThe cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.\n\nHistory\nThe drink was created in Cuba in the early 1900s, but its exact origins are not certain. It became popular shortly after 1900, when bottled Coca-Cola was first imported into Cuba from the United States. Its origin is associated with the heavy U.S. presence in Cuba following the Spanish–American War of 1898; the drink's traditional name, \"Cuba libre\" (Free Cuba), was the slogan of the Cuban independence movement. The Cuba libre is sometimes said to have been created during the Spanish–American War. However, this predates the first distribution of Coca-Cola to Cuba in 1900. A drink called a \"Cuba libre\" was indeed known in 1898, but this was a mix of water and brown sugar.Fausto Rodriguez, a Bacardi advertising executive, claimed to have been present when the drink was first poured, and produced a notarized affidavit to that effect in 1965. According to Rodriguez, this took place in August 1900, when he was a 14-year-old messenger working for a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in Havana. One day at a local bar, Rodriguez's employer ordered Bacardí rum mixed with Coca-Cola. This intrigued a nearby group of American soldiers, who ordered a round for themselves, giving birth to a popular new drink. Bacardi published Rodriguez's affidavit in a Life magazine ad in 1966. However, Rodriguez's status as a Bacardi executive has led some commentators to doubt the veracity of his story. Another story states that the drink was first created in 1902 at Havana's El Floridita restaurant to celebrate the anniversary of Cuban independence.The drink became a staple in Cuba, catching on due to the pervasiveness of its ingredients. Havana was already known for its iced drinks in the 19th century, as it was one of the few warm-weather cities that had abundant stores of ice shipped down from colder regions. Bacardí and other Cuban rums also boomed after independence brought in large numbers of foreign tourists and investors, as well as new opportunities for exporting alcohol. Light rums such as Bacardí became favored for cocktails as they were considered to mix well. Coca-Cola had been a common mixer in the United States ever since it was first bottled in 1886, and it became a ubiquitous drink in many countries after it was first exported in 1900.Rum and Coke quickly spread from Cuba to the United States. In the early 20th century the cocktail, like Coca-Cola itself, was most popular in the Southern United States. During the Prohibition era from 1922 to 1933, Coca-Cola became a favored mixer for disguising the taste of low-quality rums, as well as other liquors. In 1921 H. L. Mencken jokingly wrote of a South Carolina variant called the \"jump stiddy\", which consisted of Coca-Cola mixed with denatured alcohol drained from automobile radiators. After Prohibition, rum and Coke became prevalent in the northern and western U.S. as well, and in both high-brow and low-brow circles.Rum and Coke achieved a new level of popularity during World War II. Starting in 1940, the United States established a series of outposts in the British West Indies to defend against the German Navy. The American presence created cross-cultural demand, with American servicemen and the locals developing tastes for each other's products. In particular, American military personnel took to Caribbean rum due to its inexpensiveness, while Coca-Cola became especially prevalent in the islands thanks to the company shipping it out with the military. Within the United States, imported rum became increasingly popular, as government quotas for industrial alcohol reduced the output of American distillers of domestic liquors.In 1943, Lord Invader's Calypso song \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" drew further attention to the drink in Trinidad. The song was an adaptation of Lionel Belasco's 1904 composition \"L'Année Passée\" with new lyrics about American soldiers in Trinidad cavorting with local girls and drinking rum and Coke. Comedian Morey Amsterdam plagiarized \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" and licensed it to the Andrews Sisters as his own work. The Andrews Sisters' version was a major hit in 1945 and further boosted the popularity of rum and Coke, especially in the military. Lord Invader and the owners of Belasco's composition successfully sued Amsterdam for the song's rights.During the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Bacardi fled to Puerto Rico. The following year, the U.S. placed an embargo against Cuba which prohibited the importation of Cuban products, while Cuba likewise banned the importation of American products. With Cuban-made rum unavailable in the U.S. and Coca-Cola largely unavailable in Cuba, it became difficult to make a rum and Coke with its traditional ingredients in either country.\n\nPopularity and reception\nThe rum and Coke is very popular; Bacardi says that it is the world's second-most-popular alcoholic drink. Its popularity derives from the ubiquity and low cost of the main ingredients, and the fact that it is very easy to make. As it can be made with any quantity or style of rum, it is simple to prepare and difficult to ruin.Drink critics often have a low opinion of the cocktail. Writer Wayne Curtis called it \"a drink of inspired blandness\", while Jason Wilson of The Washington Post called it \"a lazy person's drink\". Troy Patterson of Slate called it \"the classic mediocre Caribbean-American highball\", which \"became a classic despite not being especially good\".Charles A. Coulombe considers the Cuba libre a historically important drink, writing that it is \"a potent symbol of a changing world order – the marriage of rum, lubricant of the old colonial empires, and Coca-Cola, icon of modern American global capitalism\". Additionally, both rum and Coca-Cola are made from Caribbean ingredients and became global commodities through European and American commerce. According to Coulombe, the drink \"seems to reflect perfectly the historical elements of the modern world\".\n\nRecipe and variations\nRecipes vary somewhat in measures and additional ingredients, but the main ingredients are always rum and cola. The International Bartenders Association recipe calls for 5 centiliters of light rum, 12 cl of cola, and 1 cl of fresh lime juice on ice. However, any amount and proportion of rum and cola may be used. Additionally, while light rum is traditional, dark rums and other varieties are also common.Coca-Cola is the conventional cola in the drink, to the point that customers rarely order anything else. This dates back to the origin of the drink in Cuba and was solidified in the 1920s when Coca-Cola emerged as the primary cola brand following the bankruptcy of Pepsi and Chero-Cola, and therefore the preferred cola mixer in alcoholic drinks. Pepsi's later attempts to enter the cocktail market were unsuccessful, especially after the song \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" solidified the association in the public imagination.Nonetheless, different colas are sometimes used. In Cuba, as Coca-Cola has not been imported since the U.S. embargo of 1960, the domestic TuKola is used in Cuba libres. Other common variants call for Mexican Coke (which uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup), Moxie, Diet Coke (the Cuba Lite or rum and Diet) and Dr. Pepper (the Captain and Pepper, featuring Captain Morgan spiced rum).Lime is traditionally included in the drink, though it is often left out, especially when the order is for just \"rum and Coke\". Some early recipes called for lime juice to be mixed in; others included lime only as a garnish. Other early recipes called for additional ingredients such as gin and bitters. Some sources consider lime essential for a drink to be a true Cuba libre, which they distinguish from a mere rum and Coke. However, lime is frequently included even in orders for \"rum and Coke\".When aged añejo rum is used, the drink is sometimes called a Cubata, a name also used informally in Spain for any Cuba libre. Some modern recipes inspired by older ones include additional ingredients such as bitters. More elaborate variants with further ingredients include the cinema highball, which uses rum infused with buttered popcorn and mixed with cola. Another is the Mandeville cocktail, which includes light and dark rum, cola, and citrus juice along with Pernod absinthe and grenadine.\n\nSee also\nBourbon and Coke, a similarly constructed cocktail made of bourbon and cola\nPiscola, a similarly constructed cocktail made of pisco and cola\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nDreaming of Julia\nDreaming of Julia (Cuba Libre) is a 2003 film directed by Juan Gerard. The debut film by the director, the story is based on Gerard's childhood life in Cuba. The film was released as Cuban Blood in the US. This film was initially released on 27 January 2006 at Mexico, which directed by Juan Gerard with a budget of 108.6 million USD.\n\nPlot\nSet in Cuba in 1958, the last year of Fulgencio Batista regime, the plot revolves around a boy who is torn between his friendship with a blonde American named Julia and the strife facing his family as a result of the revolution and turmoil in their nation.\n\nCast\nHarvey Keitel as \"Che\"\nIben Hjejle as Julia\nAndhy Méndez as Boy\nDiana Bracho as Beta\nGael García Bernal as Ricky\nAline Küppenheim as Katia\nCecilia Suárez as Dulce\nHéctor Then as Captain Rosado's Bodyguard 1\nRamses Cairo as Captain Rosado's Bodyguard 2\nMarilyn Romero as Tia Candita\nGyana Mella as The Hooker\n\nProduction\nThe movie was entirely filmed in the Dominican Republic, in 2000.\nPassage 3:\n2016 Rouen fire\nOn 6 August 2016, 14 youths were killed in a fire at the Cuba Libre bar in Rouen, Normandy, France.\n\nEvent\nThe fire started shortly before 00:50 on 6 August, when firefighters were called to the Cuba Libre bar in Rouen. The bar was hosting a private birthday party. The fire was initially reported as being caused by an \"accidental explosion,\" but this was subsequently refuted by the local authority. The blaze took 30 minutes to put out.Rouen's Vice Prosecutor Laurent Labadie told The Associated Press that the first testimonies from survivors and early results from the police investigation indicated that the \"fire was completely accidental.\" \"There was no explosion,\" Labadie told the AP. \"Candles on a birthday cake started the fire after the person who carried it tripped on the stairs leading to the basement.\"The candle flames are believed to have set the polystyrene ceiling tiles of the basement ceiling alight. It is expected that most deaths were caused by toxic smoke inhalation, although at this time no autopsies have been carried out to confirm the individual causes of death.\nPassage 4:\nCuba libre (disambiguation)\nA Cuba libre, or rum and Coke, is a cocktail made of cola and rum.\nCuba Libre may also refer to:\n\nFilm and television\nCuba Libre (film) or Dreaming of Julia, a 2003 comedy-drama film\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), a 2003 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent\n\nLiterature\nCuba libre!, a 1999 novel by Régine Deforges\nCuba Libre (novel), a 1998 novel by Elmore Leonard\nCuba Libre: Breaking the Chains?, a 1987 book by Peter Marshall\n\nMusic\nCuba Libre (album), a 2011 album by Lasse Stefanz\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Gloria Estefan song) (1998)\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Moncho song) (2018)\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 2000 song by Aqua from Aquarius\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 1999 song by Gigi D'Agostino from L'Amour Toujours\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 2006 song by Zucchero from Fly\n\nOther uses\nCamp Cuba Libre, a U.S. Army camp in Jacksonville, Florida during the Spanish–American War\nCuba Libre, a type of cigar made by Nestor Plasencia\nRepublic of Cuba (1902–1959), a period in Cuban history\n\nSee also\nThe Cuba Libre Story, a documentary series on Cuban history\nPassage 5:\nLiquorice stick (cocktail)\nLiquorice Stick () or alternatively spelled Licorice Stick, also known as a \"Regaliz\", is a highball (cocktail) made of cola, anisette or absinthe, and Liquorice sticks as a garnish. It originated in Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal where it was called a \"pauzinho de alcaçuz\" as an alternative to the rum and cola drink called a \"cuba libre\". In Spain it is called a \"palito de orozuz\". It was introduced into the U.S. through the Portuguese communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nRecipe variations\nLicorice stick cocktails can be mixed with just about any anis flavored liqueur.\n\nLocal variations\nIn Portugal, where the drink originates, it is often mixed with \"anisette\" but an older method considered more authentic is to make the drink using \"absinthe\" then cola is poured in over a sugar cube and ice\nIn Spain there is another variation, made with Anis del Mono and cola\nIn Greece Thessaloniki, there is another variant, that consists of \"ouzo\" and cola\nIn the Italy the drink is usually served with \"sambuca\" instead of anisette and mixed with cola\nPassage 6:\nCamp Cuba Libre\nCamp Cuba Libre was a rallying point for American forces during the Spanish–American War. Established in Jacksonville, Florida, in May 1898, it was constructed after forces assembling in Tampa became too crowded, and was the rallying point for Maj. General Fitzhugh Lee's Seventh Corps.\n\nEarly 1898\nThe camp was originally known as Camp Springfield, taking the name of the area north of downtown Jacksonville. The boundaries of the camp were set by \"Ionia Street on the east, 8th street on the north, Main Street on the west, and 1st street on the south.\" The camp saw its greatest activity as the rallying point for the 30,000 men of the Seventh Corps shortly after its construction. As an overflow camp, supplies were scarce, and resources were being directed towards the Fifth and Eighth Corps, which were being deployed to the Philippines and Cuba.\n\nWomen at Camp Cuba Libre\nThe Spanish–American War was one of the first wars in which nurses were used in an institutional capacity. The Daughters of the American Revolution Hospital Corps contracted four Catholic Lakota nuns as nurses who were sent to Camp Cuba Libre, before being assigned to Camp Columbia in Havana.White female nurses from the north who were serving with the Red Cross reported the suspicion with which they were received at Cuba Libre by the chief surgeon, who questioned the need for his staff to be aided by female nurses, channeling the suspicion that women volunteering for intimate contact with male soldiers were \"camp followers\" (a euphemistic term for prostitutes who opportunistically followed armies). To counter this perception, Chief Nurse Edna Copeland instituted \"strict sexual surveillance\" on her nurses, which seemed to prompt accusations of misconduct by the women at one another.\nPassage 7:\nMatthew Levin (chef)\nMatthew Levin  is an American celebrity chef based in Philadelphia.  He was the executive chef at Lacroix in the famed Rittenhouse Hotel until December 9, 2008.  From 2010 to July 24, 2011, he was the chef at Adsum, a Queen Village bistro where he gained notoriety for dishes including Tastykake sliders and his Four Loco dinner.  In March 2012, along with Cuba Libre owners Barry Gutin and Larry Cohen, he will take over as chef and co-owner of Square Peg, at the former location of Marathon Grill at 10th and Walnut St.\n\nEarly life\nLevin attended Syracuse University on a lacrosse scholarship, studying business. He then went on to study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York.\n\nCareer\nAs a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Levin began his culinary career training under chefs including Georges Perrier at Le Bec-Fin and Brasserie Perrier and Craig Shelton at The Ryland Inn.  Levin eventually went on to distinguished restaurants such as Aureole in New York City, Charlie Trotters in Chicago, The Millhouse in Langhorne and The Pluckemin Inn in Bedminster, New Jersey.Levin drew national attention as executive chef at the Moonlight Restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.  Bon Appetit reported, “Levin’s culinary creations now share the spotlight with art, thanks to \"Moonlight\".\"  The Philadelphia Inquirer food critic Craig LaBan awarded Moonlight three bells.Levin returned to his hometown of Philadelphia in 2006 to join the kitchen at Lacroix.  Soon after his arrival, critic Craig LaBan once again reviewed Levin's work and awarded the cuisine a rare four bells stating, \"Chef Levin has elevated this luxury destination to an elite four-bell status\", hailing Levin's creations as \"Philly’s most sophisticated contemporary cooking\".Lifestyle Magazine named Levin among the region's best chefs and Philadelphia Style magazine named Levin one of Philadelphia's \"Hot Chefs in 2007\". In 2008, Philadelphia Magazine rated Lacroix #2 out of the top 50 restaurants in Philadelphia.At the end of 2008 Levin left Lacroix to open his own restaurant. In 2008 it was reported that the restaurant, Masano, was slated to open late 2009 or early 2010. The deal for Masano, and another restaurant, later fell through. In 2010 Levin plans on opening Adsum bistro.\nIn January 2013 critic Craig Laban would go to write a scathing review of Levin's Square Peg.\nPassage 8:\nCelts and Cobras\nCelts and Cobras is the second and final studio album from the Scottish neo-rockabilly group the Shakin' Pyramids (billed on the album cover as \"Shakin' Pyramids\"), released in 1982 by Cuba Libre, a subsidiary of Virgin Records. \"Just a Memory\" and \"Pharaoh's Chant\" were released as singles from the album. It features a more diverse instrumental palette than the band's debut album, Skin 'Em Up (1981), but was seen as a departure from the group's original, immediate sound.\n\nReception\nCelts and Cobras features more varied instrumentation than previous Shakin' Pyramids releases, but was seen as a departure from the band's original, immediate sound. Trouser Press said, \"Celts and Cobras offers a higher percentage of their own songs, but on it they're accompanied by piano, accordion, electric bass and even — gack! — a string section... The band still rocks, but they'd better figure out where they're going.\" AllMusic gave the album 3/5 stars, and opined that \"the energy and verve of their debut had been replaced by a stultifying maturity.\" Ethnomusicologist Craig Morrison wrote, \"[Celts and Cobras] drifted farther from rockabilly as they broadened their horizons...

The cosmopolitan is a relative of cranberry coolers like the Cape Codder. Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a likeness in composition to the kamikaze cocktail.\nThe origin of the cosmopolitan is disputed.\n\nThe 1930s\nWhile the cocktail is widely perceived to be a more modern creation, there is a recipe for a Cosmopolitan Daisy which appears in Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903–1933, published in 1934.\n\nMade with ingredients that would have been readily available during the period, this identically named cocktail aims for the same effect. If this drink is in fact the source of the modern cosmopolitan, then it would be an adaption of a Daisy rather than a Kamikaze.\n\nProvincetown\nOne version of the creation of this popular drink credits the accomplishment to the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n\nNeal Murray\nBartender Neal Murray says he created the cosmopolitan in 1975 at the Cork & Cleaver steak house in Minneapolis. According to Murray, he added a splash of cranberry juice to a Kamikaze and the first taster declared, \"How cosmopolitan.\"  Murray's Cosmopolitan used 1.5 oz Gordon's vodka, .75 oz Rose's Lime, .75 oz Leroux triple sec, and .5 oz cranberry juice.\n\nJohn Caine\nJohn Caine is the owner of several popular bars in San Francisco and a cosmopolitan expert. He partially credits the upsurge in cocktails during the 1970s to the Cosmo being served at fern bars. Caine is credited with bringing the Cosmo west from Cleveland.\n\nCheryl Cook\nThere are a number of other claims made as to the origin of the cosmopolitan. Cocktail historian Gary Regan credits bartender Cheryl Cook of the Strand Restaurant in South Beach, Florida with the original creation. In a letter to Regan, Cook related the story of how she created the drink in 1985 or 1986:\nWhat overwhelmed me was the number of people who ordered Martinis just to be seen with a Martini glass in their hand. It was on this realization that gave me the idea to create a drink that everyone could palate and was visually stunning in that classic glass. This is what the Cosmo was based on.\nCook's original recipes called for \"Absolut Citron, a splash of Triple sec, a drop of Rose's lime and just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in pink.\"  Although Absolut Citron was not introduced anywhere officially until 1988, it was test marketed in Miami.\n\nMelissa Huffsmith-Roth\nNotable bartender Gaz Regan says that the internationally recognized version of the cocktail was created by Toby Cecchini & Melissa Huffsmith-Roth in 1989 at the Odeon restaurant in Manhattan based on a poorly described version of Cheryl Cook's creation. Huffsmith-Roth's Cosmopolitan includes 2 oz Absolut Citron vodka, 1 oz Cointreau, 1 oz lime juice, and .5 oz cranberry juice.\n\nNew York City\nAccording to Sally Ann Berk and Bob Sennett, the cosmopolitan appears in literature as early as 1993 and derives from New York City. However, a bartender named Patrick \"Paddy\" Mitten is also credited with bringing the drink to New York City from San Francisco in October 1987.\n\nPopularity\nThe cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s. It was frequently mentioned on the television program Sex and the City, in which Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. The trend was spoofed in a film adaptation when Miranda Hobbes asks Carrie why she ceased drinking them, to which Carrie replies, \"because everyone else started.\"\n\nPreparation and serving\nThe cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a martini glass. For this reason, the drink is  sometimes mistakenly categorized as a type of martini.\nThe use of citrus flavored vodka as the basis for this cocktail appears to have been widely popularized in the mid 1990s by Dale DeGroff and is used in the IBA-approved recipe. However, many bartenders continue to use a standard unflavored vodka and this alternative would undoubtedly be historically consistent with any of the supposed predecessors of this drink that were popular in Ohio, Provincetown, or Minneapolis during the 1970s, or in San Francisco during the 1980s. A lemon twist is sometimes used to garnish.\n\nVariations\nAnother variation calls for stirring in a mixing glass, instead of shaking.\nAn alternative ingredient in substitution for Cointreau is a variation of the French Martini.\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey star Kathy Wakile created a Red Velvet Cosmo, based on one of her favorite desserts, red velvet cake.\nFor a virgin cosmopolitan replace the vodka and triple sec with orange juice and pink lemonade.\nFor a constipolitan, use prune juice in place of cranberry juice.\nA CosNOpolitan, from Kimbal Musk's The Kitchen, has cranberry juice, lime, orange bitters and soda.\n\nSee also\nList of cocktails\nMartini\nPassage 10:\nCuba Libre (song)\nA Cuba libre, or rum and Coke, is a cocktail made of cola and rum.\nCuba Libre may also refer to:\n\nFilm and television\nCuba Libre (film) or Dreaming of Julia, a 2003 comedy-drama film\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), a 2003 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent\n\nLiterature\nCuba libre!, a 1999 novel by Régine Deforges\nCuba Libre (novel), a 1998 novel by Elmore Leonard\nCuba Libre: Breaking the Chains?, a 1987 book by Peter Marshall\n\nMusic\nCuba Libre (album), a 2011 album by Lasse Stefanz\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Gloria Estefan song) (1998)\n\"Cuba Libre\" (Moncho song) (2018)\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 2000 song by Aqua from Aquarius\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 1999 song by Gigi D'Agostino from L'Amour Toujours\n\"Cuba Libre\", a 2006 song by Zucchero from Fly\n\nOther uses\nCamp Cuba Libre, a U.S. Army camp in Jacksonville, Florida during the Spanish–American War\nCuba Libre, a type of cigar made by Nestor Plasencia\nRepublic of Cuba (1902–1959), a period in Cuban history\n\nSee also\nThe Cuba Libre Story, a documentary series on Cuban history", "answers": ["lime"], "length": 4196, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "db638307b229af402cb4c61e30ea5e392f6a9ad25b3d026e"}
{"input": "LJM was one of what type of company Andrew Fastow used in the Enron scandal? ", "context": "Passage 1:\nLJM (Lea Jeffrey Matthew)\nLJM, which stands for Lea, Jeffrey, Matthew, the names of Andrew Fastow's wife and children, was a company created in 1999 by Enron Corporation's CFO, Andrew Fastow, to buy Enron's poorly performing assets and bolster Enron's financial statements by hiding its debts.\n\nLJM1\nIn 1999, the early days of the Dot-com boom, Enron invested in a Broadband Internet start-up, Rhythms NetConnections. In a desire to hedge this substantial investment (they owned at one point 50% of Rhythms' stock) and several others, Fastow met with Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling on June 18 to discuss the establishment of an SPE called LJM Cayman L.P. (LJM1) that would perform specific hedging transactions with Enron. At a board meeting on June 28, Fastow announced that he would serve as the general partner and would invest $1 million. Also at this meeting, Fastow introduced the structure of LJM, stated he would collect certain \"management fees\", and got Lay to approve the partnership pursuant to Enron's Code of Conduct (Fastow's participation as the managing partner of LJM1 was not judged to \"adversely affect the interests of Enron\"). Later, Fastow raised $15 million and started LJM1 on its raison d'être, the Rhythms \"hedge\" (see below).\n\nLJM2\nIn what was essentially the second version of the same idea, Fastow proposed in October 1999 to Enron's finance Board the creation of LJM2 Co-Investment L.P. Once again, Fastow would act as general director of a much larger private equity fund that would be funded with $200 million of institutional funds. Again, the question of how Fastow's dual role as Enron's CFO and LJM2's general director was not seen as a conflict of interest and was easily laid aside by the board of directors.\n\nIllustrative transactions with LJM\nRhythms NetConnections\nIn March 1998, Enron invested $10 million for 5.4 million shares of Rhythms NetConnections, a then private broadband provider. After Rhythm went public, shares skyrocketed and Enron found itself with $300 million worth of Rhythm stock in May 1999. However, a lock-up agreement forced Enron to hold its shares for six months after the IPO. Owing to Enron's mark-to-market policy, Skilling's worries about Rhythm's volatility led to LJM1 carrying forth a convoluted transaction.\nFirst, Enron transferred with severe locking restrictions 3.4 million shares of Enron stock worth $276 million at the time to LJM1 at a reduced price of $168 million. Then, LJM1 capitalized one of its subsidiaries, LJM Swap-Sub, with $80 million of its restricted shares and $3.75 million in cash. Finally, Swap-Sub placed a put option on 5.4 million shares of Rhythms stock owned by Enron. Under the option, Enron could require Swap-Sub to purchase the shares in June 2004 at $56 a share. Hence, Enron's stock price was now tied to Rhythms' stock price. If Enron's stock did well and Rhythms' sank, then Swap-Sub could reimburse Enron using its Enron shares and provide Enron a profit. More importantly, the deal allowed Enron to use this \"trapped\" value of the Rhythm put option to bolster its income statement and keep its stock price inflated.However, unlike a true economic hedge that uses the equity of a direct competitor (in this case a direct competitor of Rhythms NetConnections), this \"hedge\" would fail disastrously if both Enron stock and Rhythms stock dropped. Despite this concern and the obvious conflict of interest involved in having Fastow run it, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen approved it.\nIn April 2000, owing to the decreasing value of Rhythms stock and a calculated 68% chance that the hedge would default, Enron unwound the transaction. As per agreement, Swap-Sub took from Enron its $207 million in Rhythms stock, but instead returned unrestricted Enron stock supposedly valued at $234 million. The Enron shares were, however, still under contractual restrictions and should have been devalued to around $161 million. Thus, Enron posted a slight profit instead of a true $70 million loss.\n\nCuiaba\nIn mid-1999, Enron owned a 65% stake in a Brazilian company, EPE, building a natural gas power plant in Cuiaba, Brazil. Additionally, the stake gave Enron the right to appoint 3 of the 4 directors in EPE's Board of Directors. The plant was having technical and environmental problems and Enron wanted to reduce its stake but had difficulty finding a buyer. Via a confusing and obscuring sequence of employees working for various subsidiaries, LJM1 \"agreed\" to purchase a 13% stake in EPE from Enron with the additional stipulation that LJM1 would gain control of one of Enron's 3 slots in EPE's Board.\nEnron used the missing director (it now only had 2 of 4 seats on the Board) and its reduced stake (52%) to claim that it no longer controlled EPE and therefore did not have to consolidate EPE on its balance sheets. This move allowed Enron to mark-to-market a portion of a related gas contract and post a $65 million mark-to-market income for the second half of 1999. Later, Enron mysteriously bought back the stake for a loss of approximately $3 million, despite the fact that the plant's construction had bogged down even more in the intervening time.\n\nENA CLO\nIn December 1999, Enron North America (ENA) pooled a group of its loans receivable into a Trust (known as a collaterized loan obligation) and sold about $324 million of Notes and equity. The lower-rated tranches of these securities were found to be extremely difficult to sell, given that they were the last to be paid out of the Trust and hence the most likely to default. These notes, not surprisingly, were purchased by LJM2 for $32.4 million. Since the loans had now supposedly been sold off without any further recourse to Enron, this allowed Enron to claim that it was no longer subject to credit exposure - improving its financial statements. Later, when some of the loans began to default, Enron provided support to the CLO in a Rhythms-like move by giving it a put option on $113 million of its stock.\n\nMEGS\nOn December 29, 1999, Enron sold a 90% stake in a company that owned a natural gas gathering system in the Gulf of Mexico to LJM2 for $25.6 million. Enron had been struggling to find a buyer by year's end in order to avoid consolidating the asset on its year-end 10-K. The transaction with LJM2 had apparently been intended to be temporary and towards this end as the contract allowed Enron the exclusive right to market LJM2's purchase to outside buyers for 90 days and capped LJM's return at 25%. Early reports indicated that the wells were performing above expectations and on March 9, 2000, Enron repurchased the stake from LJM2 for the maximum return to LJM2 possible. Jeff McMahon, Enron's then treasurer, initially refused to sign the agreement stating: \"There were no economics run to demonstrate this investment makes sense. Therefore, we cannot opine on its marketability or ability to syndicate.\"\n\nAftermath\nAndrew Fastow's interest in LJM2 was purchased in 2001 and many of LJM1's and LJM2's \"hedges\" and the debt they caused would later be handled in part by another Enron vehicle, the Raptor SPEs. LJM, along with Chewco, played a major role in the downfall of Enron (see Timeline of the Enron scandal) and was the primary vehicle by which Fastow and others siphoned off at least $42 million while ruining Enron. Its debt-concealing transactions with Enron effectively pushed liabilities off balance sheets and led to Enron's perceived success.\nPassage 2:\nEnron (play)\nEnron (stylised as ENRON) is a 2009 play by the British playwright Lucy Prebble, based on the Enron scandal.\n\nProductions\nEnron premiered at the Chichester Festival Theatre (11 July – 29 August 2009), before London transfers to the Jerwood Downstairs at the Royal Court Theatre from 17 September to 7 November 2009 and then the Noël Coward Theatre from 16 January to 14 August 2010 (after a cast change on 8 May). Directed by Rupert Goold with associate Sophie Hunter, the cast featured Samuel West as Jeffrey Skilling, Tom Goodman-Hill as Andrew Fastow,  Amanda Drew as Claudia Roe, and Tim Pigott-Smith as Ken Lay.Enron premiered on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on 8 April 2010 in previews, with the official opening on 27 April. Directed by Rupert Goold with associate Sophie Hunter, the scenic and costume design was by Anthony Ward, lighting by Mark Henderson, music and sound by Adam Cork, video and projection by Jon Driscoll and movement by Scott Ambler. Gregory Itzin starred as Kenneth Lay with Norbert Leo Butz as Jeffrey Skilling, Marin Mazzie as Claudia Roe, and Stephen Kunken as Andrew Fastow. The Broadway production of Enron closed on 9 May 2010; it lasted just over a month. The Guardian's critic Michael Billington speculated that it was The New York Times' \"hostile\" review that contributed to its premature closure. He also stated its failure to earn nominations at the Tony Awards in major categories was its \"kiss of death\".Enron was premiered in Reykjavik City Theatre in September 2010, in Dublin as part of the Dublin Theatre Festival in October 2010 and in Helsinki (Helsinki City Theatre) in November 2010.\n\nPlot\nThe play concerns the financial scandal and collapse of \"ENRON\", the American energy corporation, based in Texas. Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling and his boss Kenneth Lay are shown, as well as Skilling's protege Andy Fastow, who rises to become the chief financial officer.\n\nPremiere casts\nResponse\nTim Walker, the Sunday Telegraph critic, gave it five stars, drawing parallels with the plot to that of King Lear. \"While it isn't done any more to say this in the financial pages, I say it here with conviction: Enron is a strong buy,\" he wrote.In The New York Times review of the Broadway production, Ben Brantley wrote, contrary to some other critics, \"even with a well-drilled cast that includes bright Broadway headliners like Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie, the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirror financial practices isn’t much more than smoke and mirrors itself. Enron is fast-paced, flamboyant and, despite the head-clogging intricacy of its business mathematics, lucid to the point of simple-mindedness. But as was true of the company of this play's title, the energy generated here often feels factitious, all show (or show and tell) and little substance.\"Michael Billington, critic for The Guardian, dubbed Brantley's comments an \"obtuse and hostile review\", stating that \"Enron's fate was sealed the moment Brantley's review appeared [...] As a fellow critic, I respect Brantley's right to his opinion; what is dismaying is his failure to see what Prebble and Goold were up to [...] But no serious play on Broadway can survive a withering attack from The New York Times, which carries the force of a papal indictment\".\n\nAwards and nominations\nEnron won the 2009 Theatrical Management Association award for Best New Play and was also nominated for Best Performance in a Play (Samuel West). In the 2009 Evening Standard Theatre Awards, it won Best Director and was nominated for Best Actor (for West) and Best Play (for Prebble).The play received Tony Award nominations for the 2010 Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre, 2010 Best Featured Actor in a Play (Kunken), 2010 Best Lighting Design of a Play (Mark Henderson), and 2010 Best Sound Design of a Play (Adam Cork).\nPassage 3:\nLea Fastow\nLea Weingarten Fastow is a former Enron assistant treasurer who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and filing fraudulent Income Tax returns. The wife of former Enron executive and convicted felon Andrew Fastow, she was the second former Enron executive to go to prison after Enron collapsed due to fraud in December 2001. Fastow is a native of Houston, Texas, where she was born into a Jewish family. Her mother was Miriam Hadar Weingarten, winner of the Miss Israel competition in 1958, and her father was Jack Weingarten, of the Weingarten's supermarket chain, who was a real-estate broker. When she was young her parents divorced and her mother went on to marry to Akiva Nof, and from this marriage was born a half-sister. She graduated from Tufts University, where she met her future husband, and earned an MBA at Northwestern University. She and her husband both attended Congregation Or Ami, a conservative synagogue.In 2003, Fastow was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to commit wire fraud; money laundering conspiracy and four counts of filing false income tax returns. She pleaded guilty on January 14, 2004, to submitting a fraudulent income tax return that did not include profits her family had received from her husband's off-the-books partnerships.Fastow reported to prison on July 12, 2004, and was released to a halfway house on July 11, 2005.\nPassage 4:\nNancy Temple\nNancy Anne Temple is an attorney specializing in accounting liability. She was the in-house attorney for Arthur Andersen, who advised Michael Odom and David B. Duncan about Arthur Andersen policies regarding retention of documents from client engagements. Duncan oversaw the shredding of Arthur Andersen documents concerning their work for client Enron, between October 22 and November 9, 2001 (See the Timeline of the Enron scandal). A memo from Nancy Temple played a key role in the conviction of Arthur Andersen on charges of obstruction of justice. That conviction was later overturned.\n\nPre-Andersen\nNancy Temple graduated from the University of Illinois College of Business in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy.\nAfter graduation, Ms. Temple attended Harvard Law School where she graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1989.\nShe began her career at Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, now known as Sidley Austin.  She worked at the law firm for 11 years and was inducted as a partner.  Ms. Temple specialized in accounting liability.\n\nArthur Andersen conviction overturned\nOn May 31, 2005, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Arthur Andersen in a unanimous decision.Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said the former Big Five accounting firm's obstruction-of-justice conviction was improper because the instructions at trial were too vague for jurors to determine correctly whether Andersen obstructed justice. \"'[T]he jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing,\" he wrote. \"[I]t is striking how little culpability the instructions required.\"In post-conviction interviews, several of the Arthur Andersen jurors indicated that the \"guilty\" verdict was proximately based upon an internal October 16, 2001 email from in-house Arthur Andersen attorney Nancy Temple. The text of the email from Nancy Temple is as follows:\n\nThe Supreme Court's unanimous reversal of the conviction reinforces the opinion that the jury should not have inferred any liability on Arthur Andersen based solely upon the October 16 memo. Rather, Ms. Temple's bar license required that she not do anything that would waive the \"attorney-client\" privilege of Enron or Arthur Andersen. By having her name and a legal reference removed, in effect she was making the subject memo suitable for public disclosure – it was no longer a \"privileged\" document.In addition, public accounting firms had a duty to notify the SEC within a defined time window if the accountants disagreed with a public accounting filing by a client. Ms. Temple's memo notes that the subject matter at issue was determined not to be of a nature that would require that Arthur Andersen to notify the SEC - i.e., a \"Section 10A\" filing, and her memo indicates that she will consult with the lawyers – again – to verify that conclusion.\n\nPost-Andersen\nNancy Temple is now married and has three sons.\nAfter the Arthur Andersen case, Ms. Temple began working for Freeman, Freeman & Salzman P.C., a currently defunct law firm.\nOn April 1, 2008, Ms. Temple returned to practice law at Katten & Temple LLP, a firm she co-founded.  The firm specializes in litigation.\nPassage 5:\nKenneth Lay\nKenneth Lee Lay (April 15, 1942 – July 5, 2006) was an American businessman who was the founder, chief executive officer and chairman of Enron. He was heavily involved in the eponymous accounting scandal that unraveled in 2001 into the largest bankruptcy ever to that date. Lay was indicted by a grand jury and was found guilty of 10 counts of securities fraud at trial. Lay died in July 2006 while vacationing in his house near Aspen, Colorado, three months before his scheduled sentencing. A preliminary autopsy reported Lay died of a heart attack caused by coronary artery disease. His death resulted in a vacated judgment.Lay left behind \"a legacy of shame\" characterized by \"mismanagement and dishonesty\". In 2009 a list posted on portfolio.com ranked Lay as the third-worst American CEO of all time. His actions were the catalyst for subsequent and fundamental corporate reform in regard to \"standards of leadership, governance, and accountability\".Lay was one of America's highest-paid CEOs; between 1998 and 2001, he collected more than $220 million in cash and stock in Enron,\nselling 1.7 million of those shares. However, during his trial in 2006, Lay claimed that Enron stock made up about 90% of his wealth, and that his net worth at that time was negative $250,000.\n\nEarly life\nLay was born in the Texas County, Missouri, town of Tyrone, the son of Omer and Ruth (née Rees) Lay. Lay's father was a Baptist preacher and Lay grew up in poverty after the family's general store failed. Later in Lay's childhood, his family relocated to Columbia, Missouri, and Lay attended David H. Hickman High School and the University of Missouri, where he studied economics, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1964 and a Master of Arts in 1965. He served as president of the Zeta Phi chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the University of Missouri. He earned a Doctor of Philosophy in economics from the University of Houston in 1970.He worked at Humble Oil as an economist from 1965 to 1968 in the Corporate Planning Department. In 1968, Lay entered the Officer Candidate School for the United States Navy where, from 1968 to 1971, he rose to the rank of lieutenant and was the special assistant to the Navy Comptroller and Financial Analyst at the Office of Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the Department of the Navy at The Pentagon.\n\nCareer\nLay worked from 1971 to 1972 as a technical assistant to commissioner and vice chairman (federal energy regulator) of the Federal Power Commission and served as the energy deputy under secretary for the United States Department of Interior until 1974. In 1974, he returned to the business world as an executive at Florida Gas Transmission and was president of Continental Resources from 1981 to 1982. In 1982, he joined Transco Energy Company, owner of the Transcontinental Pipeline, in Houston and held the positions of president, chief operating officer and director until 1984 when he became chairman and CEO of the Houston Natural Gas Company.By the time energy was deregulated in the 1980s, Lay was already an energy company executive and he took advantage of the new climate when Omaha-based InterNorth bought his company Houston Natural Gas and changed the name to Enron in 1985.He was also a member of the board of directors from 1993 to 2001 of Eli Lilly and Company and a director at Texas Commerce Bank. In 1996 he held negotiations to replace Robert E. Allen as the CEO of AT&T.\n\nPolitical involvement\nLay was a friend of the Bush family including former President George H. W. Bush. He made monetary contributions, led several committees in the Republican Party and was co-chairman of Bush's 1992 re-election committee. As President, Lay flew Bush and his wife to Washington on an Enron corporate plane. In December 2000, Lay was mentioned as a possible candidate for either United States Secretary of Energy or Secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush. He was not nominated because it was decided that the administration already included too many energy businessmen from Texas.Lay additionally had friendly relations with the Republican politicians Gerald R. Ford, Dick Cheney, and James A. Baker III as well as the Democratic politicians Bill Clinton and Ann Richards. He encouraged John Ashcroft to campaign in the 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries, although this was partially to ensure him as a spoiler candidate to help Bush win the race.From 1989 to 2002, Lay's political contributions totaled $5.8 million, with 73% going to Republicans, and 27% going to Democrats. From 1999 to 2001, he gave $365,410 to the Republican Party.\n\nEnron bankruptcy and trial\nLay's company, Enron, went bankrupt in 2001. At the time, this was the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. In total, 20,000 employees lost their jobs and in many cases their life savings. Investors also lost billions of dollars. On July 7, 2004, Lay was indicted by a grand jury in Houston, Texas, for his role in the company's failure. Lay was charged, in a 65-page indictment, with 11 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and making false and misleading statements. The trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling commenced on January 30, 2006, in Houston.Lay insisted that Enron's collapse was due to a conspiracy waged by short sellers, rogue executives, and the news media. On May 25, 2006, Lay was found guilty on six counts of conspiracy and fraud by the jury. In a separate bench trial, Judge Lake ruled that Lay was guilty of four additional counts of fraud and making false statements. Sentencing was scheduled for September 11, 2006, and rescheduled for October 23, 2006.\n\nDeath\nLay died on July 5, 2006, while vacationing in Colorado. The Pitkin County Sheriff's Department confirmed that officers were called to Lay's house in Snowmass, Colorado, near Aspen at 1:41 am Mountain Daylight Time. Lay was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:11 am MDT. The autopsy indicated that he died of a heart attack brought on by coronary artery disease, and found evidence that he had suffered a previous heart attack.A private funeral for about 200 people was held in Aspen four days after his death.  His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in an undisclosed location in the mountains. A memorial service was held a week after his death at the First United Methodist Church in Houston. It was attended by over 1,000 guests including George H. W. Bush and James Baker.On October 17, 2006, the conviction was overturned due to abatement ab initio, a legal doctrine which says the death of a defendant during an appeal results in a vacated judgment. The government opposed Lay's attorneys' motions of appeal. The United States Department of Justice issued a statement saying it remained committed to pursuing all available legal remedies for victims of the fraud.\n\nPersonal life\nAt the time of his death Lay had been married to his second wife, Linda, since 1982. Both Linda, and his first wife, Judith, supported Lay through the trial and made appearances at court. Kenneth Lay had two children, three stepchildren, and twelve grandchildren.\n\nSee also\nTimeline of the Enron scandal\nJeffrey Skilling\nRichard Kinder\nDavid L.

The book is written as a first-hand account of the Enron story, covering his personal experiences working at the company as well as the experiences of several unnamed associates. Released by Avalon Publishing in the United States and by Random House in Europe, it was the first major non-fiction work written about the Enron scandal.In 2003, CBS aired a television movie based on Cruver's book entitled The Crooked E: The Unshredded Truth About Enron starring Brian Dennehy, Christian Kane and Mike Farrell, directed by Penelope Spheeris, which was a ratings hit for the network.\n\nSee also\nAccounting scandals\nArthur Andersen\nPassage 7:\nTeesside power station\nTeesside Power Station is a former gas-fired power station, in Redcar & Cleveland, England. Situated near the Wilton chemical complex, the station had combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), however in 2011 the operation of the CCGT part of the station was suspended, and in 2013 the owners announced its closure and plans to demolish it. Prior to the suspension, the station had a generating capacity of 1875 megawatts (MW), making it the largest of any CCGT power station in Europe. The station could meet almost 3% of the electricity demand for England, Wales and Scotland. Opened in 1993, the station was initially operated by Enron but moved into the hands of PX Ltd after the Enron scandal of 2001, before being bought by Gaz de France and Suez in 2008. The station also worked as a cogeneration plant, providing steam for the Wilton complex.\n\nHistory\nThe power station was constructed on a 23-acre (93,000 m2) site at the Wilton chemical complex near Middlesbrough in north east England. Construction of the station began in December 1990 and took twenty nine months to complete. The main contracted construction work was undertaken by Westinghouse and Wimpey, employing a largely local workforce of 3,000. The station was commissioned in April 1993. The station was originally owned and operated by US energy company Enron.A visitor centre at the power station was opened by MP Mo Mowlam on 6 November 1998.During maintenance closure in August 2001, an explosion in one of the power station's transformers killed three workers and injured another man.After Enron's bankruptcy in 2002, the power station was sold to a management buyout. It was owned by Teesside Power Limited (TPL) and operated on behalf of its owners by PX Limited.\nIn October 2007 it was put up for sale by its private equity owners Cargill and Goldman Sachs, valued between £200 million and £300 million. On 25 February 2008 the station was acquired jointly by Gaz de France and Suez.Plans for a £500 million upgrade of the station were granted planning permission in 2008. This upgrade would have consisted of replacing the existing generating equipment with four 300 MW gas turbines and two 340 MW steam turbines. This would retain the power station's current capacity. However, with no work having begun by 2010, a five-year extension to the permission was granted in April 2010.Following a merger between GDF and International Power in 2010, the ownership of the site was shifted to the latter company.On 1 April 2011, GDF surrendered 1,830 MW of transmission entry capacity (TEC) of the station and ceased operations of the CCGT element of the plant leaving the Open Cycle gas turbine as the only available machine, leaving the station with an operating capacity of 45 MW. This was due to the low cost of energy imports and a weak market in the UK, resulting in a need to save on operating costs.\nMP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland Tom Blenkinsop also criticised the move, calling on Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne to \"see to it that the [owners] ...  are not allowed to pull the plug on this plant at this time.\" in relation to forthcoming end of the lives of UK coal and nuclear plants.The owners, GDF Suez, announced in 2013, their intention to permanently close and demolish the plant. This was completed by early 2015.In 2018, the local authority was told it had to pay £2.6m to GDF Suez due to a backdated re-evaluation of business rates for the site.\n\nSpecifications\nWith a total generating capacity of 1,875 MW, the station had the largest generating capacity of any CCGT power station in Europe, although it had been the largest in the world at the time of opening. It was able to generate enough electricity to provide 3% of England, Wales and Scotland's combined power needs. The electricity was produced by a number of generators. These were: eight 152 MW Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Westinghouse 701DA gas turbines, each fitted with a Nooter Eriksen heat recovery steam generator, with supplementary firing; two 305 MW Mitsubishi Westinghouse steam turbines; and a single 43 MW LM6000 General Electric black start gas turbine. These generators were fuelled by natural gas, propane and naphtha. As of 1 April 2011, the station was only generating 45 MW after a partial mothballing of the station.The gas fuel used in the power station was provided from a nearby gas processing plant. It was also connected to UK national gas transmission grid. Water used in the station's steam cycle was cooled by three cooling towers. Electricity generated at the station was distributed to the National Grid via 275-kilovolt (kV) substations built by ABB.As well as generating electricity, the station also produced heat in the form of 800 tonnes (880 tons) of process steam per hour for the adjacent Wilton chemical complex, and 2,000 tonnes (2,200 tons) of gas liquids per day, in the form of propane, butane and hydrocarbons.\nPassage 8:\nVincent Kaminski\nVincent Julian Kaminski was born in Poland and worked as the Managing Director for Research at the failed energy trading corporation Enron until 2002. In this capacity he led a team of approximately fifty analysts who developed quantitative models to support energy trading. In the months preceding Enron’s bankruptcy Kaminski repeatedly raised strong objections to the financial practices of Enron’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, designed to fraudulently conceal the company’s burgeoning debt.The primary practice involved hiding Enron’s debt in partnership companies managed by Fastow and financed by outside creditors. The debt was then secured against stock in the Enron Corporation itself, which was strongly valued at that time. To induce creditors to assume the risk of financing this debt certain \"trigger events\" were built into the contracts which would require immediate repayment of the full loan amount, such as the decline of the stock value used as collateral below a prearranged level. During the course of a company-wide comprehensive risk assessment Kaminski and his team of analysts pointed out that there existed many such arrangements, and if one were triggered the rest would be activated like dominoes as the stock price fell in response to the bad news, effectively ending the financial viability of the company. Kaminski’s strident opposition to these practices was one of the last chances to avert the implosion which soon followed.Dr. Kaminski holds an M.S. degree in International Economics and a Ph.D. degree in Mathematical Economics from the Main School of Planning and Statistics in Warsaw (which has since been renamed Warsaw School of Economics), and an MBA from Fordham University in New York City. He teaches at the business school of Rice University in Houston, Texas, and is the author of several books on risk management and energy trading.

Fastow was one of the key figures behind the complex web of off-balance-sheet special purpose entities (limited partnerships which Enron controlled) used to conceal Enron's massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets. By unlawfully maintaining personal stakes in these ostensibly independent ghost-entities, he was able to defraud Enron out of tens of millions of dollars.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into his and the company's conduct in 2001. Fastow was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence and ultimately served five years for convictions related to these acts. His wife, Lea Weingarten, also worked at Enron, where she was an assistant treasurer; she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy and filing fraudulent income tax returns, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison despite a plea bargain which proposed she serve five months in jail, and 5 months in home-detention.\n\nEarly life and education\nFastow was born in Washington, D.C. He grew up in New Providence, New Jersey, the son of middle class Jewish parents, Carl and Joan Fastow, who worked in retail and merchandising. Fastow graduated from New Providence High School, where he took part in student government, played on the tennis team, and played in the school band. He was the sole student representative on the New Jersey State Board of Education.Fastow graduated from Tufts University in 1983 with a B.A. in Economics and Chinese. While there, he met his future wife, Lea Weingarten, daughter of Miriam Hadar Weingarten (a former Miss Israel 1958), whom he married in 1984. Fastow and Weingarten both earned MBAs at Northwestern University and worked for Continental Illinois bank in Chicago. Both he and his wife attended Congregation Or Ami, a conservative synagogue in Houston where he taught Hebrew School.\n\nEarly career\nWhile at Continental, Fastow worked on the newly emerging \"asset-backed securities\". The practice spread across the industry \"because it provides an obvious advantage for a bank\", noted the Chicago Tribune. \"It moves assets off the bank's balance sheet while creating revenue.\" In 1984, Continental became the largest U.S. bank to fail in American history until the seizure of Washington Mutual in 2008.Due to his work at Continental, Fastow was hired in 1990 by Jeffrey Skilling at the Enron Finance Corp. Fastow was named the chief financial officer at Enron in 1998.\n\nRise in Enron\nDeregulation in the US energy markets in the late 1990s provided Enron with trade opportunities, including buying energy from cheap producers and selling it at markets with floating prices. Andrew Fastow was familiar with the market and knowledgeable in how to play it in Enron's favor. This quickly drew the attention of then chief executive officer of Enron Finance Corp Jeffrey Skilling. Skilling, together with Enron founder Kenneth Lay, was constantly concerned with various ways in which he could keep company stock price up, in spite of the true financial condition of the company.\nFastow designed a complex web of companies that solely did business with Enron, with the dual purpose of raising money for the company, and also hiding its massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets.  This effectively allowed Enron's audited balance sheet to appear debt free, while in reality it owed more than 30 billion dollars at the height of its debt.  While presented to the outside world as being independent entities, the funds Fastow created were to take write-downs off Enron's books and guaranteed not to lose money. Yet, Fastow himself had a personal financial stake in these funds, either directly or through partners amongst them Michael Kopper.\nKopper, Fastow's chief lieutenant, pleaded guilty to taking part in a scam with Fastow that defrauded Enron shareholders of many millions. While defrauding Enron in this way, Fastow was also neglecting basic financial practices such as reporting the \"cash on hand\" and total liabilities. Fastow pressured some of the largest investment banks in the United States, such as Merrill Lynch, Citibank, and others to invest in his funds, threatening to cause them to lose Enron's future business if they did not.\n\nCollapse\nIn August, Skilling, who had been promoted to CEO of the entire company in February 2001, abruptly resigned after only six months, citing personal reasons. When reporters for The Wall Street Journal discovered an Enron \"senior officer\" had recently sold his interest in several partnerships that had done business with Enron, they initially thought that officer was Skilling. However, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer revealed that the \"senior officer\" was actually Fastow.After a former Enron executive leaked a copy of the offering memorandum for one of Fastow's partnerships, LJM–named for Fastow's wife and two sons–to the Journal, reporters bombarded Enron with further questions about the partnerships. The scrutiny died down after the September 11 attacks, but ramped up anew two weeks later with pointed questions about how much Fastow had earned from LJM. This culminated in a series of stories that appeared in the Journal in mid-October detailing the \"vexing conflict-of-interest questions\" about the partnerships, as well as the huge windfall he had reaped from them.On October 23, during a conference call with two directors delegated by the board, Fastow revealed that he had made a total of $45 million from his work with LJM–a staggering total, since he claimed to spend no more than three hours a week on LJM work. On October 24, several banks told Enron that they would not issue loans to the company as long as Fastow remained CFO. The combined weight of these revelations led the board to accept Lay's recommendation to remove Fastow as CFO on October 25, replacing him with industrial markets chief and former treasurer Jeff McMahon. He was officially placed on leave of absence, though the board subsequently determined that it had grounds to fire him for cause.It was later revealed that Fastow had been so focused on creating SPEs that he had neglected the most rudimentary aspects of corporate finance. Under his watch, Enron merely operated on a quarterly basis. Fastow never implemented procedures for tracking the company's cash or debt maturities. As a result, McMahon and a \"financial SWAT team\" put together in the wake of Fastow's ouster discovered Enron had almost no liquidity.Fastow's approach to hiding losses was so effective that the year before Enron declared bankruptcy, the Enron stock was at an all-time high of $90. As it turned out, the company was already well on its way to financial collapse, to the point that it was all but forced to seek a merger with rival Dynegy. By then, Enron's financial picture had declined so rapidly that the prospect of the Dynegy merger was the only thing keeping it alive. Dynegy tore up the merger agreement on November 28 in part due to the liquidity problems revealed after Fastow's ouster, and Enron declared bankruptcy three days later. By then, Enron's stock had dwindled to 40 cents per share, but not before many employees had been told to invest their retirement savings in Enron stock.\n\nLegal problems at Enron\nOn October 31, 2002, Fastow was indicted by a federal grand jury in Houston, Texas, on 78 counts, including fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy.  On January 14, 2004, he pleaded guilty to two counts of wire and securities fraud, and agreed to serve a ten-year prison sentence. He also agreed to become an informant and cooperate with federal authorities in the prosecutions of other former Enron executives in order to receive a reduced sentence.Prosecutors were so impressed with his performance that they ultimately lobbied for an even shorter sentence for Fastow.  He was finally sentenced to six years at Oakdale Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, Louisiana. On May 18, 2011, Fastow was released to a Houston halfway house for the remainder of his sentence.\nOn May 6, 2004, his wife, Lea Fastow, a former Enron assistant treasurer, pleaded guilty to a tax charge and was sentenced to one year in a federal prison in Houston, and an additional year of supervised release. She was released to a halfway house on July 8, 2005.\n\nSentencing and incarceration\nAfter entering into a plea agreement with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and the forfeiture of $23.8 million in assets, on September 26, 2006, Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison, followed by two years of probation. U.S. District Judge Ken Hoyt believed Fastow deserved leniency for his cooperation with the prosecution in several civil and criminal trials involving former Enron employees. Hoyt recommended that Fastow's sentence be served at the low-security Federal Correctional Institution in Bastrop, Texas. Fastow was incarcerated at the Federal Prison Camp near Pollock, Louisiana.\n\nLife after incarceration\nSoon after his release on December 16, 2011, he began working as a document review clerk for law firm Smyser Kaplan Veselka LLP in Houston.\n\nSpeaking engagements\nSince his release, Fastow has worked the public speaking circuit with presentations on ethics and business. In one such speech, Fastow recounts his crimes at Enron and reflects on his guilt:“I found every way I could to technically comply with the [accounting] rules... But what I did was unethical and unprincipled. And it caused harm to people. For that, I deserved to go to prison.”In March 2012, Fastow spoke on ethics to students at the University of Colorado Boulder Leeds School of Business.\nIn June 2013, Fastow addressed more than 2,000 anti-fraud professionals at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners' 24th Annual ACFE Global Fraud Conference.\nIn April 2014, Fastow spoke at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, regarding business ethics.In February 2015, he spoke at:\nthe University of St. Thomas,\nthe University of Minnesota,\nthe University of Texas (Austin campus),\nthe University of Houston Bauer College of Business,\nthe University of Southern California's Leventhal School of Accounting, and\nthe University of Missouri School of Accounting.\nIn April 2016, March 2017, March 2018, and March 2019 Fastow spoke at the Ivey Business School. The University of Tampa's Center for Ethics hosted him in October 2017. In March 2022 the National Investor Relations Institute  New York Chapter hosted Fastow as guest speaker for a discussion on business ethics, and the ambiguity and complexity of laws and regulations.\n\nInvestment in KeenCorp\nFastow became principal and investor in KeenCorp in 2016. KeenCorp is a Netherlands-based company that offers analytics and artificial intelligence products that monitor \"day-to-day workflow: E-mails, Microsoft Teams chats, Google Suite, and Slack\" in order to analyze employee sentiment and engagement.\nOriginally, Fastow connected with KeenCorp when the company was beta testing its software using a digital database of Enron emails.\n\nIn the media\nA number of books have been written about Enron and Fastow.\nIn 2003, Fastow was a prominent figure in 24 Days: How Two Wall Street Journal Reporters Uncovered the Lies that Destroyed Faith in Corporate America by the reporters who had broken some of the key stories in the saga, Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller. They painted Fastow as in their words \"a screamer, who negotiated by intimidation and tirade\".\nAlso in 2003, Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind wrote the book The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron ISBN 1-59184-008-2. In 2005, the book was made into a documentary film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.\nIn 2005, Kurt Eichenwald's Conspiracy of Fools features Fastow as the book's antagonist.In 2009, Lucy Prebble's play Enron featured Fastow as a lead character.", "answers": ["independent ghost-entities"], "length": 7110, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a96ab885a132aad0f22735dad044516f01929c6be656b11a"}

He was the first Bellator Heavyweight World Champion.\n\nAmateur wrestling career\nHigh school\nAfter transferring from New London High School in New London, Wisconsin to Freedom High School in Freedom, Wisconsin. Konrad compiled a 101–15 record and won the 2002 Wisconsin state championship. He was listed as a first team high school All-American at 275 pounds by both the Amateur Wrestling News and Wrestling USA Magazine. During his high school career, Konrad also excelled at freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling. He won the 2002 Junior National Championships in both styles.\n\nCollegiate\nKonrad wrestled at the University of Minnesota where he won two NCAA titles. The first came during an undefeated junior season of 2006 and he followed that up with another undefeated, title winning performance in 2007. His overall collegiate record finished at 155–13, with 10 of those losses coming during his freshman season.\nKonrad gained notoriety in wrestling through his rivalry with Steve Mocco. Mocco is a two time NCAA champion for Oklahoma State and Iowa. As Mocco attempted to win his third NCAA title during the 2006 season, Konrad beat Mocco a total of three times including a pin at the National Duals and a 5–2 victory in the NCAA title match. Konrad is the all-time Minnesota record holder for consecutive wins with 76. He recorded a pin in his final collegiate match over Penn State wrestler Aaron Anspach.\n\nInternational\nWhile concentrating on collegiate wrestling, Konrad has managed to develop a strong international record as well. In 2005 he won a gold medal at the Pan American Championships in Guatemala City, Guatemala and finished third at the U.S. World Team Trials.

Konrad won the Heavyweight tournament final and became the first Bellator heavyweight champion at Bellator 32 with an Americana submission in round 1 against Neil Grove. \nIn 2011 Konrad won a non-title decision over Paul Buentello.  This fight surprised most observers, as it was contested entirely standing, unlike most Konrad matches.  More than 18 months after winning the title, Konrad finally had his first official title defense, against Season Five Tournament Winner Eric Prindle, another opponent known primarily for his striking.  This time, Konrad took the fight to the ground quickly and dispatched Prindle within a minute.

A professional competitor since 2011, Rosholt has competed for the UFC, Titan FC, Professional Fighters League, and Legacy FC. He is the younger brother of former mixed martial artist Jake Rosholt.\n\nBackground\nRosholt was born and raised in Sandpoint, Idaho, attending Sandpoint High School before moving to Oklahoma his junior year where he attended Ponca City High School. Rosholt competed in wrestling as well as football. In wrestling, Rosholt was a member of Wrestling USA Magazine's 2005 All-America Dream Team, a four-time State Champion, and a two-time national runner-up. Rosholt continued wrestling at Oklahoma State University, following in the footsteps of his older brother, Jake, a three-time National Champion for the Cowboys. Jared Rosholt went on to be a three-time All-American and finished his collegiate career with an overall record of 125-27. That record qualified him as the winningest heavyweight in the history of the Oklahoma State wrestling program. His 125 wins also qualify as the fifth-most victories by a wrestler in any weight class in Oklahoma State history. Rosholt finished fourth in his division at the 2008 NCAA wrestling championships, third in 2009, and second in 2010. Rosholt's combination of size and speed had many wondering if he would follow the lead of his older brother Jake into MMA competition.\n\nMixed martial arts career\nEarly career\nRosholt made his professional mixed martial arts debut on February 26, 2011, where he won by submission (punches) in just 1:17 of the first round.\n\nTitan Fighting\nRosholt came to fight on two days notice as a replacement to fight at Titan FC 18: Pulver vs. Davidson against Kirk Grinlinton.

After this, he rebounded against Nick Rossborough on July 29, 2017, with a unanimous decision victory at Professional Fighters League 2: Everett. In the following year, on June 7, he scored another win over Valdrin Istrefi with a unanimous decision at PFL 1. However, his winning streak ended on July 19, when he was defeated by Kelvin Tiller via a guillotine choke at PFL 4. He made a comeback and defeated the same opponent, Kelvin Tiller, with a unanimous decision in a 2018 PFL Heavyweight Quarterfinal bout. Yet, his journey saw another defeat, this time by Philipe Lins, who won via TKO stoppage at PFL 8 on October 5, 2018.\nThe year 2019 started with a loss to Denis Goltsov on June 6 in PFL 3, where he lost via TKO stoppage in the first round. However, he bounced back with a win against Satoshi Ishii on August 8 in PFL 6, which was decided unanimously. The winning streak continued as he defeated Muhammed Dereese with a TKO (punches) in a 2019 PFL Heavyweight Quarterfinal bout. He also emerged victorious against Kelvin Tiller, who replaced the injured Francimar Barroso, with a unanimous decision in a 2019 PFL Heavyweight Semifinal bout on October 31, 2019, at PFL 9.

He is in both the U.S. amateur wrestling Hall of Fame, for his three NCAA titles and Olympic silver medal, and the pro wrestling Hall of Fame, as a seven-time NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion. The Dan Hodge Trophy is the college wrestling equivalent of the Heisman Trophy. \nHodge was born and raised in Perry, Oklahoma, where he continued to live. He was famous for the ability to crush apples with one hand, a feat which he demonstrated live on ESPN during the 2006 NCAA Wrestling Championships. He said his strength was due to having double tendons in his hands.\n\nEarly life\nDaniel Allen Hodge was born and raised in Perry, Oklahoma, the son of an alcoholic father and a mother who dealt with severe depression. His home burned down when he was 9, and his mother suffered severe burns over 70 percent of her body, necessitating 52 blood transfusions. Hodge was raised by his grandfather, who drank a lot and beat Hodge frequently. He also worked at a Conoco gas station.\n\nAmateur wrestling career\nHodge started wrestling by the age of 13. At Perry High School in Oklahoma, Hodge won the 165-pound title at the state tournament in 1951. As a collegiate wrestler for the University of Oklahoma, Hodge was undefeated at 46–0, with 36 pins and reportedly was never taken off his feet during his collegiate career. He was a three-time Big Seven conference champ at 177 pounds (1955–1957), and won the 177-pound title at the NCAA championships those same three years, pinning all three of his finals opponents. In addition to his collegiate wrestling career, Hodge also won three Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) national championships in freestyle wrestling, as well as winning one in Greco-Roman wrestling in 1956 at 174 pounds. He was the first amateur wrestler to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated.\nHis reputation as a high school wrestler preceded him when he joined the US Navy in 1951. At Ames, Iowa, in April 1952, Hodge survived the US Olympic Trials, and was coached by Naval Academy Instructor Ray Swartz in the 174-pound division. Hodge finished outside the top seven in the Helsinki Olympics freestyle middleweight, losing two of his three bouts. Going into May 1956 wrestling trials for the US Olympic team, Hodge was the middleweight favorite. He was eliminated on May 2 by William Smith, who was embroiled in controversy with the Central AAU. At the Melbourne Olympics freestyle middleweight, he won the silver medal, losing the final to Bulgarian Nikola Stanchev.The Dan Hodge Trophy, named after him, is the college wrestling equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nTrained by Leroy McGuirk and Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis, Hodge made his debut as a professional wrestler on October 9, 1959. Hodge's first major feud was with National Wrestling Alliance Junior Heavyweight Champion Angelo Savoldi. Hodge's father entered the ring during a boxing match on May 27, 1960, between Hodge and Savoldi, and stabbed Savoldi with a penknife. Savoldi required 70 stitches at a local hospital, while Hodge's father was arrested. On July 22, 1960, Hodge defeated Savoldi for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship at the Stockyards Coliseum in Oklahoma City. Hodge became McGuirk's principal headliner, and by 1962, Hodge was making upwards of $80,000 a year.Hodge was a perennial NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, holding the title eight times for a total of over ten years, longer than anyone else. After holding the title for over four years, he eventually dropped the title to longtime rival Hiro Matsuda. Six months later, he defeated Matsuda to regain the title. He held the belt for several months until he lost it to Lorenzo Parente; they both continuously lost and regained the title in the span of a year during their feud. After Parente lost the belt to Hodge again, Hodge held the belt for another four months until eventually losing it to Sputnik Monroe on July 13, 1970. Once again regaining the title a few months later, Hodge found himself as an ex-champion again when he eventually faced Roger Kirby. He was separated from the title until he defeated Dr. X, who was holding the title, and Hodge held his title once again for two more years before being upset by Ken Mantell on December 19, 1973. Mantell eventually lost the title to Hiro Matsuda, Hodge's rival; Hodge defeated him for the championship on March 2, 1976.On March 15, 1976, after wrestling that evening in Houma, Hodge was driving his car when he fell asleep at the wheel causing him to crash through a bridge and into a lake. The car flipped, and the crash broke his neck and shattered his teeth upon impact. Hodge was able to escape by punching out his car window and safely swimming back to shore. He was then transported to a hospital, and the injuries sustained in the accident caused his retirement from professional wrestling. On September 1, 1983, Hodge returned to the ring, facing against SWCW USA Junior Heavyweight Champion Eric Embry, which Embry won.In 2007, Hodge was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. He made appearances in WWE on Raw in 2005 and 2012 in which he honored his close friends and fellow Oklahoman Jim Ross. WWE Hall of Famer and seven-time world champion Bret Hart has referred to Hodge as \"one of the greatest wrestlers in pro wrestling or amateur wrestling there’s ever been\", and described being in the same room as Hodge at the 2008 National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum's award ceremony as \"a big, big honor for me\".\n\nBoxing career\nDanny won the 1958 Chicago Golden Gloves at Heavyweight, then won a Chicago Intercity bout in October, beating Charley Hood. He finished his amateur career with 17 wins, no losses and 12 KO's. Convinced by boxing manager Art Freeman that he was a better prospect than Rocky Marciano, Hodge decided to become a professional boxer rather than pursue the opportunity to compete as a boxer and a wrestler at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. In his professional boxing debut, he scored a first-round knockout victory over Norm Jackson. As a professional, he had a reported record of 8–2, although only 7 wins have been documented.  He retired on July 9, 1959.\n\nPersonal life\nHodge and his wife, Dolores, had three children.On March 29, 2005, Hodge was honored by Oklahoma state lawmakers as an \"Oklahoma Sports Hero\". He served as chairman of the Oklahoma Professional Boxing Commission, which regulates professional boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts in Oklahoma. There is a statue in his honor at the Perry Wrestling Monument Park in Oklahoma.\n\nDeath\nHodge died at the age of 88 on December 24, 2020, and had been suffering from dementia.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nCauliflower Alley Club\nArt Abrams Lifetime Achievement Award (2004)\nLou Thesz Award (2007)\nOther honoree (1998)\nGeorge Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2000\nInternational Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2021\nJapan Wrestling Association\nNWA International Tag Team Championship – with Wilbur Snyder\nNational Wrestling Hall of Fame\nDistinguished Member (class of 1976)\nNational Wrestling Alliance\nNWA Hall of Fame (class of 2010)\nNWA Mid-America\nNWA United States Tag Team Championship (Mid-America Version) (1 time) – with Lester Welch\nTrans-World Wrestling Association\nTWWA Championship (1 time)\nNWA Tri-State\nNWA North American Heavyweight Championship (Tri-State version) (3 times)\nNWA United States Tag Team Championship (Tri-State version) (5 times) – with Skandor Akbar (2), Lorenzo Parente (1), Luke Brown (1), and Jay Clayton (1)\nNWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (7 times)\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI Stanley Weston Award (1996)\nProfessional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum\nClass of 2007\nWrestling Observer Newsletter\nWrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996)\nPassage 7:\nMinnesota Golden Gophers wrestling\nThe Minnesota Golden Gophers are a Division I college wrestling team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The fire was ignited by an electric chandelier in the meeting room, the forerunner of Jesse Auditorium, during a debate.\nThe \"New Academic Hall\", just south of the columns, was completed in 1895 at a cost of $250,000. In 1922, the hall was renamed in honor of former University president Richard Henry Jesse.\nIn 1932, a tornado ripped through Columbia and caused significant damage to the building.  In 1982, a severe storm damaged Jesse Hall, resulting in renovations that included a new ball and new slate on the dome, tempered windows, reinforced beams, and a new paint job. The renovations cost roughly $390,000 and were paid for by state funds.  On April 23, 1991, an arson fire caused $350,000-$500,000 in damage to the building.\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is one of the most distinctive on the campus; the dome stands 9 stories above the ground, and is taller than the building it stands on.  It was designed by Morris Frederick Bell and fashioned after Richard M. Upjohn's Connecticut State House of 1872-1878.  The dome was first lit in October 1987 to commemorate MU's sesquicentennial celebration.  It is normally illuminated at night by bright white lights, but its color is changed to gold for Homecoming and green for Engineers' Week each March.\nA winged sphere originally surmounted the dome.  The wings broke from the sphere when an individual fastened the staff of a large American flag to the topmost part of the dome.  The winged sphere lives on as the symbol of the secret society QEBH. William Lincoln Garver was assistant architect and superintendent of construction.\n\nJesse Auditorium\nThe original entrance to the auditorium was from the quad on the north side.  It originally seated 1,200 people, but after being proclaimed a fire hazard the wooden balcony was removed, reducing capacity to only 400.  A complete renovation of the auditorium was carried out in 1953 with a design by Jamieson and Spearl, and today it seats 1,732.  Many great talents have graced the stage at Jesse.  William Jennings Bryan gave his famous \"Pending Problems\" lecture there in 1900.  Today, the University Concert Series books events such as touring Broadway shows, symphony orchestras, singers, and comedians from around the world.\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nUniversity of Maine\nThe University of Maine (UMaine) is a public land-grant research university in Orono, Maine. It was established in 1865 as the land-grant college of Maine and is the flagship university of the University of Maine System. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".With an enrollment of approximately 11,500 students, UMaine is the state's largest college or university. The University of Maine's athletic teams, nicknamed the Black Bears, are Maine's only Division I athletics program. Maine's men's ice hockey team has won two national championships.\n\nHistory\nThe University of Maine was founded in 1862 as a function of the Morrill Act, signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Established in 1865 as the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the college opened on September 21, 1868, and changed its name to the University of Maine in 1897.By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master's degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor's degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, the university expanded its curriculum to place greater emphasis on liberal arts. As a result of this shift, faculty hired during the early 20th century included Caroline Colvin, chair of the history department and the nation's first woman to head a major university department.In 1906, The Senior Skull Honor Society was founded to \"publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community.\"On April 16, 1925, 80 women met in Balentine Hall — faculty, alumnae, and undergraduate representatives — to plan a pledging of members to an inaugural honorary organization. This organization was called \"The All Maine Women\" because only those women closely connected with the University of Maine were elected as members. On April 22, 1925, the new members were inducted into the honor society.When the University of Maine System was incorporated, in 1968, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono (known informally as \"U.M.O.\"). This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986, when the \"U.M.O.\" moniker was also abandoned and replaced officially with \"UMaine\" as the informal title with which to reference the Orono campus.\n\nOrganization and administration\nThe University of Maine is the flagship of the University of Maine System. The president of the university is Joan Ferrini-Mundy. The senior administration governs cooperatively with the chancellor of the University of Maine system, Dannel Malloy, and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the governor of Maine and one is the current Maine state commissioner of education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the chancellor and each university president, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates and operating budgets.UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated. Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987. It is classified as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation. It consists of a legislative branch, which passes resolutions, and an executive branch, which helps organize on-campus entertainment and guest speakers, works with new and existing student organizations, and performs other duties. Other organizations fall under the umbrella of Student Government Inc., including representative boards, community associations, and many other student groups. The Maine Campus, the student newspaper, is also incorporated and does not operate under or receive money from student government.\n\nCampus\nLocation and layout\nSituated on Marsh Island, between the Penobscot and Stillwater rivers, the University of Maine is the nation's only land grant university (other than the University of Hawaiʻi) on an island. Occupying the small city of Orono, population ~9,500, the 660-acre (2.7 km2) campus has an enrollment (2012–2013) of 10,901 students. The campus has thirty-seven academic buildings, thirty administrative buildings, eighteen residence halls, eighteen specific laboratory facilities, fourteen Greek life houses, ten sports facilities, five museums, three dining facilities, two convenience stores, a student union, a cafe, a pub, an 87,000-square-foot (8,100 m2) state of the art recreation and fitness center, and a 200'x200' air supported athletic/recreational dome.In 1867, the university rejected a campus plan by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City and the White House grounds in Washington, D.C. The plan's broad concepts, including the Front Lawn, were nevertheless adopted during the school's first fifty years, and were oriented toward the Stillwater River. A second master plan was produced in 1932 by Carl Rust Parker of the Olmsted Brothers firm, which reoriented the campus center to the Mall, an open grassy area between the Raymond H. Fogler Library and the Memorial Gym. The Mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls.\nThe campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop), all of which are near or border the Mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the Alfond Arena (basketball, hockey), Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium (football, track and field), Larry Mahaney Diamond (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), the Field Hockey Complex (field hockey), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings on the northern section include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls.\nThe southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the Maynard F. Jordan Observatory, Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls. The recently renovated Collins Center for the Arts is also on the southern part of campus, and not only provides the Hutchins Concert Hall, a 1,435-seat venue for performing artists from around the world, but also houses the Hudson Museum, known for its contemporary Native American art, as well as displays that are culturally specific to the indigenous people of Maine. The Hilltop section of campus is populated largely with residence halls but also includes the 7-acre (2.8 ha) Lyle E. Littlefield Ornamental Gardens, as well as academic and recreational facilities. The campus is also designated as an arboretum.The pre-1915 core of the campus, covering its earliest period of development, was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978; this was expanded to include the second major phase of development (through the end of World War II) in 2010.\n\nAmbulance Service\nThe University of Maine operates the \"University Volunteer Ambulance Corps,\" an Ambulance service fully licensed by the State of Maine. The service is operated by students and staff of the university. UVAC's ambulances are available to respond to emergencies on campus and can also provide mutual aid to many surrounding towns and agencies. The service ensures a licensed Emergency Medical Technician is sent on every call. The service has two ambulances both equipped to provide Paramedic Level care. UVAC responds to approximately 500 calls per school year.\n\nGreek life\nGreek life has existed at the University of Maine since 1874. Approximately 14% of University of Maine undergraduates are members of Greek letter organizations.\n\nFraternities\nSororities\nSustainability\nThe University of Maine is one of 16 colleges and universities listed in Princeton Review's \"Green Honor Roll\" (2011). Several of the nation's leading research universities, including Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, Oregon State, Arizona State and the University of Washington are also on that prestigious list, as are Harvard and Northeastern. Recognizing schools for their commitment to sustainability, the Green Honor Roll lists only those 16 institutions that received the highest possible score on The Princeton Review green rating. The guide lauds UMaine for its recycling programs, green-certified buildings and free shuttle bus service. It also notes the fact UMaine has a sustainability coordinator, a sustainability council, and \"Eco Reps\" in its residence halls.University of Maine has a sustainability council made up of students, faculty, administrators, staff and a full-time sustainability coordinator. A green loan fund provides capital for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. The university has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, and two residential-scale solar thermal systems are in place on Nutting Hall and Sebec House. The University of Maine composts food scraps from dining facilities, and York Dining Hall has gone trayless to reduce waste. For all new campus construction, LEED Silver standards are required. The Blue Bike program refurbishes abandoned bikes and rents them to students free of charge, providing a means of alternative transportation on and around-campus.\n\nDining services\nIn 2022, the university signed a contract to outsource campus dining services to Sodexo beginning on July 1, 2023.  Sodexo provides food service at Maine's six other public universities. The deal requires Sodexo to pay the university a $3 million signing bonus and invest $7 million in dining hall improvements.\n\nAcademics\nThe University of Maine offers more than 90 undergraduate major programs organized in five colleges: the College of Education and Human Development; the College of Engineering; the Honors College; the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; and the College of Natural Sciences, Forestry and Agriculture. UMaine also is home to one of the nation's oldest honors programs, now called the Honors College. The Honors College offers academically qualified students an opportunity for intensive, interdisciplinary study. Students are invited to become part of the Honors College during the admissions review process. UMaine also offers a wide array of graduate programs, including more than seventy master's degree programs and thirty doctorate programs.\n\nThe University of Maine is one of only a handful of institutions to offer a combined developmental/clinical PhD to students accepted into their clinical psychology PhD program, as well as advanced degrees with distinct concentrations in developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and behavioral neuroscience. The University of Maine has a strong commitment to developing the next generation of neuroscience researchers and educators, thus along with offering a PhD in psychological science with a concentration in behavioral neuroscience, they also offer a neuroscience concentration for PhD students studying biomedical science.It is the only institution in Maine ranked as a national university in the U.S. News & World Report annual rankings. U.S. News categorizes UMaine as an institution that offers \"a full range of undergraduate majors, master's, and doctoral degrees.\"UMaine is one of only four institutions in Maine (along with Bowdoin, Bates, and Colby) accredited to award membership into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.The university is also the birthplace of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society, recognizing high academic achievement across all disciplines.The Raymond H. Fogler Library is the largest in Maine and serves as one of its intellectual hubs, attracting scholars, professors, and researchers from around the state. A collection of rare and ancient manuscripts, as well as about two million government publications, augment the university's collection. The Special Collections Unit includes the Stephen King (author and UMaine alumnus) papers, which attract researchers from across the globe.\nUMaine hosts the Intensive English Institute, an English as a second language program designed to help students develop their English language skills for success in school, business, and social communication. Due to budget cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic, the IEI was discontinued as of May 31, 2020.The University of Maine is also home to the Maine Business School, the largest business school in the state. Paris-based international educational consulting organization Eduniversal has included the Maine Business School at the University of Maine among its selection of 1,000 of the world's best business schools, ranking it as an \"excellent business school-nationally strong and/or with continental links.\" In 2011, U.S. News & World Report ranked the Maine Business School among the nation's best business collegesThe Canadian-American Center, an institution that focuses on Canadian-American studies is based at the University of Maine.\n\nAccreditation\nThe University of Maine is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education, and programmatically accredited by other accreditors including the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, the American Chemical Society, the American Dietetic Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, the Council on Social Work Education, the National Association of Schools of Music, the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, the Council for the advancement of Educator Preparation, the Society of American Foresters, and the Society of Wood Science and Technology.\n\nAdmissions\nThe fall 2018 admissions data are as follows:\n\nEnrollment\nIn the fall of 2020, the university's enrollment consisted of:\n8,870 undergraduate degree-seeking students\n595 undergraduate non-degree students\n2,121 graduate degree-seeking students\n155 graduate non-degree students\n9,110 full-time students\n2,631 part-time students\n\nResearch\nThe University of Maine is one of the National Science Foundation's top 100 public universities for research. In FY10, UMaine exceeded $100 million in external expenditures for research, 86% of which was federal funding. Leading sectors of the university in generating external support are advanced materials, marine sciences, climate change, environmental studies, forestry, precision manufacturing, and aquaculture. Undergraduate research is a priority at UMaine, and in 2008, the Center for Undergraduate Research was established to connect students with faculty projects that suit their interests.The University of Maine has several research areas that operate as independent units under the umbrella of the University of Maine. While these units house and fund faculty, staff, and students from a variety of academic backgrounds and colleges, the research units are independent of the traditional departmental and college structure.\nIndependent research units at the University of Maine include:\n\nUMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center\nThe UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center, founded in 1996 with support from the National Science Foundation, provides research, education, and economic development encompassing material sciences, manufacturing and engineering of composites and structures. The center's research and development projects have included the VolturnUS 1:8, composite arch bridge system, and the Modular Ballistic Protection System (MBPS).\nThe center is the leading member of the DeepCwind Consortium, whose mission is to establish the State of Maine as a national leader in deepwater offshore wind technology.\n\nMultisensory Interactive Media Lab\nFounded in 2018, the Multisensory Interactive Media Lab (MIM Lab) is moving into an era of ‘Internet of Everything,’ in which everything and everyone will be digitally embedded and connected. In the MIM Lab of the University of Maine, academic researchers develop novel enabling technologies to explore the immense potential for the communication of our experiences – shifting focus from the current age of information towards a new age of experience. Many of their research works try to answer a fundamental question “How can we move beyond traditional visual- and auditory-based digital interfaces to form immersive sensory rich interactions in the context of real-world, augmented or virtual experiences?”.\n\nUMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site at Monhegan Island\nThe University of Maine was granted an ocean energy demonstration site through state legislation in 2009. The site, known as the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, is available for use by commercial and non-commercial entities in partnership with the university to research and develop ocean energy devices, such as floating wind turbines or wave energy converters.\n\nForest Land Resources\nThe University of Maine is responsible for over 14,000 acres (5,700 ha) of land across Maine which is used for research and recreation. Among the most prominent are: Aroostook Farm, (Presque Isle, Maine); Bear Brook Watershed, (Hancock County, Maine); Dwight B. Demeritt Forest, (Orono, Maine / Old Town, Maine); Fay Hyland Bog, (Orono / Veazie, Maine); and Hirundo Wildlife Refuge, (Old Town, Maine).\n\nBureau of Labor Education\nThe Bureau of Labor Education at the University of Maine in August 1966 with funds appropriated by the Maine Legislature. Its mission is to ensure that “appropriate and specialized educational programs (be made) available to members of the Maine labor force, both organized and unorganized.” Historian Charles Scontras has been affiliated with the BLE since its founding with his first book being published also in 1966.\n\nThe Largest 3D Printer in the World\nThe University of Maine built the world's largest 3D printer, which resulted in two more broken records for the largest 3D printed vessel and the largest 3D printed house.\n\nClimate Change Institute\nThe University of Maine Climate Change Institute dates to 1973 and the founding of the Institute for Quaternary Studies. In 2002, it was renamed. Polar explorer, climate scientist, and glaciologist Paul Mayewski is the institute's director. \nThe institute has made numerous scientific discoveries, including mapping the difference between climate during the Ice Age and during modern times, connecting acid rain to human causes in the 1980s, and finding that the climate can change abruptly through analysis of ice core samples from Greenland.The institute maintains the Climate Reanalyze, a computer model based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite data. The project makes available online visualizations of daily mean sea surface temperatures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAthletics\nThe University of Maine participates in the NCAA's Division I level, and is a member of the Colonial Athletic Association for football, Hockey East for ice hockey, and the America East Conference for all other sports. The school has won two national championships, both in men's ice hockey. In 1993, they defeated Lake Superior State University 5–4 behind a third period hat trick by Jim Montgomery. In 1999, they defeated rival University of New Hampshire 3–2 in overtime on a goal by Marcus Gustafsson.In 1965, the football team competed in the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida against East Carolina. They were beaten in the game 31–0, but remain the only team from Maine to compete in a bowl contest. In the 2018 season they went to the FCS Semifinal, eventually losing to Eastern Washington.\nThe baseball team has participated in seven College World Series, six of them under coach John Winkin between 1976 and 1986, and one under Jack Butterfield in 1964. The Black Bears achieved two third-place finishes in 1964 and 1982.\nAlthough the official fight song of UMaine is \"For Maine\", the school's main spirit song is the better-known \"Maine Stein Song\". Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when singer Rudy Vallée arranged the current version. Vallee attended Maine from 1921 to 1922 before transferring to Yale, and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite. To this day, the \"Stein Song\" remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology, by Studwell and Schueneman, the \"Stein Song\" is one of the very best fight songs of all time.In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through its Campus Recreation department. Sport clubs represent UMaine by competing against teams and clubs from other universities and colleges. National governing bodies for each club provide competition guidelines and league structure.\nSport clubs are student-led and student-administered. Each has a budget that is run through Campus Recreation, which in part funds nearly all clubs. Clubs are eligible for funding through Campus Recreation after they have been active for at least one year and have a membership minimum of ten members. Current club sports include alpine skiing, baseball, crew, cricket, cycling, fastpitch softball, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, Nordic skiing, roller hockey, rugby, shotokan karate, soccer, tennis, table tennis, tackle football, ultimate, and volleyball.\n\nNotable alumni\nSee also\nUniversity of Maine School of Law\nPassage 4:\nRob Koll\nRob Koll is an American college wrestling coach.  He is currently head wrestling coach at Stanford University.  He is the son of Wrestling Hall of Fame member and three-time NCAA wrestling champion Bill Koll.\n\nWrestling career\nAs a wrestler for the University of North Carolina, Koll was a four-time All American, three-time ACC champion, and the 1988 NCAA champion at 158 pounds. After college, he competed internationally in freestyle wrestling. In 1989 he won the Pan-Am Games and was runner-up at the Olympic Festival; he won the U.S. national freestyle championship in 1990 and 1991; took first in the 1990 and 1993 World Cup; placed fifth in the 1991 World Championships; won the 1992 World Cup Grand Prix; and was the alternate for the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nCoaching career\nKoll joined Cornell University as an assistant wrestling coach in 1989.  He became head wrestling coach at the school in 1993.  He led Cornell to six top-five finishes in the NCAA Division I wrestling tournament, including second-place finishes in 2010 and 2011.  The 2010 and 2011 finishes were the best ever for an Ivy League team. The 2011 team was ranked first for much of the season, but lost in the NCAA tournament to Penn State, which surged under its coach Cael Sanderson, who was in his second year at Penn State.  Koll has coached NCAA champions Yianni Diakomihalis (2018 (141)), Gabe Dean (2015 (184) & 2016 (184)), Nahshon Garrett (2016 (133)), Kyle Dake (2010 (141), 2011 (149), 2012 (157) & 2013 (165)), Steve Bosak (2012 (184)), Cam Simaz (2012 (197)), Troy Nickerson (2009 (125)),  Jordan Leen (2008 (157)), Travis Lee (2003 (125) & 2005 (133)), and David Hirsch (1994 (126)). Koll has been won multiple coaching awards including Ivy League Coach of the Year (2015, 2016, 2017) and EIWA Coach of the Year (2007, 2010, 2011, 2017) and NWCA National Coach of the Year (2005).\nHe became head wrestling coach at Stanford University in 2021.\n\nPersonal life\nRob Koll was raised in State College, Pennsylvania.  His father, Bill Koll, was a legendary three-time NCAA wrestling champion for Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), and a fifth-place finisher at the 1948 London Olympics.  Bill later became the head coach at Penn State University, and from 1965-1978 he led the team to a 127-22-7 record.\nPassage 5:\nJohn Watrous (computer scientist)\nJohn Harrison Watrous is a professor of computer science at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, a member of the Institute for Quantum Computing, an affiliate member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and a Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He was a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary from 2002 to 2006 where he held a Canada Research Chair in quantum computing.He is an editor of the journal Theory of Computing and former editor for the journal Quantum Information & Computation. His research interests include quantum information and quantum computation. He is well known for his work on quantum interactive proofs, and the quantum analogue of the celebrated result IP equals PSPACE, QIP equals PSPACE. This was preceded by a series of results, showing QIP can be constrained to 3 messages, QIP is contained in EXP, and the 2-message version of QIP is in PSPACE. He has also published important papers on quantum finite automata and quantum cellular automata. With Scott Aaronson, he showed that certain forms of time travel can make quantum and classical computation equivalent: together, the authors showed that quantum effects do not offer advantages for computation if computers can send information to the past through a type of closed timelike curve proposed by the physicist David Deutsch.He obtained his Ph.D. in 1998 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under the supervision of Eric Bach.\nPassage 6:\nDavid R. Mayhew\nDavid R. Mayhew (born May 18, 1937) is a political scientist and Sterling Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Yale University. He is widely considered one of the leading scholars on the United States Congress, and the author of nine influential books on American politics, including Congress: The Electoral Connection. In 2017, University of California, Berkeley professor Eric Schickler chronicled Mayhew's lifetime of contributions to the study of Congress in a journal article published in The Forum. Mayhew has been a member of the Yale faculty since 1968, and his students include several leading contemporary scholars of American politics, including the University of California, San Diego professor Gary Jacobson, Yale professor Jacob Hacker, and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law professor Steven Calabresi, as well as many famous figures such as Detroit Lions Pro Bowl quarterback Greg Landry and CNN personality Chris Cuomo. He has also taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst College, Oxford University, and Harvard University.\n\nWritings\nIn Congress: The Electoral Connection, Mayhew argued that much of the organization of the United States Congress can be explained as the result of re-election seeking behavior by its members. In Divided We Govern, he disputed the previously accepted notion that, when Congress and the presidency are controlled by different parties, less important legislation is passed than under unified government. The book won the 1992 Richard E. Neustadt prize. Princeton professor R. Douglas Arnold, another student of Mayhew's, noted that the academic literature on Congress can be cleanly categorized as coming \"before\" or \"after\" Congress: The Electoral Connection.His 2011 book, Partisan Balance: Why Political Parties Don't Kill the U.S. Constitutional System (Princeton University Press, 2011), contends that majoritarianism largely characterizes the American system. The wishes of the majority tend to nudge institutions back toward the median voter. Partisan Balance won the 2011 Leon D. Epstein Outstanding Award from the American Political Science Association.In his most recent work, The Imprint of Congress, Mayhew makes a case for studying the consequences of Congress's activities, not just the aspirations, processes, and optics associated with those activities.  The book analyzes congressional participation in a series of policy impulses that have invested the United States from the 1790s through recent times.\n\nEducation and awards\nMayhew earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1964, and his B.A. from Amherst College in 1958.  He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002, he received from the American Political Science Association the James Madison Award, which, awarded triennelly, \"recognizes an American political scientist who has made a distinguished scholarly contribution to political science.\" In 2004, he received the Samuel J. Eldersveld Award for lifetime achievement also from the American Political Science Association. In 2018, Mayhew was awarded the American Political Science Association Barbara Sinclair Legacy Award for a lifetime of significant scholarship to the study of legislative politics. In 2007, Mayhew was elected to the American Philosophical Society, and on April 30, 2013, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, completing the prestigious \"trifecta\" of academic honors in the social sciences.\n\nQuotes\n\"If a group of planners sat down and tried to design a pair of American national assemblies with the goal of serving members' reelection needs year in and year out, they would be hard pressed to improve on what exists.\"\n\"As an expressive institution Congress, in short, is noisy, versatile, and effective.\"\n\"Probably half the adverse criticism of Congress by elites is an indirect criticism of the public itself.\"\n\"It is not a minor matter that contingency, strategy, and valence issues tend to infuse elections.\"\n\"Assertion butts up against indifference, and assertion wins.\"\n\"'Party Government' plays a role in political science somewhere between a Platonic form and a grail.\"\nPassage 7:\nFrancis Quadrangle\nDavid R. Francis Quadrangle is the historical center of the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Known as The Quad, it is the oldest part of Red Campus and adjacent to Downtown Columbia at the south end of the Avenue of the Columns. At its center are six Ionic columns, all that remains of the original university building Academic Hall. Twelve buildings front the modern quadrangle including the domed main administration building Jesse Hall, the tallest building in Columbia. The Quad was designed and constructed by architect Morris Frederick Bell and his assistant William Lincoln Garver. It is named after Missouri governor David R. Francis. Eighteen structures, including the entire quad and most of Red Campus are listed as the Francis Quadrangle National Historic District. An obelisk, the original tombstone of Thomas Jefferson, stands in front of the Chancellor's Residence. It was gifted to the University by Jefferson's descendants in recognition of Missouri's ties to Virginia. In front of Jesse Hall stand markers honoring university president Richard Henry Jesse and Missouri governor David R. Francis. Nearby is another obelisk in memory of Missouri's first U.S. senator David Barton, The Missouri School of Journalism is located at the northeast corner of The Quad, comprising Walter Williams Hall, Neff Hall, Gannet Hall, along with the Reynolds Journalism Institute. To the west, Switzler Hall is the oldest academic building on campus, though the Residence on the Quad, home of the chancellor, is the oldest building overall. The University of Missouri College of Engineering completes the west side. Pickard Hall is currently closed due to radiation contamination from turn of the century experiments. Swallow Hall was recently renovated and houses the Departments of Anthropology, Visual Studies and Ancient Mediterranean Studies.\n\nHistory\nAt the genesis of the University of Missouri the only building among a great forest campus was Academic Hall. Constructed by architect Stephen Hills from 1840 to 1843 out of Red Brick and limestone quarried from the bluff of Hinkson Creek,  this was the only academic building of the university for many years. In 1843 a mansion was built next door for the President of the University of Missouri. During the American Civil War, Union troops occupied Academic Hall and burned the ancient forest and parts of the library for firewood. Academic Hall was damaged and the president mansion was burned in 1865. After the war, the university sued the federal government for damages, eventually winning and building the Memorial Gateway on the Avenue of the Columns with the money. A new President's Mansion was built in 1867 and still stands today. The need for expansion after the war necessitated the construction of Scientific Hall, now Switzler Hall in 1872.\nThe burning of Academic Hall on a cold January night in 1892 ushered in a time of great change for the university.  There was much support in the Missouri Legislature to move the University to Sedalia.  The Governor of Missouri, David R. Francis, sent a telegram to the students of the university assuring them that he would fight to keep the campus in Columbia.  He later traveled to Columbia to address the citizens, faculty, and students.  After calling for a special session of the Missouri Legislature he was able to appropriate $250,000 for the rebuilding.  The University of Missouri was rebuilt in a quad around the columns, with \"New Academic Hall\" later renamed Jesse Hall on the south, and the Avenue of the Columns on the North.\n\nOn October 23, 2010 the quad was featured as the location of an ESPN's College GameDay.  An ESPN record of over 18,000 fans showed up.\n\nBuildings\nGeology Building\nThe Geology Building is the newest stand-alone building on The Quad.\n\nHill Hall\nHill Hall was built in 1950 and named after former President of The University Albert Ross Hill.\n\nJesse Hall\nJesse Hall was constructed in 1892 as the \"New Academic Hall\". It was later renamed after MU president Richard Henry Jesse. The dome rises nine stories above the quad, and is one of the most recognized symbols of MU. It was designed by architect Morris Frederick Bell, and serves as the administrative center for the University of Missouri–Columbia.\n\nLafferre Hall\nThe Engineering Building was built in 1892 and lies on the west side of the quad. After a significant donation, the building is now called Lafferre Hall.\n\nPickard Hall\nPickard Hall was built in 1892 and contained the MU Art and Archaeology Museum until 2013, when it was closed due to latent radiation from experiments dating 1910-1930. It was named after professor of archaeology and art history John Pickard.\n\nResidence on the Quad\nThe Residence on The Quad was built in 1867 and stands on the East side of the quad. It is the oldest building left standing on campus.  Thomas Jefferson's original tombstone stands between this building and The Columns.  The Residence is intended to be the official home of the University's chancellor.\n\nSociology\nThe Sociology building was built in 1892 and stands near the northeast corner of the quad. The building has been renovated and turned into the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute.\n\nSwallow Hall\nSwallow Hall was built in 1893 and stands on the southeast corner.  It is named after George Clinton Swallow, Missouri's first state geologist.  Today the building holds the Museum of Anthropology.\n\nSwitzler Hall\nSwitzler Hall was constructed in 1871 as the \"Scientific Building\". It is the oldest academic building left standing on campus. Switzler Hall is named after curator William Franklin Switzler. One of the notable attractions of Switzler Hall is the bell tower. The bell was given to the University by Major James S. Rollins and is inscribed with the words \"Nunc occasion est et tempus,\" which translated is, \"Now is the occasion and the time.\" The bell rang each hour classes were in session until 1936.\n\nMonuments\nThe Columns\nThe Columns that once supported Academic Hall designed by Stephen Hills now stand in the middle of the quad. The Columns are the only remaining part of Academic Hall after it burned on January 9, 1892. In August 1893 the Board of Curators voted to remove the Columns because they thought that they were unsafe and ugly. The Columns were inspected and found that the foundations were sound. Local support for keeping the Columns changed the Board's mind and the vote was reversed in December 1893. Today, The Columns are the second-most photographed landmarks in the state of Missouri, next to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.\n\nThomas Jefferson's tombstone\nThomas Jefferson's original tombstone stands on the east side of the quad.  Jefferson's original tombstone was given to Mizzou by his heirs in July 1883 due to Mizzou being the first University founded within Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase.\nThe plaque on the gravestone reads \"This original marker, placed at the grave of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, Virginia in 1826, constructed from his own design, was presented July 4, 1883, by the Jefferson heirs to the University of Missouri. First state university to be founded in the Louisiana Territory purchased from France during President Jefferson's administration.  The obelisk, dedicated on this campus at commencement June 4, 1885, commemorates Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, whose faith in the future of western America and whose confidence in the people has shaped our national ideals; commemorates the author of the Declaration of Independence and of the Virginia statute for religious freedom, founder of the University of Virginia, fosterer of public education in the United States.\"\nAnd under these words it reads (the original epitaph)\n\"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom and FATHER of the University of Virginia\"\n\nFrancis Marker\nAs tribute to former governor of Missouri, David R. Francis, a statue of stands just northeast of the entrance to Jesse Hall. It is a tradition that before an exam a student will rub his nose to receive an A on the exam. Due to the tradition's popularity the statue's nose has been replaced three times since its dedication.\n\nBarton Marker\nA stone marker memorializing Missouri's first senator David Barton stands at the southwest corner of The Quad.\n\nBritish House of Parliament Stone\nA Stone from the House of Parliament stands outside the J-School.\n\nChinese Lions\nTwo ancient Chinese lions guard the archway to 9th Street at the northeastern side of The Quad.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nHistory of the University of Missouri\nPassage 8:\nMarchant Glacier\nMatataua Glacier, formerly Marchant Glacier (78°6′S 162°3′E) is a glacier, about 7 nautical miles (13 km) long, which drains the slopes of Rampart Ridge between Mount Bishop and Mount Potter and flows northwest to the vicinity of Mount Bockheim, in the Royal Society Range, Victoria Land, Antarctica.\n\nName\nIt was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1994 after David R. Marchant, a glacial geologist at the University of Maine (and from 1995 at Boston University). In connection with Antarctic field work since 1985, Marchant discovered and used volcanic ashes to infer paleoclimate change and geologic stability in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and map the glacial history of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Marchant was put on paid administrative leave by Boston University in February 2018 for sexually harassing multiple female graduate students in Antarctica. In 2019, BU President Robert A. Brown terminated Marchant's employment. The incidents are thoroughly chronicled in the documentary Picture a Scientist.It was renamed Matataua Glacier by ACAN/BGN in September 2018 because of its proximity to Mata Taua Peak. The name Matataua Glacier represents a change in designation that brings the name of this feature into alignment with ACAN policies.\nPassage 9:\nDavid R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\nThe David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science is a professional school within the  Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. QS World University Rankings ranked the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science 24th in the world, 10th in North America and 2nd in Canada in Computer Science in 2014. U.S. News & World Report ranked the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science 42nd in world and second in Canada.\n\nHistory\nIn 1965, when Mathematics was still a department within the Faculty of Arts, four third-year mathematics students (Richard Shirley, Angus German, James G. Mitchell, and Bob Zarnke) wrote the WATFOR compiler for the FORTRAN programming language, under the direction of lecturer Peter Shantz. \"Within a year it would be adopted by computing centres in over eight countries, and the number of student users at UW increased to over 2500.\" Later on in 1966, two mathematics lecturers (Paul Dirksen and Paul H. Cress) led a team that developed WATFOR 360, for which they received the 1972 Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery.\nUW's Faculty of Mathematics was later established in 1967.  As a result, the Department of Applied Analysis and Computer Science (AA&CS) was created.  By 1969, AA&CS had become the largest department in the faculty.  At that point, the first two PhD degrees in computer science were awarded, to Byron L. Ehle, for a thesis on numerical analysis, and to Hugh Williams, for a thesis on computational number theory.  In 1975 the department dropped the words \"Applied Analysis\" and became simply the Department of Computer Science.\nIn 1982, the Institute for Computer Research (ICR) was established. Its goals were \"to foster computer research..., facilitate interaction with industry, and encourage advanced education in computer science and engineering.\" Also that year, the Ontario government announced plans to build the Davis Centre, current home of the School of Computer Science. The groundbreaking was in April 1985 and the Davis Centre was formally dedicated on November 10, 1988.\nOn May 1, 2002, the department officially became the School of Computer Science. On November 18, 2005, it was renamed again to the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, in recognition of the establishment of the David R. Cheriton Endowment for Excellence in Computer Science. Cheriton had recently donated $25 million to the university.\nSupport for computing within the School of Computer Science had been historically provided by the Computer Science Computing Facility (CSCF) and ICR.\n\nPrograms\nThe David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science offers several diverse undergraduate programs including:\n\nBachelor of Computer Science\nHonours Computer Science\nBusiness Option\nBioinformatics Option\nDigital Hardware Option\nSoftware Engineering Option\nHonours Data Science\nBachelor of Mathematics\nHonours Computer Science\nBusiness Option\nDigital Hardware Option\nBachelor of Software Engineering\nBachelor of Computing and Financial ManagementIn general, the philosophy of the undergraduate program is to build a solid foundation of mathematics and computer science during the first three years of the program, allowing students more flexibility in fourth year. Required courses for all computer science programs include courses in combinatorics, data structures, algorithms, compilers, software engineering and operating systems. The curriculum is also designed to encourage either significant depth in an area outside of computer science (such as in the Bioinformatics Option) or exposure to a variety of areas outside of the computer science.\nThe school also offers Masters of Mathematics and Ph.D. graduate programs.\n\nMaster of Mathematics (Computer Science)\nPh.D. in Computer Science\n\nReputation\nThe university is well-regarded in the field of Computer Science, where it ranks 41st in the world and fourth in Canada according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and 22nd in the world and second in Canada in the QS World University Rankings in 2019.\nPassage 10:\nRichard Henry Jesse\nRichard Henry Jesse (May 1, 1853 – January 21, 1921) was an American educator and the eighth president of the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.  He was born in Lancaster County, Virginia 1853 and attended the University of Virginia.  He went on to teach at the University of Louisiana and Tulane University before assuming the presidency 1891.  He retired in 1908.  Jesse Hall on the David R. Francis Quadrangle is named in honor of him and was initiated as an Honorary member of the Acacia Fraternity.

He most recently worked for KSL 5 Television. Nourse joined the KSL news team in 1964 as the station's weekend anchor/reporter. Six months later, he was named the station's weekday anchor. He concluded his 43-year career with his final newscast on November 28, 2007, a record term for a Utah television news anchor. Nourse's longevity as an American news anchor comes second to that of the late Hal Fishman, whose career spanned 47 years.Nourse began his broadcasting career in Grand Junction, Colorado, at radio stations KDTA and KREX. He attended Mesa College in Grand Junction and Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Nourse moved to Salt Lake City in 1964 and applied at KUTV channel 2 and KCPX channel 4, but neither hired him. The next day, he applied across the street at KSL channel 5 and was hired.\n\nNourse, Welti, and James\nThe birth of KSL's franchise product was on the evening of July 13, 1965. On that day, Nourse was first paired with weatherman Bob Welti and sportscaster Paul James, recently poached from KCPX-TV, which had long been the leading news station in Utah.  Despite its newspaper roots, KSL-TV had long been a ratings also-ran.  However, within a short time,  Nourse, Welti, and James catapulted channel 5 to first place—a lead it held for over four decades. The trio would remain together for 26 years until James and Welti both retired in 1991.  At that time, they were the longest-running evening news team in the nation.\n\nCancer\nIn 1980, Nourse learned he had Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer. He was off-the-air and in the hospital for chemotherapy treatment. His co-anchor at the time, Shelly Thomas, interviewed him and his doctor.

After a career that began at KSL in 1964, Nourse passed the reins to his long-time colleague and former co-anchor, Bruce Lindsay.\n\nPersonal life and death\nNourse, along with his second wife, Debi, was the father of five children. With his first wife, Jan (1957–1997), he had a daughter (March 22, 1985 – April 15, 2007).Nourse died on May 18, 2023, at the age of 83.\n\nPast news team members\nNadine Wimmer, Kevin Eubank, Tom Kirkland (2006–2007) Eyewitness News|HD at 10\nNadine Wimmer, Mark Eubank, Tom Kirkland (2002–2006) Eyewitness News at 10\nRuth Todd, Mark Eubank, Tom Kirkland (1998–2001) Eyewitness News at 10\nRuth Todd, Mark Eubank, Craig Bolerjack (1994–1998) Eyewitness News at 10\nCarole Mikita, Mark Eubank, Craig Bolerjack (1991–1994) Eyewitness News at 10\nShelly Thomas, Bob Welti, Paul James (1979–1991) Eyewitness News Tonight at 10\nBruce Lindsay, Bob Welti, Paul James (1979–1991) Eyewitness News at 6 & 10\nBob Welti, Paul James (1965–1991)\nPassage 8:\nSagarika Ghose\nSagarika Ghose (born 8 November 1964) is an Indian journalist, columnist and author.

Bell also holds the record for the most consecutive league appearances for a British team; he was picked for the first game after the Second World War in the 1946–47 season and did not miss a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.Jimmy Moreton made 148 Football League and 22 FA Cup appearances, as well numerous first-team outings in the lower Lancashire Combination and Central Leagues. Upon his retirement in 1926, Moreton became first trainer, then manager of Rovers. As of the end of the 2011–12 season, the most recent player to amass 100 appearances is Ash Taylor.Ian Muir's tally of 180 goals in 393 appearances makes him Tranmere's leading scorer. John Aldridge scored 174 goals in 294 games, and became player-manager in 1995.\n\nPlayers\nThis list contains players who have made 100 or more appearances in nationally organised first-team competition for Tranmere. It includes first-team appearances and goals in the Football League and play-offs, the FA Cup, the Football League Cup, the Third Division North Cup, the Football League Trophy, the Full Members Cup and the Anglo-Italian Cup.

They were established in 1949 under the name of Stockton Heath, adopting their current name in 1961. They currently compete in National League North and play at Cantilever Park.\n\nClub history\nFirst 50 years\nFormed in 1949 by Jimmy Drinkwater, the club was initially named Stockton Heath Albion and competed in the Warrington and District League until 1953, when they moved to the Mid Cheshire League. Freddie Worrall became manager at the same time, and during a 13-year spell in charge, the club won the league in 1959–60 plus the League Cup in three consecutive seasons during the 1950s. During his thirteen years at the helm, Heath were one of the most feared sides in Cheshire football, winning a string of honours including the Mid Cheshire League Championship in 1959–60, the League Cup in 1953–54, 1954–55, 1955–56 and made several appearances in the Cheshire Amateur Cup Final. Several players from this successful period went on to join Football League clubs, including Ian Weir, John Green, Alan Foster and Roger Hunt, later a World Cup winner with England in 1966.\nAt the club's 1961 AGM, it was decided to change the name to Warrington Town. In 1978 the club were founder members of Division Two of the Cheshire County League. When it merged into the North West Counties Football League in 1982, the club were founder members of Division Three. They finished as runners-up in the first season, earning promotion to Division Two. In 1985–86 Warrington reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, losing 6–3 to Halesowen Town in a replay. After finishing as runners-up in Division Two in 1986–87, the club were promoted to Division One. In the same season they reached the FA Vase final, where they lost 3–2 to local rivals St Helens Town\nIn 1989–90 Warrington Town won Division One, and were promoted to the Northern Premier League. In 1992–93 they reached the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy, eventually losing 2–1 at Sutton United, and also became the first Division One club to reach the final of the League Cup, losing on penalties to Winsford United. The season also saw the club sell Neil Whalley to Football League Third Division side Preston North End for a £25,000, equalling the record fee paid for a Northern Premier League player. A few weeks later Warrington also sold Liam Watson to Preston for a record £60,000.\nAfter finishing second bottom of the league in 1996–97, the club were relegated back to Division One of the North West Counties League. The following season they were demoted, failing ground grading. In the 1998–99 season, teenage striker Damien Whitehead set a new club record of 52 goals in just 42 appearances, before signing for Football League Division Three side Macclesfield Town at the end of the season.\n\n21st century\nThe 1999–2000 season saw Town win the Second Division Trophy beating Tetley Walker 2–0 at Prescot Cables, with two goals from Neal Holden. The following season they won Division Two and were promoted back to Division One. They finished fifth in 2003–04, and were moved to Division One of the Northern Premier League as part of the restructuring that led to the creation of the Conference North and Conference South. When Division One was split into northern and southern sections in 2007, the club were placed in the southern division, but were moved to the northern section the following season.In 2013–14 the club finished third in Division One North, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, where, they lost 1–0 at home to Bamber Bridge in the semi-finals. Former Director of Football, Toby Macormac, became the new club Chairman. The club reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in their history in 2014–15 , where they beat League Two club Exeter City 1–0 with a 7th-minute header from Craig Robinson, in a giant-killing at Cantilever Park shown live on BBC Two. In the second round they lost 0–2 at Gateshead, televised live on BT Sport. Later in the season the club lifted its first trophy in 14 years by defeating Farsley Celtic on penalties in the final of the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, held at Edgeley Park. \nDuring the 2015–16 season the club set many new club records including scoring over 100 league goals and also winning over 30 league games in one season. Attendances at the club increased with a seasons average of 418 per game, including two crowds of over 1,000 for the games against Northwich Victoria and Prescot Cables. The Club Chairman decided to part company with manager Shaun Reid by mutual consent in February 2016, replacing him with Stuart Mellish and Lee Smith. Mellish and Smith led Town to the league title, finishing 15 points clear and setting division records of 106 points and 121 goals scored, and gaining promotion to Northern Premier League Premier Division. Team captain Ciaran Kilheeney was the top scorer in all 3 NPL divisions with 37 league goals,  and he, James McCarten and goalkeeper Karl Wills were named in the NPL Division One North team of the season.\n\nNPL Premier Division\nAt level seven in the English football league system, the Northern Premier League Premier Division was the highest level that Warrington had ever reached. After 16 games of the 2016-17 season, while sixth in the table, management duo of Stuart Mellish and Lee Smith left by mutual consent and were replaced by Paul Carden. Carden lead the team to a tenth place finish in their first season in the division. In the 2017–18 Northern Premier League season Warrington improved on the previous campaign and ended up with a highest ever finish of third in the NPL Premier Division qualifying them for the play-offs, where they lost in a home semi-final against Grantham Town.  They followed this up in 2018-19 with another third placed finish, in a season made more complicated by the expulsion of North Ferriby United who went out of business partway through the campaign. In the play-offs Warrington beat Nantwich Town 4-1 in a home semi-final, and then won 2-1 against South Shields in the final. Normally this would have resulted in promotion to National League North. However, as a one-off for the 2018-19 season, Town had to play a \"super playoff\" game against the playoff winners of the newly-formed Southern League Premier Central Division.  In this game Warrington lost 3-2 to King's Lynn Town after extra time, and they remained in the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2019–20 season. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019-20 season was formally abandoned in March 2020, with all results from the season being expunged. After another abandoned season in 2020-21 and a play off final defeat in 2021-22, Warrington finished the 2022-23 season as runners up and were promoted to the National League North for the first time in club history, beating Bamber Bridge F.C. 1-0 in the play off final at Cantilever Park.\n\nCurrent squad\nAs of 24 March 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\nGround\nThe club played firstly at Stockton Lane in Stockton Heath in 1949, arriving at London Road in 1950, then moving to its first ground on Loushers lane (the Cheshire Police Ground) in 1953, returning to further down Stockton Lane in Grappenhall in 1955. The following year, the club moved to Cantilever Park, which had a capacity of 2,500 as of November 2014. It takes its name from the Cantilever Bridge, a high-level road bridge on Ackers Road over the Manchester Ship Canal that towers over the ground to the east. The ground itself is on the northern bank of the canal. The ground consists of three stands, one of which is seated.\n\nHonours\nNorthern Premier League\nNorthern Premier League Play Off Winners 2018-19, 2022-23\nNorthern Premier League Division One North Champions 2015–16\nNorthern Premier League Challenge Cup\nWinners 2014–15\nNorth West Counties League\nDivision One Champions 1989–90\nDivision Two Champions 2000–01\nDivision Two Trophy winners 1999–2000\nLeague Cup winners 1989–90\nLeague Shield winners 1985–86\nMid-Cheshire League\nChampions 1960–61\nLeague Cup Winners 1953–54, 1954–55, 1955–56\nNorthern Combination Cup\nWinners 1989–90\nAltrincham Cup\nWinners 1954–55\nRuncorn Challenge Cup\nWinners 1965–66, 1966–67, 1968–69\nWarrington Guardian Challenge Cup\nWinners 1980–81, 1994–95\nRaab Karcher Cup\nWinners 1987–88\n\nRecords\nFA Cup\nSecond Round 2014–15\nFA Trophy\nQuarter Finals 1992–93\nFA Vase\nRunners-up 1986–87\nRecord attendance: 2,550 v Bamber Bridge,Northern Premier League - Premier Division, Playoff final, 1 May 2023\n\nLeague history\nPassage 6:\nMitch Duggan\nMitchell James Duggan (born 20 March 1997) is a  professional footballer who currently plays as a defensive midfielder for Warrington Town.\nPassage 7:\nList of Tranmere Rovers F.C. players (1921–39)\nTranmere Rovers Football Club is an English association football club based in Birkenhead, Wirral. Founded in 1884, they played their first games under the name Belmont F.C.; in 1885, before the start of their second season, they adopted the name Tranmere Rovers. In 1889, Tranmere entered the West Lancashire League, and progressed through the Combination, the Lancashire Combination and the Central League. On 27 August 1921, as founder members of Division Three North, they won their first Football League match 4–1 against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. Tranmere have played in the Football League ever since, with the exception of 1939–1946, when competitive football was suspended due to the Second World War. Their highest league finish was fourth in the First Division which, at the time, was the second tier of the league pyramid, in the 1992–93 season.\n\nPlayers\nThis list contains players who have appeared in nationally organised first-team competition for Tranmere from 1921 until the Second World War. It includes first-team appearances and goals in the Football League, the FA Cup and the Third Division North Cup. Appearances and goals in other competitions or non-competitive matches are not included. Statistics from the three games in the 1939–40 Football League season abandoned because of the Second World War have been expunged from the records and are not included. Players that also represented the club after the war are instead at List of post-war Tranmere Rovers F.C. players.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nBilly Dennis (English footballer)\nWilliam Dennis (21 September 1896 – 1952) was an English footballer. His regular position was at full back. He was born in Mossley, Lancashire. He played for Ashton PSA and Denton before joining the army during World War I during which time he also featured for Birkenhead Comets, Linfield and Tranmere Rovers. Post-war he joined Stalybridge Celtic then was signed by First Division Blackburn Rovers. After a short spell at Ewood Park he re-joined Stalybridge in time to play in the Football League for them. He moved back to the First Division with Manchester United for a short lived spell prior to joining the club with whom he was to have his longest association Chesterfield. He finished his League career with Wigan Borough, before leaving the cash-strapped club for Cheshire League football with first Macclesfield and then Hurst. Aged 37 he joined Mossley as trainer, also making one appearance for his home town club.\nPassage 9:\n1989–90 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season\nJohn King guided Tranmere Rovers F.C to Leyland DAF Cup victory in 1989–90. Tranmere moved to the top of the Third Division after winning seven of their opening nine games, including a 6–0 victory over Bristol City. They also took Tottenham Hotspur to a Littlewoods Cup fourth round replay. Following a poor spell, they revived their promotion prospects with nine straight wins. Tranmere finished in fourth place, but lost 2–0 to Notts County in the play-off final. They defeated Rochdale 1–0, Scunthorpe United 2–1, Chester City 3–0, Bolton Wanderers 2–1 and Doncaster Rovers 3–1 in the Leyland DAF Cup before beating Bristol Rovers 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nFinal league table\nPassage 10:\nJames Wallace (footballer, born 1991)\nJames Robert Wallace (born 19 December 1991) is a former English footballer who played as a midfielder. He is the current chief scout at Preston North End. He started his career at Everton's youth academy aged 13, and progressed through the club's youth system before playing regularly for the reserve side. Following a string of loans to Bury, Stockport County, Shrewsbury Town, Stevenage and Tranmere Rovers, he eventually left Everton without playing a league game, joining Tranmere on a permanent basis in 2012 and then Sheffield United in 2014. Born in Liverpool, Wallace has represented England at under-19 and under-20 level, despite having represented the Republic of Ireland at under-16 level.\n\nClub career\nEverton\nWallace joined Everton's youth academy at 13, before joining the reserves and ultimately progressing to the senior squad. He made his competitive debut for Everton against Sigma Olomouc in the UEFA Europa League in August 2009, coming on as a 66th-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw in Olomouc. It was to be Wallace's only first-team appearance of the 2009–10 campaign, as he was sidelined later that year with a double hernia problem that subsequently kept him out of action until 2010.After making no first-team appearance at the start of Everton's 2010–11 season, Wallace joined Bury on a one-month loan deal in November 2010. He made his debut for the club two days later, in an FA Cup Second Round match against Peterborough United, playing the whole game in a 2–1 defeat. Wallace made no further appearances for Bury during his one-month loan spell due to the adverse weather conditions that resulted in a spate of postponements throughout December 2010, and the player returned to his parent club shortly before the start of 2011.In February 2011, Wallace was loaned out, this time joining relegation threatened League Two side Stockport County, with the deal running for a month. He made a scoring debut for Stockport in a game against Macclesfield Town, scoring the opening goal of the game with a \"superb 25-yard strike\", although the club went on to lose the match 4–1. Wallace played in five games during his loan spell as Stockport had a brief up-turn in form, and the loan deal was later extended to the end of the 2010–11 season. Towards the latter stages of the campaign, Wallace was made Stockport captain, and made a total of 14 appearances during his three-month spell with the club, scoring one goal. On returning to Everton, Wallace was handed a new one-year contract with the club.Wallace did not feature in any of Everton's pre-season fixtures ahead of the 2011–12 campaign, and was again a regular for the club's reserve side at the start of the season. After making no first-team appearances, Wallace signed for League Two side Shrewsbury Town on 3 November 2011, joining the club on a month's loan. Shrewsbury manager Graham Turner stated that he had previously tried to sign Wallace on a number of occasions, but was unable to bring the player to the club as a result of Wallace's international commitmentsand injury problems. Wallace made his debut for Shrewsbury in a 2–0 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge two days after joining the club, although was sent off after just 25 minutes for a \"lunge\" on Dagenham's Jon Nurse. As a result of the red card, Wallace missed Shrewsbury's three next games. Wallaces loan spell was extended for a further month on at the end of November, with Turner stating – \"We want to see more of him. He wants to see more of us\". Wallace only made one further appearance for Shrewsbury, but despite only playing three times for the club in the space of two months due to the three-match suspension and injury problems, Turner stated a desire to renew the loan deal for a third time – \"Wallace hasn't had the best time here – he's only played about 40 minutes in his two months with us due to not being able to play in the FA Cup, suspension and injuries. I want him to get back to Everton get his injury cleared up, and we'll take it on from there\".After just four days back at Everton, Wallace joined League One club Stevenage on a one-month loan deal in January 2012. Following Stevenage manager Graham Westley's departure to Preston North End, Wallace's loan spell at Stevenage was cancelled by mutual consent on two weeks later, with the player having made no first-team appearances for the club.Three days after leaving Stevenage, Wallace signed a one-month loan deal with Tranmere Rovers, making his debut two days later in a 2–1 away defeat to Bournemouth. In February 2012, Tranmere extended Wallace's loan deal a further month, before Wallace scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Rochdale in March.\n\nTranmere Rovers\nAt the end of the season, Wallace was linked with clubs in the Championship and League One, but joined Tranmere Rovers on a permanent basis. His move delighted manager Ronnie Moore, who said, \"I'm delighted that James will be returning to the club as we were really keen to sign him. He was fantastic for us last season and played a big part in our climb up the table; he's got bags of energy, tackles well, can pick out a pass and has goals in him too. He's turned down some big clubs to come to us, which shows how much he enjoyed it here last season. It's a big signing for the club, and I think we've got a very good player on our hands. He's a leader, a talker and he'll make an excellent captain for the club.\"\n\nSheffield United\nAfter Wallace's contract with Tranmere expired after two seasons, he went on to sign a two-year deal with Sheffield United on 13 June 2014. Wallace's time at the Blades was blighted by injuries which hampered his spell at the club.\n\nShrewsbury Town (loan)\nWallace joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until the end of the season in January 2016, linking up once again with the club he had a brief spell with in 2011. He was sidelined for a lengthy period after picking up a knee injury in a league match against Southend United the following month, making a total of eight appearances in all competitions before his loan expired in May.\n\nReturn to Tranmere Rovers\nWallace re-joined Tranmere Rovers on an initial short-term loan deal on 28 November 2016. He rejoined the club on a permanent basis in January 2017, signing an 18-month contract.\n\nFleetwood Town\nWhen Wallace did not agree a new contract with Tranmere, he was snapped up by League One side Fleetwood Town. At the end of the season, Wallace became the club's chief scout.\n\nInternational career\nRepublic of Ireland\nWallace previously played for Republic of Ireland at under-16 level, and participated in the 2007 Montaigu Tournament for the Republic of Ireland. However, it was later found that he was not eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national team.\n\nEngland\nWallace was subsequently called up to represent the England U19 side in March 2009, although he was an unused substitute in a 0–0 draw with Czech Republic at the Bescot Stadium. Wallace made his debut for the England U19s in September 2009, coming on as a second-half substitute, replacing Andros Townsend, in a 2–1 victory against Russia, and made his first U19 start for England the following month, playing the whole game as England beat Finland 3–1.Wallace was called up to represent the England U20 squad in February 2011, playing in a 2–1 defeat to France, and was later named in Brian Eastick's 21-man squad to represent the England U20s at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which took place in Colombia throughout July and August 2011. Wallace was an unused substitute in England's first group match, a 0–0 draw with North Korea, Wallace made his first appearance in the next match against Argentina, which also ended goalless. Wallace made two further appearances for England under-20s, both as a substitute, as England were eventually knocked out 1–0 by Nigeria.\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of match played 14 January 2017.\n\nClub\nInternational\nPersonal life\nBorn in Fazakerley, Liverpool, Wallace is the nephew of former Doncaster Rovers footballer Gregg Blundell.", "answers": ["Warrington Town Football Club"], "length": 5861, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "27a089389352bbc56ac06c79c190369a13f794bf84c6abd1"}

He played college football for the University of Oklahoma, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American.  He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys eighth overall in the 2002 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Cowboys and Cincinnati Bengals.  He earned five straight Pro Bowl selections from 2003 to 2007. Despite being an accomplished player, Williams is perhaps most remembered as being one of the ”dirtiest” players in the NFL during his playing career, and was even criticized by his own teammates for his actions on multiple occasions.\nWilliams is currently a sideline reporter for Oklahoma football games.\n\nEarly years\nWilliams was born in Redwood City, California.  He graduated from James Logan High School in Union City, California, where he played quarterback, wide receiver and defensive back for the Logan Colts high school football.\n\nCollege career\nWilliams attended the University of Oklahoma, and played for coach Bob Stoops's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 1999 to 2001.  He was a starter on the undefeated 2000 Oklahoma Sooners team that won the BCS National Championship, setting a school record for tackles for a loss by a defensive back with 12.In 2001, his junior season at Oklahoma, he won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy as the nation's top overall defensive player and also won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back, while leading the team to a 10-2 record and a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Cotton Bowl Classic.  He was named Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team Big 12 selection, and recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American.  Williams decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft.\nNicknamed \"Superman\" while at Oklahoma, Williams is remembered at OU for his actions in the 2001 Red River Shootout. The Sooners led 7–3 with only minutes remaining as the Longhorns offense took the field, hoping to execute a game-winning drive. With Texas forced to begin their drive inside their own 5-yard line, the Sooners prepared to pressure UT quarterback Chris Simms.  Williams timed the snap perfectly.  Simms barely had time to pull back from center when Williams came flying in from the blindside over the top of a Longhorn running back who barely had time to rise out of his stance.  The jarring and unexpected hit knocked the ball loose and into the hands of linebacker Teddy Lehman, who stepped into the endzone for a touchdown and sealed the game for Oklahoma.\nThis play has been immortalized on a mural plaque at the Roy Williams Strength and Speed Complex at the University of Oklahoma.  The complex is named for Williams both for his athletic achievements and for his donation of approximately $100,000 towards its construction.\n\nProfessional career\nDallas Cowboys\nWilliams was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round with the eighth overall pick of the 2002 NFL Draft after a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was known throughout the league for his hard hitting and his tackling skills during running plays. With the arrival of Ken Hamlin from Seattle, Williams had the luxury to move closer to the line of scrimmage to blitz and cover short passes during nickel or dime situations.\nAs a rookie in 2002, he was moved to free safety in order to play alongside strong safety Darren Woodson. However, the Cowboys defensive scheme that year allowed both players to interchange positions so as to confuse opposing offenses. He tied the franchise single-season record for most interceptions returned for touchdowns with two. Williams was also the runner-up for Defensive Rookie of the Year.\nIn 2003, Williams with the mentoring of Woodson, enjoyed a stellar season and his first trip to the Pro Bowl as he was part of the Cowboys' number one ranked defense and helped lead the team to its first playoff game since 1999.\n\nIn 2004, Woodson suffered a herniated disc in training camp and was forced to sit on the sidelines. Williams' struggles were more apparent as he was forced to play more coverage due to the inexperience and inconsistency of the Dallas cornerback position. After the season, the horse-collar tackle was banned. This action is now referred to as the \"Roy Williams Rule\", as the rule was introduced the 2004 season, during which Williams used the technique on plays that resulted in three significant injuries.Williams is occasionally referred to by fans as \"Biscuit\", in reference to a statement in a 2003 press conference by former head coach Bill Parcells who, noting Williams' weight, said that he was \"a biscuit short of a linebacker\".With the right cornerback position stabilized by the free agent signing of Anthony Henry in 2005, Williams was once again able to play to his best strength by roaming closer to the line of scrimmage. At the end of the 2005 NFL regular season, Williams had 2.5 sacks and three interceptions. He earned his third Pro Bowl berth in 2005 and remained a dominant force for the Dallas defense.\nIn early August 2006 the Dallas Cowboys signed Williams to a four-year contract extension worth $25.2 million to keep him with the team through the 2010 season.On December 17, 2007, Williams was issued a one-game suspension without pay from Commissioner Roger Goodell. He received it for a repeat offense violating the league's horse-collar tackle rule. During the season, Cowboys teammates Terrell Owens and Patrick Crayton criticized him for his continued use of the horse-collar tackle. After the 2007 season, Williams was named to the Pro Bowl on January 3, 2008 for the fifth straight time, this time as a replacement for the late Sean Taylor (who played for the Cowboys' heated rivals, the Washington Redskins).\nWilliams announced that he would be wearing No. 38 at the start of the 2008 season because that was the number he wore in college and also \"8\" in the Bible signifies a new beginning. Teammate Greg Ellis, speaking on Sirius NFL Radio, said that Williams told him he felt like he did not fit in head coach Wade Phillips' defensive scheme. Ellis added he was bothered by the way Williams had been isolating himself from other Cowboys, and Williams \"just doesn't fit what's going on here in Dallas right now.\" The Cowboys hired new DBs coach Dave Campo, hoping this would help Williams create more turnovers, after Williams failed to achieve any sacks or forced fumbles since 2005.Williams broke his forearm in the second game of the year against the Philadelphia Eagles.  He missed four games, then on his first game back against the St. Louis Rams, he refractured the same forearm and was forced to miss the entire season on injured reserve.\nOn October 14, 2008, the Cowboys acquired wide receiver Roy E. Williams from the Detroit Lions, making the two Pro Bowl players with identical names teammates.\nOn March 5, 2009, the Cowboys released Williams, per his request.\n\nCincinnati Bengals\nWilliams signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on May 6, 2009.He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on November 13, 2009, due to a forearm fracture after recording 28 tackles. On March 13, 2010, Williams signed a one-year contract to stay with the Bengals. He recorded 59 tackles, a sack, and an interception of Ben Roethlisberger that year.\n\nNFL statistics\nKey\n\nGP: games played\nTOTAL: total tackles\nSOLO: unassisted tackles\nAST: assisted tackles\nSACK: sacks\nFF: forced fumbles\nFR: fumble recoveries\nFR YDS: fumble return yards\nINT: interceptions\nIR YDS: interception return yards\nAVG IR: average interception return\nLNG: longest interception return\nTD: interceptions returned for touchdown\nPD: passes defensed\n\nRetirement\nOn August 24, 2011, Williams announced his retirement, taking a job as a sideline reporter for Oklahoma Sooners football games. He also appeared on the television show Storage Wars: Texas on A&E.  He joined the cast in season 1, episode 10 and returned for five episodes in season 2.\n\nPersonal life\nIn July 2004, Williams started the Roy Williams Safety Net Foundation which was inspired by his sister Alecia, a single mother raising a young son. The Foundation's purpose is to help ensure low-income single mothers receive support, guidance, and assistance to enhance their quality of life.Williams was engaged to singer Kelly Rowland for a year. Williams' aunt is Vecepia Towery, the winner of Survivor: Marquesas. Williams has three children with his wife Kristy, whom he has known since middle school.\nPassage 3:\nDoug Crusan\nDouglas Gordon Crusan Jr. (born July 26, 1946)  is a former American football offensive tackle who played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Miami Dolphins. He played in Super Bowls VI, VII, and VIII. Crusan was the starting offensive tackle for the 1972 Super Bowl Champion Miami Dolphins, the only NFL team to finish a season with a perfect record (17–0). He was also the team captain for the 1967 Indiana Hoosiers football team and played defensive tackle in the 1968 Rose Bowl against Southern California and O. J. Simpson. Crusan was a first-round selection in the 1968 NFL Draft, picked by the Dolphins behind Larry Csonka. Crusan has been involved in the private sector as a senior business manager since retiring from the NFL, and has been actively involved in the NFLPA for 38 years.\nPassage 4:\nHorse-collar tackle\nThe horse-collar tackle is an American football maneuver in which a defender tackles another player by grabbing the back collar or the back-inside of an opponent's shoulder pads and pulling the ball carrier directly downward violently in order to pull his feet from underneath him. The technique is most closely associated with Pro Bowl safety Roy Williams. \nAfter being blamed for a series of major injuries in the 2004 season, the horse-collar tackle was banned from the NFL during the 2005 off-season. The rule forbidding it is often referred to in the press as \"The Roy Williams Rule\". The rule, with modifications, was adopted in college football in 2008 and high school football in 2009.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1981 NFC Championship Game where the Dallas Cowboys visited the San Francisco 49ers, after the 49ers took the lead 28-27 due to \"The Catch\", on the Cowboys following drive, Drew Pearson caught a long pass from Danny White at midfield. 49ers cornerback Eric Wright stopped Pearson with a horse-collar tackle (White fumbled on the next play, thus preserving victory for the 49ers and putting them in Super Bowl XVI).\nRoy Williams was well known for horse-collaring players while playing at Oklahoma, and continued to use the tackle after moving to the NFL in 2002.\nThe horse-collar tackle rose to infamy during the 2004 NFL season, in which it was implicated in six major injuries, four of which were caused by Williams, including two in one game. The injuries that season included broken legs for Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., Baltimore Ravens running back Musa Smith, and Tennessee Titans wide out Tyrone Calico. On May 23, 2005, NFL owners voted 27–5 to ban the tackle, with the Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, and San Francisco 49ers voting against. The first year of the ban, only two penalties were called by referees for the horse-collar tackle. Owners voted 25–7 in 2006 to expand the rule to include tackles by the back of the jersey in addition to tackles by the shoulder pads.\n\nRisks\nThe horse-collar is particularly dangerous due to the awkward position of the player being tackled, who will often fall backward in a twisting motion with one or both legs trapped under the weight of his body. This is exacerbated if the player's foot gets caught in the turf and by the additional weight of the defender.  Potential injuries include sprains or tears to ligaments in the knees and ankles (including the ACL and MCL), and fractures of the tibia and fibula. Smith, for instance, was effectively sidelined for two seasons after a horse-collar tackle by Williams broke his right tibia.\nThe ban states that a horse-collar tackle is an open-field tackle in which a defender uses the shoulder pads or jersey to immediately bring a ball carrier down. The term \"open field\" means that horse-collar tackles committed near the line of scrimmage will be allowed.\n\nPunishment\nIn the NFL, the horse-collar tackle results in a 15-yard major foul penalty and an automatic first down if committed by the defense, and the penalty is assessed as if it were a dead ball, after the play foul,  if the opposing offense gains yards. It will often also result in a league-imposed fine on the player. Roy Williams was the first player suspended for repeated violations of the rule. The one-game suspension was given following a horse-collar tackle on Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb that occurred on December 16, 2007, and it was Williams' third violation of the rule of the 2007 season.The tackle was made illegal in the CFL for the 2007 season. The horse collar tackle was legal through the 2007–2008 season in college football but was banned by the NCAA after criticism from pundits and coaches for the 2008–2009 season as part of a package that adopted several NFL rules into the college game.The National Federation of State High School Associations added a penalty for horse-collar tackles for the 2009 season.\nPassage 5:\nRex Boggan\nRex Reed Boggan (March 27, 1930 – December 8, 1985) was an American football player. \nBoggan was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1930. He attended Memphis Technical High School in Memphis, Tennessee.He attended the University of Mississippi and played college football at the tackle position for the Ole Miss Rebels football team from 1949 to 1950 and in 1954. Between 1950 and 1953, his college career was interrupted by his service in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. In December 1953, he was selected as the most valuable player from the Navy and Marine Corps football teams of 1953. As a senior, he led the 1954 Ole Miss Rebels football team to the SEC championship and the No 6 ranking in the final AP poll. He was selected by the Associated Press as a first-team player on its 1954 All-America college football team.Boggan was drafted by the New York Giants in the 20th round of the 1952 NFL Draft and played for the Giants during the 1955 season at the defensive tackle position. He appeared in 11 NFL games, all of them as a starter. In August 1956, a large calcium deposit fused the two major bones in his right leg. The condition ended his football career.Boggan died in 1985 after suffering a heart attack at his home in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\nPassage 6:\nDallas Texans (NFL)\nThe Dallas Texans played in the National Football League (NFL) for one season, 1952, with a record of 1–11.\nThe Texans are considered one of the worst teams in NFL history, both on and off the field, and while based in Dallas, they were later based in Hershey, Pennsylvania and Akron, Ohio during their only season. After the team folded, the league awarded its assets to the new Baltimore Colts (who moved to Indianapolis in 1984).\nProfessional football returned to Dallas in 1960, as the American Football League (AFL) commenced operations with one of its eight charter members in Dallas (also called the Texans), while the NFL added the Dallas Cowboys.\nWhile both franchises have proved far more successful both on and off the field, only the Cowboys remained in Dallas: the AFL Texans moved to Kansas City and were re-branded the Chiefs in 1963.\nIn 1974, the World Football League placed a team in Texas called the Houston Texans. The team transferred to Shreveport, Louisiana before the 1974 season was finished. In 2002, the NFL would revive the Houston Texans nickname when it added a new franchise called the Houston Texans as its 32nd franchise.\nSince their demise, the Dallas Texans are regarded as being the last NFL franchise to collapse outright and permanently cease operations: none of the Colts, the AFL/NFL Texans/Chiefs, the Cowboys, or the modern NFL Texans claim any relationship with the earlier 1952 Texans franchise or its predecessors (including NFL charter member the Dayton Triangles), despite the players and assets remaining contiguous.\n\nHistory\nAfter the 1951 season, the financially troubled New York Yanks franchise, originally founded as the Dayton Triangles, was put on the market by Ted Collins, who had founded the franchise in 1944 as the Boston Yanks before moving it to New York City in 1949, rebranding them as the Bulldogs, and rebranded it again as the Yanks in 1950. After failing to find a buyer, Collins sold the team back to the League.\nOn January 29, 1952, a Dallas-based group led by a pair of young millionaires, Giles Miller and his brother Connell, completed the purchase of what was ostensibly a new franchise: the first-ever major league sports team based in Texas. However, the Millers also acquired the entire Yanks roster in the sale; thus, for all intents and purposes, the brothers bought the Yanks and relocated them to Dallas.\nHome games were set for the 75,000-seat Cotton Bowl, home stadium of the Southern Methodist University Mustangs: the Millers originally wanted to name the team the Rangers, but decided to call them the Texans instead.\n\n1952 season\nThe Millers believed that the growing state of Texas, with its longstanding support of college and high school football, would be a natural fit for the NFL to move farther south and west, while the team owners approved the move with an 11–1 vote.\nWhile Giles Miller had declared \"There is room in Texas for all kinds of football\", the opening game against the New York Giants set the tone for the season and the franchise. While the Texans scored the first touchdown, they missed the extra point and did not score again, losing 24–6 in front of only 17,499 fans at the Cotton Bowl.\nFan interest quickly waned as the team collapsed to 0–9 and showed no sign of being competitive. In the four games the Texans played at the Cotton Bowl, they lost all four by an average of eighteen points, and drew a total of only 54,065 fans: this was by far the lowest in the League, and barely half of the 25,000 per game required for the team to break even. The nadir came in a November 9 game against the Los Angeles Rams, a 27–6 blowout loss which attracted only 10,000 fans, and as it turned out, would be the last game the Texans would play in Texas.\nBy this time, the Millers had sustained losses of $250,000, a staggering sum by 1950s standards, and were unable to meet payroll. The situation was exacerbated by the woeful ticket sales and an inability to get any financial support from local businesses – an important factor even in this decade – to cover these debts, or even operating expenses. Unlike present economic arrangements in which the NFL's multi-billion-dollar television contracts essentially underwrite the league's franchises, teams in this era had no hope of remaining solvent without local support. NFL games were not carried on national TV at all until 1953, and then only on the now-long-defunct DuMont Television Network, for a pittance compared to the contracts of today. Only two Texans games were televised: October 12 against the Bears in Chicago on ABC, and the Thanksgiving game [see below], also against the Bears, on DuMont.The Millers had seen enough, selling the team back to the league on November 14, with five games remaining in the season. Afterwards, the NFL moved the franchise's operations temporarily to Hershey, Pennsylvania (though it kept the Dallas Texans name), and moved the Texans' last two home games out of Dallas, thus making them a traveling team.\n\nThe team played one of its remaining two relocated home games at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio, where the franchise tallied its only win under the Texans moniker, an upset over the Chicago Bears of George Halas, in front of a meager crowd of only 2,208 fans on Thanksgiving Day. This remains the smallest crowd at any NFL game since 1939 (excluding 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited attendance).\nAs a measure of how low the NFL ranked on the sports scene in the early 1950s, the Akron high school Championship Game played at the Rubber Bowl that morning attracted 14,284 fans, far outdrawing the afternoon's professional contest.Head coach Jim Phelan jokingly suggested because of the small turnout, the Texans players should \"go into the stands and shake hands with each fan,\" while Halas had been so certain that the Bears would overpower the lowly Texans that he started only his second-string players. The Texans jumped out to a 20–2 lead, and after a Bears rally, scored a touchdown with 34 seconds left for an upset 27–23 win.\nWith the victory, the NFL avoided having a franchise with a winless regular season, something that had not happened since 1944.The team's final game was a 41–6 blowout loss at the hands of the Detroit Lions: while this game had been scheduled to be played in Dallas, it was moved to Detroit after the league took over the team, thus forcing the Texans (who were the designated home team) to make their second trip of the year to Briggs Stadium – this game drew 12,252 fans, less than one-third of the average for the Lions' home games that year. Two weeks later, the Lions won the NFL Championship.\nGeorge Taliaferro, the team's leading rusher, was selected to the Pro Bowl at the end of the season.\n\nThe end of the Texans\nFor all intents and purposes, the conclusion of the Texans' brief history was written before they even played their last game. Unable to find a buyer for the team, but not wanting to outright contract the franchise (which would have unbalanced the schedule), the NFL quickly began to solicit bids from other cities. The week after the Texans' Thanksgiving upset, the NFL granted a new franchise to a Baltimore-based ownership group headed by Baltimorean Carroll Rosenbloom, and awarded it the remaining assets (including the players) of the failed Texans. Rosenbloom named his new franchise the Baltimore Colts (after the unrelated previous team from the competing All-America Football Conference, which merged with the NFL in 1950).\nThe Colts (who relocated to Indianapolis in 1984) do not claim the history of the earlier Triangles/Dodgers/Tigers/Yanks/Bulldogs/Yanks/Texans as their own, despite the Colts' inaugural 1953 roster including many of the players from the previous season's Texans, and a number of players from the 1950-1951 Yanks. Likewise, the NFL considers the new Colts to be a 1953 expansion team and not a continuation of the original Colts, the charter NFL member Triangles or any other franchise.\nAs a result, the Texans are officially recognized by the NFL as being the League's last team to date to permanently cease operations and not be included in the lineage of any current franchise.\n\nAfter the Texans\nAlthough the NFL rapidly grew more prosperous during the latter part of the 1950s (especially after the success of \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\", the 1958 Championship Game at Yankee Stadium between the vaunted New York Giants and the developing Colts, leading to a later profitable nationwide television contract), the 1952 debacle in Dallas left the NFL leery of further expansion.\nUnable to persuade other NFL owners to reconsider, Texas oil scion Lamar Hunt, with others, founded the American Football League as a direct competitor to the older NFL.\nWhen Hunt's own Dallas Texans were announced as charter members of the new league, the NFL quickly reconsidered its position on expansion, and made a second venture into Dallas in 1960, establishing what would become a far more successful team, the Dallas Cowboys (briefly known in the beginning as the Dallas Rangers: a minor league baseball team of that same name was expected to disband, but didn't, so the \"Cowboys\" name was later adopted for the NFL team in mid-March 1960).Both franchises shared the Cotton Bowl (also the home of Southern Methodist University's (SMU) Mustangs) stadium for their first three seasons. The Cowboys were even more woeful on the field in their inaugural season, enduring a winless season with an 0-11-1 record, and would not post a winning record until 1966, while the AFL Texans, after going .500 over their first two seasons in the new league, would capture the 1962 AFL Championship after defeating the cross-state rival Houston Oilers in double overtime. Both teams also initially struggled to draw enough fans to the Cotton Bowl to turn a profit, but unlike the 1952 Texans they both had owners in Hunt and the Cowboys' Clint Murchison, Jr. with the resources and patience to absorb early losses.\nNevertheless, by the Texans' 1962 championship season they were being consistently outdrawn at the gate by the Cowboys. Hunt, realizing he had no realistic prospect of the Texans competing with the NFL's Cowboys in Dallas, relocated his team to Kansas City and rebranded them as the Chiefs, the second and last of two occasions that a professional American football champion has played the following season in another city.The Texans nickname was later revived by the NFL for the Houston Texans, an expansion team awarded in 2002 to fill the void left after the Oilers relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 1997, subsequently being rebranded as the Tennessee Titans.\n\nNotable players\nPro Football Hall of Fame\nOthers\nJack Adkisson, more famous as professional wrestler - Fritz Von Erich\nJoe Campanella, as Baltimore Colts' general manager in 1967\nBrad Ecklund\nWeldon Humble\nChuck Ortmann\nGeorge Taliaferro\nFrank Tripucka\nBuddy Young\nGeorge Young, Baltimore high school and NFL coach with the Baltimore Colts, Miami Dolphins and general manager of the New York Giants, then later NFL executive staff.\n\nFirst round draft selection\nAfter Richter, a star at the University of California, made it clear he did not want to play for Dallas, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, sending him closer to home. While the Rams sent a whopping eleven players to Dallas in exchange - still the second-biggest trade involving a single player in NFL history as of 2022 - the deal turned out to be very lopsided in the Rams' favor.\nRichter went on to play nine seasons in Los Angeles and be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while of the eleven players sent to Dallas, defensive back/end Tom Keane was the only one of the eleven who lasted in the League beyond 1952, making All-Pro for the Baltimore Colts in 1953 before he retired in 1955. Of the remaining ten players, four did not last beyond the Texans' only season, and six never played another down of professional football.\n\nSeason-by-season\n1952 results\n^ moved from Dallas\nPassage 7:\nHarry Schuh\nHarry Frederick Schuh (September 25, 1942 – May 20, 2013) was an American professional football player who was a tackle in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL).\n\nBiography\nSchuh played college football with the Memphis Tigers and was named an All-American in 1963 and  1964. He was the third overall player selected in the 1965 AFL draft, after Joe Namath and Larry Elkins. \nHe played for the AFL's Oakland Raiders from 1965 through 1969 as the starting right tackle, winning the AFL Championship in 1967 and playing in the Second AFL-NFL World Championship Game.  \nSchuh was an AFL Western Division All-Star in 1967, an AFL All-League tackle in 1969, and an AFC selection for the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl in 1970 as a member of the NFL's Raiders, but he was traded before the 1971 season for his replacement at right tackle, Bob Brown, an eventual member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nSchuh finished his career with the Green Bay Packers. He was a member of the Raiders' All-Time Team.\n\nDeath\nSchuh died in Memphis, Tennessee on May 20, 2013.\nPassage 8:\nList of Iowa State Cyclones in the NFL Draft\nThe Iowa State Cyclones college football team competes as part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and represents the Iowa State University in the Big 12 Conference (Big 12). ISU has had 130 players drafted into the National Football League (NFL) since the first draft held in 1936, through the 2021 NFL Draft. ISU has only seen one player taken in the first round, George Amundson with the 14th overall pick in the 1973 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. Troy Davis was drafted in the third round of the 1997 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints; he has since been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Kelechi Osemele was drafted in the second round of the 2012 NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens; he went on to win Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens as their starting right tackle. Six former Cyclones who were drafted have been selected to a Pro Bowl or AFL All-Star Game.\nThrough the annual NFL Draft, each NFL franchise gets the chance to add new players to their teams. The current draft rules were established in 2009. The team with the worst record the previous year gets to pick first, then the next-worst team picks second, and so on. Teams that were not in the playoffs receive their draft order by their regular-season record. If 2 or more non-playoff teams have the same record, the tie breaker used is their strength of schedule. Playoff teams receive their draft order after all the non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).In 1944, the All-America Football Conference was established and it began play in 1946 in direct competition with the NFL. From 1946 to 1949, the two leagues fiercely competed for the top college football prospects with each league holding their own drafts, before the AAFC finally merged with the NFL at the end of the 1949 season.\nLike the AAFC earlier, the American Football League (AFL) operated in direct competition with the NFL and held a separate draft. This led to a massive bidding war over top prospects between the two leagues. As part of the merger agreement on June 8, 1966, the two leagues would hold a multiple round \"Common Draft\". Once the AFL officially merged with the NFL in 1970, the \"Common Draft\" simply became the NFL Draft.\n\nKey\nSelections\nNotable undrafted players\nNote: No drafts held before 1920\n\nSee also\nList of Iowa State University people\nIowa State Cyclones football\nHistory of Iowa State Cyclones football\nList of Iowa State Cyclones football All-Americans\nIowa State Cyclones football statistical leaders\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nVaughn Martin\nVaughn Martin (born April 18, 1986) is a Jamaican-born Canadian former American football defensive tackle. He was most recently a member of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round of the 2009 NFL Draft, the first Canadian university football player drafted by an NFL team as an underclassman. He played university football at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nEarly years\nMartin was born in Jamaica and raised in Toronto and London, Ontario. He attended London South Collegiate Institute, playing football for head coach Chris Marcus, and later Mike Stenning. He also attended The Kiski School under coach Marcus Muster for a short time before transferring.  He competed as a linebacker, defensive end, defensive tackle and fullback in high school, recording 90 tackles with five stops behind the line of scrimmage in 2004. The three-time starter was rated one of the top 12 defensive ends in Ontario by All-Star Football and Weir's Magazine. He also received a two-star prospect rating from Rivals.com.Prior to beginning his collegiate career, Martin competed for two summers with the Forest City Thunderbirds in the Central Ontario Football League. He also was a member of Team Canada, playing in the 2006 NFL Global Junior Championship in Detroit. He was named to the NFL Global Junior Championship X All-Tournament Team after helping Team Canada to a perfect 5-0 record, including five shutouts.\n\nUniversity career\nMartin turned down scholarship offers from the University of Toledo, the University at Buffalo, and Ohio University to enroll at Michigan State University in 2006, but failed to qualify due to academic transcript issues. He then enrolled at Milford Academy, a preparatory school in New York. He later returned home to Ontario, where University of Western Ontario assistant coach Mickey Donovan along with special teams coach Chris Marcus — Vaughn's high-school coach and mentor — convinced him to enroll.\nMartin joined the Western Ontario Mustangs football team and saw action at defensive tackle and end during his first season. In 2008, Martin performed mostly at defensive tackle earlier in the year, but he also at defensive end. In 12 games, he collected 36 tackles (22 solos) with 3.5 sacks, 7.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and 13 pressures. He returned an interception for a touchdown, registered a safety, caused a fumble and recovered two others. He also played fullback, where he scored twice on a pair of 3-yard rushing attempts, finishing with 10 yards on four carries.\n\nProfessional career\nPre-draft\nMartin was not invited to the 2009 NFL Scouting Combine, but impressed several pro scouts in the spring of 2009 when he participated at the University of Michigan's Pro Day, where he ran a 4.96 second 40-yard dash at 330 pounds. He also set the 2009 draft class bench press record, lifting 225 pounds 44 times.\n\nSan Diego Chargers\nMartin became the first CIS football player drafted as an underclassman when he was picked in the fourth round, 113th overall, by the San Diego Chargers in the 2009 NFL Draft. Martin signed a four-year contract with the Chargers in July 2009. Athletic and intelligent—he scored an impressive 38 on the NFL's Wonderlic Test—scouts also report that he has the bulk, strength, and agility to become a nose tackle like Jamal Williams. He recorded his first career sack on November 22, 2010, against the Denver Broncos, sacking quarterback Kyle Orton.\nOn May 8, 2011, the Montreal Alouettes selected Vaughn Martin in the 5th round of the 2011 CFL Draft. His rights belonged to the Alouettes if Martin choose to pursue a career in the CFL.\n\nMiami Dolphins\nMartin signed with the Miami Dolphins as a free agent on March 28, 2013. On November 8, 2013, he was released.\n\nDetroit Lions\nMartin signed with the Detroit Lions on March 13, 2014.   He was released on June 2, 2014.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nMartin signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in February 2015. He was released on August 30, 2015.\n\nMontreal Alouettes\nMartin signed a two-year contract with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League on February 10, 2016. Martin played in seven games during the 2016 CFL season before being released in August, about halfway through the season.\nPassage 10:\nShane Bannon\nShane Bannon (born April 20, 1989) is a former American football fullback in the National Football League (NFL).  He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs out of Yale University in the seventh round (223rd pick overall) in the 2011 NFL Draft.  Bannon is the first Yale Football player to be drafted by an NFL team since the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted tight end Nate Lawrie in the sixth round (181st pick overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. The Chiefs waived Bannon on September 3, 2011. After he cleared waivers, he was signed to the Chiefs practice squad.

Since 2006 he has been producing and directing the four-part documentary film series Standing on Sacred Ground, which premiered in 2013 at the Mill Valley Film Festival and aired nationally on PBS in 2015. Standing on Sacred Ground  features eight indigenous communities around the world fighting to protect their sacred places. The award-winning series visits Altaians in Russia, the Winnemem Wintu in northern California, Papua New Guinea, the tar sands of Canada, the Gamo Highlands of Ethiopia, Peru, Australia and Hawaii. McLeod produced and directed the award-winning documentary In the Light of Reverence (2001) and has made three other award-winning documentary films: The Four Corners: A National Sacrifice Area? (1983) with Glenn Switkes and Randy Hayes, (Winner of the Student Academy Award). Downwind/Downstream (1988) with Robert Lewis, and NOVA: Poison in the Rockies (1990). His first film was the 9-minute short The Cracking of Glen Canyon Damn—with Edward Abbey and Earth First! (1982) with Glenn Switkes and Randy Hayes.

It was directed by Matt Myers, who also wrote the film's script and served as its narrator.\n\nSynopsis\nThe documentary looks at the Tar Creek Superfund Site and chronicles the long-term effects of mining, tribal relations, United States Environmental Protection Agency management. The land within the perimeters of this environmental disaster was bad enough that the federal government bought out the homes of citizens living there and moved them away.\n\nReception\nThe Library Journal rated the film favorably, writing \"This grim exploration of our toxic legacy doesn't spare mine owners, bureaucrats, or politicians. Although regulations are much stricter today, viewers will ask themselves whether any agency is willing or able to remediate former mine sites properly.\" The Journalism & Mass Communication Educator wrote a predominantly positive review where they praised the film for its attention to personal details while also noting \"The film’s interviews are striking, but lack a sense of coherence.\" The Capital Times was slightly more mixed in their review, stating \"Myers is a folksy and poetic narrator, although the tone of the film gets needlessly preachy toward the end. He found a good selection of people to interview – scientists, social workers, politicians, elderly ex-miners, displaced residents – but the selection leaned a little too heavy on officials. I would have liked to hear more from a family or child's perspective.\"\nPassage 3:\nSnegithiye\nSnegithiye (transl. Oh (female) friend!) is a 2000 Tamil-language mystery thriller film directed by Priyadarshan. The film notably features only female characters, played by Tabu, Jyothika, Sharbani Mukherjee and Ishita Arun. Music was composed by Vidyasagar. The film, released in 2000, proved to be an average grosser at the box office but bagged positive reviews from critics. Originally planned to be made as a bilingual, in Tamil and in Malayalam, the film released first in Tamil only, while the Malayalam version, Raakilipattu, as well as the dubbed Hindi version, Friendship, released seven years later. The film's story is loosely based on the 1999 Marathi film Bindhaast written by Chandrakant Kulkarni.\n\nPlot\nBest friends Vani \"Vasu\" Subramaniyam  and Radhika are carefree pranksters at a prestigious ladies' college in Chennai. They stay up late, break rules and wreak havoc at their hostel, much to their lecturers' annoyance. They also form a rivalry against Gita, the college queen bee. Malathi,  Radhika's aunt, wants her niece to complete her studies, so that she can take over her late parents' multi-million business. In order to straighten Radhika out, Malathi arranges for her to get married.\nAt this point, Vasu and Radhika are introduced to Gayathri, a fiercely independent and strong police officer and an alumnus of their college. During an event at the college, Gayathri explains how women in the country lose their independence and livelihood after getting married. Convinced that they should avoid marriage as long as possible, Vani and Radhika pretend that Radhika has a boyfriend from overseas, named Ramesh, in order to avoid Malathi from arranging anymore suitors. However, this fantasy takes a whole new turn when an actual person named Ramesh calls and sends Radhika letters, claiming to be her boyfriend. To end this nuisance, Vasu and Radhika invite Ramesh to their hostel during the college dance program and plan to trick him into blurt out the truth. Vasu instructs Radhika to bring her aunt's guns for their safety.\nHowever, a mysterious shooter kills Ramesh before the girls can confront him. Fearing that suspicion would fall on them, they decide to dispose of the body by hiding it in the air ventilator. Unexpectedly, the body slides down the vent and lands on the auditorium stage, in the middle of a performance. Gayathri, who is the guest of honour at the event, takes charge of the case. She finds Radhika's necklace on the body and the two girls are brought in for questioning. At the police station, an old woman shows up claiming that Ramesh is her son and has gone missing. Realising that the noose is tightening and that the story of their innocence would not stand, Vasu and Radhika escape police custody and hide in an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of the city.\nNow the prime suspects of Ramesh's murder, they decide to find the real killer before Gayathri catches up to them. Vasu suspects Malathi of framing them in order to inherit Radhika's wealth. When they finally meet her, Malathi explains that she had known all along that the girls had been fooling her. The young man who was pretending to be Ramesh, was actually a family friend, named Vikram, whom Malathi had been planning to marry Radhika off to.\nThrough their college friends, the girls discover that Gita had gone missing on that fateful night. After much difficulty, the girls find Gita hiding in at a border town. However, Gita reveals that she too is on the run from Gayathri, because she had witnessed Gayathri killing Vikram [aka Ramesh] that night. On the night of the murder, she had returned to the hostel to take some medications and had inadvertently witnessed the murder and had fled from the scene, fearing Gayathri would use her influence to cover up the crime. Unfortunately, Gayathri manages to catch up on the trio. However, the woman who had pretended to be Ramesh's mother arrives on the scene. She turns out to be a CBI officer, who had been investigating Gayathri and knows that the girls are not responsible for Vikram's murder.\nGayathri ends up having a mental breakdown. The CBI officer reveals that Gayathri had murdered Vikram to avenge her sister's paralysis. Vikram had raped Gayathri's sister in the past after Gayathri found out he was a womaniser and stopped her sister from dating him. To escape justice, she had no choice but to frame Vasu and Radhika as the murderers. The film concludes with Gayathri institutionalised at a mental asylum where the three girls, now close friends, pay her a visit.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe original story idea for the film was taken from Marathi writer Chandrakant Kulkarni, who had made the successful Marathi film, Bindhaast, based on the story last year. Priyadarshan heard about the film and asked producer Mukesh Mehta to see it and decide whether he would like to produce the movie and thus Mehta went to Bombay, saw the film and liked it. However the producer reiterated that they have taken only the main thread from the Marathi story with the rest of the film, its sub-plots and the treatment are completely different from the original. Initially, it was planned as a Malayalam film with a cast familiar to the Kerala audience. But as Priyadarshan's excitement over the project grew, the canvas got wider and the producer decided to look for a bigger audience. Thus Jyothika, Sharbani Mukherjee and Ishita Arun, daughter of Ila Arun, stepped in to give it a more national flavour. Seasoned actresses like Sukumari, Manorama, Lakshmi, KPAC Lalitha, Mita Vasisht, Tabu, and  Dipti Bhatnagar also joined the all-female team. Cinematographer Jeeva and art director Sabu Cyril also joined the team and they shot 90 per cent of the film in a college in Mysuru (previously Mysore) and the rest in Chennai (Madras), also featuring live coverage of the Dasara (Dussera) festival of Mysuru. The film was subsequently made simultaneously in Tamil and Malayalam with a title of   Raakilipattu, while a Hindi version was also planned in 2000. The title of the Tamil version of the film was taken from a song from the 2000 Mani Ratnam film Alaipayuthey. This movie was also dubbed in Kannada language with the title \"Yen hudgiro Yaking hadthiro\". The movie was not released due to protests across Karnataka after the kidnapping of Kannada idol Raj Kumar by Veerappan.\nJyothika prioritised her work in the project and thus delayed her schedules for Uyirile Kalanthathu in order to ensure the film was released as early as possible. The songs of the film were released at Devi Theatre with Kamal Haasan appearing as the chief guest.\n\nRelease\nRelease for the film was postponed several times with the makers hoping to get a simultaneous release for all versions. The team also noted the kidnapping of Kannada actor Rajkumar by bandit Veerappan as reason for the delay. Snegithiye opened to positive reviews but performed averagely at box office. However the film went on to inspire other film makers to produce all women ventures, with director Gnanasekharan announcing that his project, Aishwarya, starring Uma, Monal and Abhinayashree would be a \"small-scale Snegithiye\".The film was dubbed and released in Hindi in 2007 as Friendship, but went unnoticed after arriving with very little publicity. Despite originally being planned in only Malayalam, Raakilipattu was released in Kerala, only in 2007.\n\nSoundtrack\nWhile S. P. Venkatesh composed the film score, all the songs were composed by Vidyasagar, except \"Kannukulle\" which was composed by Raghunath Seth as mentioned in the original audio cassette. The songs were well received by the audience. Lyrics were written by Vairamuthu, Pa. Vijay and Kadhalmathi.\n\nTrack listing\nPassage 4:\nSingle Video Theory\nSingle Video Theory is a music documentary directed by Mark Pellington that follows the making of Yield, the fifth album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam. It was released first on VHS on August 4, 1998, and then on DVD on November 24, 1998.\n\nOverview\nThe film was shot in 16mm film over three days in November 1997 in downtown Seattle. It features interviews with the band members and behind-the-scenes footage of the band's rehearsal sessions for its shows opening for The Rolling Stones. The term \"single video theory\" is a play on the \"single-bullet theory,\" involving the assassination of John F.

It stars Rishi Kapoor, Divya Bharti, and Shah Rukh Khan (in his film debut). The film revolves around an effervescent girl Kaajal (Bharti), depicting her travails as a widow after the disappearance of her husband Ravi (Kapoor) and how her obsessive lover Raja (Khan) wins her over.\nThe story for Deewana was written by Ranbir Pushp. Guddu Dhanoa, Lalit Kapoor and Raju Kothari had co-produced the film under the banner, Mayank Arts. The cinematography was handled by Harmeet Singh while A. Muthu edited it. The duo Nadeem-Shravan composed the award-winning soundtrack for the film with lyrics penned by Sameer. The muhurat shot for the film took place on 14 July 1991.\nUpon its premiere on 25 June 1992, Deewana was well received by critics, and emerged as a major commercial success, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of the year, with a worldwide gross of about ₹162 million (US$2.0 million), surpassed only by Beta. The soundtrack album turned out to be a chartbuster and was the highest-selling soundtrack of the year. The success of the film consolidated both Khan and Bharti's foothold in the industry, and launched Kanwar's directorial career. At the 38th Filmfare Awards, it received 9 nominations, and won 5 awards including Best Male Debut (Khan) and Best Female Debut (Bharti).\n\nPlot\nKajal, a beautiful young lady, falls in love with Ravi, a rich and handsome man. They happily marry with the full blessings of Ravi's mother, Lakshmi Devi. Ravi's greedy uncle Dhirendra and cousin Narendra are disappointed to hear of this, because they are next in line to inherit the family's vast wealth after Ravi. Dhirendra hires hoodlums to murder Ravi. The hoodlums, along with Narendra, try to murder Ravi. What happens in the struggle is that Ravi manages to kill his cousin Narendra and both of them topple over a cliff in the general confusion. The hoodlums flee. The news reaches Ravi's family. Widowed and depressed, Kajal moves to another city along with Ravi's mother Lakshmi Devi.\nRaja, a handsome, rich, jobless and good-hearted guy riding a motorcycle, accidentally knocks down Lakshmi Devi on the street, takes her to her home, and thus meets Kajal. He falls in love with Kajal, and tries to express it, but she cuts him short and reveals that she is already married and a widow. Taken aback briefly, Raja returns with his suit, but Kajal continues to resist his advances. Raja's rich father, Ramakant, dislikes the idea of his son marrying a widow and tries to get rid of Kajal. After this, Raja quarrels with his father and begs Lakshmi Devi for marriage with her widowed daughter-in-law. Lakshmi Devi persuades Kajal to marry Raja, saying that Kajal has a long life ahead of her, she has no child, and will be totally alone after Lakshmi Devi's death. Kajal finally accepts second marriage at her mother-in-law's behest. Lakshmi Devi conveys the acceptance to Raja, but she also tells him how reluctant Kajal was, and advises him that even after the wedding, he should go slow and not approach Kajal in a sexual way until she genuinely, in a heartfelt way, accepts him as her husband.\nNews of Raja's forthcoming engagement is the last straw for his father, who throws him out without further ado. Raja now has to look for a job. His friends open a garage with him. He meets with an accident and is hospitalised. Kajal rushes to see and realises that she is in fact in love for him. They begin a new phase, with reciprocal affection for each other.\nRaja, who is obviously very accident-prone, meets with yet another fortuitous accident. The man at the other end of the accident becomes a great friend of Raja. Little does Raja know that this man is none other than Kajal's wedded husband and Lakshmi Devi's much-mourned son, Ravi.\nWhen Raja introduces Ravi to Kajal, she is shocked by learning that Ravi survived Dhirendra's attempt to murder him. However, she stays with Raja. Dhirendra learns about Ravi. He kidnaps Kajal and Raja, demanding Ravi's property in exchange. Raja escapes and beats Dhirendra along with Ravi. They find Kajal tied up with a bomb strapped around her. Ravi manages to switch off it. Dhirendra returns only to kill Raja. Ravi pushes him and sets the bomb off, causing a large explosion that kills the two for all.

(special appearance)\n\nProduction\nIn the early 1990s, Ranbir Pushp conceived the story of Deewana, and Guddu Dhanoa being pleased with it, decided to bankroll the film under his own production banner, Mayank Arts. In an interview to Rediff.com, Raj Kanwar, who had previously worked as an assistant director to Shekhar Kapur in films such as Mr. India (1987) and Ghayal (1990), revealed that he was approached by Dhanoa to direct Deewana, becoming his directorial debut. Lalit Kapoor and Raju Kothari co–produced the film along with Dhanoa.Rishi Kapoor was the first person to be signed, he being Kanwar's first choice. He was given a remuneration of ₹1 million (US$13,000). For the female lead, Madhuri Dixit had been Kanwar's initial choice. Her unavailability and lack of dates led to the casting of Divya Bharti, on the recommendation of Guddu Dhanoa's friend and the former's manager, Jatin Rajguru. Dhanoa addressed Bharti to be \"time-punctual\" and that once she refused to get off her car as she had come a bit late for the shoot.Kanwar had several actors in mind for the role of Raja. Some of them included Armaan Kohli, Sunny Deol, Anil Kapoor, Govinda and Telugu actor Nagarjuna. Kohli had shot for it a few days, but later opted out citing a misunderstanding between him and Shabnam Kapoor (wife of Lalit Kapoor, one of the producers of the film) on the sets of Insaaf Ki Devi (1992). Shah Rukh Khan, then a budding artist, was finally selected. Kanwar had liked his performance in Circus and Dil Dariya and thus suggested his name to the producers. He worked in the film alongside his prior commitments to Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992), his other film which was supposed to mark his debut. He expressed his enjoyment on hearing that [Rishi Kapoor] was also a part of the film.Principal photography took place in and around Mumbai and Ooty, being handled by Harmeet Singh. B. H. Tarun Kumar was the choreographer while Ram Shetty and Harish Shetty were the action directors. Leena Daru acted as the costume designer. Songs were shot at various locations in Ooty, such as the Botanical Gardens and Ooty Lake. After filming ended by early 1992, it was edited by A. Muthu.\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack album features 7 songs composed by Nadeem-Shravan, a duo. Sameer wrote the lyrics and Kumar Sanu (singing for Kapoor), Sadhana Sargam, Alka Yagnik (both singing for Bharti), and Vinod Rathod (singing for Khan) performed the vocals. The album sold between 7 million and 8 million units, making it the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack album of 1992.The soundtrack album is featured by Planet Bollywood in their listing of \"100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks\". News18 included \"Aisi Deewangi\" as one of the \"5 Memorable Songs of Divya Bharti\" and raved about her presence in it by saying that it made \"people swoon over her as well the tune. Her effortless beauty, along with her charming on-screen chemistry with Shahrukh Khan multiplied the X-Factors and made it a delightful watch.\" Rediff listed it among the \"10 Amazing Nadeem-Shravan songs\".\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on 25 June 1992. It was promoted with the tagline The Power of Love. When director Raj Kanwar had gone to attend the first screening of the film, along with the distributers, he was shocked to find the theatre deserted. But later, they found it swarming with mostly college kids, ensuring that the film became a blockbuster. It ran at theatres for 50 weeks and emerged a golden jubilee film. According to the film-trade website Box Office India, it collected ₹140 million (US$1.8 million) worldwide and became the second highest-grossing film of the year, surpassed only by Beta. It was made available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video since 2020.\n\nReception\nDeewana received positive reviews from critics upon release, with major praise directed towards its [cinematography], soundtrack and the cast performances, particularly that of Bharti and Khan. Nikhat Kazmi published a review of the film in The Times of India on 28 June 1992, writing that Khan's role is clichéd but he was able to \"interpret it with a fresh zeal and wafts across like a breeze in the traditional role of a young man obsessed with love. Angry, confused, tender, mature and childishly rebellious, Deewana marks the advent of a new talent\". On 31 July, a writer in The Indian Express praised the film's cinematography and songs but was critical to its story which he called \"no more than a routine melodrama\". The writer added that Bharti had a \"pretty ... but ... thin\" role and \"there is nothing she can do about it\". He further observed that Khan is \"fairly impressive and brings some life to a conventional role\". In an interview, while reviewing the film by himself, Khan said that his performance in the film was \"awful–loud, vulgar and uncontrolled\" and that he \"overacted terribly\" in it. According to him, he hasn't contributed anyway to the film's success, and credited Nadeem–Shravan's music for the same, while also praising the performances of Kapoor and Bharti.Modern film reviewers, however, appreciated Deewana. In 2007, the author Anupama Chopra described the film as a \"crude and melodramatic\" work, with Khan's performance being \"equally loud\". She said that the film established his position as a leading actor of Hindi cinema, despite his \"over-the-top\" performance. Rachit Gupta of Filmfare in 2014 stated, \"Divya seemed at ease sharing screen space with Rishi Kapoor. She also matched Shah Rukh Khan's manic intensity emotion to emotion. She fit perfectly into the character of a woman dealing with the loss of her husband.\" In 2018, Sampada Sharma from The Indian Express wrote that her performance is unforgettable, adding, \"From playing a newly married girl to being the one who is at a crossroads in her life, Deewana was Divya's film and she delivered a performance that was applause-worthy.\"\n\nAccolades\nTheme\nDeewana deals with the central theme of love. [Raj Kanwar] had compared the role of [Divya Bharti] to that of female roles in his other films like Laadla (1994), Jaan (1996), Jeet (1996) and Judaai (1997) stating that they all were \"strong female characters\", portraying either the plight of women or displaying the acting prowess of the respective actresses. The film also shows how individuals become \"obsessed\" while in love, through the character of [Khan]. He himself talked about this as a lesson he learnt from the film while at University of Edinburgh to receive an honorary degree. Several critics compared [Rishi Kapoor]'s role to that in Chandni (1989) for in both the films, he was portrayed as the sacrificing husband. In another aspect, [Deewana] emerged as the pathbreaking Bollywood love triangle with its storyline portraying the first lover to be sacrificer, a reversal to the general rule.\n\nLegacy\nDeewana has been regarded as one of the earliest Indian films based on the social stigma of widow remarriage. The film's music, being composed by the duo [Nadeem-Shravan], became a multi-platinum success. [Divya Bharti]'s performance fetched her critical appreciation;  the film's title became synonymous with her. The film is also notable for being the debut film of [Shah Rukh Khan]. Despite having limited screen presence in the second half of the film, his portrayal of an obsessive lover achieved him a major career breakthrough. The song \"Koi Na Koi Chahiye\" picturised on him has gradually gathered a cult following. Ashok Raj described his role as \"A small-town commoner who stalks a rich widow to gain access to a prosperous lifestyle.\" News18 remarks that Kapoor's \"filmography came to a head\" with Deewana and that it remains it to be one of his most memorable works, his fashion in the film being considered a trendsetter for himself.Additionally, Deewana has been included in many listings—\"500 Greatest Bollywood Movies of the 80s, 90s and 2000s\", \"Top 90 Hindi Movies Of The 1990s\" and \"100 Greatest Bollywood Love Triangle Movies\". The soundtrack album was featured by Planet Bollywood among the \"100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks\" with a conclusion that \"Deewana was simply one of the best albums of the 90s\". India Today ranked Deewana first as one of the \"Top Films of Raj Kanwar\". Filmfare featured it in their listing of \"16 Best Shah Rukh Khan Movies\". Rediff.com has placed the film twice in its listing of \"Top 20 soundtracks of Nadeem–Shravan\" and \"10 Amazing Nadeem–Shravan songs\". The scene where Khan confronts Bharti and throws red colour on her white saree to confess his love to her was included by NDTV as one of the \"Top 10 Holi scenes from Bollywood\". Diptakirti Chaudhuri, a film critic, hailed Deewana to be a pathbreaking film in Bollywood, as it showed a complete contrast to the general storyline of love triangles.The film has been referenced many times in the following years. In Pehla Nasha (1993), Khan says to Deepak Tijori, \"You have done a miracle (Chamatkar) gentleman, I have become a crazy fan ([Deewana]) of you.\" Moreover, in the \"Chennai Express Special - Part 2\" episode of the popular television sitcom Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Popatlal dances along the song \"Koi Na Koi Chahiye\". The film's poster is shown in the film Dhanak. A footage from Deewana is also shown in Fan.\n\nSequel\nA sequel to Deewana was announced in 2013 by the producer Guddu Dhanoa.\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nVolcanic Sprint\nVolcanic Sprint is a 2007 documentary film produced by Steve Dorst and Dan Evans about a grueling mountain race in Africa and the mostly local competitors who compete against tough odds to overcome dire poverty.\n\nSynopsis\nVolcanic Sprint is a documentary film about the Mount Cameroon Race of Hope, which is located in the Southwest Province of Cameroon, in the city of Buea.

Shaam was selected to play the film's main antagonist, a role initially planned to be played by the director himself. Arjun also helped the makers get in touch with composer Ilaiyaraaja to compose two songs for the film. The team shot in Chennai in February 2015, with Oru Melliya Kodu, a dialogue taken from Gautham Vasudev Menon's Yennai Arindhaal (2015), adapted as the film's Tamil title.In April 2015, actress Khushbu was approached to play Arjun's wife in the film but turned down the offer. The actress later sought a public clarification from the team if the story was based on the death of Indian businesswoman, Sunanda Pushkar, and urged the team to narrate the story with sensitivity. Ramesh, however, refused to confirm Kushboo's allegations and turned down her request of divulging the film's plot to the media. During December 2015, the director revealed that production was complete and that postproduction and censoring works were ongoing.\n\nSoundtrack\nKannada track listing\nTamil track listing\n\nRelease\nThe film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Notuku Potu in 2017.\nKannada versionA critic from The Times of India wrote that \"the film is engaging and makes for a good watch\" and \"This non-linear narrative holds the viewer gripped.\" A critic from The Hindu wrote \"The slow paced narration, which is unusual for Kannada audience, uses sound and visuals to get the needed effect, with Ilayaraja's music score succeeding in creating the mood\". A critic from Deccan Herald said that \"The film, which boasts of a surprising twist in the climax and a subtle message, has all trademark Ramesh’s style of film making\".\nTamil versionA critic from The Times of India wrote that \"It is a pity that the film fails to cross that melliya kodu [thin line] between being 'not boring' and 'compelling enough'\". A critic from Deccan Chronicle gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half stars and wrote that \"Despite few glitches, OMK is worth a watch for its gripping making\". A critic from The New Indian Express said that \"Though not one of the best scripts to come out in the suspense-crime format, the film could be a one-time watch for lovers of the genre\".\nPassage 9:\nSecrets of Life\nSecrets of Life is a 1956 American documentary film written and directed by James Algar. The documentary follows the changing world of nature, the sky, the sun, the sea, planets, insects and volcanic action. The documentary was released on November 6, 1956, by Buena Vista Distribution.\n\nSynopsis\nThe fourth in Walt Disney's True-Life Adventures series, the 1956 film Secrets of Life features previously rarely-seen film footage of nature's \"behind-the-scenes\" goings-on that play a huge role in making the planet what it is. From bees to ants and the flora and fauna surrounding us, Secrets of Life reveal a sometimes startling glimpse into nature's wonders that we often take for granted. Accompanied by musical selections, the metamorphosis of air-borne seeds into glorious plants and flowers is shown with the help of time-lapse photography.\nBees are seen as they go about the non-stop business of pollination, giving adage to the saying \"busy as a bee\". Ants are shown in their various classifications, from workers to warriors to the regal \"queen\". Countless protozoa are viewed in a single drop of water as the voice-over describes their role in the \"big picture\" of unseen nature.\nThe close-ups provide an intimacy which gives these oft-neglected organisms a \"face\".\n\nAwards\n1957 Berlin Film Festival: Golden Bear (Best Documentary)\nPassage 10:\nToys in the Attic (2009 film)\nToys in the Attic (Czech: Na půdě aneb Kdo má dneska narozeniny?; festival title: In the Attic or Who Has a Birthday Today?) is a 2009 internationally co-produced stop-motion animated fantasy film directed by Jiří Barta and written by Edgar Dutka and Barta which depicts a community of toys and other objects in an attic who come to life when no human is around. It is an international co-production between the Czech Republic, France, Japan and Slovakia. The film was released first in the Czech Republic on 5 March 2009 and has been shown subtitled at film festivals internationally. An American English dub – adapted, produced and directed by Vivian Schilling and performed by actors including Forest Whitaker, Joan Cusack, Cary Elwes  and Schilling herself – has been recorded, which the film was first shown with on 3 March 2012 at the New York International Children's Film Festival and was released nationally on 24 August 2012 by Hannover House.\n\nPlot\nIn an attic full of discarded junk, a pretty doll called Buttercup lives in an old trunk together with her friends, the marionette Sir Handsome, the lovable Teddy Bear, a Mechanical Mouse and the plasticine creature, Laurent. When Buttercup is snatched and taken off to the Land of Evil, her pals set out on a wondrous and daring adventure to rescue her from the all-powerful Head of State. Originally produced in Czech, the meticulously crafted animated feature is set in a magical world of toys and knick-knacks stored in the attic of a home in Prague. Following the symbolism of the Cold War era that impacted director Barta and the Czech Republic, the world of the attic is divided into the land of happy toys in the west and the land of evil in the east. The despotic Head of State rules over the evil empire of the east with a band of sinister minions, insects and rotted vegetables.\n\nCzech Cast\nBára Dlouhá as Paní Na Ulici\nBarbora Hrzánová as Myška Sklodowská\nBoris Hybner as Mucha\nVladimír Javorský as Rytíř Krasoň\nNada Konvalinková as Služebná Růženka\nJohana Krticková as Holčička - Hlas\nVěra Kubánková as Babička - Hlas\nJirí Lábus as Hlava / Vládce Říše Zla\nPetr Nározný as Kocour Baron\nLucie Pernetová as Panenka Pomněnka\nIvan Trojan as Skřítek Šubrt\nMiroslav Táborský as Doktor Skarab\nLudmila Ungrichtová as Babička\nAndrea Zádníková as Holčička\n\nEnglish Dub Cast\nForest Whitaker as Teddy\nJoan Cusack as Madam Curie\nVivian Schilling as Buttercup\nCary Elwes as Sir Handsome\nMarcelo Tubert as Laurent\nDouglas Urbanski as Head\nRico Simonini as Tomcat\nJo Ellison as Rosie\n\nProduction\nJiří Barta and Edgar Dutka wrote the script, originally titled Whose Birthday is it Today before it was renamed Toys in the Attic, from 1998 to 2000 with the intention of creating a story that was family-orientated, sellable to producers, and having elements of a child's imagination: \"When I found an old exercise book with my drawing of a train made from old train tickets with a piece of cigarette for the smokestack, the kid in my imagination reappeared.  Edgar and I remembered the games we used to play in strange forbidden places we found in our attics.\"Due to very short deadlines set by the producer, multiple stages of making Toys in the Attic, including pre-production, production, and post-production, happened at the same time. The film was made by a total of ten to fifteen of Prague art school graduates and Barta's colleagues and friends. Pre-production began in January 2007; it involved not only storyboarding but also creating the puppets and sets from a \"huge amount of junk and antique stuff.\" The filming and animation took place from June 2007 to September 2008, which the final product contains 1,200 stills; and post-production was finished by early 2009.The main part of the film's animation is that of puppets animated by stop motion but there are also examples of clay animation in the character Šubrt and the objects of his room, special effects such as steam in traditional animation and the face of the plaster bust Hlava (\"Head\") was performed in pixilation and voiced in the original Czech audio by actor Jiří Lábus.\n\nRelease\nThe film was theatrically released on 5 March 2009 by CinemArt and was premiered at the New York International Children's Film Festival. It was also released on DVD, VOD and Blu-ray on November 23, 2009 by Magic Box.\n\nReception\nCinemaArt released the film in the Czech Republic on 6 March 2009. Peter Debruge compared the film to Toy Story in a reviews for Variety, and complimented the animation: \"despite their inflexible faces, Barta conceives all sorts of inventive ways to bring these inanimate objects to life. […] Should a given shot prove too tricky to accomplish practically, Barta has no qualms about using digital compositing to blend multiple stop-motion plates. Though rudimentary, fire and water effects are especially effective.\" About the film's commercial prospects, Debruge wrote: \"For all its charms, In the Attic feels vaguely sinister and may prove too intense for younger kids – a testament to the film's pacing and score, as well as how deeply auds emotionally connect with these occasionally macabre toy characters.\" The film has been honored with awards including an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival, those for best feature at the 2010 New York International Children's Film Festival and the 2011 Tehran International Animation Festival, in both winning over The Secret of Kells, and the Kecskemét City Award at the 7th Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials in 2011. The film has a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAwards", "answers": ["Volcanic Sprint"], "length": 7247, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fe60adfdc85ed9f3f7bfa2bbeea5fcd1e6f4383b94f3818f"}
{"input": "Which band was formed first, Wire or Young the Giant?", "context": "Passage 1:\nPrimary rock\nPrimary rock is an early term in geology that refers to crystalline rock formed first in geologic time, containing no organic remains, such as granite, gneiss and schist as well as igneous and magmatic formations from all ages. Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary published in 1913 provides the following term as used in geology:\n\nPrimary rocks\n(geol.) a term early used for rocks supposed to have been first formed, being crystalline and containing no organic remains, as granite, gneiss, etc.; – called also primitive rocks. The terms Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary rocks have also been used in like manner, but of these the last two only are now in use.\nNinety years later the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific & Technical Terms published in 2003 places the term in the geologic field of petrology:\n\nPrimary rocks [′prī‚mer·ē ′räks]\n(petrology) Rocks whose constituents are newly formed particles that have never been constituents of previously formed rocks and that are not the products of alteration or replacement, such as limestones formed by precipitation from solution.\nThe term dates from the late 18th century (see Giovanni Arduino and Abraham Gottlob Werner) when the first attempts to formulate a geologic time scale divided crustal rocks into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Darwin used the phrase \"primary rocks\" in 1838 in the Geological Introduction to Zoology of The Voyage of HMS Beagle Fossil Mammalia Described by Richard Owen The last two terms have survived on most geological time scales used in the 20th and 21st centuries. For an example of the extensive use and explication of this term as debated in the mid-18th century, see \"On the Origin of Eruptive and Primary Rocks\" by Thomas Macfarlane and published in three parts in The Canadian Naturalist and Geologist Journal of 1863. And for an example in Australian geology literature, where it is capitalized to stress the unique use of the word, see \"Report on Country in the Neighborhood of Lake Eyre\" by H.Y.L. Brown, Government Geologist, published in 1892.\nPrimary rock is also referred to as primitive rock, plutonic rock, and the crystalline basement rock of the Earth's continental cratons.  It is also loosely, and less precisely, referred to as bedrock, especially in civil engineering, geophysical surveys and drilling science.\nThe Austrian-American astrophysicist Thomas Gold utilized this term in his book \"The Deep Hot Biosphere\" in the chapter titled \"The Siljan Experiment\" regarding the deep drilling project in Sweden to prove the theory of abiotic/abiogenic oil and gas: \"...the ground of Sweden, composed almost entirely of primary rock and not of sediments....\"\nPassage 2:\nKonstantin Vakulovsky\nCaptain Konstantin Konstantinovich Vakulovsky (born 28 October 1894, died Summer 1918) was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories. A major general's son, he volunteered for aviation duty on 8 August 1914, six days after graduating from university. He taught himself to fly, and became one of Russia's first military pilots on 13 June 1915. After escaping the fall of the Novogeorgievsk Fortress in a hazardous flight, Vakylovsky flew reconnaissance missions, some through heavy ground fire. Given command of the newly formed First Fighter Detachment, he became a flying ace credited with six aerial victories. He died in a flying accident during Summer 1918.\n\nBiography\nKonstantin Konstantinovich Vakulovsky was a major general's son, born on 28 October 1894 in Dagestan. When young, he served in the Vladikavkaz Cadet Corps. However, he was schooled in Saint Petersburg at the Military Engineering-Technical University, graduating on 2 August 1914. Beginning 8 August 1914, he served as an aerial observer with the air detachment at the Novogeorgievsk Fortress. While doing so, he enrolled in basic aviation courses and taught himself to fly. After flying 50 training flights without an instructor, he passed his graduation flight with distinction. On 13 June 1915, he was appointed a military pilot by the Supreme Commander in Chief of the Imperial Russian Army.On 20 August 1915, the Novogeorgievsk Fortress fell to the invading Germans. Vakulovsky departed the siege in a hazardous low level flight through ground fire and foul foggy weather. After five hours flying, he reached friendly forces with news of the fortress' fall, and with the battle standards of the fort. The feat earned the gallant pilot the Order of Saint George Fourth Class.Vakulovsky and the other surviving pilots from the fallen fort were formed into the 33rd Corps Detachment of the Imperial Russian Air Service on 29 October 1915. They flew reconnaissance missions throughout the winter of 1915/1916. On 18 February 1916, Vakulovsky flew an aerial photography mission over Bushof through heavy anti-aircraft fire. On 10 April 1916, by order of the czar, he was granted the Gold Sword for Bravery; the citation took special notice of the Bushof sortie.On 16 July 1916, Vakulovsky was promoted to Poruchik. Within the week, he was given command of the nascent First Fighter Detachment, on the recommendation of Grand Duke Alexander.Vakulovsky scored his first aerial victory on 7 September 1916. On the 19th, he was so severely stunned by the blast of an antiaircraft shell over Postav that he was sidelined for some weeks. He returned to duty 25 October 1916, and scored his second victory three days afterward. He came under fire immediately after that, his craft suffering a shattered propeller and splintered frame. On 28 October, he flew four sorties; on the last one, he scored a victory, but crashlanded afterwards at his own airfield.Vakulovsky recorded no more victories for some months, but continued to fly combat. He was promoted to Stabskapitän on 12 April 1917; two days later, he scored his third victory. On 12 May 1917, he participated on a raid on an enemy aerodrome at Kabilnichachby and claimed a victory that went unconfirmed. His reconnaissance patrols also had its hazards; on 13 June 1917, for instance, he flew an aerial photography mission over the enemy's third line trenches over Baldohn at 500 meters. Antiaircraft fire set his plane afire, and he glided to a flaming landing on Dalen Island under artillery fire. Although scorched, wounded, and shocked, he escaped the wreckage.Vakulovsky scored his next victory on 21 August 1917. He would have another pair of victories accredited to him on 1 September 1917. On that day, he fought on 16 separate occasions. The following month, a few Sopwith Triplanes were delivered to the First Air Division, and he requested one of them for his personal craft.Konstantin Konstantinovich Vakulovsky died in a flying accident in the Summer of 1918.\n\nList of aerial victories\nSee also Aerial victory standards of World War I, List of World War I flying aces from the Russian Empire\nConfirmed victories are numbered and listed chronologically.\n\nHonors and awards\nOrder of Saint Stanilas Fourth Class with Crossed Swords and Bow\nOrder of Saint Anna Fourth Class for Bravery\nOrder of Saint Anna Third Class with Crossed Swords and Bow\nOrder of Saint Anna Second Class with Crossed Swords\nOrder of Saint Stanilas Third Class with Crossed Swords and Bow\nOrder of Saint Stanilas Second Class with Crossed Swords and Bow\nOrder of Saint Vladimir Fourth Class with Crossed Swords and Bow\nOrder of Saint George Fourth Class\nGold Sword for Bravery\n\nSources of information\nPassage 3:\nLiberty Baptist Church (Grooverville, Georgia)\nLiberty Baptist Church is a historic church built about 1858 in Grooverville, Georgia. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 2013. It is located on Liberty Church Road. There is a Georgia Historical Commission historical marker at the site. According to the marker: \"In 1841 the Ocklochnee anti-Missionary Baptist Association passed a ruling to dismiss members believing in the 'new fangled institutions of the day.'\" One of the excommunicated sisters joined with others in forming the Liberty Baptist Church. The church includes a slave gallery. Freed slaves from the area formed First Elizabeth Church in Grooverville.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Brooks County, Georgia\nGrooverville Methodist Church\n[1]\nPassage 4:\nJapp–Maitland condensation\nThe Japp–Maitland condensation is an organic reaction and a type of Aldol reaction and a tandem reaction. In a reaction between the ketone 2-pentanone and the aldehyde benzaldehyde catalyzed by base the bis Aldol adduct is formed first. The second step is a ring-closing reaction when one hydroxyl group displaces the other in a nucleophilic substitution forming an oxo-tetrahydropyran.  \n\nThe reaction was first described by Francis Robert Japp and William Maitland in 1904.The Japp–Maitland reaction is of some importance to synthetic organic chemistry for example as part of the synthesis of biomolecule centrolobine:\nPassage 5:\nWest Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 1967\nThe West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 1967 was held in Indian state of West Bengal in 1967 to elect 280 members to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. United Front led by Ajoy Mukherjee won majority of seats in the election, and formed first non-Congress government of the state.\n\nResults\nElected members\nPost-Poll Alliance\nUnited Front led by Ajoy Mukherjee formed the Government. United Front was combination of People's United Left Front, an electoral combination of Communist Party of India, the Bangla Congress, the All India Forward Bloc and the Bolshevik Party of India with United Left Front (1967),  electoral alliance of The front comprised the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Samyukta Socialist Party, the Socialist Unity Centre of India, the Marxist Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Communist Party of India, the Workers Party of India and the Revolutionary Socialist Party.\nPassage 6:\nDocument and Eyewitness\nDocument and Eyewitness is the first live album by the post-punk band Wire, released in July 1981 by Rough Trade Records. It marked the end of the first period of Wire's activity (1977–1980) and the end of their association with EMI. Recorded in February 1980 at the Electric Ballroom in London – at the final gig of Wire's first period – the original release came with a 45 rpm 12\" EP that featured recordings from a July 1979 show at the Notre Dame Hall in London, along with one track from a March 1979 gig at Le Pavillon in Montreux, Switzerland.The Electric Ballroom show records Wire after the release of 1979's 154 album, tired of playing the same old songs and continually moving forward. Of the seven songs from the Notre Dame Hall show, three were never recorded in-studio by Wire and the rest were captured as B-sides and other ephemeral recordings. Nine of the songs recorded live for the album were reworked and recorded for the band's 2013 album Change Becomes Us. Three songs would also surface on Colin Newman's solo album's, and one would be recorded by Graham Lewis and Bruce Gilbert for their Dome project.\n\nBackground\nThe Electric Ballroom show documents a band revelling in their (artistic) freedom, creating a surreal and challenging show that not only included almost all new material, but also a Dadaist cabaret including a moving 6'x12' sheet behind which the band performed, assorted headdresses and props, and an MC, Wire's manager Mick Collins, who tried to keep control of proceedings. The show was performed before a restive punk crowd who were little appeased by a version of \"12XU\" (edited down to a 15-second fragment for this release) and reacted with a thrown bottle during the unnamed instrumental.\nThe Electric Ballroom recording was made on an eight-track tape recorder that was set up incorrectly, resulting in a distorted two-track mix. The live version of \"Heartbeat\" was recorded in Montreux, when Wire supported Roxy Music on the continental leg of their Manifesto Tour.Colin Newman has stated that the idea of Document and Eyewitness \"was to make it an art statement, as opposed to just releasing a rubbishly recorded gig.\" In his book Read and Burn: A Book About Wire, Wilson Neate wrote that the album was consequently not presented as a standard live album, that the band was \"undercutting the illusion of the live moment with after-the-fact commentary and observations on the night's occurrences.\" The spoken commentary between selected tracks by two Wire fans, Adrian Garston and Russell Mills, constitutes the \"eyewitness\" in the album title.\n\nAlbum cover\nThe album's sleeve art, created by Graham Lewis, is a cut-up version of a poster made by Bruce Gilbert for two shows that Wire played at Notre Dame Hall on 19 and 20 July 1979. Recordings from the first of these two shows make up most of sides three and four of Document and Eyewitness.\n\nReleases\nThe original vinyl release by Rough Trade was a double with the Electric Ballroom tracks on sides one and two, and the Notre Dame Hall and Montreux tracks on sides three and four. The 1991 compact disc reissue by Mute Records switched the running order, beginning with Notre Dame and Montreux and following with the Electric Ballroom tracks. \"Our Swimmer\" and \"Midnight Bahnhof Cafe\" were originally released on Rough Trade as a 7\" single (RT79) in 1981 and are bonus tracks on Mute's CD reissue. In 2014, the band's label Pinkflag released a new version of the album, which revises the original track list of the album and also includes a bonus disc, this disc also including the original CD bonus tracks. The release was remastered from the original tapes.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a 1982 review for Trouser Press, Alec Ross said, \"there are high spots,\" but \"[t]his live stuff...is just boring–a meandering parody of what made Wire intriguing.\" Robert Christgau, in his \"Consumer Guide\" column, wrote, \"At first I diagnosed the grungy sound and semipro execution of this live LP-plus-EP as the band's worst case of arty-farty yet. But for all the chatter and false starts and extended instrumental nothings, it packs real momentum–you could even say it gets wild.\"The album is included in The Quietus' 2013 list of its writers' \"40 Favourite Live Albums\".\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Bruce Gilbert, Robert Gotobed, Graham Lewis and Colin Newman, except where noted.\n\nOriginal vinyl release\nSide one\n\n\"5/10\" M.C.'s request spot – 5:30\n\"12XU (Fragment)\" – 2:16\n\"Underwater Experiences\" – 2:39\n\"Everythings Going to Be Nice\" (Lewis) Woman enters pulling 2 tethered men and an inflatable jet – 1:05\n\"Piano Tuner (Keep Strumming Those Guitars)\" Vocalist attacks gas stove – 5:19\n\"We Meet Under Tables\" (Newman) Vocalist wears black knee length veil – 3:30Side two\n\n\"Zegk Hoqp\" 12 percussionists with newspaper head dresses – 5:00\n\"Eastern Standard\" M.C. attempts geographical explanation' – 3:03\n\"Instrumental (Thrown Bottle)\" – 2:11\n\"Eels Sang Lino\" Vocalist accompanied and lit by illuminated goose – 3:05\n\"Revealing Trade Secrets\" – 2:34\n\"And Then...\" (Gilbert, Lewis) Vocalist eats 2 loaves and then blank scrolls are unrolled – 4:50\n\"Coda\" – 4:09\n\n45 rpm 12\"\nSide three\n\n\"Go Ahead\" – 4:00\n\"Ally in Exile\" – 4:19\n\"Relationship\" – 1:20\n\"Underwater Experiences\" – 2:41Side four\n\n\"Witness to the Fact\" – 2:50\n\"2 People in a Room\" (Gilbert, Newman) – 1:52\n\"Our Swimmer\" – 3:00\n\"Heartbeat\" (Newman) – 3:08Sides one and two recorded 29 February 1980 at Electric Ballroom, London.

The band's line-up consists of Sameer Gadhia (lead vocals), Jacob Tilley (guitar), Eric Cannata (guitar), Payam Doostzadeh (bass guitar), and Francois Comtois (drums). Formerly known as The Jakes, Young the Giant was signed by Roadrunner Records in 2009, and they released their eponymous debut album in 2010. The band's first three singles, \"My Body\", \"Cough Syrup\", and \"Apartment\", all charted on the US Alternative Songs chart.\n\nHistory\nFormation (2004–2009)\nThe Jakes formed in 2004 in Irvine, California. Consisting of Jacob Tilley, Addam Farmer, Kevin Massoudi, Ehson Hashemian, and Sameer Gadhia, the band's name was an acronym of the members' first names. After several personnel changes, the group's lineup by 2008 included Gadhia, Tilley, Hashemian, Eric Cannata, Francois Comtois, and Jason Burger. Initial coordination of musical contributions was difficult because the members all attended different schools. With two members still in high school and the others each attending different colleges, the Jakes recorded an EP, Shake My Hand, with producer Ian Kirkpatrick. Band members then individually decided whether or not to put their schooling on hold to focus on music. Burger left the band to pursue an education at Manhattan School of Music in New York City, and Comtois took over as the drummer. Shortly thereafter, longtime friend and collaborator Payam Doostzadeh (Persian: پیام دوستزده) joined as bassist. In 2009, the band played four shows at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. The band's song \"Garands At Normandie\" was played during an episode of MTV's The Real World: Brooklyn, and \"Paid the Piper\" was featured on A&E's The Beast. Another song, \"Cough Syrup\", received airplay on the Los Angeles radio station KROQ. Shortly before signing to Roadrunner Records in August, keyboardist Ehson Hashemian left the band. In December 2009, the band announced they had changed their name to Young the Giant.\n\nYoung the Giant (2010–2013)\nThe Jakes officially changed their name to Young the Giant in January 2010 during the production of their eponymous album. Young the Giant spent 2010 opening for Minus the Bear and Steel Train while working on their debut album with Joe Chiccarelli at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles. They took an old-school approach to recording the album. All the tracks were performed live which resulted in a lot of “chopping” during production.
